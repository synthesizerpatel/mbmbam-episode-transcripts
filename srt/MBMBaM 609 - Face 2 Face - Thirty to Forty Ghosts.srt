1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
The McElroy brothers are not experts.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,560
It's been a while, right?

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,680
I don't memorize this shit.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,800
And their advice should never be followed.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,680
Oh, Travis claims he's a sexpert.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,800
But if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,600
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,280
will know how cool they are for listening.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,800
What's up, you cool baby?

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Because my life, it's better, it's better with you.

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:12,280
My life, it's better with you.

12
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,680
Hi, everyone.

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,400
Welcome to my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin Ignatius McElroy.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,720
I'm your middle brother, Travis Jedediah McElroy.

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,720
No jokes this time, guys.

17
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,600
It's just me, Griffin.

18
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,760
Yeah, I'm so yeah.

19
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,480
Griffin's lackadaisical approach to his introduction mirrors, I would say, his lackadaisical approach

20
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
to his garments.

21
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
Yeah.

22
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,880
We did talk about it like before, before anybody packed or anything.

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
Yeah.

24
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,360
I went to Skeffington's.

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,920
Yeah, Justin got himself a tuxedo.

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,560
I rented a tuxedo.

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,280
I packed three different jacket, tie, and shirt combinations.

28
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,120
That must be fun to travel with.

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,920
No, but they're worth it, Griffin.

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
They're worth it.

31
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
You're worth it.

32
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
You back there.

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Hey.

34
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,640
Yeah, my suitcase weighs 55 pounds, no lie.

35
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,000
Matt, poor Matt, had a flat tire on the interstate.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,320
You owe it to Matt to dress up.

37
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,000
I mean, I bought this special shirt.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You didn't rent it.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But this is you guys.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,760
I can't move my body to the- Yeah, that is true.

41
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,080
I can't give a sudden hug.

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,480
Okay, let's get started.

43
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,560
This is an advice show.

44
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,120
We take your questions and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom after two years of hiatus.

45
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,040
We have emerged like the Chilean miners back from underneath the ground to you.

46
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,240
And I don't want you to waste any more time in answering these questions.

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
So here we go.

48
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Now wait before we start.

49
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
Okay.

50
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,720
In the spirit of Fancy Takes Flight, I thought that maybe we could elevate the show a little

51
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,040
bit because it's been a little bit puerile lately, a little bit juvenile.

52
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,360
So I thought it would be nice if we maybe elevated things with a little work of fort.

53
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Yeah.

54
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:24,840
I hope you like bits.

55
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,400
This one is all film related, classic films.

56
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Okay.

57
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,840
A group of teens- God, I wish I didn't get so competitive about

58
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
this.

59
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,000
But just- Hey, don't shout it out because you will probably-

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, don't shout it out.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Law of large numbers.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You'll probably get it before us.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't shout it out.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Also, they're not that clever.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So many of you will get it.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hey.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I've been working on these for three days.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,440
A group of teens spends the day in detention.

73
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,680
Each of them comes from a different social group, but they end up bonding over the fact

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,680
that they all have boners.

75
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,680
The Breakfast Chub.

76
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
You didn't ding, ding, ding.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,960
Ding, ding, ding.

78
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,760
It was clearly The Breakfast Chub.

79
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
Okay.

80
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
That's a tie.

81
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,900
No, I'm sorry, Justin.

82
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,900
You did not ring in.

83
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,900
Okay.

84
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,900
You're right.

85
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,900
No, you're right.

86
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,900
It's fine.

87
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,900
It's fine.

88
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,900
It's fine.

89
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,900
It's fine.

90
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,900
It's the Breakfast Chub.

91
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,900
It doesn't.

92
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,900
It doesn't.

93
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,900
Couldn't matter less.

94
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,480
A rebellious patient at a mental institution stands up to tight-fisted nerds, Ratched,

95
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,720
when she tries to stop them from taking dumps.

96
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,220
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

97
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,600
One flew over the doo-doo's nest?

98
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
I'll accept it.

99
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Yes.

100
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,920
Well, we also would have accepted one flew over the poo-poo's nest.

101
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,600
Either way works, I guess, or doesn't work.

102
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,240
One more.

103
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
One more?

104
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
One more.

105
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
One more.

106
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,600
In this classic black and white film, a reporter tries to understand a rich and powerful man's

107
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,760
mysterious last words, I need to take a crap.

108
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,840
Turns out it was the name of his sled.

109
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,040
I mean- I mean, I know that- I know the film you're referencing, but there's nothing-

110
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
I can't imagine.

111
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
I mean, okay.

112
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Ding, ding, ding.

113
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Yeah.

114
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,280
It's Citizen Kane, but the sled was called Rosebutt?

115
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,280
No.

116
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,280
Justin?

117
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
Sit, sit, sit.

118
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
I got nothing.

119
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,280
The answer we were looking for was Shitizen Kane.

120
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,520
Damn it!

121
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,320
Motherfucker!

122
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,320
That one- that sucks for me and you.

123
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Yeah.

124
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Yeah.

125
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
I can't believe you didn't get it.

126
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
That was right there.

127
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Did you all know?

128
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,320
Shitizen.

129
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
Yeah, they- of course they knew.

130
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
There's a billion of them.

131
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,320
Yeah.

132
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,320
Now, that wasn't everybody, though.

133
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,720
I would say that was only about 10% of the audience, and you're all terrible, too.

134
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,200
Okay, now we're going to help people.

135
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,160
I recently got my first job.

136
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,000
These are all from your region, by the way, so blame yourselves.

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,320
Take a look in the mirror.

138
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,360
This is what you are.

139
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,440
I recently got my first job since the beginning of the pandemic.

140
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,440
It's wonderful, but I've come across a lunchtime predicament.

141
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,840
I'm a messy eater, and I always stain my shirts.

142
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,320
When I was quarantining, I would simply remove my shirt for meals.

143
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,160
This worked well then, but obviously I can't-

144
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,200
Except for the tummy stains.

145
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Yeah.

146
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,440
Obviously, I can't continue this.

147
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
What should I do?

148
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,580
That's from running out of clean shirts.

149
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,580
Are you here?

150
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,580
Oh, why?

151
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,400
Yeah, I wouldn't fess up to that either.

152
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,960
I did think about this when we got that one in.

153
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,680
You want us to say this in front of people?

154
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,080
You want us to read this one, huh?

155
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Okay.

156
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,720
Yeah, because my gut tells me, eat better.

157
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Just eat differently.

158
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,480
Do a better job.

159
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,200
That's clearly not on the table.

160
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,160
Slower, perhaps?

161
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,680
Or at least drier food.

162
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,640
Eat dry food that won't stain.

163
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,460
You don't deserve wet food.

164
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,720
Wet food is for careful boys.

165
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,880
Meal choice is huge.

166
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,660
If you don't want to improve your technique, which who has the time?

167
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,660
Meal choice is huge.

168
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,920
Do you open up your cupboard and there's just a wall of SpaghettiOs?

169
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,080
You today, I believe.

170
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,800
Oh no, it's Wednesday, rib day.

171
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Rib day.

172
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,920
Today I'm having red wine rib gravy, delicious.

173
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,880
And of course, soup with no spoon.

174
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:12,080
Do you know that it's, you did have the pandemic times and you could have worked, you know,

175
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,200
they say if you come out of this pandemic and you haven't learned to stop eating without

176
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,720
spilling all over yourself, what have you done?

177
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,600
This is your opportunity to learn to work and eat better and I think that the window

178
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
has closed.

179
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,600
I mean, there's also lunch smock right there, lunch raincoat.

180
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,280
Get a branded lunch smock available at macroemerch.com.

181
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,240
It says, I'm a fucking mess on it.

182
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
I'm a wreck.

183
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
I'm a disaster.

184
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,840
I don't know how to eat food good.

185
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,480
That's two hard words to say right back to food good.

186
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,360
I can do it very easily now, of course.

187
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
Yeah.

188
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Cause you're focused.

189
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
You're dialed in.

190
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
With a run up to it.

191
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Yeah.

192
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
With a little bit of practice.

193
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
Sure.

194
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,440
Can you have two, can you just wear two of the same shirt to work?

195
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,800
Post lunch, whip it off.

196
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,600
You got a clean one right underneath.

197
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,960
Oh, but you could, then you could keep the nasty shirt at your desk.

198
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
This is my lunch shirt.

199
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
Do not smell.

200
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Oh, there you go.

201
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Do not smell the lunch shirt.

202
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
Do not smell.

203
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,080
Do not smell this shirt.

204
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,640
Do not open the baggie with shirt in it.

205
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,480
You could also, if you have your own office, you could lock the door and take your shirt

206
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
off to eat.

207
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,120
But oh God, you gotta check that the door is locked.

208
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,520
It's a great conversation starter.

209
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,080
But then you get, here's, here's my problem with shirtless eating.

210
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,700
Well, hold on, sorry.

211
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:29,640
My first of 312 problems with shirtless eating is that you eat the spaghetti-o's.

212
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,200
You do get the wet red stuff on your tummy and then you put the shirt back on, it's still

213
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,920
going to get the wet red stuff on the shirt.

214
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:42,120
I've seen you have a towel, you have a lunch towel, a classic office lunch towel.

215
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,720
It's weird how if you, as an adult, and I've done this a few times, if you, if you take

216
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,160
the napkin and you stuff it into your shirt, people make fun of you.

217
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,880
And it's like, I'm trying to be elegant.

218
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,140
This is for you.

219
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,140
This is for you.

220
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,680
I want you to enjoy a clean shirt.

221
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,240
I don't have to see my dirty shirt.

222
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
You do.

223
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
Oh, what about this?

224
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,160
Stained cape, right, and then at lunch, flipped that bad boy around and now it's on the front.

225
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
Oh.

226
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
Yeah.

227
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,160
That's good.

228
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,240
And then, after lunch, stained cape.

229
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Can you just, wait, can you just, save a step, turn your shirt backwards?

230
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
There you go.

231
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,440
After you stained the front of it.

232
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,920
And then when someone's like, you have a stain on the back of your shirt, I'm like, someone

233
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
must have been eating messy behind me.

234
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Oh no.

235
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Oh man.

236
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,320
Why do I sit in front of messy people all the time?

237
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,920
Oh, I bet it was Doug.

238
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,280
I would never stain my shirt, but Doug, the person who's in the job above me would.

239
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Yeah.

240
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,320
Dougie Meatballs, who works in the upper cubicle.

241
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,960
I recently turned 21 and I am learning that every time I consume an alcoholic beverage

242
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,240
or engage in the devil's lettuce, I am overcome with-

243
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Iceberg.

244
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,920
And I am profound and insatiable vegetable lust.

245
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,160
I'm talking, I take three sips of a gin and tonic and I am on the floor of my kitchen

246
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,400
eating whole carrots from the bag.

247
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Okay.

248
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,640
No timeout real quick, for future reference question asker, vegetable lust might be confused

249
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
for something else.

250
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,760
Not how I would have froze it.

251
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
Yeah.

252
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,160
No tomato, leafy, green, or tasty plant of any kind is safe from my monstrous desire.

253
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,840
Why the fuck does this happen?

254
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
What do I do?

255
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,240
How do I mitigate this hog wild behavior with the fact that I drink with friends who are

256
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,440
not immediately overcome with my same veggie related needs?

257
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,160
That's from the veggie vagabond.

258
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
Are you here?

259
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Hey.

260
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
You're very close.

261
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
Okay.

262
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
Hello.

263
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,440
You're not normally this close when we do these, but we're going to roll with it.

264
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,720
Are you asking us how to stop eating vegetables?

265
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,240
Because you've come to the right place.

266
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Yeah.

267
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Yeah.

268
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,000
And just to sum up, your problem is whenever I get drunk or high, I make healthy choices.

269
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,320
You're not.

270
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,200
What do I do to stop this?

271
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,280
You have, you have a superpower.

272
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,200
You don't have anything that needs fixed.

273
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,340
Like do you know, do you know that when you get high, you can eat loose pepperonis out

274
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,340
of a bag.

275
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:13,040
Have you been eating your child's leftover Halloween candy in April?

276
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,640
Have you heard of a Cadbury mini eggs in the freezer?

277
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,080
Like that's what they're there for.

278
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:24,800
You could hear your wife say, this box of Girl Scout cookies was full yesterday.

279
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,240
And you go, oh, Lily, the dog.

280
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,000
There's not a three.

281
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,520
You don't have a problem.

282
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,800
This is a great habit unless, unless your like vegetable budget is through the roof.

283
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,960
That's the only thing.

284
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
That's true.

285
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,440
You know, in this country, we don't subsidize produce as much as we should, and we don't

286
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,520
have the sort of fresh local, because they're not shelf stable.

287
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
We got it.

288
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,880
There's food deserts.

289
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
It's a whole thing.

290
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,000
You thought they'd keep clapping when you said food deserts, huh?

291
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Seaspiracy.

292
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Look it up.

293
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No.

294
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Read a book.

295
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Read a book.

296
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,120
It would irritate me if I ate all my good roasting broccoli.

297
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,520
And then the next, the next day I wanted to eat some roasted broccoli and I didn't have

298
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
it.

299
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
I'm like, ah, hi Justin.

300
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
You got me again.

301
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,680
I said, hi, hi Justin ain't going to roast that broccoli.

302
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,040
Hi Justin is eating it right off the stock.

303
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,240
And now sober Justin has to order crinkle fries from Arby's because I don't have another

304
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,140
side dish.

305
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,840
This is a gift that keeps on giving.

306
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,960
There's no bad part of it.

307
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
I'm trying.

308
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,080
It's a weird twist on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

309
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,080
If Dr. Jekyll is like, I got to get rid of Mr. Hyde.

310
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,440
He paid my taxes on time and called my mom on her birthday.

311
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,080
Ah, curse you Hyde.

312
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,320
Is there such a thing as too much fiber?

313
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Oh yeah.

314
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Oh yeah.

315
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Oh yeah.

316
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,840
I think it probably gives away the fact that I'm not getting enough fiber that I have to

317
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
ask that.

318
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,400
I've never even come close to that threshold.

319
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,760
What if you, what if, okay.

320
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,440
What if they just really don't like vegetables?

321
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,720
Now think on it.

322
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,320
You get a craving, but you don't like them, but your body wants them.

323
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Do you like vegetables?

324
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Sorry, hold on.

325
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
This is ridiculous.

326
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Do you like vegetables?

327
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Yeah.

328
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Yeah.

329
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Okay.

330
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
They do like vegetables.

331
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,960
I mean, one time when I was on shrooms, I ate a whole pizza, uh, but that was because

332
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,160
it made my mouth taste like a party.

333
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,840
Sure, sure.

334
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,160
That's because it was a time pizza and it was starting to slip through the cracks of

335
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
the universe.

336
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
You get it.

337
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
You get it.

338
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
You get it.

339
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Every pepperoni had Don Knot's face on it.

340
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
You understand.

341
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,600
That's all of it.

342
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,640
And the pizza was taunting me.

343
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
Okay.

344
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,420
Well, have you bragged enough?

345
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,420
May we move on?

346
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,260
No, I, well, here's what I can picture, right?

347
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,360
You're getting drunk and high with friends and you're like, oh, you know what I could

348
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
really go for?

349
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
And they're like, oh, a hamburger.

350
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,880
And you're like, some broccoli rabe and they're like, get the fuck out.

351
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:06,160
I can see where that might be socially uncomfortable, but like, bring it with you, bring it with

352
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,720
you, have it in your pocket.

353
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,520
Just have loose carrots in your pocket.

354
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,800
I cannot think of a worse thing to do to a high friend.

355
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,040
Then you're sitting there and you're talking to them and you just slowly sneak a little

356
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
baby carrot.

357
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
Oh yeah.

358
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Crunch, crunch, crunch.

359
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
Yeah.

360
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
What?

361
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
And also.

362
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Are those Cheetos?

363
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,780
Well, their nature is Cheetos.

364
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:32,760
And the disappointment they'll feel when they cash the bong and they're like, anybody else

365
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,520
holding any good green stuff?

366
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,160
And you're like, oh yeah.

367
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,220
Brutabaga.

368
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,220
What color is rutabaga?

369
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,220
I genuinely.

370
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,220
It's kale.

371
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,220
Rutabaga's gotta be red, right?

372
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,220
You know what's weird?

373
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,600
I now have a real serious craving for vegetables.

374
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Yeah?

375
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
Yeah.

376
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
I'd love to eat.

377
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
No, not, no.

378
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
No.

379
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
No.

380
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
You got me good.

381
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
I can't get that drunk during a show.

382
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Come on.

383
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,040
My girlfriend and I have been living in our apartment for about two years now.

384
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,280
And our upstairs neighbor is quite obviously a gamer.

385
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
Hashtag.

386
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,600
He has, you say, I think you have to say it before.

387
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
No, gamer hashtag.

388
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Okay.

389
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,080
He's a very nice guy.

390
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,960
Welcomed us when we moved in and everything, but he has always been very loud when he plays

391
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,640
games with his friends, stomping on the ground, shouting, et cetera.

392
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,640
Standard gamer.

393
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,640
However.

394
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,640
Just regular old gamer stuff.

395
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,640
Classic gamer stuff.

396
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,640
However.

397
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
Textbook.

398
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
That's not the issue.

399
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,800
A month or two ago, we noticed he hasn't been loudly gaming anymore.

400
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
That's right.

401
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
You guessed it.

402
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,080
He died controller in hand, just like he always dreams.

403
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,240
How he would have wanted to go.

404
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,040
Him and Master Chief, Thelma and Louise.

405
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,640
The loving embrace of Fortnite.

406
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:53,460
We actually got kind of used to his noise.

407
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,020
It was just sort of comforting and funny to hear someone else around.

408
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,560
And now it just feels too quiet.

409
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:05,000
My question is, how do I approach my neighbor and ask him to go back to his noisy gaming

410
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,360
for our normalcy without sounding like a freak?

411
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,480
Just from a little too quiet, are you here?

412
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,480
What?

413
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,120
How did that happen?

414
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,840
You're right behind the other person that was here too.

415
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
Hello.

416
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
Okay.

417
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,200
Do we have some sort of promotion where if you sit in the first three rows, we answer

418
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
your...

419
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Okay, anyway.

420
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,880
Maybe they had a falling out with their gaming group.

421
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
With their Fortnite squad.

422
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,240
Oh, you got to patch things up.

423
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,280
You have to patch it up rom-com style.

424
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh, this game has another patch, and this time it's friendship.

425
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah.

426
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,160
Patching up your relationship.

427
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,360
You need to do sort of a parent trap, but for gamers, gamer trap, and you like lure

428
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:52,720
them into like a raid, maybe like one of the hard ones, and you're like, I need help, and

429
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,160
then they all do it together.

430
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
Yeah, man.

431
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,640
That all sounds like definitely real gamer opportunities.

432
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,440
Yeah, it's like gamers stuff.

433
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
You guys get it.

434
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Sure.

435
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,360
I've become a books person myself.

436
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,160
Maybe they've become a books person.

437
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
There've been a lot of...

438
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:14,920
Listen, there've been a lot of good books lately.

439
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,360
Everyone's always talking about how good books are right now.

440
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,320
Well, it's just like book graphics keep getting better and better.

441
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Right?

442
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,320
That's true.

443
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,040
You need to go up there and just take all their books away.

444
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Because if they...

445
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
Oh, yeah.

446
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
And burn them.

447
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Wait.

448
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
No.

449
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,040
What?

450
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,040
What?

451
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,040
No.

452
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,040
On to DVDs.

453
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
Yeah.

454
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
Is what he was going to say.

455
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,040
And then melt those in a fire.

456
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
No.

457
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
No.

458
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Damn it.

459
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,720
Maybe they're just waiting for a new game that's really fun, and maybe you could make

460
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,720
that game.

461
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Ooh.

462
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
Yeah.

463
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Maybe you base it on them.

464
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Yeah.

465
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
And something you know about them.

466
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,200
Maybe you make it out of like a cardboard box that you cut some holes in, and then it

467
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,840
comes with a little ball, and they have to get the ball into the holes from far away

468
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
or something.

469
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
It sounds good.

470
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
Oh, the look on his face.

471
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
Oh, the delight.

472
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,840
Thank you.

473
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,640
I ran out of games.

474
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,240
And you can hang over his shoulder the whole time like, this is Sergeant Bloodmash.

475
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,880
Yes, we need you to get the enemy base.

476
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,640
They're in the hole number four with the blue circle around it.

477
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,640
Yeah.

478
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,640
Kill streak.

479
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
Achievement points.

480
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:34,760
Uh-oh, here comes a babe, but you got to have DLC for it.

481
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,600
It's the second box they have to pay $5.

482
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Oh, yeah.

483
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
The babe box.

484
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:45,320
The babe box you get for winning the box war.

485
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,160
I think the three of us are the only ones who like this bit.

486
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,960
You don't, but you don't have a second box, so you have to make an announcement like,

487
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,840
we're so sorry to let down our mini fans, we do have to delay box two, the babe box.

488
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,840
We just want to take all the time to make the decision.

489
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,600
But good news, it's going to be babe box 3D when it's done.

490
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Hey, wait a minute.

491
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,360
This ball is too big to fit through this hole.

492
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,560
They rushed this through QA, man.

493
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,080
This is bullshit.

494
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,560
This box only has three flaps.

495
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
What the fuck?

496
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,920
The third flap, we're finishing the fourth one.

497
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
It's art.

498
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,280
You wouldn't get it.

499
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,280
That's part of the experience.

500
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,280
It's supposed to be challenging.

501
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:37,760
It's weird.

502
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,760
Before we start Haunted Dawn Lunch, I do need Paul to bring me another White Claw.

503
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,160
Thank you, Paul.

504
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
Let's see this beauty.

505
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,840
Meet our first contestant, Justina.

506
00:19:49,840 --> 00:20:00,720
Justina, what you see is in a purple outfit with some rainbow sleeves and some face paint,

507
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,120
which you'll find out comes by Honest.

508
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,120
You're purchasing the doll pictured above.

509
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,760
Are those two fingers holding her around the waist, or is that some sort of weird?

510
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Oh, boy.

511
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
Oh, God.

512
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
Holy shit.

513
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
That sucks.

514
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,120
I didn't even notice that.

515
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,120
That sucks.

516
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,720
It looks like E.T.'s trying to make a few bucks.

517
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,160
It sucks.

518
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Meet Justina.

519
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,640
Justina was in her late teens.

520
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,800
Hold her like this.

521
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,200
Do not use more than two fingers.

522
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,560
Holy shit.

523
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Meet Justina.

524
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:41,880
Normally, I should leave out the ones where they have the description of their deaths,

525
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,880
but I have two that I do include that, because you'll see.

526
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
Meet Justina.

527
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,400
Justina was in her late 20s, working at a full-service laundromat.

528
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,240
In her off time, she was a face painter for children's birthday parties.

529
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,320
Not a very good one, it looks like.

530
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,680
She was getting high on her own supply.

531
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,840
She was happy, but always anxious to see what was in store for her.

532
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,800
Did she break something in this picture?

533
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,760
Is that a bulb of garlic on the bottom?

534
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,800
It looks like prop bread.

535
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:22,320
One day, while at work, a very strange and potent smell came on fast.

536
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,360
It caused her and her coworkers to go unconscious.

537
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,840
Around 10 minutes later, it had built up in the building, causing an explosion.

538
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:36,240
Justina likes to watch soap operas and loves Slim Jims.

539
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,520
That's the way it's written.

540
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,680
The other people who worked there didn't get dolls.

541
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,080
It caused an explosion.

542
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,720
Justina likes to watch soap operas and loves Slim Jims.

543
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Do you?

544
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,680
Okay, that may seem unrelated, but trust me, you'll see.

545
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,880
Does she love them from an aesthetic point of view?

546
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,880
It doesn't look like she has the apparatus.

547
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,560
I eat the Slim Jims, Griffin.

548
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
How?

549
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,840
With my mouth.

550
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,240
She communicates with dowsing rods, pendulum, and balloon lights.

551
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
What?

552
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
I don't know.

553
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:22,200
Please do not adopt her if you have ill intentions, like trying to get free face paint.

554
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Please act-

555
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Wake up.

556
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Do a Spider-Man to me.

557
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Please act-

558
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,600
No, I said send me a suit Spider-Man.

559
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,960
Please ask questions before purchasing.

560
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,080
I don't think you have that kind of time.

561
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,560
Oh yeah, don't even act like she's not 12 inches tall.

562
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,080
I have the proof.

563
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,120
Also, if you need any loose sequins, I have a couple bags of them.

564
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,560
I am selling a doll, not an experience.

565
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,800
I am not responsible for any experience you may or may not have.

566
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,680
That's a fun way of putting that.

567
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:04,080
Please realize by adopting Justina, you are potentially inviting a spirit into your home.

568
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,760
They are not toys and should only be handled by adults.

569
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,800
Like this.

570
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,160
With their two glowing fingers.

571
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,440
That's a great 180 from like, I'm selling a doll, it's not a toy.

572
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,880
Light a white candle to welcome her spirit.

573
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,080
You will receive the doll pictured above.

574
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,640
Anything else is a bonus.

575
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,640
What?

576
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,640
Whoa, I don't want-

577
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,800
No, I see what kind of bric-a-brac you're working with.

578
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,980
I'm good.

579
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,000
I ask only adults purchase my dolls.

580
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,200
I don't accept cancellations or issue refunds.

581
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,840
I can't imagine why not.

582
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,880
So that is Justina.

583
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,520
Thanks for coming to the show, Justina.

584
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,760
What a pleasure it was to have you.

585
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,760
Happy to be here.

586
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,600
Hey, can I just tell you all, I don't want to over-hype it, but you're going to love

587
00:23:51,600 --> 00:24:00,840
my new boy, Little Spitz.

588
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,840
Let's meet Little Spitz.

589
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,880
Oh yeah.

590
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,160
That's Little Spitz, baby.

591
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,120
Only $150?

592
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,920
I'm going to watch this shit go up in real time.

593
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Little Spitz.

594
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Hey, what's up, guys?

595
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,760
I'm Little Spitz, isn't I?

596
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,120
Hey, they're starting to have some fun over here on Metaphysical eBay, okay?

597
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,520
Little Spitz was a kid who wanted to be a rapper when he grew up.

598
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,760
No, he did not.

599
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,760
Yeah, he did.

600
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,120
He was a doll his spirit in, idiot.

601
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,040
He listened to all the classic rappers all the time, like Tupac and Eminem.

602
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,840
He wrote his own raps.

603
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,160
He made his own arms.

604
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,520
He wrote his own raps.

605
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,000
He made his own arms.

606
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And he would hang out.

607
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,440
What can't Little Spitz do except clap?

608
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,400
He wrote his own raps and would hang out with older kids who thought he was cool because

609
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,160
he rapped.

610
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,640
We've all been there.

611
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,880
This ultimately got him killed as he was-

612
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,800
Didn't see that coming, did you?

613
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,240
Got him killed as he was with his group of friends and they decided to sneak out and

614
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,520
go to a real rap battle.

615
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,760
Are these three separate pictures?

616
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,560
All posed like to give you a full idea.

617
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,640
They thought it would be like 8 Mile.

618
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,480
That's not me editorializing, that's what it says.

619
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,440
They thought it would be like 8 Mile.

620
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,220
While they were there on the edges of the crowd though, a car rolled up and a window

621
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,800
rolled down.

622
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
What are you saying?

623
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
No, keep going.

624
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,440
Hey y'all, an eight-year-old rap prodigy lost his life.

625
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:59,360
If you could have a little decorum.

626
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,760
While they were there on the edges of the crowd though, a car rolled up and a window

627
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:08,880
rolled down, a barrel of a gun came out the window, and someone from the car yelled, Joy

628
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,880
Road, bitches.

629
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,440
Joy Road?

630
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:20,840
Joy Road, bitches, and sprayed the crowd, presumably with bullets.

631
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,720
With Axe Body spray.

632
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,880
Lil Spitz was among the first hit with the bullets, not even understanding what happened.

633
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,620
Now he is in this vessel, looking for someone cool and laid back.

634
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,960
He said, that's me.

635
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,640
Also someone who listens to rap music, or will at least play it for him.

636
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,480
That's Lil Spitz.

637
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,600
God almighty.

638
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:50,440
This is our last item up on Metaphysical eBay, and we are branching out a little bit.

639
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
Oh.

640
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
All right.

641
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,720
Tell me more, I've been in the market for one of these bad boys.

642
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,640
Well this is a high-ranking Illuminati Freemason Cobra Ring Silver Antique Vintage Metaphysical.

643
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,960
Wait, how is it metaphysical?

644
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,600
Well, it's it because you're going to accept this ring into your life and experience wealth,

645
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,120
comfort, power, influence, and all the very best things in life.

646
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,560
Romance, love, comfort, and so much more.

647
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,100
You truly can't have it all.

648
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,020
That's why items like this exist.

649
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,800
What's on either side of the snake?

650
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,320
Well, Travis, being offered is a very rare, very powerful Freemasons ring that comes directly

651
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,420
from the highest ranks of the Illuminati.

652
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,960
Those who are the real heavy hitters, the real power holders of the Freemasons, those

653
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,360
who make up half of the sacred inner circle of the New World Order.

654
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,360
Okay.

655
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,360
So Trav, let me tell you.

656
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,960
Oh, and it's adjustable, which is nice.

657
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
That is nice.

658
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,080
You would think that they would have them fitted, but no.

659
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,080
Who has the time?

660
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,760
Also nice to see that they're hollow in the back.

661
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,760
So you can store stuff.

662
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,120
From the very moment you touch this piece, you'll realize you've purchased something

663
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,160
truly extraordinary that will forever reverberate incredible power into your life.

664
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:56,560
The aggressive power of this amazing ring has been created with forces of magic and

665
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,800
other worldly technology, not only to, but a few of the most powerfully connected men

666
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
on earth.

667
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,520
If only Little Spitz had been wearing this ring when that drive-by happened.

668
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,640
He would be protected.

669
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,840
And other world technology couldn't make it fit?

670
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,120
Fascinating sidebar, you may not know this, most do not, but the government of the United

671
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,120
States possesses a memory copying technology, a medical device of sorts.

672
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,520
Of sorts?

673
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,360
Which is held at an underground nuclear metropolis in Roswell, New Mexico, long before it became

674
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,360
Area 51.

675
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
Sure.

676
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,760
This process is parts of the brain that never dies, but rather simply shuts off when one

677
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
dies.

678
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
Yeah.

679
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,920
This unusual technology turns it back on like a light switch and then siphons those memories,

680
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,160
creating a memory archive for that particular individual.

681
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,080
This wipes the memories of the brain so that no matter what medical, technological, or

682
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,520
metaphysical advancements may arise in the future, nobody will ever be able to access

683
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,200
the secret information within their memories except for them.

684
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,120
This has been encoded within the memory archives of its Illuminati masters, the three men that

685
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,320
make up half of the sacred inner circle of the New World Order at the time of its creation.

686
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,320
Okay.

687
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,680
That was an interesting sidebar.

688
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,680
Yeah.

689
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,080
This goes on for literally two pages.

690
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,200
Yeah.

691
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,440
There are no rituals or binding spells needed once your talisman arrives.

692
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
Cool.

693
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,200
This is completely ready for use.

694
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,720
All that's needed is you accept this small magical offering into your life to keep it

695
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
with you as much as possible.

696
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,680
I mean, within reason.

697
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,960
That's how I felt when my first daughter was born too, it's nice.

698
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,320
You will have the know-how to anyone or anything that stands in your way of wealth and success.

699
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,320
No level of magic will be able to hold you back in life.

700
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,320
I mean, yeah.

701
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,960
And it's 100% guaranteed satisfaction and fast delivery.

702
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,960
So that's huge.

703
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,920
You don't need to wait for this and it's available for just $80.

704
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,920
Just $80, really?

705
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,800
That's half the price of little spits.

706
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:48,720
I mean- Imagine if you had both little spits and the Illuminati ring.

707
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,720
Yes.

708
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,720
An unkillable rap god.

709
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,200
Hey, we are going to go use the bathroom.

710
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,480
You should use the bathroom and we'll be right back with more jokes.

711
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
We love you very much.

712
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Bye.

713
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
Bye.

714
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
Hello, my friends.

715
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,480
I hope you're enjoying the episode.

716
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:19,680
I don't know which one they decided to run, but I bet it was one of the good ones.

717
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
Not that one.

718
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
You know, it was kind of a dud.

719
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
You probably heard a lot of people talking about it.

720
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
I'm just kidding.

721
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
They're all sevens because we're professionals.

722
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:33,600
I want to tell you for a second, I want to talk to you about Imperfect Foods.

723
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,600
You know, food waste is a big problem and we could all be doing a little bit more, but

724
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,240
what if you could do more about the food waste problem and also help yourself too, my friends?

725
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,880
That is what I like to call profitable altruism, which is a phrase I just invented, but I think

726
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,120
it's really going somewhere.

727
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:55,120
Imperfect Foods is the best route I can think of to do that.

728
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,940
You can also save time in your grocery shopping.

729
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,880
You can eat more fresh and delicious food and you're helping the planet.

730
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,240
It's a slam dunk.

731
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,560
It's a grocery delivery service that offers a whole line of sustainable groceries that

732
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,040
embrace the natural imperfections in food.

733
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,520
You know, we're all a little imperfect by definition.

734
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
We're human beings.

735
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,120
Don't you want that same value in your produce?

736
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,320
This is fresh.

737
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,320
It's delicious.

738
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,040
It's just not exactly the perfect fit for the store shelves, but it may be the perfect

739
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,640
fit for your home and Imperfect delivers weekly by neighborhood, which is a unique model.

740
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,180
It produces 25 to 75% fewer emissions.

741
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,040
Could this get any better for you or the planet?

742
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,320
I think not.

743
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:41,760
Imperfect Foods got me hooked into some really cool produce that I can't even get in my area.

744
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,400
Things that are not available around here and some products I haven't heard of before,

745
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,400
that have become absolute staples in my house.

746
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,800
Try the croissant toast.

747
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,200
Cannot recommend it enough if you want one easy slam dunk.

748
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,420
Right now, Imperfect Foods is offering our listeners 20% off your first four orders when

749
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,920

750
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,600
Again, 20% off your first four orders.

00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,240
That's up to an $80 value at ImperfectFoods.com.

752
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,520
Offer code when you use the promo code MYBROTHER.

753
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,240
And the movement at ImperfectFoods.com and use code MYBROTHER.

754
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,640
While you're enjoying all your Imperfect Foods, you're going to be looking for some new hobbies.

755
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,640
You have so much free time here.

756
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,040
I don't go to the grocery store anymore.

757
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,520
Why not try picking up a new language?

758
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:36,000
I have been learning Japanese recently because someday I'd like to go to Tokyo Disneyland.

759
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,840
There's other reasons, obviously, but I'm sorry.

760
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,600
I am who I am.

761
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,440
Babbel has 15-minute lessons that make it the perfect way to learn a new language on

762
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
the go.

763
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:54,000
With Babbel, you can choose from 14 different languages, Spanish, French, Italian, German,

764
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,920
plus they have this speech recognition technology.

765
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,280
It makes it easier to improve your pronunciation.

766
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:06,400
It's a really, really fun, easy, accessible, effective way of learning a new language.

767

769
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,000
Babbel, language for life.

770
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Quick bit of housekeeping.

771
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Thanks, by the way.

772
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Thanks, obviously.

773
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,960
Thank you for listening.

774
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,320
Thanks to everybody who joined and upgraded during the Max Fun Drive.

775
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:39,040
Just a reminder, we are in the midst of the Fancy Takes Flight Tour to celebrate 20 Rendez

776
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
Vu.

777
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:46,440
Tickets for all the shows are on sale now at bit.ly forward slash McElroy Tours, M-C-E-L-R-O-Y

778
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,960

779
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:54,660
There's a virtual Adventure Zone next week on May 20th at 9pm ET.

780
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,160
The game is Dread.

781
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,960
It's going to be wild.

782
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,700
Tickets are 10 bucks and the VOD, that's video on demand, is available for two weeks

783
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,160
after the show.

784
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,520
You want to see us live, in person, well, then you're going to head out to Boston on

785
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,040
June 17th to see Taz.

786
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,800
We're also in Boston June 18th with MBMBAM.

787
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,840
And then on the 19th, we are in Mashantucket at the Foxwoods Casino June 19th with my brother.

788
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
My brother and me.

789
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,640
We're also coming to Salt Lake, Portland, San Diego, Washington, Detroit, Cincinnati.

790
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:31,400
Now, mask and proof of full vaccination or negative COVID test within 72 hours of event

791
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,040
start are required.

792
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,600
Hey, our dad also has a book coming out this week or now.

793
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,520
I mean, it's out on Tuesday, May 10th.

794
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:48,040
So if you would like to have a great children's book to share with a kid in your life or just

795
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,640
by yourself, you just want to enjoy it.

796
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,760
It's called Goldie's Guide to Grandchilding and it is available in bookstores.

797
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,600
We're going to be doing some appearances with dad throughout this great nation of ours.

798
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,880
Go to Linktree slash Goldie's Guide.

799
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:10,760
That's L-I-N-K-T-R dot E-E slash G-O-L-D-I-E-S guide to check in on that.

800
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,440
Oh, this is fun.

801
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,080
I don't want to spoil the surprise, but we are in a podcast with Batman.

802
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,800
It's us and Batman fighting crime together.

803
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,920
It's called Batman Unburied.

804
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:26,120
It's a new podcast that drops new episodes Tuesday and it's exclusively for free on Spotify.

805
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:31,880
It's made by Spotify, Warner Brothers and D.C. and is a thrilling take on the Caped

806
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,880
Crusader.

807
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,880
And we are in there with him, fighting alongside of him, basically.

808
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
We have new merch too.

809
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,600
You can check it all out at McElroy Merch dot com.

810
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:47,240
And 10 percent of all merch proceeds this month are going to go to Naral.

811
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,860
That is a group that fights for access to abortion care, birth control, paid parental

812
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,880
leave and protections from pregnancy discrimination.

813
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,360
That's all at McElroy Merch dot com.

814
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,920
And do I have to do a celebrity impression now?

815
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,720
OK, let's see if you can guess this one.

816
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,440
I've been working on it.

817
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,440
What?

818
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,640
What's the deal with hummus?

819
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:22,740
It's just mushed up beans and spices.

820
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:26,420
Thank you so much to everyone who participated in this year's Max Fun Drive.

821
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,560
If you're a member who wants to purchase additional patches, our annual shop is now

822
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
live.

823
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,000
The proceeds for this year's sale will be going to Trans Lifeline.

824
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,560
Anytime is a good time to donate to Trans Lifeline, but this year it feels particularly

825
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,080
important.

826
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,760
Trans Lifeline is a non-profit for the trans community by the trans community.

827
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,640
We're grateful that with your support, we'll be able to help Trans Lifeline connect trans

828
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,920
folks to the support and resources they need to survive and thrive.

829
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,420
The sale will run until Friday, May 20th.

830
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:02,120
Folks at the $10 monthly level and above will have access to all of the patches from the

831
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,200
drive.

832
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,140
We also have a special network patch starring Nutsy that all members can purchase.

835
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:27,800
Hey, this is Alden Ford and Mujan Zofagari, and we are here with all the other creators

836
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
of Mission to Zix.

837
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
Hello.

838
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
Hey.

839
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,800
You're not going to say our names too?

840
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,800
No, no.

841
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
It's a short promo.

842
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
Yeah.

843
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,700
Now with the end of our fifth and final season just a few weeks away, we want to say thank

844
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:43,640
you to Maximum Fun and to every single one of you who has listened to and supported Mission

845
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,720
to Zix.

846
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,720
Thank you.

847
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,180
And if you haven't checked it out, well, Mission to Zix is an improvised space opera with blockbuster

848
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:55,120
quality sound design, a score performed by an actual 60-piece orchestra, and hilarious

849
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,180
guest comedians on every episode.

850
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:02,620
And as our final episodes air, now is the perfect time to jump on board.

851
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:12,500
It's Mission to Zix, Z-Y-X-X on Maximum Fun.

852
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:19,460
How can I interest you gentlemen in a wager?

853
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,460
Yes.

854
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,900
It's time to play minion quotes.

855
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,620
Yeah.

856
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:31,100
But this time with a twist.

857
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:36,740
So if you've never played this game, here are the rules.

858
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:42,980
I Justin McElroy am going to read to you an inspirational or hilarious quote.

859
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:49,700
That quote is attached in the memetic image that has been shared on Facebook by your aunt

860
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,060
and it is connected to a cartoon character.

861
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,940
That cartoon character will have to be guessed by my other two brothers if they guess it

862
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,940
correctly.

863
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:02,500
I will have to post this image, apropos of nothing, on my Facebook page.

864
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,540
Now what makes this more interesting tonight is we are passing it around.

865
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:09,720
We have each selected one quote so the stakes are higher than ever because all three of

866
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,460
us are participating in the game.

867
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:18,820
Oh, also I just realized in a second, another twist, I've been locked out of my Facebook

868
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,500
for the past like three weeks because of like, I don't know, because I haven't logged in

869
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,540
long enough and they're worried about it and I was like, oh cool, I don't ever have to

870
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,900
go on Facebook again.

871
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,620
So if I lose, I have to figure that out.

872
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,620
Your brand reemerges.

873
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,620
Yes.

874
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,620
Okay.

875
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,620
Okay.

876
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,620
Are you ready to play minion quotes?

877
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,620
I'm so fucking ready.

878
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,620
Oh, mine.

879
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,620
Okay, great.

880
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,620
Oh, Travis is first.

881
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,620
I thought you said I'm first.

882
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,620
Travis is first.

883
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,620
Travis is first.

884
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,620
Okay.

885
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,620
Okay.

886
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,620
I'm not looking at your phone.

887
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:51,620
The quote is, I don't care how difficult 2019 has been, but the fact we woke up every day

888
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:58,420
means that God isn't finished with us, which I think is supposed to be inspirational, but

889
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,900
could also be horrifyingly threatening.

890
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,900
Yeah.

891
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:08,100
Knowing what happens in 2020, it does sound like God is threatening us from a distance.

892
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:14,460
The religious ones are tough because usually it is not who you would think of as being

893
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,140
a particularly religious cartoon character.

894
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:21,780
And I would argue the highest stakes ones to pick as the picker, yes.

895
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,780
Yeah.

896
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,780
Oh, wow.

897
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,780
I really want to get this right.

898
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,780
Yeah.

899
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,580
I live life on the edge.

900
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,580
Can I have a hint?

901
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,580
No.

902
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,580
Maybe just one hint?

903
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,580
Oh, okay.

904
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,620
It's a cartoon character.

905
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,620
Damn it.

906
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,500
It's a cartoon character.

907
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,500
Can I ask a question, yes or no, and you have to answer honestly?

908
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,540
Oh, you can ask the question and we'll see.

909
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,340
Is it a Looney Tune?

910
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,340
That's a big swash.

911
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,340
Tweety Bird.

912
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,340
I'm saying Tweety Bird.

913
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,340
Tweety Bird, Tweety Bird.

914
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,340
I'm going to say Bugs Bunny.

915
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,340
It's a classic.

916
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,340
I'm sorry.

917
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:09,220
Paul, if we could swap it, it is Moana.

918
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,740
I should have considered the coconut.

919
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,740
That was my bad.

920
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:20,340
What, you know how Moana has a close and personal relationship with the Christian deity?

921
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,780
You know how famously that's what the movie is about?

922
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,780
Okay, now wait.

923
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,780
Now hold on.

924
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,780
Now I'm mad.

925
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,300
She literally meets a god of a different religion.

926
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,780
Like she meets a god.

927
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,780
Correct.

928
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,780
Correct.

929
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,780
A Demi-God, but still.

930
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,420
Well, I mean then, Te Fiti?

931
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,420
It's a huge part of the movie.

932
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:40,260
Yeah, and she's interacting with religious figures outside of the Christian experience.

933
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,260
Yeah.

934
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:46,460
Yeah, but our God's not done with her.

935
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,980
Our God, the one true God, Father of Abraham.

936
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,460
Hey, do you ever have a moment where you're like, oh, all the Southern Baptist isn't out

937
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,460
yet?

938
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,460
Oh no.

939
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,460
The Lamb of Judea.

940
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,460
Okay.

941
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,100
Could beat the shit out of the Rock's Mouth.

942
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,700
All right, Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.

943
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,540
Okay, this is Justin's minion quote.

944
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,540
Okay.

945
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,940
Paul, it would be easier if you just put the quote on the screen.

946
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,220
I can just read off of that.

947
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:17,620
Remember how when you were little, you could just rip off your diaper and run around naked

948
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,180
and everyone thought it was so cute and funny.

949
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,740
Anyway, I need bail money.

950
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,820
Fuck, that's funny.

951
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,260
God.

952
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:32,740
So I am going to, because it occurs to me that I slightly cheated.

953
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:37,300
So I am going to tell you, it is not a cartoon character.

954
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,300
Oh.

955
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:45,900
But it is a children's character, not a cartoon character.

956
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,660
Is it Moana again?

957
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,820
Now Bud, Bud, that's a cartoon, remember?

958
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,820
We just saw it.

959
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,660
I want to say Blippi, but I know you wouldn't do that to us.

960
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:05,300
I don't think boomers know who Blippi is and this has big boomer energy.

961
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,460
Is it children's?

962
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:11,420
A children's character for children's, but not a cartoon.

963
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,420
Family character.

964
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,420
Everybody can enjoy this character.

965
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,420
God, I've said too much.

966
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,420
Okay.

967
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,420
I'm going to shut up.

968
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,420
Can I ask one yes or no question?

969
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,980
I've already given you all the clues you need, Mr. Policeman.

970
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,260
Is it a human character?

971
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:26,300
Also, we referenced that Snowman movie a lot for three people who haven't seen it.

972
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,820
I barely seen the poster.

973
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,820
Is it a human character?

974
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,320
I mean, it's an interesting question.

975
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,460
That you'll answer now.

976
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,900
Come on, it won't be funny if nobody gets it.

977
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:42,900
Yeah, but of the people on this stage, I think I have the least appropriate tribute.

978
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,220
The least appropriate sacrifice is I am the only one who's had to do this.

979
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,260
No, it's not a human character.

980
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,260
Yes.

981
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,260
Okay.

982
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,260
That's tough.

983
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:55,520
Do you have a guess, Travis?

984
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,780
I'm going to say Paddington.

985
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,780
You really need?

986
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,780
Okay, Paddington.

987
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,780
Interesting.

988
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,020
It's not fucking Paddington.

989
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:09,460
I'm trying to think of the other deep wells that we usually draw from, and by we, I mean

990
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,500
boomers who put up memes on Facebook.

991
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,500
Think really hard.

992
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,980
I think you can do it.

993
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:15,980
Really?

994
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:20,740
A live action non-human that boomers would know.

995
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,740
Is it Kermit?

996
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,740
Yes!

997
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:47,340
I knew you could do it.

998
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,180
Now Justin, do you want to wait?

999
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,980
Do you want to wait until Griffin's?

1000
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,180
No, we're going to sit right here, everyone.

1001
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:01,940
I'm just going to put it on my Facebook right now, because it's not fun unless I do it right

1002
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,940
now.

1003
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,140
And I will then immediately comment on it.

1004
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:09,580
Oh no, my Facebook's locked!

1005
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,140
Do you want to load mine up while Justin?

1006
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,500
Oh, you got that hair trigger.

1007
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,380
He already had the image loaded.

1008
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,380
Okay.

1009
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,940
Hold on, I want to put a link to Sydney's website on here.

1010
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,540
Yeah, I'm sure she'll love that.

1011
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,500
Oh, he's doing it.

1012
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,580
Okay, here is my minion quote.

1013
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,580
Oh boy.

1014
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,220
Hold on, devil.

1015
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,900
Not today, or any other day.

1016
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,540
Feeling blessed and covered under the blood of Jesus.

1017
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:41,780
Like, share, and type, amen.

1018
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,820
Wow.

1019
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:47,140
Now this is your first time playing, right?

1020
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,140
Yes.

1021
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:54,060
I also, in full disclosure, I don't know where you find these, but I was looking around for

1022
00:45:54,060 --> 00:46:01,680
minion quotes, and I found one on the MBMBAM reddit that somebody posted on there.

1023
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,700
So thank you for doing that hard work.

1024
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,580
So same question, is this a cartoon character?

1025
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,580
This is a cartoon character.

1026
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,420
Is it a Looney Tune?

1027
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,740
That's such, that's so- You, I gave you-

1028
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,420
It's not a Looney- You see this, right?

1029
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,420
It's a cartoon character.

1030
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,420
You see this.

1031
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,940
You're right, you should be able to get your revenge.

1032
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,500
It is a cartoon character, it is not a Looney Tune.

1033
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,340
I will not give you anything else.

1034
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,340
Bart Simpson.

1035
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,340
No.

1036
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:34,540
Oh, he gave us nothing there, that was a cold, dead stare from Griffin.

1037
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,120
Okay, Justin.

1038
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,300
Not a Simpson character.

1039
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,300
It's not a Ralphie.

1040
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,420
Okay, let me hear your guesses.

1041
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,420
Not, what?

1042
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:50,300
Alvin, from Alvin and the Chipmunks.

1043
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,300
No.

1044
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:57,060
I do want the audience to keep yelling, though, because I honestly haven't-

1045
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:01,940
Scooby-Doo I heard, which will be a wild- No, I haven't heard it.

1046
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,300
Shrek, just reveal it.

1047
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,500
It's fucking Fred Flintstone.

1048
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:22,060
Now, Devril, pretty sure that the Flintstones universe is like wicked BC, like super duper

1049
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:25,380
duper BC.

1050
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,740
Back in the time when man and dinosaur lived together.

1051
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,740
Really, Amanda?

1052
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,500
Amanda's already commented on my Facebook page.

1053
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,860
Don't you have work to do, Amanda?

1054
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:33,860
You're getting a raise.

1055
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,020
Anticipating our needs.

1056
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,020
So that's MinionQuotes.

1057
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,020
Oh, boy.

1058
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:43,100
All right.

1059
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:48,460
So we asked you all to send in questions that we could answer live, and we have some people

1060
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,460
picked out.

1061
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,020
Where's the microphone at?

1062
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:55,020
I was in the bathroom during the soundcheck, so I don't actually know.

1063
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:58,300
So we're going to call down two at a time- Can we get the house lights up just like 20%?

1064
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,460
Can we go back to the part where Griffin said he was in the bathroom for both soundchecks?

1065
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,380
Because I feel like that you didn't let it sink in.

1066
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,380
Where is it?

1067
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,380
It's right there.

1068
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,380
It's right there.

1069
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,380
I'm playing Where's Waldo with this microphone.

1070
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,380
Okay.

1071
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,380
Yes.

1072
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,380
Hello.

1073
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,380
Hello.

1074
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,380
Hello and welcome.

1075
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,380
Hi.

1076
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,380
Hi.

1077
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,380
I'm Taylor.

1078
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,380
Hi, Taylor.

1079
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,380
Hi, Taylor.

1080
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:27,300
Taylor, your question- I can't believe we picked this one.

1081
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,820
Taylor asked, who are you?

1082
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:37,980
I'm just here because I bought the tickets.

1083
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:44,500
So I guess we were actually, we read this backstage and we thought, I wonder how it's

1084
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,500
going.

1085
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,500
Yeah.

1086
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,060
So we wanted to ask you, Taylor, what do you think so far?

1087
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,540
And really give us the real shit.

1088
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,100
Please be honest with us, Taylor.

1089
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,660
Like what do you think so far?

1090
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,140
I think it's pretty good so far.

1091
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,140
Yeah.

1092
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,140
I think it's pretty good so far.

1093
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,420
Now, Taylor, I have a follow-up question.

1094
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:06,020
When you say, I'm just here because I bought the tickets on accident?

1095
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:09,220
No, my sibling's actually here with me.

1096
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,220
Oh, okay.

1097
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,660
What's your sibling's name?

1098
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,660
Rhiannon.

1099
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,660
Hi, Rhiannon.

1100
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,660
Hello.

1101
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,660
And Rhiannon knows who we are, right?

1102
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,660
Yes.

1103
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,660
Oh, okay.

1104
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,660
It's a very early birthday present for them.

1105
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,660
Oh, happy early birthday.

1106
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:20,660
Okay.

1107
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,660
Now, have you picked a favorite yet?

1108
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,660
Oh, good question.

1109
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:27,660
Well, I'm a little biased because I'm on Tumblr a lot, so I see Griffin's face a lot, so.

1110
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,660
Oh, my God.

1111
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:36,180
I will be feasting off the memory of you hesitating to remember his name for a week.

1112
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,180
Yeah, that was decadent.

1113
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,780
But you did pull it, Taylor, so don't feel bad.

1114
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,780
Yay.

1115
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,780
You did pull it.

1116
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,780
Yeah, you did pull it.

1117
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,780
Garf-ball.

1118
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,780
What is it?

1119
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,780
Garf-ball.

1120
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,780
Garf-ball.

1121
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:47,780
That's a Garfield...

1122
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,780
Dresses Garf-ball?

1123
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:49,780
Garf-ball.

1124
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:56,020
That's a completely unnecessary self-own, but which of my many incredible memes that have

1125
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,020
made it onto Tumblr?

1126
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:01,500
The main one I see is, like, you holding a blank piece of paper, and people edit.

1127
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,500
Oh, edit.

1128
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,380
I think my favorite one is somebody saying, I'm too afraid to...

1129
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,580
I don't know who the McElroy brothers are, and I'm too afraid to ask with your face.

1130
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,580
Did you make that one?

1131
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:10,580
Or...

1132
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,580
Wait, no, Taylor wasn't afraid.

1133
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:12,580
Yeah.

1134
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:13,580
Taylor asked.

1135
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,580
I saw that one.

1136
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,580
I did not make it.

1137
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,580
You did ask who we are.

1138
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,580
Yeah.

1139
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,580
And that's what's...

1140
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,580
That's all that's important.

1141
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,220
We're like brothers, and we do, like, advice.

1142
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,220
That's the show, basically.

1143
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,220
Yeah.

1144
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,220
And we do, like, strong.

1145
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,220
Skits.

1146
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,220
We're strong.

1147
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:31,320
Yeah, we're strong and capable fellows.

1148
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,340
We're strong and we have normal digestive systems.

1149
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,340
Those are the two things.

1150
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:37,440
That's exactly what I got from everything you guys have said so far.

1151
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,440
You're getting that.

1152
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,440
Okay, perfect.

1153
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,300
We eat bananas totally normal.

1154
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,940
And...

1155
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,940
Um, well, we, Taylor, we've embarrassed you now.

1156
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,900
Thank you so much for being a good sport.

1157
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,740
Thanks for coming.

1158
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,580
I hope you're having fun.

1159
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,420
Yeah.

1160
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,240
Yeah.

1161
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,080
Yeah.

1162
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:55,920
Yeah.

1163
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,740
Yeah.

1164
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:57,580
Yeah.

1165
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,420
Hi.

1166
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,240
Hi.

1167
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,080
Who, who are you?

1168
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:00,920
We've called so many names.

1169
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,760
Okay.

1170
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,580
I'm Lauren.

1171
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,420
Hi, Lauren.

1172
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,260
Hi, Lauren.

1173
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,420
You asked us, uh, failed my driver's test today.

1174
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,020
How could I impress the examiner next time?

1175
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:10,860
Yeah.

1176
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,380
How bad'd you fail?

1177
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,180
I drove on the wrong side of the road.

1178
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,020
I mean-

1179
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:15,860
Whoa!

1180
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,540
Hey, Lauren.

1181
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,620
Very British.

1182
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,460
Very British, Lauren.

1183
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,460
I know the first impressive thing

1184
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:23,620
you could do next time, Lauren.

1185
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:27,340
For like a long time?

1186
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,740
No.

1187
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:32,660
Well, Griffin, how long do you think it needs to happen

1188
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,500
before it's a no?

1189
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,020
Hey, hey, Lauren, uh, can you replicate

1190
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,700
what they said to you in exact replica?

1191
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,060
Like tone of voice, too.

1192
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:40,900
Yeah.

1193
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,180
Um, she waited until I was done with my test

1194
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,700
and then she was like, unfortunately,

1195
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,900
you drove on the wrong side of the road,

1196
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,300
which is an automatic fail.

1197
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,120
Damn.

1198
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:48,960
Whoa!

1199
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,800
She made you keep going?

1200
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,140
Yeah, she should have said something

1201
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:51,980
when you ran over like 80 people.

1202
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:52,820
When you were doing it,

1203
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,420
when she was just like, hell yeah, fuck, let's go.

1204
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,500
Yes, yes, this is how I do it.

1205
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,380
Yes, go!

1206
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,260
I'm feeling something for the first time.

1207
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,080
This is li-

1208
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:01,920
This is living.

1209
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,860
I'm alive.

1210
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,180
Hold my hand, Lauren.

1211
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,900
Lauren, are you feeling this?

1212
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:10,380
Um, the word that I feel like

1213
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,180
made us select this question was,

1214
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,940
how could I impress the examiner next time?

1215
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,460
And I'm not sure you understand

1216
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,220
what the examiner is looking for.

1217
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:27,580
It's not America's Got Talent driving edition.

1218
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,380
You already tried stunting,

1219
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,420
so let's mark that one off.

1220
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,180
Next.

1221
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,140
Oh, super cool car.

1222
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,520
They can't flunk you for knowing all the words

1223
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,320
to Barenaked Ladies one week.

1224
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,440
They can't, they legally can't flunk you

1225
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,560
if you sing the fast part from Hook by Blues Traveler.

1226
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,400
Yeah.

1227
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,240
On loop.

1228
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,520
Was that it?

1229
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,600
Was it just driving the wrong lane that they didn't?

1230
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,440
Cause that's an easy fix.

1231
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,080
Is that not enough?

1232
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,580
No, I'm saying you just don't do that next time

1233
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,260
and you should be good.

1234
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,260
Or were there other rules?

1235
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,760
Cause we're real like gear heads.

1236
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,760
Oh, you know what?

1237
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,040
Everybody does parallel parking on their test.

1238
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,640
Do some perpendicular parking.

1239
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,280
Yes.

1240
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,320
That'll blow them away.

1241
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,400
I'm doing concentric parking.

1242
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,180
My parallel parking actually went really well,

1243
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,640
but that's not good enough apparently.

1244
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,480
Yeah.

1245
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,560
Now, Lauren, you could-

1246
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,040
I think it sucks because like,

1247
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,400
they shouldn't fail you cause like,

1248
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,400
what are the odds that you'll do that again?

1249
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,800
Yeah.

1250
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,560
And also the fact that you did that

1251
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,240
and they knew you'd failed and they're like,

1252
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,520
and you still have to parallel park.

1253
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,280
Yeah, that sucks actually.

1254
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,640
They should've let you go home.

1255
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,760
Did they keep writing stuff down on the paper?

1256
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,040
Cause that's a wild part of the grift.

1257
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,520
Yeah, did you see them?

1258
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,880
Did you see them casually put the clipboard on the floor?

1259
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,480
I needed that.

1260
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,980
I won't be needing this.

1261
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:59,040
No, but there are just like some random scribbles

1262
00:53:59,040 --> 00:53:59,880
on the paper.

1263
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,880
So I think she was trying to like,

1264
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,240
make me think I had some hope.

1265
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,640
Yeah.

1266
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,840
How long do you have to wait before you can take it again?

1267
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,800
A week.

1268
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,640
One week.

1269
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,480
That is not very long.

1270
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,200
It's been one week since I failed my test.

1271
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,160
Drove on the wrong side of the road.

1272
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,480
If, when you go back, you have the same tester,

1273
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,440
spend the whole time,

1274
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,040
anytime you're on the right side of the road,

1275
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,040
say like, I don't know if you noticed.

1276
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,800
Many people would choose that side of the road,

1277
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,840
but not me.

1278
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,520
An obvious mistake.

1279
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,360
Clearly.

1280
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,960
I'm not zooming into the front of the other cars.

1281
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,520
Notice how me and the other driver pass by each other

1282
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,480
without incident.

1283
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,240
You're welcome.

1284
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,560
Does that help?

1285
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,520
I think.

1286
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,640
You're going to do it next time.

1287
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,640
Yeah, you got it.

1288
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,280
We believe in Lauren, right?

1289
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,120
Thank you.

1290
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,400
Hey, my name is Ellie.

1291
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,240
Hi Ellie.

1292
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,680
Griffin, you're really putting yourself through a lot

1293
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,640
of struggle to not burp right there.

1294
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,320
Sorry.

1295
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,120
Contortions.

1296
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:04,960
Hello Ellie.

1297
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,440
Hi.

1298
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,280
How you doing?

1299
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,120
Good.

1300
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:08,960
I'm doing great.

1301
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,800
Thank you for asking.

1302
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,640
Yeah.

1303
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,320
You asked, I work at a haunted cave

1304
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,480
that is said to have 30 to 40 ghosts,

1305
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,720
but I haven't had a ghost experience yet.

1306
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,160
How do I trigger one?

1307
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,480
Yeah.

1308
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,280
I work at the Wabasha street caves in St. Paul.

1309
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,120
Yes.

1310
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,960
There's fans and every tour guide has had like things move.

1311
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,880
They've seen people, they've heard bands.

1312
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:34,720
Definitely.

1313
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,560
They've heard what?

1314
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,400
Bands.

1315
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,960
We have big bands that play and-

1316
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,800
Ghost bands?

1317
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,960
Wait, big bands or big bands?

1318
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,200
Like big names or-

1319
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,120
Like Glenn Miller orchestra style big bands

1320
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:45,960
or just like large bands?

1321
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,560
Like Cab Calloway, like Benny Goodman and stuff.

1322
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,400
Wait, hold on.

1323
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,840
Wait, shut.

1324
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,680
Wait.

1325
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,400
Your caves are pulling Cab Calloway?

1326
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,160
Yeah, that's a huge ghost git.

1327
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,000
Apparently.

1328
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,440
Can I say if I was going to have a ghost experience,

1329
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,400
if it was totally legit,

1330
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,200
I would also experience a Cab Calloway concert.

1331
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,040
Yeah.

1332
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,360
Apparently John Dillinger is also around sometimes.

1333
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,200
Wow.

1334
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,040
Okay.

1335
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:09,880
Wow.

1336
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,400
Well, he's not busy haunting other places.

1337
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,360
What's so dope about your caves

1338
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,840
that makes every ghost wanna be there?

1339
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,960
Three people were murdered there.

1340
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,280
Well, then there should be three ghosts.

1341
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,720
Yes.

1342
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,200
Ellie, these other sightings

1343
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,680
that the other tour guides have had,

1344
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,120
are these things that they've told you in confidence

1345
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,280
or are these things that they say

1346
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,760
when they're giving tours of the caves?

1347
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,800
So both, and they have pictures to prove it.

1348
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,640
What?

1349
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,720
Like not just orbs, like actual pictures of-

1350
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,440
We've got a fucking scoop.

1351
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,600
Hold on, wait.

1352
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,480
Not just orbs.

1353
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,840
As if someone came to me and was like,

1354
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,360
yeah, I work at this cave.

1355
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,520
Check out this fucking orb I saw.

1356
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,120
I'd be like, just an orb?

1357
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,720
Yeah.

1358
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,960
So you're saying they have a picture

1359
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,920
of like them in Cab Calloway.

1360
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:06,320
Hey, Ellie, like if your coworkers have pictures of ghosts,

1361
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,800
that should be all you're sort of thinking

1362
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,280
and talking about.

1363
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,280
Like in your life, your questions should be like,

1364
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,120
my fucking coworkers have pictures of ghosts.

1365
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:15,960
What do I do with that?

1366
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,360
And not just fucking bullshit orbs.

1367
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,480
Real human-shaped ghosts.

1368
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,960
Juicy three-dimensional ghosts.

1369
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,280
Like we have one of an old lady

1370
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,320
walking through a table.

1371
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,800
What?

1372
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:35,160
Ellie, why are you here and not like at CNN?

1373
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,960
I don't know.

1374
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,480
Is this what's happening in the world

1375
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,040
when people are like, I don't know if there are ghosts.

1376
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,560
It's because the people who have pictures are like,

1377
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,480
I'm not gonna do anything with these.

1378
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,480
What am I gonna do, show these to people?

1379
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,720
Yeah, I guess so.

1380
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,120
I don't know.

1381
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,720
We have not even glanced across the surface

1382
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,560
of your question.

1383
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,400
So you go to the caves

1384
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,480
and you loudly announce, well, I finished all my business.

1385
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,680
I wish there was more business to finish.

1386
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,000
Yeah.

1387
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,080
I wish there was somebody else with business

1388
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,760
they had not finished on this earth

1389
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,680
that I could assist with that particular issue.

1390
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,280
Cause all my business is finished.

1391
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:16,720
Hey, you also, you have the benefit Ellie,

1392
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,880
of apparently there is a ghost there

1393
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,880
who is well known for call and response songs.

1394
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,880
You can walk into the cave and just go,

1395
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,560
hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

1396
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:33,280
There's also, there could just be a echo.

1397
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,760
Dammit, you're right.

1398
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,360
Oh, I could try that I guess.

1399
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,880
Does the cave got wifi?

1400
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,720
Yes.

1401
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,560
Really?

1402
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,960
Yes, we had electricity installed into it

1403
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,600
like in the 1990s.

1404
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,480
Wow, that was your mistake.

1405
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,800
The ghosts wouldn't like that.

1406
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,640
They don't like change is what we've heard, but.

1407
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,000
Can you roll. From who?

1408
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,360
They don't know how cool it is.

1409
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,600
You got to get to this cave.

1410
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,560
If the ghosts say they don't like change

1411
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,680
is cause they don't know how cool shit is outside the cave.

1412
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,840
Like we've got a lot of stuff going on.

1413
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,600
I think you could roll up into the cave

1414
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,680
and plug into cave wifi on your computer

1415
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,320
and just turn on Netflix and just kind of wait

1416
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,720
and be like, anybody want to watch some new drama?

1417
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,280
Now, wait a minute, hold on.

1418
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,120
We don't know how wifi and ghosts interact.

1419
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,960
Maybe they're all fucking flipped out

1420
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,720
cause they're experiencing the wifi.

1421
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,440
Like when you switch it on

1422
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,480
the ghost experience all of the internet at once.

1423
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,800
A ghost in the machine if you will.

1424
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,600
A ghost in the machine if you like.

1425
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,600
You got to get the wifi out of there.

1426
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,160
Yeah. Step one, Ellie,

1427
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,560
go in there tonight under cover of darkness,

1428
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,200
remove that wifi single-handedly,

1429
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,240
get a bucket, scoop up that wifi and carry it out.

1430
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,120
I don't know how wifi works.

1431
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,720
Does that, does that help?

1432
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,560
It helps.

1433
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,400
It does, it does.

1434
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,240
Yeah, I thought it helped.

1435
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,560
Yeah, thank you so much, Ellie.

1436
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,400
Yeah.

1437
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,240
Thank you so much, Ellie.

1438
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,080
Thank you so much, Ellie.

1439
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:57,920
Thank you so much, Ellie.

1440
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,760
Thank you so much, Ellie.

1441
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,720
Y'all look so great.

1442
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,240
I have to say, I should have thought a long time ago

1443
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,400
to tell people to dress nice and fun at our shows.

1444
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,160
What were we facing?

1445
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,440
Hey, what's up?

1446
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,560
Hey, my name's Jake.

1447
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,400
Hi, Jake.

1448
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,280
Hey, Jake.

1449
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,480
Are you sure it's not Jacob?

1450
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,720
Cause that's what you put in the email.

1451
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,400
It is catfish, catfish.

1452
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,240
It is Jacob.

1453
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,400
I was trying to be playfully short with the name.

1454
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,240
Okay.

1455
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,080
All right.

1456
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,880
I think we won't tolerate here as fun.

1457
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:30,200
Jacob, you were talking about a pancake eating challenge

1458
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,320
and I want to know all about it.

1459
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,560
Yeah, this one, we didn't know if it was fun or not,

1460
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,200
but we did need more details, so go on.

1461
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,040
All right.

1462
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,320
An hour north of here is the best place on earth,

1463
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:43,520
Merlin's Family Restaurant, Princeton, Minnesota.

1464
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,360
They got a big stack.

1465
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,720
Everyone knows that, yeah.

1466
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,560
Yeah.

1467
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,080
Not as hot as that cave was.

1468
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,960
No, not.

1469
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,040
Didn't you think you were going to get cave levels of

1470
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:52,880
reactions, right?

1471
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,720
I kind of did.

1472
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,560
Yeah.

1473
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,640
I got to say, if I'm going to go to one of those places,

1474
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,600
I'm pretty intrigued by this big stack of pancakes.

1475
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,400
How big?

1476
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,960
Approximately five inches by 18 inches across.

1477
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,800
Whoa.

1478
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,640
Holy shit.

1479
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,520
Jesus Christ.

1480
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,000
A real chode of pancakes.

1481
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,520
That's...

1482
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,360
In order of pancakes is one pancake.

1483
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,320
That's a hundred square inches of pancake.

1484
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,800
If my math is correct.

1485
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,640
Yes.

1486
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,000
Well, I guess cubic.

1487
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,240
Well, I got to run the diameter.

1488
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,720
Hey, somebody figure that out for me.

1489
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,560
How much pancake is there?

1490
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,400
So what is...

1491
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,240
Pie.

1492
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,080
What's the pancake?

1493
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:26,920
No, it's not pie.

1494
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,200
It's pancakes.

1495
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,440
God almighty.

1496
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,960
So the stack being five inches, but there's four.

1497
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,720
It's comprised of four pancakes.

1498
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,560
Uh-huh.

1499
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,400
Wow.

1500
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,240
And when you eat them, when you eat them, you get...

1501
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,080
Sure, yeah.

1502
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:37,920
Yeah.

1503
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,640
That's the way I traditionally interact with pancakes.

1504
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,960
When you eat them, you get a shirt and your picture

1505
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:44,960
on the wall of fame.

1506
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,640
If you lose, you got to take a picture.

1507
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,920
I'm put on the wall of shame as well.

1508
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,560
So either way you get a picture up on the wall.

1509
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,680
Yeah, it's pretty sick.

1510
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:55,000
Is it a time challenge or just like take your time

1511
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,800
if you can eat them at all?

1512
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,640
It's great.

1513
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:58,600
That's the trick.

1514
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,240
You can stay for hours and fill yourself.

1515
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,400
Oh, they don't know I know this hack.

1516
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,800
Okay, go on.

1517
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,440
Pancake restaurants hate this hack.

1518
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,280
Yeah.

1519
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:12,080
And when you finish it, you still have to pay for it?

1520
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,480
No, no, actually you get it for free,

1521
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,800
but it's like $10 anyway.

1522
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,240
It's just pancake.

1523
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,080
Wow.

1524
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:17,920
Yeah, sure.

1525
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,360
Any dressings on them?

1526
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,840
Any syrups or fruit?

1527
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,680
Butters?

1528
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,760
One could go nuts, but I don't like syrup or butter.

1529
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:29,280
Anything you add to that is just more content.

1530
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,760
So what's your question?

1531
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,280
My question is, so every time I go there,

1532
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,800
I'm gotten very good at this challenge.

1533
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,680
I'm on the wall of fame six times.

1534
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,520
Whoa.

1535
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,360
Fuck yeah, Jacob.

1536
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:43,400
My brother and my brother and me, heroes only.

1537
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,240
Yeah.

1538
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,280
Heroes only here tonight.

1539
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,360
And whether that be just to,

1540
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,960
for the party trick of the morning

1541
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,880
or to update to get more updated photo on the wall.

1542
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,280
Yeah, sure.

1543
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,600
So when they keep swapping out,

1544
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,200
they don't add additional jakes?

1545
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,240
No, it rotates through.

1546
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,880
My ones from freshman year are gone.

1547
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,240
Oh, you want them to stack it

1548
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,160
so that you can have a flip book of you experiencing.

1549
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,120
Exactly.

1550
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,520
But in my training, I've found I can now eat.

1551
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,400
Your training?

1552
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,440
Yeah, Griffin, you don't go

1553
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,800
and do a pancake big stack challenge cold.

1554
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,040
You don't want Jacob to eat pancakes at home.

1555
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,400
Come on.

1556
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,640
Clearly Jacob loves pancakes.

1557
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,320
He does pancake challenges.

1558
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,040
You would deny Jacob home game pancakes?

1559
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:25,880
Okay, fine.

1560
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,320
What if the first time you ate them was at this restaurant?

1561
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,560
Like what is this?

1562
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,400
Where can I find these in the wild?

1563
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,720
Hey, what's, excuse me.

1564
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,080
My crepes are fucking so thick.

1565
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,400
Take them back.

1566
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,680
These are the weirdest fucking waffles I've ever had.

1567
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,360
Your toast is flying around.

1568
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,440
So.

1569
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,760
My Doritos are stale and flavorless.

1570
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,320
Sorry, Jacob, what's your question?

1571
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,600
So now that I've trained to eat two big stacks,

1572
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,160
this will be accomplished.

1573
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,600
Am I good if I bring my own photo

1574
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,840
to be presumably put above the wall of fame?

1575
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,800
Fuck yes.

1576
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,640
What?

1577
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,960
Yes.

1578
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,760
I'm glad we wasted so much time during the actual question

1579
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,680
because the answer is yes, obviously.

1580
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,760
Obviously you have to bring your own.

1581
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,920
What are you thinking, boudoir?

1582
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:13,760
I don't.

1583
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,880
Champion belt, I assume.

1584
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,880
I will say that if I had just finished two heapin' helpins.

1585
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,520
That's 10 inches by 18 inches of pancake.

1586
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,840
Then the last thing I'm going to want to do afterwards

1587
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,120
is a fucking photo shoot.

1588
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,240
This is tour manager Paul.

1589
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,640
Right here, I put up a slide that said

1590
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,640
this is 1,272.35 cubic inches of pancakes.

1591
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,480
Can I say-

1592
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1593
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,280
Paul, Paul, I love you.

1594
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,200
You're a dear friend.

1595
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,480
That can't be right.

1596
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:50,560
I will say, I will say, no timer.

1597
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,840
They're not watching the bathrooms.

1598
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,680
That's it.

1599
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,520
Oh, what?

1600
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,360
They let you poop.

1601
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,200
So you can poop whenever you want.

1602
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,040
Okay.

1603
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,800
Jake, let me say, I just want to say,

1604
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,320
thank you for representing what I think

1605
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:03,320
is maybe human beings' most enduring quality,

1606
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,120
which is once we've accomplished something,

1607
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,000
say one big stack,

1608
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,400
we must continue to challenge ourselves

1609
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,840
even if others do not.

1610
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,680
Yes.

1611
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:15,000
You finished the big stack six times.

1612
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,160
You went on the wall six times

1613
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:20,520
and you said there has to be more in life than this.

1614
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,640
You're going to finish two stacks and weep

1615
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,840
because there are no more stacks to conquer.

1616
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,160
But good news, Jake.

1617
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,840
I'm here to tell you three stacks.

1618
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:32,240
No, do two stacks and do send us a picture of that, Jake.

1619
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,080
I got to see it.

1620
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,760
Does that help?

1621
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,600
Yes, it does.

1622
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,760
The encouragement will help me join my brothers in syrup.

1623
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,600
Thank you.

1624
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,440
Yes.

1625
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,440
Give me five.

1626
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,600
Hello.

1627
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,440
Hello.

1628
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,360
Hi, brothers.

1629
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,200
Hi. Hi.

1630
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,400
For a second there, I thought the mic wasn't working.

1631
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,240
You got this.

1632
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,080
You got this.

1633
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,360
No, I was just scared.

1634
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,200
I'm Andy.

1635
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,040
Say them.

1636
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:00,880
Hi, Andy.

1637
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,720
Andy, you're great.

1638
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:02,560
I'm glad you're here.

1639
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,400
Yeah, we got this.

1640
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,240
Relax.

1641
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,080
You asked-

1642
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:05,920
Breathe through it.

1643
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,920
You're as powerful as someone who just finished two big stacks.

1644
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,520
I don't know that powerful is the adjective

1645
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,360
I would use to describe you.

1646
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,760
You're as sleepy as someone who just finished two big stacks.

1647
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,400
You're ready to hibernate through the winter.

1648
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,760
Andy asked, how do I enforce my workplace's

1649
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,760
no touching the dinosaurs rule

1650
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,880
while still letting people know that I'm cool

1651
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,200
and I would also like to touch the dinosaur.

1652
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:36,360
So give me a little context here, Andy.

1653
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,240
I work at a dentist's office.

1654
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,960
Yeah.

1655
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,560
Yeah, just a really cool shoe store, actually.

1656
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,400
Yeah.

1657
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,240
No.

1658
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,240
No, I work at a science attraction

1659
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:49,360
where we do have real original fossil dinosaurs displayed.

1660
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,200
Wow.

1661
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,040
And it's very cool.

1662
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:51,960
You get to be very close.

1663
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,080
It feels you're immersed in the science.

1664
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,360
And also the barriers are like exactly

1665
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,000
sort of at toddler forehead height.

1666
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,760
And that's kind of it.

1667
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,000
And there are a lot of children and adults

1668
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,080
who really, really want to touch the dinosaurs.

1669
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:07,880
Sure.

1670
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:08,680
Yeah.

1671
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,160
I would like to touch the dinosaurs.

1672
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,560
I would like to touch the dinosaurs.

1673
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,200
I would like my finger grease to destroy

1674
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,840
a dinosaur bone over time.

1675
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:15,960
Yeah.

1676
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,000
I mean, listen.

1677
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,120
If time and Earth couldn't do it,

1678
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:22,280
what are my Dorito fingers going to do that's so bad?

1679
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,400
Yeah.

1680
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,000
If they can't hang, don't pull them out

1681
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,320
if you don't want me to touch them.

1682
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,560
So Andy, what's the problem?

1683
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:32,640
Well, the problem is that I really, really

1684
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,800
want to touch the dinosaur.

1685
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,600
All the time.

1686
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,760
Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy,

1687
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,600
have you touched the dinosaurs?

1688
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,840
Because I noticed earlier you said a science attraction

1689
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,280
and not the name of the business because there

1690
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,520
would be a revelation you've touched the dinosaurs.

1691
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,000
Yeah.

1692
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,840
Yeah.

1693
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,160
No, Andy.

1694
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,880
Andy, have you touched the dinosaurs?

1695
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,640
Not even an accidental like, whoa.

1696
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,120
The more we talk, the less Andy has to admit their crime.

1697
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,200
OK, moving on.

1698
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,200
Andy refuses to incriminate themselves.

1699
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,480
Andy takes the fifth.

1700
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,160
But how do you let them know it's

1701
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,120
a normal and natural impulse in life

1702
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,440
to want to touch the dinosaurs?

1703
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:21,280
They're not perverted in any way.

1704
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:24,600
I really want to be like supportive but firm, you know?

1705
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,080
Yeah.

1706
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,840
And as dads, I would hope he would like help.

1707
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:30,800
OK, you're going to want to do a heavy sigh and then I get it.

1708
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,600
I get it.

1709
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,720
That is the number of times I've said

1710
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,640
to my five-year-old who is a carbon copy of myself

1711
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,680
when it comes to impulse control, I get it.

1712
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,160
Hey, buddy, I get it.

1713
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:42,720
I get it.

1714
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,160
I also sometimes want to see what sound a thing makes

1715
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,520
when I throw it at the wall.

1716
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,320
I get it.

1717
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,440
So on brand.

1718
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:56,040
Can you, Andy, can I suggest this?

1719
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:59,920
Could you have one dinosaur bone that's kind of bad?

1720
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:00,440
Yeah.

1721
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,080
And it's like a burner.

1722
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,360
Yeah, an extra one.

1723
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,640
We got three legs.

1724
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,360
And listen, you want to touch the dinosaur, I get it.

1725
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,600
Hold on, let me open my locker.

1726
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,840
I got one back there for you that you

1727
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,680
can touch all you want, no big deal.

1728
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,720
Can you memorize the speech that Sam Neill gives

1729
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,120
at the beginning of Jurassic Park

1730
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,880
where he scares the boy very badly with a velociraptor claw

1731
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,320
and just deliver that whenever a child wants to touch the bone?

1732
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:26,600
Or really runs afoul of any kind of rule?

1733
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,440
Excuse me, did you just drop that litter on the ground?

1734
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,800
Let me tell you a little bit about velociraptor.

1735
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,440
Well, that's not how the velociraptor gets you.

1736
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,040
Here, come here.

1737
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,560
I'm going to scratch your tummy with this.

1738
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,960
Andy, could you sell dinosaur bone touching gloves

1739
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,080
for $5 a pop?

1740
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,120
Ooh.

1741
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,560
On the side.

1742
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,080
How?

1743
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:43,960
That little private.

1744
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,360
This would not be an official piece of merchandise.

1745
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:49,120
This would be, yes, you would produce them from your jacket.

1746
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,880
How straight is the security here?

1747
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,320
Could you charge people to touch the bones

1748
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,080
when no one's looking?

1749
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,400
Probably for a little bit.

1750
01:09:59,400 --> 01:09:59,900
Yeah.

1751
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:00,400
OK.

1752
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,960
Maybe not all the time.

1753
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,600
Does that help, Andy?

1754
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,240
It does help.

1755
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:05,720
Thank you.

1756
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:06,200
Thank you.

1757
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:06,680
Thank you.

1758
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:07,160
Thank you.

1759
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,920
Thank you.

1760
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:09,440
OK.

1761
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,560
And thank you.

1762
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,160
And thank you.

1763
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,680
Make them go away, please.

1764
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,040
I'm so intimidated.

1765
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:14,560
Thank you.

1766
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,120
Goodbye.

1767
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:15,600
Yes.

1768
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,880
Make us more.

1769
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,920
Make them less.

1770
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,240
Yes.

1771
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,840
Hey, you all have been outrageously fun.

1772
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,640
Thank you so much.

1773
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,440
Yes, thank you all.

1774
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:29,160
We have done so much stupid bullshit tonight.

1775
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,000
And you all have been there for all of it.

1776
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,040
And I really, really appreciate it.

1777
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:32,680
Even Taylor.

1778
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,520
And Taylor didn't know what was happening.

1779
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,760
Yeah, even Taylor was into it.

1780
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:37,920
But you all have buoyed us.

1781
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,560
You lift me up so I can climb on mountains.

1782
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,640
Thank you.

1783
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,360
We want to say thank you to you.

1784
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,600
Thank you to the beautiful Orpheum Theater.

1785
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,560
It feels like we tricked our way into here,

1786
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:51,880
which we kind of did.

1787
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,360
Sorry you guys didn't get to see Jim Gaffigan tonight.

1788
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,880
I know you were expecting it.

1789
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,800
So sorry.

1790
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:01,160
We want to say thank you to Paul for helping us run the show.

1791
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,200
Thank you to Amanda.

1792
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,880
And thank you to Rachel for helping to run the show

1793
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,880
and doing the recordings and all of that stuff.

1794
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,480
Thank you to our dad, Clint.

1795
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,000
Thank you, Clint.

1796
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,280
Buy his book.

1797
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,680
Thank you to our families for supporting us here.

1798
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,240
And let me see, anything else?

1799
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:22,320
Thanks to Montaigne for these four theme songs.

1800
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,360
My life is better with you.

1801
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,040
Sidney McElroy is not with us.

1802
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,480
Dr. Sidney McElroy is not with us.

1803
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:34,120
But I really appreciate her just being her, I guess.

1804
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:38,200
Now, we don't do a final Yahoo anymore, as you know.

1805
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,580
And it's brought a really fun energy

1806
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:43,560
because we get to ask you, our beloved listeners,

1807
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,680
what celebrity impression you'd love to hear

1808
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,720
a Griffin McElroy attempt.

1809
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,600
OK, so on upcoming episodes, you can look forward

1810
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:54,520
to Nicolas Cage and Gilbert Godfrey.

1811
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,840
So what celebrity impression would you like to hear?

1812
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,720
First five rows.

1813
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,520
Oh, wait, hold on.

1814
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,800
First five rows, so it doesn't just become.

1815
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,300
Oh, do you have a walk-in, Griff?

1816
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,040
A walk-in?

1817
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:06,600
Yeah.

1818
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,520
Yeah, I guess.

1819
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:17,120
Uh, uh, what kind of shit?

1820
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:23,880
I like, I like to eat the, I like to eat the spaghetti.

1821
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,240
That sucks shit.

1822
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,400
My name is Justin McElroy.

1823
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,880
I'm Travis McElroy.

1824
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,640
I don't deserve to say my name.

1825
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,080
It's remember, remember, remember me.

1826
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,720
Gives your dad's square on the lips.

1827
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:40,200
I'm just bringing it in, everyone.

1828
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:43,680
It's better with you.

1829
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:49,160
My life, ah, it's better, it's better with you.

1830
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,160
It's better with you.

1831
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:55,640
My life, ah, it's better, it's better with you.

1832
01:12:55,640 --> 01:13:01,620
Because it's true, ah, it's better, it's better with you.

1833
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:10,600
My life, ah, it's better with you.
