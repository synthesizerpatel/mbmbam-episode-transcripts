1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,080
Hi everybody, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, the advice show for the modern era. I'm

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,400
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,240
I'm your sweet, sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,400
Now baby brother, you're sitting next to me.

9
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,240
That's it. We're just sitting next to each other. I'm looking at you. I feel you.

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,880
I'm looking at you drink this devastating cocktail I watched you make in the kitchen for yourself.

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,640
Justin, that's the grossest thing I've maybe ever seen anybody put into a cup.

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,040
It's mainly milk and also coffee.

13
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,720
The sign of a great cocktail is it's mostly milk.

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,520
It's mostly milk and coffee and liquor. It's called... How's my bathroom today?

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,000
It's called Minority Bathroom Report.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,880
It's called I just downloaded that new Jurassic World game on my iPhone. I really want to get deep.

17
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,560
Here comes a red ball from the precogs. It says you're going to kill your bath.

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,560
You're in town for your high school reunion, Griffin, your 10-year reunion.

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,080
My 10th, yeah, my decade.

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,080
That's the most important one, as we all know.

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,520
Here is the question, I think, on everybody's mind.

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,160
Were the people there at the reunion impressed enough

23
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,680
by the fact that you had a popular podcast?

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,200
Oh, man, let me tell you. No, not really.

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,000
Not really.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,800
I mean, what's enough? What would it be? What would be... Are we looking for...

27
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,240
I'm looking for like a Rudy, put you on your shoulder, carry you...

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,680
I was not lifted. I was not... I was not carried. I was not heralded.

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,440
My buddy, Alex, tried to get the hype going. He tried to get that train a-rollin'.

30
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,840
He was like, this dude had a day named after him last year.

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,600
I was like, well, that's not entirely accurate. It was...

32
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,040
Did you buy a round for the bar and say, don't worry, this one's on Totino's?

33
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,240
No, my friend, my old buddy, Derek, bought a round for the bar.

34
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,680
And then he got concerned that not everybody was cashing in on his offer,

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,760
which I get. If you go out and say, hey, everyone, this next one's on me.

36
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,400
And then there are people who don't get one on you.

37
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,840
Well, some of those people, the big worry is that they're planning on saving it.

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,920
They'll come back to the bar in a few weeks and say, I think I should have a one that Derek...

39
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,360
I believe Derek has an IOU for a one on him.

40
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,280
I feel the exact opposite of how I imagine Derek must have felt.

41
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,280
If I said a round on the bar on me and everyone went, oh, that's all right,

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,520
I would be so relieved because I would have gotten them with the gesture, but like...

43
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,200
I'd like to say that when I'm the only one in the bar.

44
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,960
Yeah, but then it's like, ha ha ha ha, and everybody laughs,

45
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,360
but it's just me laughing, and then I get a little sad.

46
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,920
Yeah.

47
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,520
What about this move?

48
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,560
Next one that the next person orders is on me, and then you just watch them fight for your love.

49
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,560
The 11th caller gets a free drink, and here's my phone number.

50
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,240
Everybody just start calling me and friend me on Facebook.

51
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,400
I was hoping for like a 10-year review from you guys of how I've been doing

52
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,240
since 2005 when I graduated high school.

53
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,680
Well, we hit the podcast.

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,080
We did the podcast, and that's been really good.

55
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,120
You got married, right?

56
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,400
Right.

57
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,120
I got married.

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,840
It doesn't just have to be life events.

59
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,320
Just how has my performance been?

60
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,520
How am I...

61
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,800
What about my physique?

62
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,920
I felt different.

63
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,600
Has my physique changed since 2005?

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,880
I felt that around year five, it really started to kind of wane a little bit.

65
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,560
Yeah, he had peaked.

66
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,680
Wait, which element of my persona are you even talking about?

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,480
Your performance.

68
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,760
Just like your overall...

69
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,960
I can't lift as much weight over my head.

70
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,600
Your lifting, your health, your vim, your vigor.

71
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
All my stats, all my statistics.

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,720
I mean, you haven't been getting as many RBIs.

73
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,240
Your fielding is weak.

74
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,600
Dad used to call those ribbies, and I thought it was just like pretty standard.

75
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,720
So I had a few incidents in my mid-20s where I'd be at a bar before watching baseball,

76
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,760
and I would say like, hey, nice RB or something.

77
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,600
It's weird to find out that there was something about sports that you didn't know, Justin.

78
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,400
Yeah, it's weird.

79
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,960
I'm certainly not scoring as many home runs as I once did, or home alone as I call them.

80
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Can I tell you guys in the last decade how many home alone's I've pulled down?

81
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,560
None of them.

82
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,920
This is a comedy advice show where we...

83
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,320
I want you to fucking lay it on me.

84
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,920
I'm not going to get any better if you guys don't tell me what needs improvement.

85
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,280
I want you to beat me into the ground or else I'll never become the world's greatest drummer

86
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,120
or home run getter or whatever I try.

87
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,200
Oh, you want me to whiplash you?

88
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,400
I want you to whiplash me.

89
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,120
No, no, that's not my beat.

90
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,320
That's not my beat, Griffin.

91
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,040
You're not supposed to say mean things about me while I do drums.

92
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,840
You smell like butts, and you're not doing a great job.

93
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,800
Tear my shit apart.

94
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,400
I'm not going to get...

95
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,480
When I'm 38 years old, I don't want to be the same as I am right now,

96
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
but that is sort of the direction that you're pushing me.

97
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,360
Good job, Griffin.

98
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,920
Stay the same.

99
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,040
You are a 10 out of 10.

100
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,760
I wouldn't change a thing.

101
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,560
Can I say that though?

102
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,120
Like if you could stay the same, like if you could aim for that in 10 years,

103
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,560
I think you will be far ahead of the curve.

104
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,880
Yeah, I mean, maintaining is...

105
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,480
Like if you could just maintain.

106
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,720
I just want to increase my jump height.

107
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,080
If I'm the same, but I can increase my vertical leap by seven inches.

108
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,040
That's going to be great because you're going to spend the entire reunion

109
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,480
trying to find a reason to jump super high.

110
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,600
Not just to jump super high, but to jump super high in a context in which

111
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,880
people would need to measure the inches and compare them.

112
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,440
And compare it.

113
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,040
See, that's one problem is I didn't jump high last night.

114
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,200
Here's what you need to do right now on the Facebook page of your reunion.

115
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,000
You need to say, in case anybody missed it, I did clock in at six vertical inches.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,320
People are posting pictures already in that Facebook group.

117
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,680
I need to hop in and be like, oh, this was right before I jumped 36 inches.

118
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,200
No, you've got to improve.

119
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,040
You don't want to be 36 inches right now.

120
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,400
You want to have good growth.

121
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,200
How every day post like a three second video of you jumping next to a ruler

122
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,720
and just like every day chart like how much you go up.

123
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,920
Or maybe like there's a day where it's like, oh, that was like a half inch down.

124
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,640
What happened?

125
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,720
And like you ate a big burrito and we can like chart it over the next 10 years.

126
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,200
Then we'll end up being 3650.

127
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,280
You are you are like treacherously close to up worthy territory right now.

128
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,520
This man measured his vertical leap every day for 10 years.

129
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,120
And you won't believe what happens next.

130
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,680
Nothing.

131
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,160
Nothing.

132
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
It's the same 36 inches.

133
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,840
That doesn't seem like that's three feet.

134
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,520
That doesn't seem like very.

135
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,160
Is that good?

136
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,120
That would actually be insane.

137
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,840
You can delete.

138
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,360
Stop.

139
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,880
Are you telling me if you could leap three feet straight up on the ground,

140
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,240
you wouldn't be impressed.

141
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,800
OK, hold on.

142
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,480
I want to get some sort of ballpark here.

143
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,520
Oh, my legs.

144
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:35,760
Stop.

145
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,640
My baby's sleeping.

146
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,680
Don't do this anymore.

147
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,200
Let's read the first question.

148
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,880
We don't need another 259.

149
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,680
OK, it looked like about 18 inches.

150
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,680
I just got to double that.

151
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,000
Should we get into the advice?

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,200
Yeah, my birthday is coming up and I'm having a dope party.

153
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,800
Oh, call the cops.

154
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,880
Casually seeing a couple of dudes right now.

155
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,200
And I'm pretty sure they all know of this impending natal anniversary.

156
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,840
But I'm not sure who, if any of them to invite.

157
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,640
What do I do?

158
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,840
Too many suitors in there.

159
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,080
I kind of feel like you would invite none of them because I feel like if you're planning

160
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,680
a party like you already are going to have so much to think about.

161
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,280
You don't want like a new romance to sort of distract you from just sort of enjoying

162
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
the party with people you're super comfortable with.

163
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,880
Now, Justin, may I counterpoint?

164
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,960
You invite all of you first.

165
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,280
And now this way, what you've done is you've guaranteed an interesting evening.

166
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,080
Kind of your Flintstones, like you want to go to the bowling league, but you also have

167
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,200
Pebble's birthday.

168
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,680
OK, but Fred didn't do that shit to make it sexy.

169
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,280
Like he didn't try and sex his life out.

170
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,400
How do you know that, Griffin?

171
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,360
That was out of necessity.

172
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,440
His and Barney's relationship had grown a bit stale and they wanted to like have adventurous

173
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,160
friendships.

174
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,600
I want to add a little bit of flavor to this equation.

175
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,240
Hey, Fred, don't you think things are getting a little stale?

176
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,960
Get your dick out.

177
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,360
When was the last time you fought me for the pebbles?

178
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,640
For the fruity pebbles?

179
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,200
Here's the question.

180
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,080
It's weird.

181
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,120
Isn't it weird?

182
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,240
Wait, hold on.

183
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,360
Isn't it weird that Bar- I've never thought of it.

184
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,200
Barney was trying to steal a cereal from Fred named after his daughter.

185
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,920
I'm going to gobble your pebbles.

186
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,480
Stop it.

187
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,280
What are you talking about?

188
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,480
You're going to gobble my pebbles.

189
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,560
I want a spoonful of pebbles.

190
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,160
Get out of here, you fucking weirdo.

191
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,720
I want to take a big bite of Bam Bam.

192
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,400
Yeah, how's that?

193
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,280
How's that feel?

194
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,320
How's that feel to you?

195
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,440
Bam Bam had a cereal.

196
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,600
Things like peanut butter bowl or something.

197
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,520
I'd love to have one night with Wilma.

198
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,080
For one million clams.

199
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,800
One night with Wilma is a lot of-

200
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
General Mills made a series called One Night with Wilma.

201
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,400
We made a sex tape with a particularly loquacious Velociraptor.

202
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
He watched us and then we recorded it.

203
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,120
It's a living.

204
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,920
He had a pterodactyl make an audio recording.

205
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,720
It's a living.

206
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,320
Do all the fellows, along with knowing about your birthday,

207
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,480
do they know that you're seeing multiple dudes or are you doing this on the DL?

208
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,120
If they were all at the party together, would they be like,

209
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,040
why are you smooching on Steve?

210
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,840
It doesn't matter if they're doing it on the HL or on the DL Hugely.

211
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,200
If it's casual, it doesn't sound like they give a shit.

212
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,400
Like they mean, hey, I'm Bryce.

213
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,360
Hey, I'm Todd.

214
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,600
I'm with Roseanne.

215
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,160
Yeah, me too.

216
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,120
I'm with Roseanne.

217
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,600
Cool.

218
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,360
It's casual.

219
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,320
I watch Roseanne.

220
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,680
Yeah, I also watch Roseanne.

221
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,640
I also watch Roseanne.

222
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,360
You suck.

223
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,000
You suck.

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,560
You suck.

225
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,120
You suck.

226
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,040
I also watch Roseanne. You son of a bitch.

227
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,000
That's my thing.

228
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,960
Now we're going to fight.

229
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

230
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,120
What if the party ends with like, listen, me and Bryson got to talking

231
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,440
and we're going to give you a birthday present to remember.

232
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,120
We're all going to watch Roseanne together.

233
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,880
Well, we're going to like just both pleasure you all night long.

234
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,240
Think about that.

235
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,280
Thanks for saving this energy until I was in the room with you.

236
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,120
Yeah, but think about it.

237
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,760
Yeah, no, I'm-

238
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,280
No, I think this is fine playback considering on another podcast we record,

239
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,880
I had to listen to our father two inches from my face.

240
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,360
Yeah.

241
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,560
Fucking R. Kelly dirty talk some plants.

242
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,120
Yeah.

243
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,320
I think this is fair playback.

244
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,560
Adventures on episode 18.

245
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,680
What if they decide, what if they fulfill your fantasy of like they,

246
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,400
one of them dresses like Jacob and one of them dresses like Edward

247
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,920
and they fight over your loves.

248
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,680
A birthday fantasy just for you.

249
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,160
Or one of them dresses like Jacob and the other one dresses like

250
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,160
the other god-like character from Lost and they compete for your soul.

251
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,160
One of them dresses like Jacob Marley and the other one dresses like Scrooge.

252
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,040
Fantasy coming to life.

253
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,680
If you can think of other Jacobs, send us a text.

254
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,800
Text us right now.

255
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,880
Jacob to 414141.

256
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,360
One of you is Jacob Marley, one of you is Ziggy Marley.

257
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,440
And one of you is Dweezil Zappa, but you actually are Dweezil Zappa.

258
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,800
This question is from Dweezil Zappa.

259
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,920
I'm seeing a couple of guys and also Dweezil Zappa.

260
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,600
And it's weird, like Dweezil knows about it, but the other two don't know about Dweezil.

261
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,360
And I've got a sack of flour and a chicken and a wolf.

262
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,360
I need to get all six of them across the river, but I've only got one raft.

263
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,400
And Dweezil Zappa is going to eat all the flour if I leave him alone with it.

264
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,320
But the chicken will eat Dweezil Zappa.

265
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Also Dweezil Zappa won't get on the raft.

266
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,920
So that seems like, that seems like it's just sort of going to screw them over.

267
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
Dweezil Zappa just like fool me once.

268
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,160
No.

269
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,040
He won't get on the raft.

270
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,480
I've been hurt on rafts before.

271
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,640
Not falling for another raft scheme.

272
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,760
How about a yahoo?

273
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,000
Yep.

274
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,920
This yahoo is sent in by Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

275
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,720
It's by yahoo answers user Christina R93, who asks,

276
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,680
if people are having sex during an earthquake, do they still have to move?

277
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,320
My friends and I were joking around and this question popped up.

278
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,240
There is no wrong or right answer.

279
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,800
There is.

280
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,160
I don't know why you got so zen like about it so quickly.

281
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,520
Just to see what kind of answers there are.

282
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,200
Opinions are greatly encouraged.

283
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,960
Well, opinions are basically probably always.

284
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,200
Opinions as opposed to scientific like study theories.

285
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,400
Yeah.

286
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,800
You got a control group with placebo effect.

287
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,960
You just thought there was an earthquake, but you were fucking.

288
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,400
So let me, this might get a little blue.

289
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,280
This is the picture that they're painting, right?

290
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,320
There's two people.

291
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,000
They begin lovemaking and then an earthquake starts and then they go.

292
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,520
Whew.

293
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,320
Thank God.

294
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:42,160
And then just relax every muscle simultaneously and let the earth do the work.

295
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,080
That's actually the safest thing to do in the middle of an earthquake.

296
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,280
Just relax all your muscles.

297
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:56,320
And let go jelly bones and just let your member jiggle and wiggle and rigor,

298
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,920
wriggle and wriggle and wiggle and rigor.

299
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,440
Just let your bed just go to town all on their own.

300
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:03,840
You know what?

301
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,040
You've had a hard day.

302
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,880
You put in the work down the office.

303
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,640
Now it's time for the earth to make your bits move so that you don't have to.

304
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,760
What if you instantly fetishize it and then it ruins your love life because

305
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,760
it's unpredictable when you'll be able to climax.

306
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,480
All right.

307
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,120
That was holy, holy unpleasant for me.

308
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,440
Your foot has got to get back into the DMZ.

309
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,080
I'm sitting in the fucking splash zone of justice.

310
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,280
You need to move your foot.

311
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,120
I've touched it twice now and I hate, I hate, we started,

312
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,880
I tell people we started doing this podcast because we weren't communicating

313
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,320
with each other enough and I missed you guys.

314
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,840
That's 100% true.

315
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,040
I hate doing this.

316
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,000
It's the same room as you.

317
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,200
It is miserable.

318
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,880
I mean, when Griffin and I started recording, we still recorded from our separate bedrooms.

319
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
We were in the same apartment, two rooms apart.

320
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,560
We have to go into some places that require me to be rather free with my own sort of

321
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,200
psyche and sexuality, just like removing all the barriers.

322
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,240
Even as I'm saying that sentence, you're looking at me as I'm saying,

323
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,520
just stare straight ahead.

324
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,400
That would be excellent.

325
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,640
I'm just going to look at this grub hoe ad you had pulled up.

326
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,480
I'm just going to stare a hole through that.

327
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Um, there are people, there are probably people who are tectonic sexual, right?

328
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,720
Do you think after that New Yorker piece came out, they were like,

329
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,920
we have to get up in the Pacific Northwest and get, just stay hard 24 seven,

330
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,560
I guess, just waiting for the big one.

331
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,440
Oh man.

332
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,120
Cause it's going to be, according to that article, it's going to be like three uninterrupted minutes.

333
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,680
That's going to feel so good.

334
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,920
Oh, you guys, this explains why I win.

335
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,680
I went to see San Andreas.

336
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,960
There was like one other person in there who just kept winking at me.

337
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,320
I get it.

338
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,960
That was The Rock.

339
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,000
That was, that was Dwayne.

340
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
That was The Rock, the Dwayne Johnson.

341
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,440
Known tectosexual.

342
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,560
He was saying, thanks.

343
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,360
Yeah, I made it.

344
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,640
I made this one for free.

345
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,400
This one was for Dwayne.

346
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,680
What if The Rock did show up at screenings of his movies that he just went from person to person

347
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,440
like, excuse me, excuse me.

348
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,400
It's me, The Rock.

349
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,080
Um, how are you enjoying the picture?

350
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,440
Is there anything I can improve on next time?

351
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:11,760
Thanks.

352
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,360
Here's a, here's a coupon for Wendy's.

353
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,040
Thanks for taking this brief survey.

354
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
I got this coupon the last time I went.

355
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,760
I'm never going to use it.

356
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,120
The Rock is Dave Thomas.

357
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,680
Did you know that?

358
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:23,920
Yeah.

359
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,320
I read about it on the blogs.

360
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,920
He looks really good.

361
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,600
I recently went to a wedding in which I bought a few gifts off the registry for the soon-to-be

362
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,800
married couple, as you do.

363
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,120
Oh, it's a quick sidebar.

364
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,320
Do you guys ever have a set amount in mind that you want to spend on a gift registry?

365
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,720
And the things that are about that price are already taken.

366
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,640
So you end up buying like five really terrible things just to get to that dollar amount.

367
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,880
I got you some napkins and some napkins.

368
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,680
There's four forks you wanted and these cups.

369
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,360
I got you one piece of the crystalware set.

370
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,120
Hopefully somebody else is going to swoop in there.

371
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,680
I hope it.

372
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,320
Anyway, the issue being here is that within three months they'd already filed for divorce

373
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,200
and were officially divorced shortly thereafter.

374
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,840
Is there a time limit or protocol for returning gifts?

375
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,480
Wait, what?

376
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,040
I don't believe that a marriage doesn't extend beyond six months or possibly should be able

377
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,000
to keep the thousands in cash and gifts they receive.

378
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,400
That's from malevolent matrimony in Milwaukee.

379
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,440
What the fuck are you talking about?

380
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,360
You know that Seinfeld's off the air, right?

381
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,640
You don't have to pitch episodes.

382
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,160
What are you talking about?

383
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,800
Give me my stemware back.

384
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,920
What are you talking about?

385
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,800
I have the answer.

386
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,120
There's no answer required.

387
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,800
This isn't a thing.

388
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,160
I've got the answer, Griffin.

389
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,120
I've got the answer.

390
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,160
Please let me give the answer.

391
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,960
Please.

392
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,520
Yeah, please.

393
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,240
I want it now.

394
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,080
The answer is the same amount of time that the government requires that a couple stay

395
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,000
married in green card cases.

396
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,120
I don't know how long that is, mind you.

397
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,800
Get federal on this.

398
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,240
You don't know how long it is.

399
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,200
But however long.

400
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,520
Somebody do a quick doodle.

401
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,240
As many times as you've watched the film Green Card?

402
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,120
As many times as you spent your life remembering the episodes of Wings in which Helen married

403
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,440
Antonio Scarpacci for his green card and then they eventually got divorced.

404
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,480
But oh, no, he didn't actually turn in the paperwork.

405
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,960
So then she wasn't able to marry Timothy Daly's character whose name was.

406
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,480
You remembered so much about you remembered so much about the Wings story arc, but not

407
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,400
the name of one of the main characters.

408
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,440
What's his name?

409
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,120
I think his name was Pilotson.

410
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,440
Brian was his brother.

411
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,360
I think it was Mark Pilotson.

412
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,080
I remember Roy, I remember Roy.

413
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,640
How do I not remember Tim Daly's character?

414
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,000
Nobody's going to remember this story arc of my brother, my brother and me, because

415
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,680
they're going to stop listening, thinking about remembering and talking about the podcast

416
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,080
after this.

417
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,640
I remember Helen.

418
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,720
Helen had a sister who was Amy Yazbeck.

419
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,160
OK, you guys check back in with me.

420
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,400
Man, I had this whole thing.

421
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Lied about Wings.

422
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,240
No, about Green Card, and I was going to say, like, you always talk about what a big

423
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,640
Def R.

424
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,760
Dude you are and what a big fan of his.

425
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
And then I didn't get to say it because you are this stupid.

426
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,160
Oh, but wait.

427
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,720
Oh, but wait.

428
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,480
You just did.

429
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,160
I just got it in, I guess.

430
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,360
If Travis wants to.

431
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,400
Anybody else have any things that they wanted to say during the episode, but like somebody

432
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,920
else cut them off and then just like.

433
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,000
But I'm really enjoying Travis's new bit, shitty Wikipedia.

434
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,360
Tim Daly played, I don't know, whatever, something.

435
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,800
Oh, I'm OK.

436
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,440
Like, I'm staring at Tim D.B. page.

437
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,920
OK, we're done with the episode.

438
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,280
This Yahoo answer that I'm going to read to you now is sent in by Drew Davenport.

439
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,840
Thank you.

440
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Ya Drew Drew at Drew Davenport.

441
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,040
Joe is his name.

442
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,600
Thank you.

443
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,080
Thank you.

444
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,720
Slam dunk.

445
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,320
Three pointer from the half court line.

446
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,760
He's a large man.

447
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,240
All right.

448
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,680
What is at the bottom of my glass?

449
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,720
Can you give me that Sharpie so I can stir this up a little bit?

450
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,880
Is this what it's like for you when, like, nobody else is?

451
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,160
Or is this the you you are?

452
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
It's a whole carnival, man.

453
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,280
You're drinking a milk.

454
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,080
You're drinking a tall glass of milk booze and you're still in that beach life.

455
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,160
Oh, he just sucked that.

456
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,240
He just sucked the booze off the Sharpie.

457
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,240
He just put the Sharpie in his mouth and got the five characters from Cheers.

458
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,400
Norm, Cliff, Frazier, Lilith and Rebecca made appearances on Wings, but no characters from

459
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,080
Wings crossed over to any Cheers episodes, though Thomas Hayden Church, who played Lowell,

460
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,640
played an unrelated character on a Cheers episode prior to being cast on Wings.

461
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,880
All of this is getting cut out of the show.

462
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,760
Let me please, please, let's ask another question, please.

463
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,600
This Yahoo Answers is by Yahoo Answer user, Jackie, who asks,

464
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,200
I have only been a massage therapist.

465
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,840
What are you doing?

466
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,720
I'm reading the Yahoo.

467
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,440
Are you drunk?

468
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,160
No, are you?

469
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,000
All right.

470
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,440
Let's get this thing back on track, guys.

471
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,440
This Yahoo Answers by Yahoo Answers user, Jackie, who asks,

472
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,600
Puzzle of the Muscles?

473
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,800
Do you want to read it?

474
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,280
What?

475
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,320
Do you want to read it?

476
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,360
No, I don't want to read it.

477
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,120
Why do you think I want to read it?

478
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,160
Because you tried to.

479
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,480
Well, I just got confused about what we were doing.

480
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,800
I don't usually see them in front of me.

481
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,880
If I see a question, I just read it.

482
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,760
You just let it rip.

483
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,040
Travis.

484
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,600
Yes?

485
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,800
Do you remember the theme song to Wings?

486
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:16,480
I think it was like, boo-doo-boo, wings, wings, boo-doo-doo-doo, wings, wings, boo-doo-doo-doo,

487
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,680
wings, wings, boo-doo-doo-doo.

488
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:23,040
Wings, wings, boo-doo-doo-doo, wings, wings, boo-doo-doo-doo-doo, wings, wings, boo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

489
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,880
Brothers, brothers, flying planes, doodly-doodly-do.

490
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,200
I think there's a murder mystery episode this one time.

491
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,240
Tony Shalhoub went on to do the show Monk.

492
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,400
If I remember correctly, I don't have the lyrics in front of me.

493
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:48,480
Wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings.

494
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,800
Planes going to China, never flew there before, who cares?

495
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,280
Oh, I don't know what to do with these toss-outs, I've scrambled wings.

496
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,840
Okay, sorry.

497
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,480
So.

498
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:02,800
Sorry.

499
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:11,440
All right. It actually went... Wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings.

500
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,520
Wings, wings, wings, wings.

501
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,400
Wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings.

502
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:25,360
Aaaaaah glorious.

503
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,320
So, this Yadru was sent in by,

504
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,680
it was asked by Jackie, who asks,

505
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,700
"'Puzzle of the muscles?'

506
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,080
I have only been a massage therapist for five months

507
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,280
and have been receiving guidance

508
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,200
from the lead therapist at my work.

509
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,080
She says that I should look over the muscles

510
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,080
of the body again to see how they run.

511
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,400
I joked saying that I should just make

512
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,320
a puzzle of the muscles.

513
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,880
Well, she really liked that idea

514
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,000
and now wants to see me make one.

515
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,920
How would I make a puzzle of the muscles?

516
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,740
Thanks.

517
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,360
You're gonna need to collect some muscles.

518
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,200
It's gonna be the tricky part.

519
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,160
That's gonna be number one.

520
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,240
It's gonna be getting your hands on some legal muscles.

521
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,920
Would you do a three-dimensional puzzle

522
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,160
or is it gonna be two-dimensional, just like for babies?

523
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,680
If you're using human muscle mass,

524
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,440
it's gonna be in three dimensions.

525
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,040
Here's the thing, you could do like a foam,

526
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,040
like a human analog, you know, Mythbusters-style thing,

527
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,800
but I feel like the consistency difference

528
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,640
of not actual flesh muscles would,

529
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,840
nobody's coming back to do it a second time.

530
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
You know what I mean?

531
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,080
Griff, your read on this is confusing to me.

532
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,760
I don't think this massage therapist guru

533
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,520
was instructing this person to create

534
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,160
a Hannibal-esque sculpture made of human muscles

535
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,280
that could be disassembled and reassembled.

536
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,120
You're now who's misunderstanding.

537
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,820
You're the misunderstand-er, sir,

538
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,320
because it's not gonna be a statue.

539
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,780
It's gotta be interactive.

540
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,880
There's gotta be an interactive sort of gameplay element

541
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,360
to it, because it's a puzzle,

542
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,160
and they want you to solve it.

543
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,620
It needs to be vaguely human,

544
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,600
but you have to work this thing out for yourself.

545
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,480
Maybe there's a word search in there somewhere.

546
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,320
Ooh, a jumble, a jumble of muscles.

547
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,640
A jumble of meat, but there's somewhere in there

548
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,560
is the word that's gonna unlock the triptych.

549
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,200
And Justin, there's a precedent for this.

550
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,880
You went to it, I think.

551
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,120
What was that museum exhibit with all the skin bodies?

552
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,840
It was bodies, yeah.

553
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,120
It's just like that, except interactive for kids.

554
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,340
You were not encouraged to disassemble

555
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,040
and reassemble those, that's ghoul.

556
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,340
Well, not encouraged, but they also slip them a fiver,

557
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,180
and you can do whatever you want.

558
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,400
No, I mean, you were actively discouraged

559
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,920
from disassembling and reassembling the muscles.

560
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,560
There's a big person that stands by each exhibit

561
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,120
to keep people from touching them,

562
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,040
to keep people from reassembling them into,

563
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,880
I don't know, a double man.

564
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,720
And they didn't have any kind of take-home version, or?

565
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,880
Most museums don't actually have a take-home version.

566
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,280
They do, no, but they have,

567
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,540
like you go in the gift shop and it's like,

568
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,520
here's a tiny Mona Lisa, here's a little David.

569
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,880
I mean, they sold Operation,

570
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,000
but I don't think that's the same thing.

571
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,480
Well, it's a Stark.

572
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,320
Thanks.

573
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,000
Let's do a different Yahoo, something with some more meat.

574
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,440
But I made that good joke.

575
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,700
This Yahoo is sent in by Ira Ray.

576
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,780
Are you Ira Ray?

577
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,480
Who wants to know?

578
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,280
Thank you, Ira Ray, it's by Yahoo Answers user.

579
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,880
Mysterious Griffin, but that's with YPH,

580
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,720
so it's not my brand.

581
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,540
Mysterious Griffin asks, homemade, in quotes,

582
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,440
homemade ways to replicate the look of a butt bra?

583
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,280
Wait, what?

584
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,220
I'm not talking about exercise, but about ways to dress.

585
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,000
I've seen butt bras online,

586
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,480
but these are expensive.

587
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,640
Are there any homemade ways

588
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,320
to replicate the look of a butt bra?

589
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,600
Update, I should have been more clear.

590
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,000
I feel like you're pretty explicit.

591
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,640
A butt bra lifts the buttocks.

592
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,620
It does not use padding at all.

593
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,840
I am not interested in padding, just lifting.

594
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,360
I would think padding would be so much easier.

595
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,200
Way easier.

596
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,440
Like way wicked easy.

597
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,040
Trying to like reshape,

598
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,760
like someone making a man-made lake,

599
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,500
trying to reshape the waters of your buttocks

600
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,320
into some sort of fashionable, fashionable visage.

601
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,640
May I be vulnerable for a moment?

602
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,440
I feel like you've been extremely vulnerable

603
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,760
this whole episode.

604
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,940
Thank you, Griffin.

605
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,520
I've seen, you're a raw wound.

606
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,440
How is a butt bra with no padding

607
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,320
that just lifts,

608
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,320
how is it different from like tight underpants?

609
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,560
Because it lifts and separates.

610
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:53,560
But is it like suspenders attached to underpants?

611
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,320
Like how are you getting the lifting action?

612
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,200
I'm assuming it's like a hammock.

613
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,740
I would imagine it's constructed like a hammock

614
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,880
with like, and it swoops over your shoulders

615
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,960
and around your neck,

616
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,240
sort of like you're hauling,

617
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,740
like a villager hauling water from the well.

618
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,840
It's like that same sort of contraption,

619
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,160
like a leather strap.

620
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,000
A front to back saddlebag.

621
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,360
Right, exactly, exactly.

622
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,880
Well, how do you recreate that without this?

623
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,720
How do you recreate that?

624
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,680
Because they're very,

625
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,800
they're imaginary and they're very expensive.

626
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,640
Maybe a belt wrapped around your neck.

627
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,960
Okay, so I just,

628
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
one problem that I've noticed with your plan so far.

629
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,120
Okay.

630
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,680
Is that's not safe.

631
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,500
It's not safe.

632
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,560
Well, it depends on your butt size.

633
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,720
If your butt's very heavy in a fashion

634
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,940
that's gonna make it choking sort of hazard,

635
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,840
you don't wanna do that.

636
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,680
How about a bungee cord with fish hooks on either end?

637
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,520
Oh my God.

638
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,360
And you're gonna get-

639
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,040
Jesus, saw five.

640
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,400
No, I'm just saying like you get down the bottom.

641
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,720
Okay, well maybe instead of fish hooks,

642
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,560
just like a really strong duct tape.

643
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,040
Is that better?

644
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,440
A little bit, but it's still not good.

645
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,320
Can you get little cross,

646
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,520
like a cross beam that goes from your thigh

647
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,840
that just sort of holds your butt up,

648
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
but then no through the pants.

649
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,360
It would look like you would have,

650
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,000
like an acute triangle in there.

651
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,840
You're gonna need a flying buttress.

652
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,160
Like a nice curve, hold that butt up.

653
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,000
And pun intended.

654
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,920
Was it?

655
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,800
Yep.

656
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,640
What about a-

657
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,040
I didn't emphasize it enough though.

658
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,960
Can I try it again?

659
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,800
A flying buttress.

660
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,640
Ah!

661
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,480
Oh no.

662
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,480
Um, can you get a sort of page or servant boy

663
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,960
to just sort of hold it up for you

664
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,260
that you walk around sort of like he's carrying your train.

665
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,100
I like that.

666
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,940
Is that-

667
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,560
You're gonna need two,

668
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,700
because what you're gonna need is like a two by four.

669
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,520
I don't think a small boy would be appropriate

670
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,400
because you're getting into some legal issues there.

671
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,240
Yeah.

672
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,200
I think you gotta get an Ewok

673
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,240
because they're exactly the right size.

674
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,080
You just slap your dress over the Ewok in the back

675
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,320
and have the Ewok go around like yub, yub,

676
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,600
just carrying your butt around.

677
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,840
Yep, Jubjub, you know the rules.

678
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,920
I'm trying to twerk over here.

679
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,160
So do the thing you do.

680
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,640
Do the thing you do to make me twerk artificially, Jubjub.

681
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,920
If you paid a, okay,

682
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,880
if you paid an Ewok in walnuts and stuff

683
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,720
to carry your butt around,

684
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,240
is there any chance he makes it through the entire night

685
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,000
without trying to stick his finger in your butt?

686
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,280
Like guarantee he tries to-

687
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,120
What the fuck?

688
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,940
Wait.

689
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,780
I'm just thinking about what I know of Ewoks.

690
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,680
They're mischievous.

691
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,520
Hold on.

692
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,600
That's what you know of Ewoks?

693
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,240
Like when they get a little bit frustrated

694
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,320
because they're not getting enough

695
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,160
like acorns and berries or whatever?

696
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,000
They're from the forest,

697
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,520
they're from the forest moon of Endor.

698
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,080
They eat walnuts and berries

699
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,080
and they love to finger blast you in the background.

700
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,720
Here's the problem though.

701
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,040
Do you give them all the acorns up front?

702
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,080
Do you give them to be in the light?

703
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,360
He blows his way through them.

704
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,560
It depends on what you want.

705
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,760
Because if you want an Ewok to turn you into a meaty puppet,

706
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,480
if you want an Ewok to turn you into a puzzle of muscles,

707
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,840
then you do give them all up front.

708
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,200
And he's like, well, I got paid.

709
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,360
So I can, now this is wicked.

710
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,200
Now this is wicked opportunity.

711
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,520
You gotta give them half up front and half at the end.

712
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,680
Like you're higher to hit man.

713
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,760
Yeah.

714
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,600
Hey Griffin.

715
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,420
Yeah.

716
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,880
Show me those wings again.

717
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,680
Show me those wings.

718
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,760
Don't waste another minute on your flyin'.

719
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,720
Minute on your flyin'.

720
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,840
What was it?

721
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,000
Don't waste another minute on your flyin'.

722
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,840
Flyin'.

723
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,660
Minute on your flyin'.

724
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,240
Minute on your flyin'.

725
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,160
Because it rhymes with cryin'.

726
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,640
One more time.

727
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,480
Don't waste another.

728
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,080
Maybe I hear where the wings are callin'.

729
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,000
Frazier.

730
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,160
Lol all over my face.

731
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,280
Wings.

732
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,120
What was that?

733
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,960
Seinfeld.

734
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,600
I thought it was actually a little bit of Doug.

735
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,440
Wings.

736
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,640
Let's go to the money zone.

737
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,000
And we've earned it.

738
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,060
Yeah.

739
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,540
ما Verp

740
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:04,680
You've probably already pooped your pants with laughter

741
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,480
at some of these great wings related bits in the show

742
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,720
and you're gonna need some new underwear.

743
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,080
Luckily we've got a hookup just for you.

744
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,720
It's Butt Bras, new sponsorship.

745
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,840
Nah, it's not.

746
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,480
It's MeUndies.com.

747
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,920
It costs less than one of the upper echelon butt bras.

748
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,560
It's about the price of a regular butt bra

749
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,880
that you get in a store.

750
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,200
It is admittedly slightly more expensive

751
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,960
than an entry-level butt bra.

752
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,040
Yeah, it's like a department store butt bra price.

753
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,520
Their tagline is department store butt bra price,

754
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,400
but higher echelon butt bra quality.

755
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,880
Meundies.com is committed to making

756
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,800
the world's most comfortable underwear.

757
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,420
And right now you can get 20% off your first order

758
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:47,300
when you go to MeUndies, that's M-E-Undies.com,

759
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,720
slash my brother.

760
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,600
And listen, if you don't love them,

761
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,000
your first pair is free.

762
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,320
We all wear them and we all are huge fans

763
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,680
and we've heard from like so many listeners who said,

764
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,040
these are the most comfortable underwear

765
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,280
I've ever worn, you guys, did not steer me wrong.

766
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,260
So you should definitely go get some of those.

767
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,460
So you're wearing great underwear from MeUndies.

768
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,620
Now what's next?

769
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,460
What are you gonna do?

770
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,660
Go to the, I wanna tell you guys about Basecamp.

771
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,900
Basecamp is a project management service software solution.

772
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,960
That's what they call it, the triple S.

773
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,200
And what it does is it helps you wrangle people

774
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,880
that are maybe doing different roles,

775
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,680
that have different responsibilities

776
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,040
and have different objectives,

777
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,400
and lets you get them all under one umbrella

778
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,820
and lead them towards a common goal,

779
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,440
finishing the project, getting it done.

780
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,280
Get it done.

781
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,520
And again, it runs on secure servers up in the cloud.

782
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,480
So you don't have to mess with anything technical.

783
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,400
They do all that for you.

784
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,220
If you're having a hard time just sort of getting,

785
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,900
hey, it's like wrangling ducks.

786
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,480
It's like herding ducks in here.

787
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,840
And it's like being pecked to death by ducks.

788
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,760
I would recommend that you go with Basecamp.

789
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,640
And if you're a listener to My Brother, My Brother and Me,

790
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,200
which you are, then you can try Basecamp for free

791
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,160
for two months at Basecamp.com slash My Brother.

792
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,720
Got a message on the Jumbotron, if you wanna

793
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,000
give a quick message to your business

794
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,400
or something to a friend,

795
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,960
you can go to Maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron.

796
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,240
This is, well, let's say about the Drunk and Ugly.

797
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,780
It's a podcast featuring over 400 episodes

798
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,000
of great storylines, hilarious characters

799
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,360
and more indie RPGs than you can shake a wizard's staff at.

800
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,000
You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll critically succeed

801
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,720
at being entertained.

802
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,040
Come check out the Drunk and Ugly actual play podcast.

803
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,920
Griffin, how can I find this great sounding show

804
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,040
with so many episodes?

805
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,520
All you gotta do is go to their website

806
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,280
at drunkandugly.com or just search

807
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,600
for Drunk and Ugly on iTunes.

808
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,560
You'll find it there.

809
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,440
400 episodes is a lot of episodes.

810
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
God, I hope we don't make it to 400.

811
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,220
I will consider a personal failure

812
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,040
if we make 400 episodes of this show.

813
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,920
We also have a message for Anna.

814
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,760
Oh.

815
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,600
Oh.

816
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,240
Go ahead, Drew.

817
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,080
No, go for it.

818
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,980
You have mispronounced the name.

819
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,880
I have, Anna, like the Frozen character.

820
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,960
It's from Liz.

821
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,320
I think the Frozen character's named Anna, isn't it?

822
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,440
I don't know anymore.

823
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,720
I'm all turned around.

824
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,320
Happy birthday, gig keeper.

825
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,280
Here's a poem for you recited by the McElroy brother

826
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,680
that is currently the closest geographically

827
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,560
or emotionally to Angela Lansbury.

828
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,840
That's actually correct.

829
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,840
Love you.

830
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,920
Your present from me is as late as can be.

831
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,440
So I hope you don't think I don't care.

832
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,680
I know that it's late, but I think that you're great

833
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,200
from your sis with the magical hair.

834
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,040
That's lovely.

835
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,860
That's lovely.

836
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,700
For a second, Travis,

837
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,320
I was wondering why you were reading that in that voice

838
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,160
and not in the voice of Angela Lansbury.

839
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,380
And then I realized I was thinking of Maya Angelou.

840
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,880
A lot of people get those two confused.

841
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,000
That's two different people.

842
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,120
The most different. Very different people, yeah.

843
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,480
Both powerful women.

844
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,860
Sexy, strong.

845
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:04,860
Hi, I'm Julie Sabatier, host of Rendered.

846
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,420
It's a show about making meaning and breaking rules.

847
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,020
We're answering important questions like,

848
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,220
can you build a space suit in your living room?

849
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,980
I went to my brother's place in Beaverton

850
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,380
and he has a swimming pool and I pressurized the suit

851
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,340
and sat down there underwater for about 10 minutes.

852
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,260
The thing that I had built was supporting my life.

853
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,780
That felt really good.

854
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,500
What does it sound like when you play a polka record

855
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,500
through a styrofoam cup?

856
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,100
And what happens when an airport carpet

857
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,940
gains a cult following?

858
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,300
Oh my goodness, the carpet has an Instagram.

859
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,220
Check out Rendered now at MaximumFun.org

860
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,480
or wherever you like to listen to podcasts.

861
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,660
My fiancee and I are in the process

862
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,340
of planning our wedding.

863
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,260
We're pretty in sync with most of the decisions so far,

864
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,620
including trying to get a famous person

865
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,820
to attend the wedding.

866
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,340
However, we have different strategies.

867
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,740
I say we should cast a wide net

868
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,380
by inviting multiple big celebrities

869
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,740
and hope that one is free that day.

870
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,100
He thinks we should only invite one lesser known

871
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,860
but still recognizable celebrity

872
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,140
as they'll be flattered and definitely show it.

873
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,780
Who has the fail-proof plan?

874
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,460
That's from RSV Please Help.

875
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,900
Dear Kevin Sorbo, I'm inviting you to our wedding

876
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,660
and it's important that you know

877
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,660
that you are the only famous person we've invited.

878
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,660
We are putting all of our eggs in the sore basket.

879
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,380
Are you worried that you'll get a response

880
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,540
from Kevin Sorbo who's like,

881
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,140
I was just talking to French Stewart

882
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,100
and he said you invited him too.

883
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,900
What the fuck, Steve?

884
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,860
Or they both show up

885
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,820
and you don't have enough chicken to go around.

886
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,700
I only plan on one of you showing up.

887
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,860
Bro, if Sorbo shows up,

888
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,180
there's not gonna be enough chicken to go around.

889
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,060
That fool will eat all the chicken in the place.

890
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,380
He eats up all the chicken that you got on your shelf.

891
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,580
So just let him introduce himself.

892
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,620
He's Kevin, the chicken boy Sorbo.

893
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,300
He loves chicken.

894
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,780
He won't even be done with your vows.

895
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,260
You'll hear a clatter and a clang in the kitchen.

896
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,100
What is that?

897
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,940
It's Kevin Sorbo eating.

898
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,060
What do you mean this is all the chicken you have?

899
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,500
Chicken boy, we haven't even cooked that shit yet.

900
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,980
Sorbo.

901
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,500
I just imagine those thoughts from Kevin Sorbo

902
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,020
is like, here's my standard contract.

903
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,100
I'll show up two seconds before the vows,

904
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,900
I'll listen to one of you do the vows,

905
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,460
then I'm on that chicken.

906
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,860
I need at least 30 pounds.

907
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,900
The worst part is he eats the bones

908
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,700
and then calls them Sorbo's.

909
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,780
That makes it okay.

910
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,300
And that's crazy is that he somehow,

911
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,700
and nobody's been able to figure this out,

912
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,900
science, religion, nobody's been able to figure this out yet.

913
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,020
He eats the bones and he adds them to his skeleton.

914
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,620
And don't offer that fool any Sorbet.

915
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,420
He will fucking lose his mind.

916
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,700
Yeah, I get it.

917
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,180
He looks like Doomsday at this point.

918
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,340
Chicken bones emitting from his skin,

919
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,300
like some sort of a chitin.

920
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,020
Why is Kevin, here's what I don't get.

921
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,620
Where is he putting it all?

922
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,460
Because I've seen Kevin Sorbo eat five whole chicken bones.

923
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,660
He goes home and he feeds it to his chicks.

924
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,980
Wait, that's weird.

925
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,460
To the baby Sorbo's.

926
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:11,340
Okay, he creates a pellet in his gullet, right?

927
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,260
It gets mushed up with the rocks that he's eaten earlier.

928
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,020
And then he goes home to the baby Sorbo's.

929
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,980
And mama birds it in.

930
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,420
And mama birds it into his baby Sorbo's.

931
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,660
If you cut one of those,

932
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,020
if you cut one of those eboluses,

933
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,500
like eolus from Hercules,

934
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,820
cut one of those open,

935
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,260
you can tell how old Kevin Sorbo is.

936
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,740
The answer is 615 years old.

937
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,660
It's the bones.

938
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,500
He looks so young.

939
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,980
It's the bones.

940
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,820
I heard when the bird flu was going around in China,

941
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,500
he didn't leave his house for three weeks.

942
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
He was terrified.

943
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,540
Yeah.

944
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,860
He started stockpiling.

945
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,620
Why would you want a famous person?

946
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,740
That would be the most uncomfortable thing ever, right?

947
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,500
To have just a stranger at you.

948
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,380
You would be constantly worrying about,

949
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,460
is Kevin Sorbo having a good time?

950
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,300
And you're gonna neglect every other person at that wedding

951
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,500
if Sorbo's there.

952
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,900
You do not need the distraction.

953
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,740
Trust me on this.

954
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,540
There is a better way to go about this,

955
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,940
and that is contact all of your guests and say,

956
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,660
now, we're so glad that you guys are able to make it great.

957
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,900
Do you have any personal connections

958
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,740
to a famous person you could bring with you?

959
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,580
Oh, okay.

960
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,740
If it's Kevin Sorbo.

961
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,740
So that way, like somebody else is responsible for it,

962
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,900
but they're there.

963
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,860
Here, to answer the question concretely,

964
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:37,540
which we so rarely are able to do,

965
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,940
the one of you that is right

966
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,100
is the one who says that you should cast a wide net,

967
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:48,100
because we are some of the least famous people

968
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,060
that you will meet,

969
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,900
and we have gotten wedding invitations

970
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,980
that we have not executed on.

971
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,100
So I think that casting a wide net is probably good,

972
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,580
just like hope Cheech Marin is in the neighborhood.

973
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,220
Less famous than us.

974
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,180
Less famous than us is what I'm saying.

975
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:11,180
And that's not a big circle of people.

976
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,580
No, there's not a lot of people.

977
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,380
It's just us, Cheech Marin, and Kevin Sorbo.

978
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,100
I had a Yahoo. The new Beatles.

979
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:23,100
Justin can attest to this.

980
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,980
I was sitting here,

981
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,780
and I accidentally clicked the refresh button

982
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,620
on one of my Yahoos.

983
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,460
And that's a shame,

984
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,200
because I lost the name of the person that sent it in.

985
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,860
Not only that, it's been deleted

986
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,060
while we were sitting here.

987
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:35,880
It's been moderated.

988
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,980
Do you remember the subject? It was John from Durham

989
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,640
was the person who sent it in.

990
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,180
I saw that much.

991
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,880
But I didn't see the actual,

992
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,360
didn't actually see the question.

993
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,500
Shit, birds.

994
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,700
Can't believe this.

995
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,820
I can't, but do you remember the subject?

996
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,060
Oh, oh, oh.

997
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:58,060
Oh, Griffin is using Google's spider crawlers

998
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,180
to view a cached version.

999
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,380
Wow, you're going deep for this one.

1000
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,080
I did it, I recovered the data.

1001
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,580
You're out in Silk Road picking this up.

1002
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,840
John Durham, a bunch of people actually sent this in.

1003
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,860
But the first, as far as I can tell, is John Durham.

1004
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,660
There has been, I-

1005
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,060
Sorry about using your whole name, by the way,

1006
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,900
John Durham.

1007
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,740
Yeah, it's okay.

1008
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,100
He knows what he was getting into.

1009
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,620
I neglect people sometimes,

1010
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,560
because I get a lot of multiple submissions

1011
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,400
of the same question,

1012
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,020
and I just pick one at random.

1013
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,220
And last week I did that to poor Rachel Sperling twice,

1014
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,980
and I felt so bad about it.

1015
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,740
And it was just luck of the draw.

1016
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,680
It's just luck of the draw.

1017
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,060
Now I'm trying to come up with a more equitable solution,

1018
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,340
which is first in gets the name treatment.

1019
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,180
Got it.

1020
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,280
So John Durham or Dunham, fuck.

1021
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,120
Jeff Dunham.

1022
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,100
Jeff Dunham sent this one in.

1023
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,060
Thanks, I love all your racist puppets.

1024
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,180
It's by Yahoo Answers.

1025
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,120
Well, I'm not gonna know who did it,

1026
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,120
because the question's been deleted.

1027
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,860
So you should just be happy that I'm gonna be able

1028
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,120
to read the question to you at all.

1029
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,420
You selfish prick.

1030
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,320
Got him.

1031
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:00,320
My boyfriend, to be, keeps on giving me the head lice.

1032
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,220
About two months ago, I found some head lice in my hair.

1033
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,780
The morning after someone I'm dating slept at my place.

1034
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,280
I did the treatment the same day.

1035
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,220
Two weeks later, slept together again.

1036
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,660
And I found living lice again.

1037
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,820
It happened again yesterday.

1038
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,220
Then I got the treatment again.

1039
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,900
And today it was, well, that's four lices.

1040
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,820
That's four different lice events.

1041
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,160
What should I do?

1042
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,740
We're not close enough to talk about that.

1043
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,300
But I'm pretty sure he's the one giving them to me,

1044
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,540
tired of doing treatments

1045
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,900
and changing tons of sheets after we're sleeping.

1046
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,180
I thought about telling him I got them somehow.

1047
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,180
And in a responsible way, I'm telling him,

1048
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,180
but I'm afraid he'll be turned off by me.

1049
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,780
Please help me, frowny face.

1050
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,620
This is-

1051
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,460
Turn off by you?

1052
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,620
He's the lice guy.

1053
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,080
This is a tale as old as time.

1054
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,120
We get this question every week,

1055
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,280
where people say, I'm sleeping with someone,

1056
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,660
but at what point is it time to say, I know you have lice?

1057
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,620
You know what I mean?

1058
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,140
Like, yes, we will engage in intercourse

1059
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,900
and sleep in the same bed together,

1060
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,460
but we're not quite at the place

1061
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,060
where we're comfortable talking about each other's head lice.

1062
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,980
And he's probably very embarrassed about it.

1063
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,340
Here's what drives me crazy,

1064
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,740
is you've done four of these treatments.

1065
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,180
If he does one, he's probably good to go at that.

1066
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,980
I don't think he is that embarrassed, Griffin.

1067
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,980
I'm saying maybe that's what he thinks

1068
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,380
he's bringing to the table.

1069
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,500
Listen, I don't have a great personality.

1070
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,740
I'm not very rich, but you know what I do have?

1071
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,900
Head full of lice.

1072
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,900
A billion little fingers to please you.

1073
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,340
Oh, God.

1074
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,780
We're gonna share this together, baby.

1075
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,380
Go, go, my little- You and me and the lice.

1076
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,100
My little sexual servant.

1077
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,020
Hey, baby.

1078
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,740
Oh, I'm going to- My nanobot.

1079
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,420
I'm gonna sit down my nanobots

1080
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,060
to please your every crevice.

1081
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,700
Hey, baby, have you seen Ant-Man?

1082
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,420
There's something way worse than that.

1083
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,060
Call me Lice Bryce.

1084
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,980
Lice Bryce, Ant-Man's shitty brother.

1085
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,460
Oh, Lice Bryce.

1086
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,900
I only use my powers for sexual pleasure.

1087
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,100
Oh, God.

1088
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,900
Maybe you're giving it to each other on alternating days.

1089
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,140
One of you does the treatment, gives the other one lice,

1090
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,580
that one doesn't does the treatment,

1091
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,260
then you give him back the same lice.

1092
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,140
The lice are just bouncing back and forth between your heads.

1093
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,940
Is it weird that what I'm taking away from this question

1094
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,540
is how many times you have to sleep together

1095
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,860
before you transition from boyfriend-to-be to boyfriends?

1096
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,620
Yeah, I think you sound a little judgmental

1097
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,460
talking about that.

1098
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:18,140
I've also never described anyone as my girlfriend-to-be.

1099
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,780
Well, Trav, I think if somebody gave me lice four times,

1100
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,700
I'd probably keep him in the maybe column.

1101
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,540
I don't know.

1102
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,220
Keep him on the bench for a little while.

1103
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,060
I don't know, Mom.

1104
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:27,900
He's great.

1105
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,380
I really have a great time with him.

1106
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,620
But there is the lice thing.

1107
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,380
Bryce can take me to pound town like no other.

1108
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,500
There's just one issue.

1109
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,460
Mom.

1110
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,940
Mom, is he's got little nanobots.

1111
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,860
The pound town is out of control.

1112
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,500
The nanobots, I could take or leave.

1113
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,940
So, honey, are we ready to take this thing

1114
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,020
to the next level or what?

1115
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:49,860
That depends.

1116
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,420
Did you buy a box of RID?

1117
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,860
Because if so, then yes.

1118
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,980
But until you treat your sexual army,

1119
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,540
I think we're gonna have to keep this in limbo.

1120
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,460
My boys?

1121
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,780
I'll never, stop trying to change me, woman.

1122
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,300
That is true.

1123
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,980
You know, that's a bad sign.

1124
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,100
If someone can accept you just the way you are,

1125
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:08,940
head lice and all.

1126
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,820
It says lice, Bryce, on my personalized license plate

1127
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,420
and lice, Bryce, I shall remain.

1128
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,740
My license plate.

1129
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:18,780
He didn't call it that because the word is in there.

1130
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,780
No, that was too bad.

1131
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,140
That was too much.

1132
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:25,140
Standing tall on the wings of my dreams.

1133
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:25,980
That one already had it in it.

1134
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:26,820
That one just works.

1135
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,660
It was already in there.

1136
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,500
As is.

1137
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,780
How's this episode been?

1138
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,180
We left a comment card on your table.

1139
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,260
If you could fill that out for us, that would be great.

1140
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,140
If you see a comment card appearing on your Zune right now

1141
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:41,620
or your iPod, just fill that out for us

1142
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,540
and mail it back if you don't mind.

1143
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,380
I thought it was pretty good.

1144
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,820
We probably have some listeners with lice

1145
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,340
that didn't appreciate some of those jokes.

1146
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,340
Do you know that I have been sitting here for 20 minutes

1147
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,540
trying to remember the fucking theme song

1148
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,500
of Who's the Boss?

1149
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,900
And I'll even keep coming up with this.

1150
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:53,860
Who's the boss?

1151
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,700
Who's the boss?

1152
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,140
Baby, who's the boss?

1153
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,060
Who's the boss, baby?

1154
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,420
And then I would have to do a parody of like what?

1155
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,460
You can count on wings.

1156
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,500
No matter where you fly.

1157
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,100
Oh shit, your baby's sleeping.

1158
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,140
Not anymore.

1159
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,060
Another baby nap ruined by wings.

1160
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,620
What's your earliest memory?

1161
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,460
I remember my uncle Griffin singing a parody.

1162
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,780
Well, and by parody, I mean he was singing the song

1163
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:22,780
in My Two Dads, but he just worked the word wings in there

1164
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,980
because it's a name of another.

1165
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,820
Why would he do that?

1166
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,220
I don't know.

1167
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,620
They have this shitty podcast.

1168
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,100
I think it was their last episode.

1169
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,460
Do you remember podcasts?

1170
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,300
No, I don't.

1171
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,420
I don't, I don't.

1172
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,700
Patent Trolls shut them all down.

1173
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,460
Hand me another electric burger.

1174
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,700
I do remember when my-

1175
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:41,700
Because this is the future.

1176
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,780
Okay, but in the future, oh wait, how long are we?

1177
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,580
Okay, electric burgers, I shall grant you,

1178
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,460
but the psychiatrist just has electric burgers right there.

1179
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,420
I didn't realize we were at a psychiatrist.

1180
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,620
I thought it was just two people stealing the shit

1181
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,420
down at the electric burger shack.

1182
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,300
I didn't bring you into the psychiatrist portion

1183
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,860
of the bit, sorry.

1184
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,860
I thought I had explained that.

1185
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,380
I was just in my mind's eye.

1186
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,180
Wouldn't you call them Cyburgers?

1187
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,820
Oh man, that's the point.

1188
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,740
No, Cyburgers is the place across the street

1189
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,140
that's putting electric burgers out of business.

1190
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,780
They just have a much better name.

1191
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,300
Yeah, you know, big business is shutting down

1192
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,140
mom and pop electric burgers stands all over the country.

1193
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,940
This is the plot of Good Burger 2024,

1194
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:26,780
which is the sci-fi post-apocalyptic remake.

1195
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,780
Any other ones?

1196
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,540
I feel like we haven't done Family Matters,

1197
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:32,020
step by step, wings by wings.

1198
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,460
So there's another one, just throw it up on the bonfire.

1199
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:38,540
They're brothers, identical brothers, but they're not.

1200
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,700
They walk alike, they talk alike,

1201
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,380
snarls even if I like, what a crazy wings.

1202
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,260
Well, they happen to predict the bill of wings.

1203
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,380
The wings man, the winger boy, even winged wings.

1204
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:54,380
And in my opinionation of wings, wings, wings,

1205
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,300
wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings, wings.

1206
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,140
Blossom.

1207
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,780
Do you guys like my?

1208
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,220
Da, da, da, da, da, da, wings.

1209
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,060
Let's coach.

1210
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,100
I don't think we should do instrumentals anymore.

1211
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,140
I think it's harder.

1212
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:10,980
Yeah, you're right.

1213
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,100
I don't think it reads as well.

1214
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:16,780
I just went for coach and I actually booted up.

1215
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:20,180
I booted up the joke coach parody with wings in it.

1216
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,180
And then it didn't load in.

1217
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,700
The music didn't load in until I already opened my mouth.

1218
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,260
I keep that in my RAM apparently.

1219
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,620
I keep the coach theme just ready to access.

1220
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,980
I wish that was a scene in Inside Out.

1221
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,660
Always thinking about the coach theme again.

1222
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,500
Grab the bobble.

1223
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,340
Grab it.

1224
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,260
Oh shit, we dropped it.

1225
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,100
That's fine.

1226
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,060
No one's ever, no one has any reason to need that.

1227
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,660
Should we stop doing the show?

1228
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,700
Did we start?

1229
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,500
Take us to the bridge.

1230
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,100
You're just fucking looking at me.

1231
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,580
Are you turnt on your milk juice?

1232
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,460
No, I'm trying to think of other sitcom themes.

1233
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:54,580
Okay, we're gonna wrap it up.

1234
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,740
But first, before we do that,

1235
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,380
I wanna say thanks again to MeUndies

1236
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,620
who are dedicated to offering the most comfortable underwear

1237
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,820
and that it's not a lie.

1238
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,700
That's not Hollywood bullshit.

1239
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,540
That's real.

1240
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,500
If you go to meundies.com slash my brother,

1241
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,900
you get 20% off your first order.

1242
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,580
You should already be wearing MeUndies now.

1243
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:09,420
Go.

1244
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:14,060
So no one told you planes were gonna fly this way.

1245
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,460
We did some twinks.

1246
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,660
You did five.

1247
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,580
We've got upcoming live shows.

1248
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,700
Oh, yeah, I forget.

1249
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,180
Yeah, Seattle and Vancouver.

1250
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,740
You still have a chance to come see us

1251
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,700
at the end of August last weekend.

1252
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:29,540
If you go to bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM van

1253
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:32,300
or bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM, no, sorry.

1254
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,500
Bit.ly forward slash van MBMBAM

1255
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,780
or bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM Seattle.

1256
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,620
And it's not just us.

1257
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,460
You can go buy tickets.

1258
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,300
Sawbones will be there as well.

1259
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,500
It's gonna be a full night of comedy.

1260
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,740
And if you play your cards right,

1261
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,460
you might even be able to see baby Charlie.

1262
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,300
And she's the cutest baby.

1263
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,420
Siddy's sister Riley is gonna turn 15

1264
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,620
when we're in Vancouver.

1265
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,500
It's gonna get crazy in Canada.

1266
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,500
She can legally drink.

1267
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,340
Legally drink.

1268
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,700
She can legally smoke weed.

1269
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,820
We've got another live show coming up in September.

1270
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,740
We can't give you all the details just yet.

1271
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:02,580
What?

1272
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,660
The DLs?

1273
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,500
The details.

1274
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,340
I'm sorry.

1275
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,860
We can't give you all the duck tales just yet,

1276
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,100
but it's gonna be awesome.

1277
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,500
And if you play your cards right,

1278
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:13,700
no matter where in the country or the world even you are,

1279
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:14,820
you may be able to watch it.

1280
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,700
So we're working on that.

1281
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,300
We'll let you know once we have everything squared away.

1282
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:22,340
We're gonna have a simultaneous IMAX satellite presentation.

1283
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,660
Oh, that makes way more sense.

1284
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:27,140
I thought we'd just have people acting it out in every city.

1285
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,740
Wait, what did they say?

1286
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:29,660
Okay, so hold on.

1287
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,980
Guys, stick with me here.

1288
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,860
And in my opinionation,

1289
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,660
wings and a-

1290
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:36,500
I lost it.

1291
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,020
Do you guys, that's nothing.

1292
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,340
The bit rate isn't high enough.

1293
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,740
This doesn't make any sense.

1294
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,500
Also, we put out our Totino's episode,

1295
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,780
and I hope to God you've already listened to it

1296
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,260
before the censors make us take it down

1297
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,540
for being too zesty.

1298
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,700
Yeah, that was our high,

1299
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,980
did you guys know that was our highest episode download,

1300
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:57,060
single episode download day ever?

1301
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,420
We got the Totino's bump.

1302
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,860
We got that Totino's bump.

1303
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,700
Thank you, Totino's.

1304
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,580
Thank you to John Roderick and The Long Winters

1305
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,060
who used our theme song, It's a Departure,

1306
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:04,980
off the album, Put in the Days,

1307
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,020
you bet it's a terrific album

1308
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,260
that you should go listen to.

1309
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,100
And if you live in Seattle,

1310
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,140
you should look up his platform.

1311
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,580
He's run for city council.

1312
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,020
I think like eighth district.

1313
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,940
Go check out his platform

1314
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,460
and then maybe think about voting for him in this election.

1315
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,420
You should also go check out

1316
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,460
all the other amazing Max Fund shows.

1317
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,660
They're all incredible.

1318
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,140
That's gonna do it for us.

1319
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,220
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo for us

1320
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,340
to take us home,

1321
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:30,020
something to talk about over the week

1322
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,820
and then we'll answer it next week?

1323
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,380
Yes, take this in your craw.

1324
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,300
It's from YadruDruDruDavenport.

1325
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,140

00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,820

1329

00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,020
This has been my brother, my brother.

1333
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,020
May kiss your dads.

1334
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:57,980
Gware on the lips.

1335
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,220
You forget?

1336
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,060
Duck wings.

1337
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,500
Woo. There it is.

1338
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:20,500

1339
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,540
Comedy and culture.

Artist owned.

1341

Listener supported.

1342
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,340
Hello, I'm Taco, the elephant magician.

1343
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,900
Merle Highchurch here,

1344
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,180
the master of clerical magic.

1345
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,700
I'm Magnus Burnside, the fighter.

1346
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,420
Did you guys like that?

1347
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:36,500
Did you, the listener, like that?

1348
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,340
You were just swept up in a world

1349
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,580
of high fantasy and magic

1350
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:42,060
where anything can happen and anything is possible.

1351
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,260
Hi, I'm Griffin McElroy,

1352
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,860
Dungeon Master for The Adventure Zone,

1353
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,700
a new podcast on Maximum Fun

1354
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,700
in which magic and mystery intertwine

1355
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:52,460
for a very erotically charged role-playing experience.

1356
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,900
You can catch it every other Thursday

1357
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,900
here on MaximumFun.org or iTunes.

1358
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:00,900
It's for Dungeons and Dragons, but with family.
