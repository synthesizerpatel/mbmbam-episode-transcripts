1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's a new craze, and the girls, they don't want to just say they are gay.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hello. Hi, everybody. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy, and Travis, I can't believe you went with the walking thing.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We said the elves, right?

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm walking by the elves.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Okay. We said that we were doing elves and ho-hos.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Griffin.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay. Oh, sorry. I'm Griffin McElroy, your youngest brother.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's not timely. It's not appropriate.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
2011.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's 2011.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm walking by the elves.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay, and the other thing is I don't think you know who Joaquin Phoenix is.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I think you just had a big beard, and you were on the plane, and you were like...

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Do you know anything other than his visage? Can you give me some deets?

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
My last name's Phoenix, buddy.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He doesn't have an accent, whatever accent that is.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why you so hard on Joaquin, buddy?

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Can you just put on your goddamn hat?

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Put on your Christmas hat.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Did you focus group that goof out before you brought it to the show?

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
No, I did not.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay. Maybe next time.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Did you focus out the goof?

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You got to run the goofs by us.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I didn't.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So this is an advice show for the... I need a beer.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What's up?

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is an advice show for the modern era. We're going to get to the advice in just a second.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But first, some lady in this audience has a secret about these two.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes, it's true. She knows who she is.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
She is probably too ashamed to admit it.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
When I get nervous pre-show, and I always do, I got to make peeps.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And sometimes I have to use the one closest to the green room, which in this case was the ladies room.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We didn't want to, I guess, ruin the magic of the show by exposing ourselves to the audience.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
There were two stalls in there. Travis and I agreed on peep procedure.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We both went in, went in both stalls.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
There she is. There she is.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay. Normally I would apologize, but you did not follow the bathroom procedure.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You didn't jiggle the handle.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You didn't knock on the door.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
She didn't expect there to be two dudes.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You always have to expect two dudes.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You always expect two dudes in the bathroom.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is a classy show she shouldn't have to expect two dudes hanging out, crossing the streams.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
There were two different stalls.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Please admit you crossed the streams.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They were separate stalls.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We did pause in the middle and switch stalls.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But that's just so we could get the full experience.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And I giggled in the middle of the act because it was so ridiculous to do it.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And we high-fived as we were passing.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That part's not true.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I definitely giggled, though, and I couldn't just...

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Was I giggling when you came in?

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Because that would...

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, God damn it.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Nothing gets rid of the pre-show jitters.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Like, supreme embarrassment.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's a deep shame.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
God damn it.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What?

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No, my dad reads those.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The jig is up.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, man.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So, hey, we're going to get to the advice right now.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Is Greg here?

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah, boy.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Holy shit.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Greg is pumped.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, no, that's not Greg.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He's just a huge Greg fan.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He didn't come to Austin for us.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He came for Greg.

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Greg says, I need a gift for my wife.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
She is finishing up vet school this year and has only asked me for boring veterinary handbooks and the like.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I want to get her something fun and exciting, i.e. not a textbook on how to cut up horses.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Do you have any suggestions?

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Sounds like good reading to me.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
First off, there's an audio book about how to cut up horses.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's called My Brother, My Brother and Me.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's pretty much all we talk about.

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Is your wife here?

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No.

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Nice.

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay, good.

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Does she listen to the show?

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay, good.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We have worked out some goofs about how you were messing up by asking in front of her.

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, you're bad at presents, but you're actually pretty good.

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah, your bases.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Did you stop her from coming so she wouldn't find out what you were getting her?

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Classic rule.

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Classic Greg.

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's what the fans come to see.

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Classic Greg.

109
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Classic Greg play.

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So, boys, GIFs.

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay, so we've ruled out books about cutting up horses, so anything else?

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, what else is there?

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The whole world of other things.

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, a cup.

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
A cup isn't that thing.

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Or a cup.

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No, damn it.

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Damn it.

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay, let me hit you guys with this.

120
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What about a pet?

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The pet, she could, would be like a practice dog.

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Like you could...

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, this is my dog, Guinea Pig.

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yeah, this is my dog, Guinea Pig, or a Guinea Pig, Guinea Pig, and you test out...

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Or a Guinea Pig dog.

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Why is that dog's legs on its back now?

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Exactly.

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Exactly.

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
There's like a new...

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You made an upside-down dog.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Right.

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There's a Franken-dog.

133
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
A Franken-upside-down dog.

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Wait, how did this go from her being a veterinarian to creating animal atrocities?

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Have you ever read The Island of Dr. Moreau?

136
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah.

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I haven't, but I'm about to reference it.

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He basically just turns dogs upside down, that whole book.

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
How is that different from just turning a dog upside down?

140
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Because his face is right side up.

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You know, you could also, the dog could be a really powerful bargaining chip.

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You know, you could say to her, this is your dog and you love it, but if you mess up, I'm going to kill it.

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That you're...

144
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If she messes up in veterinary school.

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If she...

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Or she messes up in general.

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Burn the roast.

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No, no.

150
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's just called an abusive husband.

151
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What I'm saying to you is that you have a sign at her vet place where...

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Clinic, I think.

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What?

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Her meat locker or is she works on the pets?

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Her vet place.

156
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay.

157
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No, her pet...

158
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Pet shop.

159
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
At her littlest pet shop.

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
At her littlest pet shop clinic.

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And you say, if we, this is our guarantee to you, our pledge, if we kill your dog, we'll kill our dog.

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Or they can kill our dog.

163
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This is a dog for dog guarantee.

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You can kill our dog while we watch in horror.

166
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We'll make our kids do it.

167
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
How much to kill that puppy in the window?

168
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I am now looking to see if there are any kids in the audience because that's horrifying.

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah.

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Any kids, good.

171
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
No.

172
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No kids, cool.

173
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Cool.

174
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
How about a Yahoo answer?

175
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah.

176
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This one was...

177
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Are there Yahoo representatives here?

178
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Thank you, Nefariousity.

180
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user hmmm who asks, is it possible for internet radiations to cause somebody stretch marks?

181
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I think they are causing me, but I love internet and computer.

182
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It helps me so much, but each time I am doing it, there is some tingling sensation.

183
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And then I notice at that place, a stretch mark appearing.

184
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If I tell my family members, if I tell my family members, they think I am being stupid.

185
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Is it possible?

186
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Wow.

187
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Really?

188
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Do you think it's instantaneous?

189
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Like they feel a tingle and like they lift up their shirt and watch the stretch mark appear?

190
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah, I think it's google.com enter and then they're doubled over in pain.

191
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah.

192
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And then all of a sudden the Netmata appears.

193
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Trademark, TM, don't even try.

194
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Are there possibly, and I'm just, I'm going out on a limb here, are there maybe some behaviors that you have adopted in addition to internet and computer time?

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Like is internet and computer time also sandwich time?

196
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Because that might, if you sandwich while you internet, you may get stretch marks down there from the sandwich though, not from the internet.

197
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Is there, is internet radiation a real thing is what I'm too afraid to ask.

198
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's the question.

199
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's yeah, that's the, the secret of this hole in the stars part right now is, is, is, is there a radio?

200
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I mean, obviously there is, right?

201
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's what the 1% has been using to control us.

202
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But I do, I do enjoy though that this person has convinced himself that a internet radiation is a thing.

203
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
B, acceptable risk.

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
C, they're going, they don't know it's properties.

205
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
They're still out on the fucking forefront of internet radiation research.

206
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They don't know if it's causing stretch marks.

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
They don't know what it's doing, but they do know, they do know it's worth, whatever the help it's providing them is definitely worth the risk.

208
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hey, if a stretch mark appears, there's nothing good happening.

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
This radiation is not like, I was good at piano.

210
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
How many stretch marks until you stop?

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Right.

212
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Well, I think it's, I think it's beautiful that this person thinks that the stretch marks may be caused by the internet and yet they're willing to use the internet one more time.

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
One last chance, internet.

214
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
One last chance to solve this problem for me.

215
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Turn to, to, and Yahoo is the source they talked to.

216
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Not fucking like belly stretches.

217
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
WebMD?

218
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah. Google, maybe try that.

219
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
A real doctor's phone number.

220
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You can maybe Google that.

221
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah.

222
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You can type that out.

223
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Maybe.

224
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah.

225
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I do.

226
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I think it's a testament to their family though.

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
At least they have a supportive.

228
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, not a supportive, but no, their family said they were stupid.

229
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Hey, you're stupid.

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That's not how it works.

231
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Hey, you're like twice as tall as you once were because of stretch marks.

232
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What happened?

233
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You can't, I guess they can't say internet.

234
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
No.

235
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No.

236
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Third world internet does give you stretch marks.

237
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
No, that's true.

238
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Here in America, we have the filtered stuff.

239
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's not as fast though.

240
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Hey, I have another question here.

241
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It says, I'm, excuse me, I've got a whole list here.

242
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Hey, MBMBA M.

243
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hey.

244
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Hey.

245
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What up?

246
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Hey.

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
My wife has joined a roller derby league and is in the...

248
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Fun.

249
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah, it's good times.

250
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And is in the training period where they learn how to kick the shit out of their opponents.

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
At the end of this three-month program, she'll need a derby name that is both clever and tough sounding.

252
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Her name is Emily and she is small, but fast on her skates.

253
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Do you have any suggestions?

254
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Emily small fast.

255
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Emily skates go.

256
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Skates, tiny skates.

257
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Tiny blur.

258
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Skate murders people.

259
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't like that.

260
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
No.

261
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No.

262
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Skate or Emily.

263
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's not very good.

264
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Skate better Emily.

265
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Practice.

266
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Practice.

267
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Hard worker.

268
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't think we're good at this.

269
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I don't think we are either.

270
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
No.

271
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We have many talents.

272
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Some friends of ours have discussed this because we have friends in the roller derby community.

273
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
More of a family really.

274
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And the best name that we cooked up was Angela Landsfury, which I like.

275
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I like that.

276
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah.

277
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Is she very old?

278
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This girl?

279
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I guess that would be good.

280
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
My elderly wife Emily is participating in roller derby.

281
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
She is fast and small and solves mysteries sometimes.

282
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Actually, a lot of people don't know this.

283
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
When a roller derby player turns 50, they throw him into the tar pit like I'm dinosaurs.

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That was the most obscure fucking reference that we've ever done on this whole show.

285
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Hey, I'm the baby.

286
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Gotta love me.

287
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I guess.

288
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Don't you fucking groan.

289
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If you got it, you laugh.

290
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You paid ten dollars to be here.

291
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Might as well chuckle while the sun...

292
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What did Juno use in that movie about...

293
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What did Juno use in that movie?

294
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Roll it.

295
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Roll it?

296
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Roll fast.

297
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Roller.

298
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Roll fast.

299
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Roller girls.

300
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't know what she did.

301
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I missed that.

302
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Directed by the incomparable auteur Drew Barrymore.

303
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Sure.

304
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You could be Drew Scarymore.

305
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I like that a lot.

306
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Ooh, I like that.

307
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Ellen Rage.

308
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
God damn it.

309
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I was just about to say Ellen Rage.

310
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's it.

311
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's it.

312
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's it, though.

313
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Helen.

314
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Helen.

315
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But then it just sounds like you're saying Helen, which is also a lady's name.

316
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What about Helen?

317
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I was saying Helen with two Ls.

318
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh, so like Helen Kellen.

319
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's...

320
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's not good.

321
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
She's from Austin.

322
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
She can't.

323
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Miracle worker.

324
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay.

325
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
No.

326
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Is she from Austin, really?

327
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't know.

328
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Neither does she.

329
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There it is, folks.

330
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Put the kids to bed.

331
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Put the kids to bed.

332
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's 730.

333
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The kids are deeply offended by Helen Keller jokes.

334
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Shut the front two easy.

335
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
How about a yahoo?

336
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah.

337
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
This one was sent in by Galiayali.

338
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Thank you, Galiayali.

339
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's by...

340
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, this one's gross.

341
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,160
This one's by a yahoo answers user, SergJay, who asks, what would you do if you catch your

342
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,240
husband pooping in the backyard?

343
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
Additional information.

344
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
I did.

345
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:27,160
I don't know if I'm in Troubles.

346
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,880
So wait.

347
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,160
Is this question...

348
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,760
Is the question being asked by the catcher or the catchy?

349
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Catchy.

350
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
I don't know.

351
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Husband or wife.

352
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Am I in Troubles?

353
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
I got busted.

354
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
What would you do?

355
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
You'd be totally cool, right?

356
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,540
If you were married to a person who thought it was okay to just poop in the backyard,

357
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,240
you would also be in Troubles.

358
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,080
You would be legally bound.

359
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,520
You would share taxes with Troubles.

360
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,680
I mean, you said for better or for worse, and this is basically like the worst.

361
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Yeah.

362
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,320
Doing dirty in the hydrangeas is about as worse as it gets.

363
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,360
Doing dirty.

364
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
In the koi pond, Steve.

365
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
Really?

366
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
In the koi pond.

367
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,920
The koi pond is the worst, but the kois hate that.

368
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,640
I imported those from Japan.

369
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
You divorce him.

370
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
Right?

371
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,640
I mean, you divorce him?

372
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
You leave him instantly.

373
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
Rub his nose in it?

374
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
I guess.

375
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Definitely an option.

376
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
Definitely an option.

377
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Just bap him on the schnoz with a rolled up newspaper.

378
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
Steven!

379
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,640
Steven!

380
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,200
Shake the no-no can at him.

381
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,400
Someone responded, I think I would be really shocked.

382
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
It wouldn't-

383
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:41,840
I think I'd be totally cash about it.

384
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
Oh, Jim.

385
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,700
I would try to be cool.

386
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,360
It wouldn't make me mad, but I would question insanity.

387
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,280
It wouldn't make you mad.

388
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,560
I'm not mad, Steven.

389
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,480
I'm just disappointed.

390
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,960
How many times do we have to have this talk?

391
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,920
I'd say disappointed would probably, I mean, yeah.

392
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Jesus.

393
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,680
Made some troubles.

394
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,960
Somebody said, start serving his meals outside too.

395
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
You want to be a dog?

396
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
I'll treat you like one.

397
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
What kind of human sympathy-

398
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,680
This is the way we should treat the mentally disabled in our country.

399
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
All right.

400
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,160
Well, this is what we're going with.

401
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
You want poop outside?

402
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,160
That's how you sleep outside.

403
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Yeah.

404
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Problem solved.

405
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
He just has a dog fetish.

406
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,040
Maybe he saw that hilarious Tim Allen vehicle.

407
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
Dog fetish.

408
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
Dog fetish.

409
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
The movie.

410
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Tim Allen.

411
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,120
Road dogs.

412
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,160
And I forgot what I was talking about.

413
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
Shaggy dog?

414
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
I missed road dogs.

415
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Shaggy DA?

416
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,560
Is it just about Tim Allen wanting to fuck dogs?

417
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,560
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

418
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:47,240
I haven't seen it, but I assume that it is about-

419
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,920
Husbands don't do that.

420
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
Hey.

421
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
How about no one-

422
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Humanity?

423
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,680
It's not like if you're a bachelor, swing and single, poop in your backyard all you

424
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,680
want.

425
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,360
Is it possible that she doesn't specify, did she maybe marry a dog?

426
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,800
My husband, Marmaduke, keeps pooping in the backyard.

427
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,560
And sitting on that couch like a person.

428
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,440
He thinks he's people.

429
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,960
He always steals the newspaper.

430
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Then he poops in the backyard.

431
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,080
And he started on that mailman.

432
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,560
I would prefer to think that this is asked by the guy who got busted.

433
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,920
Oh yeah, I think so too.

434
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,480
And dogs aren't allowed to use the internet.

435
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,320
And the old battle axe came down on me real hard.

436
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Hey guys.

437
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
The old ball and chain.

438
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,520
Everybody, the old ball and chain didn't miss me.

439
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,320
I was just trying to poop in the backyard like a grown man.

440
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,440
I just wanted two minutes of quiet.

441
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,880
The only place I can get any peace in that house is outside next to my shed in my special

442
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
spot.

443
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:52,760
As somebody who was very recently shamed for using the restroom, I do sort of feel for

444
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
this man.

445
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,760
I feel his pain.

446
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,840
I don't think my crime was quite as intense as his.

447
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Right.

448
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
It was.

449
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
I mean, it was in public.

450
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,840
It was around people.

451
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Yes, that's true.

452
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
How was his not in public?

453
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
He was in the backyard.

454
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,840
I mean...

455
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,840
He was in like the backyard of Walmart using the couch.

456
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,680
Oh, if he had like a really high fence, then it's cool?

457
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,280
If you're going to do that, that thing, there's exactly one by one foot square where it is

458
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
not in public.

459
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,480
You bought a house with a room in it specifically for that thing to be done in it.

460
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
Right.

461
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,680
You don't see me storing my cigars in a room other than my cigar storage room.

462
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
Your humidor.

463
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,680
My humidor.

464
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,680
Hey, is Lonesome and the Lone Star State here?

465
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
Hey.

466
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
How's it going?

467
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,680
Lonesome.

468
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Hey.

469
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,680
You sound too friendly to be Lonesome.

470
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,980
Over the past few years, Lonesome and the Lone Star State, no fewer than five of my very

471
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,000
dear friends have all moved to the same Midwestern city.

472
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,840
I've visited a lot, really like it, but my boyfriend is a little more hesitant to pack

473
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,540
his bags and move away.

474
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,840
How can I convince him that this is the right move?

475
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,600
He's becoming more receptive, but I still got a ways to go.

476
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,880
I know personally, I don't know why anybody would want to live anywhere other than Austin.

477
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,680
Don't give him that.

478
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:14,560
Shinerbock, Alamo, it's not in this one.

479
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,560
Drafthouse.

480
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
Yeah.

481
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,560
Alamo Drafthouse.

482
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,720
That's what I meant.

483
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,840
Is your boyfriend here and sitting somewhere other than with you?

484
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,920
It depends entirely on the Midwestern city, right?

485
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,160
Like if it's Chicago, then that would probably be an easy sell.

486
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,360
But if it's like the Poopsie, Missouri.

487
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
I went to Chicago.

488
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,600
You couldn't pay me enough to go back there.

489
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,760
Do you know how cold it was?

490
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,360
I waited for a train for 10 minutes.

491
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,360
Wait, hold on.

492
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Are any of you here from Chicago?

493
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,360
Cool.

494
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
Go on.

495
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Cool.

496
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Fuck that.

497
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Fuck that place.

498
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
That place is great.

499
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
No.

500
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,400
If you're listening on the internet later, I'm just kidding, if you could see me this

501
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,600
whole time, I've been winking, right audience?

502
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Yeah.

503
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Winking.

504
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
They vouch for it.

505
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,040
You're saying no fewer than five.

506
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
Is there more and you're just not sure?

507
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Did you lose track?

508
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Did you lose count?

509
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Yeah.

510
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
You got up to five and then you just stopped.

511
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,040
I see what you're saying.

512
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,440
You don't know the metric for- People that used to buy sensi from you, you

513
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,080
just want to be closer to your target demo.

514
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,600
You know, what about a treasure map?

515
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Yeah.

516
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,760
He might not even know where he's going and then all of a sudden he follows the clues,

517
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,000
Legend of Curly's gold.

518
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
A million paces to the north.

519
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,400
Walk until cold.

520
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
You have arrived.

521
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Are you bored?

522
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
You are there.

523
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Empty warehouse district marks the spot.

524
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,040
If you see an abandoned train station- Or our friend-

525
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
Congratulations Midwest.

526
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,760
If you see our friend Darlene, you have gone far enough.

527
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,760
She will be waiting for you.

528
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
And look, there's me in a U-Haul.

529
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,760
Surprise!

530
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,800
Surprise, you moved.

531
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,800
It's all your shit.

532
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,440
No, don't do it that way.

533
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,680
It's a lot harder to dole these out and feel consequence free about it when they're actually

534
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,000
here and the repercussions are so terrifyingly real.

535
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Kidnap him!

536
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Kidnap him!

537
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Whatever!

538
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah!

539
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Drug him!

540
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Drug him!

541
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Don't.

542
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
No, don't.

543
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Don't do that.

544
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,560
Yeah, this is really much harder than I thought it would be.

545
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,680
You gotta get- There's gotta be a good reason- What is the city, if you don't mind my asking?

546
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Kansas City.

547
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Kansas City.

548
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
Okay.

549
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
There's a lot of stuff there.

550
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Aren't there multiple Kansas cities?

551
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,680
Kansas City, Missouri, Kansas City.

552
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
Is it in the Kansas side or the Missouri side?

553
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
Oh, no, never mind.

554
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
No, no, no, no, no.

555
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,000
I believe my wife, Sydney, Sydney, you're here.

556
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Hey, everybody, say hi to Sydney.

557
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,800
Now, Sydney, you've been to Kansas City, right?

558
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
Would you say everything is up to date there?

559
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
God damn it!

560
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Yes!

561
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Under the wire.

562
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Yeah, you know what?

563
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
That Oklahoma gag went over just as well as it should have.

564
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Congratulations.

565
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,080
You just bought your own coffin, stupid.

566
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
Joke coffin.

567
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,560
And there's another one.

568
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,600
Is it cool?

569
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,880
She says it's very cool for a home audience.

570
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
She doesn't have a microphone.

571
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Yeah.

572
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,920
Yeah, I guess just to give them that, it's very cool.

573
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
Sounds good to me.

574
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
It's great.

575
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,320
There's two of them, so if one like burns down, there's another Kansas City.

576
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,360
Are you sure all your friends are in that one?

577
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,360
Yes.

578
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
Okay, good.

579
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
Check, because that one's important.

580
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
Yeah, that is key.

581
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
How about a Yahoo?

582
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Yeah, definitely.

583
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,280
This one was also sent in by Nefariosity.

584
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,280
Thank you.

585
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:31,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ray, who asks, how can I become like Jackie Chan?

586
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,920
I want to learn how to fight like Jackie Chan, or learn how to do kung fu pro-erly.

587
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,140
So shall I go to China and go to a special place?

588
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:45,600
Because I want to learn how to do it proper-erly like Jackie Chan.

589
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,680
Not the way they do it near my dojo.

590
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,680
I love that.

591
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,680
Wait, wait, wait.

592
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,680
I said near my dojo, not at my dojo.

593
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
We have a small club.

594
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,600
The dojo's prices are outrageous.

595
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,960
We need outside in the alley behind it.

596
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,560
We're in front of the frozen yogurt place.

597
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,560
No, not that one.

598
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
The one around the corner.

599
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,160
Walk to the employee parking lot of the Dairy Queen.

600
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,600
You have arrived.

601
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Let the kicking commence.

602
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
The dojo club.

603
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,240
Meet me at the dojo, and you can follow me.

604
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,200
You know why everybody just said that?

605
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,680
In Huntington, Virginia, next to the Dairy Queen, there is in fact a dojo.

606
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
This is accurate.

607
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
This is an accurate goof.

608
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,560
This is an historically accurate goof.

609
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,000
There are a lot of ways you can become like Jackie Chan.

610
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Can you throw-

611
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
A friend, Chris Tucker.

612
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,640
Can you be best friends with Chris Tucker?

613
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,120
Can you throw fast punches?

614
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,640
That seems to be that whole guy's whole schtick.

615
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
I guess.

616
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
I'm not an expert.

617
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
You know what?

618
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
Are you Chinese?

619
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,520
Because if you're Chinese, my papa probably already thinks you are Jackie Chan.

620
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,880
You are like halfway there.

621
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,520
I hope he never listens and hears about how racist we say he is.

622
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Jackie Chan?

623
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:59,280
Can you have lots of goof ups during a filming of the movie, and then those make their way

624
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,280
into the credits.

625
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,760
I'm like, whoop, the ladder opened.

626
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,880
Oh, am I not?

627
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,240
You get hit like really hard with a sword or something, and then you just laugh it off

628
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
because you're Jackie Chan.

629
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
Because you're invincible.

630
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,240
You're invincible.

631
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
You're so charming.

632
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,600
What kind of kung fu are you doing at your dojo that's not like what Jackie Chan is doing?

633
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,240
We're doing tickle fu here.

634
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,560
I don't even like this.

635
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
Excuse me.

636
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,560
Teach, teach, teach.

637
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,440
This isn't like Jackie Chan.

638
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,200
I have slid down zero buildings.

639
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,960
I have punched absolutely no helicopters.

640
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,320
Where's the part where I gotta go, whoa, and barely catch myself?

641
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,400
Where's Owen Wilson even at?

642
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
I don't know.

643
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,440
Was that the right Wilson?

644
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
Shanghai Noon.

645
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
Shanghai Nights.

646
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
Shanghai Nights, Shanghai Noon.

647
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
Justin, was that the right Wilson?

648
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
Sorry, say again?

649
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
Owen?

650
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
I don't know.

651
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
You have to ask Popo.

652
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,440
Okay.

653
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
And he thinks all white people are Owen Wilson?

654
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,440
He thinks all white people are Owen Wilson.

655
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
He is the worst.

656
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
Yeah, he really is.

657
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,480
At least he's an equal opportunity racist.

658
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,480
Yeah.

659
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
Okay.

660
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,520
So, in this lull, I would like to take this opportunity.

661
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
To acknowledge the lull?

662
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
I wrote.

663
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Oh, fuck.

664
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
Fuck.

665
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
I wrote a little something.

666
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,640
I asked everyone for some words.

667
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
And so I wrote.

668
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,640
Not a goof.

669
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
Like, we told you not to do this.

670
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,280
And so I wrote just a little Madeline.

671
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
No.

672
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,280
I'm not.

673
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,280
No.

674
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
I wrote a little thing that's special for you guys.

675
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
Because you're special.

676
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
Can we call them SadLibs officially?

677
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
Can we get the branding on SadLibs?

678
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,280
SadLibs?

679
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
So, I'm going to read this MadLib.

680
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
I'm not.

681
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,280
I'm going to go use the men's restroom.

682
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
I just wanted you guys to hear this.

683
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,280
Because I wrote it for you.

684
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,280
Because I love you.

685
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
I'm going to play Chrono Trigger on my iPhone.

686
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
I wrote it especially for Justin.

687
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,440
But Justin will hear it in the bathroom, I guess.

688
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
So here it is.

689
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:41,880
I hope you guys like it.

690
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,160
One jiggly candle night's eve, Diesel McGillicuddy was snorkeling

691
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,200
patiently in his lavender vestibule.

692
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
This is even worse when I'm with you.

693
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,940
Diesel was Santa's most tingly advisor, but his wankalicious

694
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,620
swagger landed him in the mongoose house.

695
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,840
Come in here, super creeps called Santa.

696
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
You've really outdone yourself.

697
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,840
Can anybody in here contribute to this?

698
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,240
Thank you, your most perfunctory haiku-ness, responded Diesel,

699
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,280
straightening his brassiere preposterously.

700
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,360
Not so bubbly, farted Santa.

701
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,880
This candle night's nonsense has side saddled long enough.

702
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,680
Six billion grape jalapeno smoothies, and on top of that, nine whole bubbles?

703
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,160
This is your last opus.

704
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,080
Luckily, right at that moment, Santa was arrested on charges related to Watergate.

705
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,720
The rarity of the anachronism ruined Camelites forever.

706
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
The end.

707
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
Thank you, everyone.

708
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
I love you.

709
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
Don't encourage it.

710
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
That sucks.

711
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
That's the worst.

712
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
It's the worst.

713
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
It's the pits.

714
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
It was bad.

715
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
Thank you for enjoying my art.

716
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:45,520
My hope is, in the future, that you will remember their faces.

717
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
You saw them, right?

718
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,440
It's so nice to be appreciated in my own lifetime, so I don't have to wait until after my tragic

719
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,680
death to be appreciated by those that love me.

720
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,360
Mad Libs are bad, and I don't like them.

721
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,360
They don't love you.

722
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,640
They hate us.

723
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,640
They just enjoy punishing.

724
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,640
Wow, just the worst.

725
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
That might have been the worst one.

726
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
I didn't even listen to it.

727
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,840
I've been working on that for two months.

728
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,040
Do you know how much worse it is when I have to hear people not being entertained as they

729
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
were doing it?

730
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
No, no.

731
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
They were rapped.

732
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,360
They were just so hard to pay attention, they weren't laughing.

733
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Were they rapped?

734
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
They were rapped.

735
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,080
Did you help them in your sway?

736
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,880
They were so focused.

737
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,320
They paid $10 to be talked to like children just now.

738
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,880
Crystal, don't laugh.

739
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,880
I don't want to miss a word.

740
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,560
Did you hear that?

741
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
He said Santa farted.

742
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
Oh, no.

743
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
I'm doing it myself.

744
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Oh, my God.

745
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
Can we move on?

746
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
Please.

747
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Well, I did have a second one.

748
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
Do you want me to go ahead and read that out loud?

749
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
I'll break this bottle in your head.

750
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
Fair enough.

751
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
Hey, dear brothers.

752
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
I'm about to move to a new city since...

753
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Oh, wait, wait.

754
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
First, before I start.

755
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,560
Is the Shazinator here?

756
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
Boom.

757
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
Hi.

758
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
What's going on?

759
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
Hey, everybody.

760
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
Hey, sweet sweatshirt.

761
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
That is a cool sweatshirt.

762
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Dear brothers.

763
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
I'm about to move to a new city since...

764
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
Oh, wait, wait.

765
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,560
First, before I start.

766
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
Is the Shazinator here?

767
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
Boom.

768
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
Hey, what's going on?

769
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
Hey, everybody.

770
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,560
Hey, sweet sweatshirt.

771
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,560
Dear brothers.

772
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
I'm about to move to a new city.

773
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
I don't know why anybody would want to leave Austin.

774
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
Don't.

775
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,560
Don't.

776
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
Alamo.

777
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Don't give him those cheap heels.

778
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,560
No?

779
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
No?

780
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Stars at night, big and bright?

781
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
His bottle's broken.

782
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
Does that work?

783
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
What?

784
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
Sorry.

785
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,560
My bottle was broken.

786
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
Go on.

787
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
How does it work?

788
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,560
How do you...

789
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
How does it work?

790
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
It goes like this.

791
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
The stars at night are big and bright.

792
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
Clap, clap, clap.

793
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
Deep in the heart of Texas.

794
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,560
That's great.

795
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,560
That was very...

796
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,560
That was a great show, too.

797
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
So if I said, we are?

798
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,560
Marshall.

799
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
Okay.

800
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,560
So it doesn't...

801
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
Boomer.

802
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
No.

803
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,560
Come on.

804
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,560
Don't do that here.

805
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
So, okay.

806
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Oh, yikes.

807
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
And then the crowd turned.

808
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,560
Sports team.

809
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
Let's hear it for sport.

810
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
Hey, please, guys.

811
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
You like our show.

812
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
Let's not pretend.

813
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,560
Okay.

814
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
There's super fans here.

815
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,520
Besides, I hear that was...

816
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,640
Your favorite sport is Mario Kart.

817
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
Nerd alert.

818
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,520
Did you see that My Brother, My Brother and Me show, the 7 o'clock one?

819
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
Yeah, it was good.

820
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,600
It started out real funny, then it sucked for like two minutes while Travis read his

821
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
thing.

822
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,640
And then it got super antagonistic afterwards.

823
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,760
They were like just egging on the audience.

824
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,160
I'm just going to start throwing like rotten peaches at you guys.

825
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,600
Dear brothers, I'm about to move to a new city.

826
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,800
And since finishing college, I've had difficulty meeting new people.

827
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,360
My boyfriend will help, but I'd like to space out my time with him as to not drive him crazy.

828
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,360
Nice.

829
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,360
Nice.

830
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,080
What are some good ways to meet friends?

831
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
What?

832
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,080
No, no.

833
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,080
Sorry.

834
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,080
Go ahead.

835
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,080
Sorry.

836
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
What are some good ways...

837
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,080
Oh, you think that might've been alienated for those of us with wives, right?

838
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
Yeah.

839
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
Yeah.

840
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Well.

841
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
I like to call that an emasculifies.

842
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,080
Yeah.

843
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
You are paying for that later.

844
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,640
That's an emasculifies for you guys.

845
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
She knows.

846
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,280
Luckily my girlfriend doesn't listen to the show.

847
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,240
She heard you were doing a sad live and she just couldn't break.

848
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,360
She couldn't see you fall apart like that.

849
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,680
So what are some good ways to meet friends in a new city?

850
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,680
I'm glad you asked.

851
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,680
I'm glad you asked.

852
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
Is Austin the city you just moved to?

853
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
Wait, I'm confused.

854
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,800
No, I'm moving to Albany, New York.

855
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Albany, New York.

856
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,640
That's the furthest from here.

857
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,120
Okay.

858
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,840
We had talked about this before and what we had agreed to do was to introduce you to everybody

859
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,900
in the audience.

860
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,000
One by one, it would be the rest of the show.

861
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,920
It has only just now occurred to me.

862
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
That's a dumb idea.

863
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,000
That's a stupid idea because you're all in Austin.

864
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,160
Anybody else here live in Albany?

865
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,160
No.

866
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,960
How many of you would be willing to move to Albany with her?

867
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,720
If she could take a group with her, the whole problem's solved.

868
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,400
I can offer you a $30 to $33 moving stipend.

869
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,160
If you can move with her to Albany right now.

870
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,520
We got like half a pizza backstage that, I don't know, will feed you on your trip.

871
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
I don't know.

872
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,840
That's what we'll do with pizza.

873
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,280
What's up with Albany?

874
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
Is it the skiing?

875
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
My boyfriend got a job.

876
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
At a ski lodge?

877
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
No.

878
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
I'm in it now.

879
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,280
I'm interested.

880
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,280
I want to get into your life.

881
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:12,880
Now he's in your story because we can't do the other thing.

882
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,880
What's a good way to meet friends?

883
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,000
Go to a live show in Albany and then they'll do a similar gift.

884
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,640
Go to my brother, my brother and me, Albany.

885
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
Which now we have to do.

886
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
We'll see you there on Tuesday.

887
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,640
We can just do a franchise.

888
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,320
We'll sell a franchise there and get three other brothers to do it.

889
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,440
We're the Schmackleroys.

890
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,120
We're McElroys too.

891
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,760
Like Gallagher.

892
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,160
I tell you, don't you do that sat-libs bit.

893
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,400
It's not because we have a copywriter.

894
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,000
We just don't want anybody else to have to go through it.

895
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's an art form.

896
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,280
You can do it.

897
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
Do you have anything to offer?

898
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
Like other people?

899
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,280
Jesus.

900
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,280
Wow.

901
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,280
I don't know.

902
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,280
Wow.

903
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,280
That's like super on the nose.

904
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
What are you?

905
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,560
Let me try that with a different tone of voice.

906
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
So what do you have to offer?

907
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
That's not still good enough though.

908
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
Now you're giving our job interview at a ski lodge.

909
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
What's wrong with you?

910
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
How are you with sloping?

911
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Are you a slope?

912
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,840
Are you a slopster?

913
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
That is ski terminology.

914
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
Yeah.

915
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
Okay.

916
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,760
Just go up to talk, talk to somebody you don't know.

917
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,760
That's the real trick of it.

918
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,120
That's what you people came to see, right?

919
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:26,640
The real hard hitting advice that only my brother, my brother and me can offer.

920
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,640
I don't know.

921
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,480
I'm pretty bad at getting to know people in new cities.

922
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,220
I like to have this install base there already.

923
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,640
Can you get on internet and use internet to, can you start just adding people on Facebook

924
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
who live in Albany?

925
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
Hi Pete.

926
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
I'm like half joking.

927
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
I hear you're a laid off dock worker.

928
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,640
Well, my name is me.

929
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,640
Can we be friends?

930
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,400
We are both one of the 99%.

931
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Let's be buds.

932
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Say it now you have something in common.

933
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
Griffin.

934
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
How about Yahoo?

935
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
Please.

936
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
Oh, we're burning right through them.

937
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
This one is sent in by Nefariousity.

938
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,400
He sent in like all of them.

939
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,980
Thank you Nefariousity.

940
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,980
You really killed it this week.

941
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,980
It's by Yahoo!

942
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:08,560
Answers user Y and then an exclamation point and it's so Siri and it got cut off, but I

943
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:14,120
imagine that is the Joker thing.

944
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:22,400
He asks, have you ever kissed like you invented it?

945
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,080
Does he mean like you kiss someone and then yell that's copyrighted?

946
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,080
Yeah.

947
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,760
Don't you try and do that to anybody else because that's mine.

948
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,600
I don't know that inventing it is the right word.

949
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,240
I've kissed like I've patented it.

950
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,000
I've kissed like I own the concept and IP firsthand.

951
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,880
I've kissed like I've made it my own.

952
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,880
Yeah.

953
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
Hey, only he kisses like that.

954
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,800
I kissed like I reinvented it.

955
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Yeah.

956
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,320
Who's ever been kissed him and like, what did you do?

957
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,320
What did you do?

958
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,120
What the hell was that?

959
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,160
That's usually not a good sign, gang.

960
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,280
We've been around for a few thousand years.

961
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,080
We've pretty much sussed out all the ways.

962
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,960
It's like you had a finger in your mouth.

963
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,960
What happened?

964
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,240
It was like a terrible, it was like kissing four thumbs.

965
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,520
It was incredible.

966
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,080
Weirdly roused.

967
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,520
How do you even know if you've kissed like you've invented it?

968
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
I've never got.

969
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,160
You feel like you've kissed like you invented it.

970
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
You're a douchebag.

971
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,160
Yeah.

972
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
Yeah.

973
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,320
Kiss like you invented it is my favorite Tim McGraw song.

974
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,080
I kissed like I barely grasped the concept.

975
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,720
You can kiss like you chopped and screwed it, like you remixed it.

976
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Yeah.

977
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
I like that a lot.

978
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Yeah.

979
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,600
Maybe while you're kissing a lady or boy, you like flip them around on your mouth.

980
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,600
You would have to lay on the ground.

981
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
Okay.

982
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
So like a sit and spin.

983
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,600
You're not talking about like a human centipede situation.

984
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
No, no, no.

985
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
It's mouth to mouth.

986
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,600
So that would be a human push me, pull you, if anything.

987
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Things got weird.

988
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
Wow.

989
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
Yeah.

990
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
Surprise.

991
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Hi.

992
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,120
It's our show.

993
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,300
Kiss like you.

994
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,300
Are there any answers?

995
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,200
Did anybody talk about kissing like they invented it?

996
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,080
Someone without a name said, I only wish I hadn't invented it.

997
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:14,880
Then I would have been the first to kiss those sweet, sweet lips.

998
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,520
Like the metaphorical sweet, sweet lips of humanity.

999
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,280
Like I get it.

1000
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,140
I brought love to the world.

1001
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,140
I'm the shining light.

1002
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,940
I'm the Prometheus of kissing.

1003
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,940
This is confusing.

1004
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,640
That is also the name of my band.

1005
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,520
The Prometheus of kissing.

1006
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,520
I haven't.

1007
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,520
I brought smooch down from the mountain.

1008
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
I stole smooch from the gods.

1009
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,520
And I've brought lip, lip, lip lockin' down to you Cubans.

1010
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
Oh yikes.

1011
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,520
Plebes.

1012
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
I didn't read these.

1013
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,520
Somebody said, hello, sir.

1014
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
Knew you'd ask something soon.

1015
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,520
Lol.

1016
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,520
No, I can't say that I have, unfortunately.

1017
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,520
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1018
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,520
Thanks for the input.

1019
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,520
Wait, knew you'd ask something soon?

1020
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,520
Yeah.

1021
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,520
I've been eyeballing your account for a while now just waiting for a little activity.

1022
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,520
You came out with a club banger.

1023
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Unfortunately, I have no input for you on this one.

1024
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,520
I wish I could respond in the affirmative.

1025
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
Yeah.

1026
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,520
I like to kiss them dang lips like I'm mad at them.

1027
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,520
No.

1028
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,520
I'm not a kissing expert as my wife will attest.

1029
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,520
Even I can tell you that's the wrong way of doing it.

1030
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
That's not.

1031
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,520
Come here.

1032
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,520
Stupid lips.

1033
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Hate your lips.

1034
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
Give me the sweet lips.

1035
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
Press them against my lips.

1036
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,520
Hold still.

1037
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,520
I hate your lips.

1038
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,520
Rub them on me.

1039
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
I'm chapped.

1040
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,520
I put some cherry lip sparklers on and rub them.

1041
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,520
I hate your lips.

1042
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,520
Is that like an angry Bill Cosby?

1043
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,520
I got devil pudding all over my lips.

1044
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,520
Rub them on there.

1045
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,520
You have to stop doing that voice.

1046
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,520
I want to do it.

1047
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,520
I've never kissed someone like Bill Cosby.

1048
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,520
I need to save my lips because I'm going to do a Scott bit on a Harry Belafonte record.

1049
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,520
Kiss my lips harder.

1050
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,520
I can't feel anything in there.

1051
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,520
They're frozen from the pudding pop.

1052
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:20,520
It sounds like Bill Cosby being drawn and quartered actually.

1053
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:26,520
I'll never turn my back on the Scots.

1054
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,520
Man, they were truly nice.

1055
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,520
I forget the quote.

1056
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,520
I don't remember the quote from Braveheart.

1057
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,520
Don't worry about it.

1058
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,520
Oh, fuck.

1059
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,520
Is that enough comedy yet?

1060
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,520
No.

1061
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,520
Never enough comedy.

1062
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
Come on.

1063
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,520
More comedy.

1064
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,520
It's like a comedy marathon.

1065
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
Hey, listen.

1066
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,520
It is every week, Travis.

1067
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,520
Every week.

1068
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:52,520
Hey, it is becoming more and more obvious that one of my best friends doesn't brush his teeth.

1069
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,520
Okay, so just so you know, this is not from someone here,

1070
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:00,520
but I would like to look around the room and see how many people just looked at their friends that they came with.

1071
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,520
God damn it, Dylan.

1072
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,520
His breath is so bad.

1073
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,520
How bad is it?

1074
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,520
It's so bad that I have to cover my mouth or hold my breath while he's talking to me.

1075
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,520
It sounds really bad.

1076
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,520
It's not like a good dozens bit.

1077
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,520
In a confined area, in a car, for example.

1078
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,520
Thank you, question asker, for clarifying confined area for me.

1079
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,520
Like a car or a shower or a closet.

1080
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,520
Or a small box.

1081
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,520
Car shower.

1082
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,520
A veterinary stand.

1083
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
Littlest pet shop.

1084
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,520
All of the other guys that we hang out with think the same thing.

1085
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,520
We want to tell him, but are not sure how to approach the matter.

1086
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,520
Do we straight up tell him?

1087
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
Chris.

1088
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,520
How do you not know that your mouth tastes bad with your own tongue that's in there?

1089
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,520
It's like spoiled hummus in there.

1090
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,520
I know, usually.

1091
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
I hate my mouth.

1092
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,520
Usually when we advise against it, it's like straight up telling someone something like,

1093
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,520
it's because, you know, it's like we're awkward and we don't want to bring it up.

1094
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,520
There is literally no way to bring this up that isn't this.

1095
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
Your breath stinks.

1096
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,520
Your breath fucking stinks.

1097
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
Brush your teeth.

1098
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,520
What are you doing?

1099
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,520
Get out of here, Cindy Mal Jones.

1100
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,520
Your teeth are your treasure, take care of them with a brush.

1101
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,520
Get a brush and pamper your...

1102
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
Pamper your teeth.

1103
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,520
Maybe you could set it up like a trust exercise and you brush his teeth and he brushes your teeth.

1104
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,520
And then you do it every day for the rest of his life.

1105
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,520
That was so nice, Stephen.

1106
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,520
Let's never stop.

1107
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,520
Do you...

1108
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
Can you guys...

1109
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
Let me see a show of hands.

1110
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,520
Would...

1111
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,520
If your breath...

1112
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,520
Who brushes their teeth?

1113
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,520
I only saw those two guys raise their hands.

1114
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,520
I'm not trying to call you all out, but good work you two.

1115
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
And gross everyone else.

1116
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,520
If your breath was so bad that people would write into a comedy advice show about it,

1117
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,520
knowing full well that they were going to really eviscerate your buddy,

1118
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,520
would you want to know?

1119
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
I mean, would you want someone to...

1120
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,520
Raise your hands.

1121
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,520
Let me see.

1122
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
Who would want their friend to tell them?

1123
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,520
Whoa.

1124
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Okay.

1125
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,520
So we see about half of these people want to live a lie.

1126
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,520
And the other half have stinky breath.

1127
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,520
Yeah.

1128
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
Not me.

1129
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,520
Not me.

1130
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,520
I think I would want them to tell me right before it got to that point

1131
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,520
where you wrote into a comedy advice podcast.

1132
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,520
Your bad breath is about to become a meme.

1133
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,520
I wanted to warn you ahead of time.

1134
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,520
Can you brush your teeth while they're sleeping?

1135
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Are they mouth breathers?

1136
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
Are they really heavy sleepers?

1137
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,520
Can you get one of those fish,

1138
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,520
those tiny fish in the ocean that clean off whales for them?

1139
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
Oh, right.

1140
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,520
Like a pilot fish.

1141
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,520
A pilot fish.

1142
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,520
A pilot fish.

1143
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,520
They live in your friend's mouth.

1144
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
You can't do that until they wake up.

1145
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,520
And then you're just standing over them and there's a fish in their mouth.

1146
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,520
Yeah.

1147
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,520
Yeah.

1148
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,520
Must be Tuesday.

1149
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
And then you got to say, gotcha!

1150
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,520
And run out of the room.

1151
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
Psych!

1152
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,520
I'll never see you again.

1153
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,520
I'm moving to a Midwestern city.

1154
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,520
What about one of those birds?

1155
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,520
Get one of them birds that...

1156
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
One of them rhino birds.

1157
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520
One of them rhino birds.

1158
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,520
There's so much wildlife that you can put right in there.

1159
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,520
Get one of those rhino birds to get the fish out of their mouth.

1160
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,520
It's a cuckoo bird.

1161
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,520
That mouth smells like fish.

1162
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
Your mouth smells like fish.

1163
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,520
I'm going to eat the fish out of your mouth and you got to clean your teeth.

1164
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,520
Then I'm going to eat the other things on your teeth.

1165
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,520
Maybe you wait until they do something really awesome and you're like,

1166
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,520
oh, that's a really great haircut.

1167
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,520
And also your breath stinks.

1168
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
You're saying...

1169
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,520
And so that way they're going like that.

1170
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,520
Oh.

1171
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,520
Miracle Max style.

1172
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,520
You give a little chocolate coat and it makes it go down.

1173
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,520
Yeah.

1174
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
Yeah.

1175
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,520
Right.

1176
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,520
I like beautiful new shoes.

1177
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
Also your breath stinks.

1178
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,520
You probably shouldn't say it like Eddie Griffin.

1179
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,520
Just for the record.

1180
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,520
You probably shouldn't say, hey, yo, your breath stinks.

1181
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,520
Maybe get their celebrity like hero to say it to them.

1182
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,520
Oh, that'll be much better.

1183
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,520
Hi, I'm Scott Bakula.

1184
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
And God damn, your breath.

1185
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
I don't know what's going on in there, bro.

1186
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,520
But God damn.

1187
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,520
Hi, I'm Jeff Goldblum.

1188
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,520
I'm Jeff Goldblum, but I don't like it in there.

1189
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,520
I do not like it very much.

1190
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,520
No, thanks.

1191
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,520
Can you wait until they're 85 and have been lonely their whole life and then

1192
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,520
they come to you and ask why and then you drop it on them.

1193
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,520
Can I not tell you?

1194
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,520
Oh, sorry.

1195
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,520
I meant to tell you when we're 25.

1196
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,520
Can you pretend that you are them time traveling back from the future to tell

1197
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,520
them that their breath smells bad?

1198
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,520
I know that that's my answer to a lot of questions, right?

1199
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,520
Thank God I found you.

1200
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,520
If it's not too late, you're going to meet queen, some queen.

1201
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,520
Queen Elizabeth, is she still alive?

1202
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,520
Yeah.

1203
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,520
Okay.

1204
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,520
You're going to meet the baron queen.

1205
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,520
You're going to meet queen and Paul Rogers.

1206
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,520
This is a reach toothbrush.

1207
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,520
Fucking use it.

1208
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
Oh wait, you can do that now in the present.

1209
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,520
That's his friend.

1210
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
Just hand him a reach tooth.

1211
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,520
I went with my new dentist and he has a movie he'd like to show you.

1212
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,520
Get him a reach toothbrush for Christmas.

1213
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
This is not joke time anymore.

1214
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,520
You have to take care of your friend's mouth.

1215
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
Yeah, this goes past like my friend chews too loudly.

1216
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,520
Like your friend's got mouth problems.

1217
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
Serious ginger fighter problems.

1218
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
Take it from someone whose gums have bled.

1219
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
Oh God.

1220
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,520
You're doing him a favor.

1221
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
Gross.

1222
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,520
Hey, how did you-

1223
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,520
Now you know two secrets about Travis.

1224
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,520
Yeah.

1225
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,520
It's getting a little too real in here.

1226
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,520
Come for the eggnog, stay for the terrible revelations.

1227
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,520
How was that eggnog everybody?

1228
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,520
Did everybody get eggnog?

1229
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,520
Yeah.

1230
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,520
Do you want to brush your teeth now?

1231
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,520
Too bad.

1232
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,520
We thought we'd get you really heavy with eggnog humors before you.

1233
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,520
How about a Yahoo?

1234
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,520
Yeah, please.

1235
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,520
This one is sent in by Galiayali.

1236
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,520
Thanks, Galiayali.

1237
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user FashionA and then it cuts off.

1238
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,520
So I don't know guys.

1239
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,520
I printed these out.

1240
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,520
I'm sorry.

1241
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:24,520
FashionA ellipses asks, where can I find the hottest sexy Santa outfit?

1242
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,520
That's at the end of the question.

1243
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,520
Oh, okay.

1244
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,520
They can borrow mine.

1245
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,520
Your sexy walking Phoenix outfit.

1246
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,520
If they promise not to stretch it out.

1247
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,520
Is it tight in all the right places?

1248
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
All the right places.

1249
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,520
I would actually call those wrong places.

1250
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,520
I prefer your clothes to be loose fitting in those places.

1251
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:51,520
Don't you, I mean, can you make it, can you start with, it's entirely possible to start

1252
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,520
with a not sexy Santa outfit and then with some scissors and some imagination.

1253
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,520
You're going to play, you're going to pay really upmarket prices for a sexy Santa outfit.

1254
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,520
You can make it home really easily.

1255
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,520
Hey, where are your valuable bits?

1256
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,520
Just cut holes there and then we can see them and then, that's pretty sexy.

1257
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,520
That's just really upfront Santa.

1258
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,520
That's weird.

1259
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,520
That's not sexy.

1260
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,520
It's not sexy to be like, look at these.

1261
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,520
You're wearing a Santa smock, but I can see both your boobles.

1262
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:21,520
It's like almost a Santa outfit except your balls are really prominent.

1263
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,520
You've just been really upfront about your balls.

1264
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,520
And then they're just out there.

1265
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,520
You know, my favorite holiday song is I saw mommy grazing Santa Claus.

1266
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,520
That's the problem.

1267
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,520
If you just cut a hole for your balls, it's like, okay, present.

1268
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,520
And then you're just standing there.

1269
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,520
Is it sexy yet?

1270
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,520
I didn't plan past this.

1271
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,520
I don't have an exit strategy.

1272
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,520
I was going to do the two hand cup and shuffle off.

1273
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,520
Okay, the one hand cup.

1274
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,520
The one hand cup.

1275
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,520
Yeah, okay.

1276
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:00,520
I had a weird childhood and subsequently any Santa outfit's a sexy Santa outfit to me.

1277
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,520
I had some things go, it broke bad.

1278
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,520
Let's just put it that way.

1279
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,520
And I can't see.

1280
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,520
You can't catch a whiff of the smell of Ho Ho's beer.

1281
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,520
If I smell frankincense, burr, it's just whoop.

1282
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:23,520
I just want to, I just noticed this question does not say where can I find a sexy Santa Claus outfit.

1283
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,520
It says, where can I find the hottest sexy Santa Claus outfit?

1284
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:35,520
Meaning some clerk or salesperson has presented a sexy Santa Claus costume to them and they said, no, that's not it.

1285
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,520
Nope.

1286
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,520
Nope.

1287
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,520
I need hotter damn it.

1288
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,520
Hotter.

1289
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,520
Hell no when I see it.

1290
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,520
It's not sexy enough.

1291
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,520
Sexy or moral.

1292
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,520
There's no way I'm getting this promotion.

1293
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,520
Can you just low ride a regular Santa outfit so that people can see the back goods?

1294
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,520
The what?

1295
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,520
The goods on the back.

1296
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,520
The goods that you have on the back end.

1297
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,520
So that way you can back it up and make it shake like a bowl full of jelly.

1298
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,520
That's the fucking grossest thing you've ever said to me.

1299
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,520
That's the fucking grossest thing you've ever said right to my face.

1300
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,520
You've said, you've said some things too.

1301
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,520
You've said some shit.

1302
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,520
You've said some things sir.

1303
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,520
Are there any answers?

1304
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,520
Did anybody have any suggestions?

1305
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,520
Somebody says, oh, there's this place called the Naughty Nook.

1306
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,520
You might want to see if there's one in your area.

1307
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,520
Someone says, Fredericks has one too.

1308
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,520
Hit up your local Fredericks.

1309
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,520
Hey internet, stop helping these people.

1310
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,520
The proper response when you see that is close the tab.

1311
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:41,520
Don't like further push them down this road over this horrifying bath they've started out.

1312
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,520
There's a chance if you wear a sexy Santa outfit, there is a chance.

1313
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,520
Slim though it may be, passing motors, whatever.

1314
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,520
Some kid may see you and that's it.

1315
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,520
That's it for him.

1316
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,520
That's it.

1317
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,520
Then he converts, right?

1318
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,520
Something happened to me.

1319
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,520
I mean, I'm a quantum man now.

1320
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,520
I want you guys to follow me here.

1321
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,520
But the only thing that gets me through questions like these is to think that I believe in alternate realities.

1322
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,520
In some way, there's an alternate reality Yahoo answers question that says,

1323
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,520
where can I find the most modest nonchalant Santa outfit?

1324
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,520
I am Santa in my child's school play.

1325
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,520
I'm trying to be a good person.

1326
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:24,520
Where can I find a Santa outfit that will hide my balls?

1327
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,520
Every Santa outfit I've come across has been too revealing.

1328
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,520
I need it to hide my balls the best.

1329
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,520
I need so much coverage down there that it looks like I have panic and then you circled back around.

1330
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,520
Now you're terrible again.

1331
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,520
I need the most chaste Santa costumes.

1332
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,520
The holiest of holy of Santa costumes.

1333
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,520
Excuse me, where do you have the Santa costumes that include burqas?

1334
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,520
I need one of those.

1335
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,520
I need to hide everything.

1336
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:55,520
Can we try to acknowledge the situation within which one would need a sexy Santa outfit?

1337
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,520
Because it's not for a school play and it's not for Christmas morning.

1338
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:03,520
Are there a group of people who want to fuck Santa Claus?

1339
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,520
Is that somebody's thing?

1340
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,520
Is that somebody's dish?

1341
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,520
Have you heard the song Santa Baby?

1342
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,520
That's what it is.

1343
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,520
I don't like this world that you're introducing.

1344
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,520
I'm amazed that somebody wants to punch line to some sort of down your chimney gag and that's what they're wearing.

1345
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,520
Jingle balls.

1346
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,520
That's an awfully big investment for one goof.

1347
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:30,520
When it comes to dealing with my fellow co-workers, I tend to have a rather difficult time with the volume of my voice.

1348
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:38,520
I usually mumble quietly even when just saying excuse me or I'm sorry and fear the day I might try to say something and just end up yelling.

1349
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,520
Is there...

1350
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,520
So the problem is like they're saving it all up and one day the dam will break.

1351
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,520
Here comes my volume.

1352
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,520
They won't be able to stop yelling.

1353
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,520
They're just going to Care Bear stare the person's ears right off.

1354
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:55,520
Is there a simple solution or should I just start giving awkward stares with my mumbles?

1355
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,520
Just talk normal.

1356
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,520
Just talk like a person.

1357
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,520
Listen to how we're talking and then emulate us except for the subject matter.

1358
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,520
Slightly quieter.

1359
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,520
A little quieter.

1360
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,520
We're doing a live performance like quieter than this.

1361
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,520
But still like there is a simple solution.

1362
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,520
Talk like a person.

1363
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,520
Talk like a grown up.

1364
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,520
Or.

1365
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,520
Or.

1366
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,520
Unless.

1367
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,520
Unless.

1368
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,520
Just talk loud all the time.

1369
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,520
Yell all the time.

1370
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,520
Yelly Steve.

1371
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,520
Yelly Steve the office's town crier.

1372
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,520
Or.

1373
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,520
Or.

1374
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,520
Don't talk at all.

1375
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,520
Just stop talking.

1376
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,520
Monkey Steve.

1377
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,520
When someone bumps you in the hallway just stare at them.

1378
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,520
They'll never bump you again.

1379
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,520
Yeah because you're fired.

1380
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,520
Excuse me Johnson.

1381
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,520
Johnson.

1382
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,520
Johnson.

1383
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,520
Johnson.

1384
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,520
Johnson.

1385
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,520
Johnson come back.

1386
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,520
Johnson.

1387
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,520
Johnson.

1388
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,520
Johnson.

1389
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,520
Johnson.

1390
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,520
Johnson.

1391
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,520
Johnson.

1392
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,520
Keep doing it.

1393
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,520
Johnson.

1394
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,520
This is good.

1395
00:48:54,520 --> 00:49:02,520
I think the audience is thinking when's Griffin going to do his terrible bit.

1396
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,520
You'll have to come back at nine to see that.

1397
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,520
I think if this person is if their worry is like I try to control the sound of my voice

1398
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:14,520
so that I don't like freak out my other employees then I would say that you're already doing

1399
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,520
that because you're the quiet mumbly guy that everyone's afraid of.

1400
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,520
When people say like.

1401
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,520
Don't.

1402
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,520
Don't bump Steve.

1403
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,520
Whatever you do.

1404
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,520
I don't know what his plan is but he's making a list.

1405
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,520
Right.

1406
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,520
Checking it twice.

1407
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,520
In the sexiest Santa costume he could find.

1408
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,520
If you.

1409
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,520
If you.

1410
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,520
Yeah you're already that guy.

1411
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,520
When they talk about the last one you'd ever suspect to do something like this they're

1412
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,520
not talking about you.

1413
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,520
You're the first one they suspect to do exactly what you're.

1414
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,520
Oh.

1415
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,520
The bad news is if you start being loud now.

1416
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,520
Now you've made the jump to the other side.

1417
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,520
Like now he's just screaming all the time.

1418
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,520
He was quiet for like three years and now he's screaming.

1419
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,520
I feel like the fuse is lit.

1420
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,520
Yeah that damn is about to break.

1421
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,520
You need to treat him with kid gloves.

1422
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,520
And maybe you quit your job and start a new job as the normal guy.

1423
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,520
Yeah.

1424
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,520
Regular guy.

1425
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,520
And maybe disappointing for them too if you just talk about dumb shit all the time and

1426
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,520
then be like oh that's what you were saying.

1427
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,520
That whole time.

1428
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,520
I'm sure he's doing mad lips over and over again.

1429
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,520
I'm sure he doesn't say dumb shit though.

1430
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,520
He's a listener.

1431
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,520
He's very dear.

1432
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,520
He's very dear to me.

1433
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,520
Maybe start saying dumb shit really loudly.

1434
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,520
I forgot we were talking.

1435
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,520
Some people will be like go back to mumbling.

1436
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,520
Yeah.

1437
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,520
I forgot we were talking about a person.

1438
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,520
I just hope he doesn't mumble when he tells them to listen to My Brother.

1439
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,520
My Brother made this great podcast he loves so much.

1440
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,520
If you say the title of a podcast it sounds like you're mumbling.

1441
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,520
It does kind of.

1442
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,520
That's why we haven't had more mainstream success.

1443
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:39,520
Because whenever the anchors or like Ryan Seacrest mentions our show it's all sort of

1444
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,520
down here.

1445
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,520
I don't know who that is.

1446
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,520
Do you want another yahoo?

1447
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,520
Yeah we got time for one more.

1448
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,520
There's one I sent in by It's 756 Trends.

1449
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:53,520
By yahoo answers user Lynn W who asks my cat's ghost is haunting me.

1450
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,520
My cat committed suicide three days ago.

1451
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,520
Now she's haunting me.

1452
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,520
Help.

1453
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:06,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1454
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,520
First off oh god there's so many first offs.

1455
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,520
But I think the main first off is if your cat.

1456
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,520
Is that the whole question?

1457
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:16,520
Yeah if your cat committed suicide it does not get to haunt you because that was in it's

1458
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:20,520
own paws if that's the situation.

1459
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,520
First as we all know suicide is straight to cat hell.

1460
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,520
I mean it's in the Bible.

1461
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,520
Cat Bible.

1462
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:30,520
I would love to see that episode of like cat CSI like no we're ruling this one a suicide.

1463
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,520
Yeah.

1464
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,520
Based on what?

1465
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:38,520
Wait okay can you not double up on the fucking craziness of cat ghost and cat suicide with

1466
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,520
cat CSI please.

1467
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,520
Spoiler to everybody the C stands for cat.

1468
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:48,520
I can't tell you about S and I but I'm pretty sure and meow is in there.

1469
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,520
I thought he could withstand the fall.

1470
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:57,520
I guess he was a real pussy.

1471
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,520
I liked it.

1472
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,520
Looks like we're gonna have to catnip this one in the bud.

1473
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,520
Okay.

1474
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,520
Justin let the circle be unbroken.

1475
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:19,520
This is the perfect crime.

1476
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:25,520

Don't treat yourself.

1483
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,520
They cost money.

1484
