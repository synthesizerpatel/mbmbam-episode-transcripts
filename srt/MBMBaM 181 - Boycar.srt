1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:48,240
Hello, and welcome to my brother and my brother made an advice show for the modern era. I'm

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,680
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,160
I'm your baby-est baby, Griffin McElroy. A lot of times people ask us, how do you

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,920
guys record the show? How do you capture the magic? How do you capture it? It seems like

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,080
you're in the same room, and I have to convince them, but no, in fact, we are in separate rooms.

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,480
Separate states?

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,560
Separate states, separate time zones.

12
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,000
Separate, like, states of mind and general levels of professionalism,

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
I guess is fair to say. Preparedness.

14
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,520
Say professionalism.

15
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,640
Yeah, I think that's probably-

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,120
Listen, some of us got waylaid on the way to recording because they stopped to be a

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,120
Good Samaritan because a woman's car died and they pushed it single-handedly into a

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,520
parking lot.

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,080
Now, let me tell you something, Travis, because you told that story,

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,160
but you also said that you straight up forgot.

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,360
Oh no, also that too. It's not like I was on my way home to record.

22
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,680
I was just on my way home to nap.

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,640
You definitely forgot.

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,120
You definitely-

25
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,000
For sure forgot.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,960
Definitely forgot.

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,560
But then I turned on my computer and it worked perfectly right away.

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,720
Yeah. Justin's downloaded far too much World of Warcraft porn

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,400
that he found on an internet website.

30
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,280
Like, DigiPorn of World of Warcraft characters, and now-

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,920
Yeah, you can put anything into Google.

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,840
For a long time, I thought there were more rules.

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,280
But you can type whatever in and it'll deliver.

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,120
You can pretty much type whatever you want in there.

35
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,240
My thing was-

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,880
My computer has been waylaid by the fine folks at Comcast.

37
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,920
They tried to convince me today that below one megabyte of downloadable speed

38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,560
is not bad, not too bad.

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,520
My thing, my story is that I was here on time with a computer that worked perfectly.

40
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,080
So I guess it's not as fun or relevant.

41
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,640
But, driven, you also have all those dark spots on your soul.

42
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,640
I do have those, but those don't really-

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,640
I guess they come through in some form in the recording sesh,

44
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,480
but otherwise I am fucking Stevie Wonder in here

45
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,360
in terms of professionalism and preparedness.

46
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
That's my secret to a good podcast.

47
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,880
You know nothing about Stevie Wonder's professionalism.

48
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,480
As long as 33, 33.3% repeating of the podcast performers

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,280
have that Stevie Wonder level of professionalism and preparedness,

50
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,240
you're in for a good epit.

51
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,440
Yeah, that's all it takes.

52
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,200
We can be a third on our game and still-

53
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,160
Hey guys, I got two shoulders to carry both of you over.

54
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,440
One for each shoulder.

55
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,480
Brother, my brother and me.

56
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,560
One working computer and two working shoulders.

57
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,920
It's the show of the year here.

58
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,240
Travis's computer works, Travis's computer works,

59
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,960
but the fucking scheduler app on his iPhone does not, apparently,

60
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,720
or his watch, which was it, Trav?

61
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,360
Your watch, your crap.

62
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,200
I don't own a watch, Griffin.

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,720
Boom, shakalaka.

64
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,240
Okay, you took him downtown.

65
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,200
Anyway, we're not here to complain about us.

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,320
We're here to complain about you.

67
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,880
About you.

68
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,280
Can I be here to complain about us?

69
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,360
Yeah, I mean, you can complain,

70
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,400
but let's make it a post-show sort of situation.

71
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,800
I got a lot of things on the docket.

72
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,560
We'll talk about it in couples counseling.

73
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,600
Okay, triples.

74
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,480
Triples counseling.

75
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,280
Here's our first question.

76
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,360
Is it okay to walk up to a drive-through window to order my food?

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,080
I don't have a car, but I'm often walking around town

78
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
where many drive-through chains are located.

79
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,640
Would it be weird if I were to use the drive-through windows on foot

80
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,320
or maybe on a bike or something?

81
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,160
In our town, the lines are usually longer than the lines at the window,

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,880
and I don't want to have to go through all the trouble

83
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,240
of buying food inside the restaurant

84
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,920
when I'm leaving immediately afterwards.

85
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,120
Am I being weird?

86
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040
That's from walking in Wisconsin.

87
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,640
Listen, I don't want to poke a hole in this,

88
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,680
but it won't work.

89
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,960
Yeah, a lot of places won't serve you.

90
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,720
No, no, I mean, like, physically, physics-wise,

91
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,360
there's a weight sensor that alerts them

92
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,960
that there's a car there

93
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,040
that you're just not going to be able to trigger.

94
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,520
This person's super fucking fat, you don't know.

95
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,800
Okay, I didn't think of that.

96
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,440
They love fast food, but they also love walking,

97
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,000
so I don't know.

98
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,120
Maybe just carry some barbells with you

99
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,680
and just fucking slam it Thor-style on the ground.

100
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,080
That would also help you burn off the hardies.

101
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,320
I don't think that's a way to entreat service.

102
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,480
I don't think slamming barbells.

103
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,920
Bring me burgers!

104
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,720
I don't think that you're going to be...

105
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,560
If you went with a group of friends

106
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,720
and you all pretended you were an invisible car,

107
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,240
they'd probably feel bad enough

108
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,600
for you to throw you some chicken nubs.

109
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,160
Yeah, like a mime car.

110
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,480
You could be like a post-modern art car.

111
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,920
Okay, but mine car's not going to set off

112
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,360
the weight thing, is it?

113
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,200
Well, if you all stand on each other's shoulders

114
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,560
and jump up and down real quick.

115
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,600
Yeah, like you're in a car.

116
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,960
What are you talking about?

117
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,480
Well, I mean, you just got to concentrate

118
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,760
the weight into one spot.

119
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,440
I think the question, are you being weird?

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,480
Yes.

121
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,600
Yes, but does that mean it's bad?

122
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,480
That's for cars.

123
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,320
Try to imagine this in your head.

124
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,160
You've walked through this little scenario,

125
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,000
but I don't think you fully considered the part

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,440
where you're in line with other cars as a person.

127
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,480
Like slowly walking up as the line scoots forward

128
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,120
and you're standing there like you're a car.

129
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,560
What's important is that you have to do that thing

130
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,320
where it looks like you're sitting down in the seat

131
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,840
with your hand on the steering wheel.

132
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
And then when somebody pulls up too close to you,

133
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,240
you got to spin around and start yelling at them silently

134
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,600
and like waving your hand at them.

135
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,520
And it's probably important.

136
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,040
It's probably good to say like,

137
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,960
puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh.

138
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,160
And kind of bounce a little bit.

139
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,680
So they know the car is still running.

140
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,200
Won't the illusion be like cast off though

141
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,480
once the person behind you

142
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,560
inevitably tries to run over you?

143
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,600
No, you're in a smart car.

144
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,360
I guess like-

145
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,320
They're very tiny.

146
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,960
They're very tiny.

147
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,080
Can you go through a drive-through?

148
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,280
They're very tiny.

149
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,800
Can you go through a drive-through on a Segway?

150
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,840
What if you went through on a bicycle

151
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,320
in which you built a cardboard car around

152
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,160
and no one can tell the difference?

153
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,760
If the concern is being weird,

154
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,480
I think you've firmly veered into that territory.

155
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,120
Go on one of those bikes and stacked on top of another bike.

156
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,960
That's not a thing.

157
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Oh, yes it is, Justin.

158
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,240
Someone's welded a bike frame on top of a bike frame

159
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,080
and it's like two bikes frames tall.

160
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,720
That's a thing.

161
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,920
Another solution is you go to the Taco Bell

162
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,280
and you get some spicy sauce.

163
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,320
Drain that in your mouth

164
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,680
and then you'll turn into a hot rod

165
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,640
like that one cartoon.

166
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,120
Are you talking about Turbo Teen?

167
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

168
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,080
It's been like 140 episodes

169
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,560
since our last Turbo Teen reference.

170
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,840
Welcome back, Turbo Teen.

171
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,080
It's a Candle Nights miracle.

172
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,720
That's a franchise.

173
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,560
Talking about Turbo Teen again.

174
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,480
That is a franchise that is just itching

175
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,720
and raring and roaring for a reboot.

176
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,760
Gotta get a Turbo Teen.

177
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,040
Shia LaBeouf cast him in that.

178
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,640
That's what I'm saying.

179
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,880
He's obviously shown his prowess at being in movies

180
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,520
where cars turn into other shit and vice versa.

181
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,640
So you think you want to see Shia LaBeouf?

182
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,160
I don't want to pigeonhole LaBeouf,

183
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,400
but I think that in the light of recent controversy,

184
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,240
we should try and get the kid back in the picture.

185
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,320
He wants to get into a family-friendly picture

186
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,240
like Turbo Teen 2000.

187
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,760
But here's the thing, Shia, tips from us to you.

188
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,320
You need to make sure to call that thing Turbo Teen

189
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,600
and you need to make sure to license the Turbo Teen license

190
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,880
from whoever does own that.

191
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,440
Don't just write a movie called Boy Car

192
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,240
about a boy that eats hot sauce and turns into cars.

193
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,360
Yo, I'm back with another Shia LaBeouf ridge.

194
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,680
It's called Boy Car.

195
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,000
It's called Vroom Boy.

196
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,480
Apparently Shia LaBeouf,

197
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,240
whenever he did get into this hot water,

198
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,680
and by the way, I love Shia LaBeouf.

199
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,560
I don't, I think he's great, whatever he's doing.

200
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,400
Even Stevens, Transformers,

201
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,520
that one Sigur Ros music video where he got his dick out.

202
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,640
I'm a big fan of all of those things.

203
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,760
Do you think when that stuff broke bad with Shia,

204
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,080
fellow Even Stevens star, Beans,

205
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,000
thought maybe it was time for Beans to send in,

206
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,200
time for Beans to make his play at the big show?

207
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,200
Travis, if you don't stop sending us fucking pictures

208
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,400
of giant bicycles, I'm quitting the show.

209
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,640
It's Bike on Top of Bikes on Top of Bikes.

210
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,200
Yeah.

211
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,280
Travis, I'm quitting the show.

212
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,320
You said it wasn't a thing.

213
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,680
I'm gonna school you, son.

214
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,320
Yeah, well, I love this school.

215
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,960
Welcome to Travis McElroy's School for Audio Podcasts.

216
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,160
Here's where listeners come to be educated

217
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,120
about things they can't see.

218
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,680
You guys know Yahoo?

219
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,080
Por favor.

220
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,600
Don't do this thing, by the way.

221
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,680
Just go inside and wait in the line like an adult.

222
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,400
I feel bad.

223
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,440
Just go inside and wait in the line.

224
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,800
Isn't it weird that we choose a rando celeb

225
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,000
to beat up on every week,

226
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,080
and I genuinely don't like that part of the show.

227
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,640
I feel like of all the ones we've done, though,

228
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,160
Shia LaBeouf, he's still got a lot of power behind him.

229
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,240
I feel the worst about Shia LaBeouf, though,

230
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,760
because he's already getting it from all sides,

231
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,040
front, back, left, and right.

232
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,440
We should pick someone who's on top who's a darling

233
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,520
and be like, fuck you, Jennifer Lawrence.

234
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,560
But here's the thing.

235
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,240
Now you watch your mouth.

236
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,320
She's America's sweetheart.

237
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,160
I feel like with Shia, what's good about that

238
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,120
is we didn't want to be timely with making fun of Shia,

239
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,920
so we waited until the wound might conceivably

240
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,280
have started to heal.

241
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,560
And then we go back in.

242
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,440
We start digging.

243
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,880
Is this a fresh scab here?

244
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,080
Let us just check this out.

245
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,200
I feel kind of terrible, and I will for the rest of the episode.

246
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,560
Shia, if you're listening, we're sorry.

247
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,120
We left you an even deeper grave.

248
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,200
This is why we can't build a celebrity fan base,

249
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,640
because everybody's a friend of everybody.

250
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,040
Yeah, because we've made fun of everybody at this point.

251
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,720
Do you guys want to Yahoo this one?

252
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,200
Yes, you do.

253
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,400
This one is sent in by Jacob Harrison.

254
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,960
Thanks, Jacob.

255
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,960
It's by Yahoo answer chooser Chris, who asks,

256
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,480
how can I write a review for a McDonald's employee?

257
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,440
I went to my local McDonald's today

258
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,880
and one of the employees really stood out

259
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,760
from the rest of the team.

260
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,760
He was extremely kind.

261
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,360
And we actually had a conversation.

262
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
His positive energy really brightened my day.

263
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,720
I was hoping to tell his manager how good of an employee he is

264
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,880
so that maybe he could get a raise or something,

265
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,800
but I don't want to tell the manager in person.

266
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,840
Does anyone know if there is like a writer review section

267
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,960
on the McDonald's website?

268
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,320
I prefer it to be anonymous.

269
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,920
Also, would that be possible?

270
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,360
Also, does anyone know if I can do this for Chipotle?

271
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,040
He doesn't want to get bogged down in some sort of

272
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,120
single white female situation

273
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,880
where this employee becomes obsessed with him

274
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,600
and his kindness.

275
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,520
I laughed and I'm sorry I laughed because

276
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,200
We've had this experience.

277
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,400
Everybody's had this experience.

278
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,280
The fact of the matter is like,

279
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,560
dude working at McDonald's, fucking kudos.

280
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
Awesome for you that you're going out of your way

281
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,720
to make the dude coming into McDonald's have a good day

282
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,840
and you're smiling and it's great.

283
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,760
I laughed because what's your day like

284
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,760
in which it was made because that guy at McDonald's

285
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,880
really took the time.

286
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,080
Who the fuck are you?

287
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,400
No, you're telling me that when you have this experience,

288
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
to me it is as bad as when you go to McDonald's

289
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,040
and you have a really shitty experience with an employee

290
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,560
and you know like, ah, there is no recourse for,

291
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,200
there is no way that I can inform this person.

292
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,880
No, I'm sorry, what world do you live in

293
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,040
in which you do not walk out the doors in your life?

294
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
Whoop, clean slate style.

295
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,400
It was a brand new day.

296
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,560
Like I can't remember the faces of people

297
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,160
I've seen in the McDonald's.

298
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,280
Well that's because you're a sociopath.

299
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,120
The person that I am inside the McDonald's

300
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,360
is not the person I was before or after.

301
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,600
He's more full.

302
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,360
If you meet a stranger, and that stranger,

303
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,600
regardless of what the circumstance is,

304
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,080
but especially if they have overcome the adversity

305
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,360
of being like in McDonald's the whole day.

306
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,120
Like we've talked about how horrible it is

307
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,440
like crossing the threshold of a fast food restaurant.

308
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,600
These people do this for 10 to 12 hours a day, right?

309
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,960
If you meet somebody like that

310
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,240
and you have a great convo with them

311
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,160
who has overcome the adversity of McDonald's

312
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,040
to have like a really great convo with you.

313
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
Then it's just two ships passing.

314
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,960
You move off into the night,

315
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
they had a nice moment, you had a nice moment,

316
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,840
and then you eat your McDouble in your silent peace.

317
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,000
But this is why, Travis, people like you

318
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,440
are why things never get better.

319
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,000
Right.

320
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,800
Because you don't get kudos for being nice

321
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,000
and what's the point?

322
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,280
No, because the other side of that

323
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,920
is I also accept their right to be shitty to me

324
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,000
because they're stuck in a McDonald's.

325
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,880
This is the thing though.

326
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,320
If we started expecting more

327
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,960
from minimum wage employees,

328
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,120
then we'd have to start demanding to pay them more.

329
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,000
And then the whole rising tide and ships.

330
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,200
There's a lot of nautical references going on right now.

331
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,560
But listen, Travis,

332
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,160
I don't think you're measuring your life in love.

333
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,120
I don't think if you have this experience with a person.

334
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
600 burgers.

335
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,400
If you have this experience

336
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,720
and you don't walk away from it talking to,

337
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,800
you don't tell Teresa when you get home,

338
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,840
oh, the McDonald's guy said something really nice

339
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,040
about my jacket.

340
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,000
Like, what are you fucking doing?

341
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,480
No, because that requires me the other thousand times

342
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,120
to come in and be like,

343
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,440
they're really snotty to me at McDonald's again.

344
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,240
Well, that's what I'm saying.

345
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,720
I feel like judging from the experiences

346
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,560
I've had with other McDonald's employees

347
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,480
at our local, like my McDonald's, like my Mickey D's,

348
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,640
if someone said, hey, this guy was really nice to me,

349
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,600
you would probably be fired for messing up the curve.

350
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,520
The people at my McDonald's are like openly hostile.

351
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,840
Like they have embraced their situation.

352
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,360
And this may surprise you,

353
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,680
a lot of turnover at that McDonald's.

354
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,960
And a lot of Apple turnovers.

355
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,240
Turnovers, thank you.

356
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,720
You guys suck.

357
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,600
But here's the thing is like, that's their right.

358
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,800
Like I figured that's the McDonald's tip.

359
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
You know, I don't give you extra money.

360
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,960
So yeah, you can be really snotty to me

361
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,920
because I'm the one in there ordering the ranch.

362
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,040
This is what I'm saying.

363
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,720
But Travis, this is what I'm saying to you.

364
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,480
And follow me here.

365
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,520
Follow me with this.

366
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,520
What we've accepted, what your rationale

367
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,720
that you've accepted is,

368
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,520
well, these are really terrible jobs.

369
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,560
And so the people at them have a right to be hostile.

370
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,120
And I can see there's a certain logic to that.

371
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,400
I think that's fair.

372
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,080
But what you're denying is the fact

373
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,560
that what we've done is basically create a system

374
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,400
where people are in jobs that are so bad

375
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,280
that we have built for ourselves

376
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,680
several unpleasant experiences

377
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,760
that we are going to have every day.

378
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,640
Imagine if we were like paying people decently

379
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,320
and they actually were like really gave

380
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,160
like copious shit about their job.

381
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,440
Thank you, Joseph Stalin.

382
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,000
I agree.

383
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,440
We should pay everyone better.

384
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,280
We should all be on an equal level.

385
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,000
That's just not the way the world works, Daisy Mae.

386
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,520
It sounds like Travis wants every restaurant to be Dick's last resort.

387
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,160
It sounds like Travis just wants people to shovel shit.

388
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,680
And what is shocking to me is that you get like angry

389
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,560
when atop the pile of shit, the shit king,

390
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,240
the person who survived like 147 hours style

391
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,040
and has climbed through the shit to come up and say,

392
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,520
Travis, hey, I really like your jacket.

393
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,280
No, you're wrong.

394
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,080
Here's why you're wrong.

395
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,840
Because I think that's second day Darryl.

396
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,600
He's been working there for maybe two weeks.

397
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,760
It doesn't fucking matter how much money they make,

398
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,640
how long they've been there.

399
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,240
They said something nice about your jacket.

400
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,520
The last thousand-

401
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,040
When you compliment second day Darryl when he's at the top,

402
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,600
it's just going to make him look worse when he's at the bottom.

403
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,080
Darryl used to be so well connected with the other employees

404
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,040
and with the customers.

405
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,480
Everyone used to love your performance.

406
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,720
And now you just glare at everybody.

407
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,440
What's wrong?

408
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,760
You got to measure your life and love, Travis.

409
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,160
You're not measuring your life and love.

410
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,560
Don't draw attention to second day Darryl.

411
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
Save it at second day.

412
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,240
I agree with Griffin on this one, Travis.

413
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,920
I think you're not measuring life with love.

414
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,680
I'd go out of my way to be friendly to everybody

415
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,000
who is currently working a job when I encounter them

416
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,080
because I feel like that can help buoy their spirits.

417
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,840
And I think if enough people do that,

418
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,000
then you get charged up with positive energy

419
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,640
and you can start unloading that into people that come in.

420
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,080
It's a whole cycle, Travis.

421
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,280
What was that sound?

422
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,240
Was that a cash register?

423
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,200
Because Justin has paid that shit forward, I think.

424
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,680
What's up?

425
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,480
I didn't see the movie.

426
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,120
You don't have a-

427
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,880
Hey, brother, you don't have a smile today?

428
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,360
Why don't you borrow one of mine?

429
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,000
Can I say something, Justin?

430
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,200
I hate you both so much.

431
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,640
Can I say something to you right now, Justin?

432
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,160
Tell me.

433
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,800
I'm loving it.

434
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,560
I hate you.

435
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,600
Just your attitude.

436
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,160
Like, I'm loving it.

437
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,880
I hate you guys so much.

438
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,240
They should change the slogan now.

439
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,120
I've seen you interact with fast food employees.

440
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,560
I'm loving your attitude.

441
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,320
That's a new slogan.

442
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,600
I get accused of being too friendly with people.

443
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,960
I'll use first names.

444
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,120
I'm a real sweetheart.

445
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,440
They don't appreciate it at McDonald's.

446
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,400
I will say that.

447
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,320
You're not allowed back in your McDonald's for a while.

448
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,360
My carefree attitude does not seem to be winning me any friends there.

449
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,240
Maybe they do.

450
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Maybe I inspire them to go get a different job.

451
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,960
Because like I said, I do not see the same person twice.

452
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,720
Ever since we were kids, I've always had a bit of a crush on my best friend's little sister.

453
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,240
She's two years younger than me, while my best friend is the same age as I.

454
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,440
My best friend and I have been friends since we were toddlers,

455
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,040
and our families are pretty close.

456
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,240
We're practically siblings.

457
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,840
In high school, I never paid much attention to little sister,

458
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,720
but now that we're both in university, she's grown up, rather than just being the kid sister.

459
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,320
I don't make things awkward with the big sister, nor our families.

460
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,280
On the flip side, I don't think she has much interest in me anyway.

461
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,440
Do I even have a problem?

462
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,680
This person had a crisis of confidence like midway through the question.

463
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,920
Oh, shit, because I misread that at first and thought that they were saying that the big sister

464
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,840
had no interest in them.

465
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,720
No, big sister's in quotes, as if to say the little sister that grew up.

466
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,160
Oh, no, I think big sister is the little sister's big sister.

467
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,560
I think the best friend is also a sister.

468
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Man, this shit's getting complex.

469
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,120
Finish the question.

470
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,160
So, I know there are the fish in the sea, but if I did want to pursue her romantically,

471
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,240
what would be a safe way to do that?

472
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,960
That's from foolishly overcomplicates things.

473
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,160
Well, you are doing that.

474
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,520
And you are overcomplicating it.

475
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,800
That is a thing that you've done.

476
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,640
I mean, if you don't, it's all about pros and cons.

477
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,360
You got to weigh them jelly beans, boy meets world style.

478
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,760
You're saying that it's a big risk.

479
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,760
It could possibly upset your friend who's been your best friend, nay, a sibling, your whole life,

480
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,360
and you don't think that the little sister is interested in you like that anyway.

481
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,880
Yeah, I would probably just sit this particular one out.

482
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:56,800
Let me say, I would say that if you don't know by now, like you've been almost siblings,

483
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,960
almost a member of this family since you were toddlers, and you are uncertain about this situation,

484
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,080
that's a pretty clear sign.

485
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,920
But I'm not, but I'm not sure.

486
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:13,360
Sometimes it doesn't click with you until you realize the person has interest in you.

487
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,120
Sometimes that can get the gears turning.

488
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,080
Yeah, but I'm saying like-

489
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,280
Well, I had never saw it.

490
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,960
I had never thought of it that way.

491
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,760
Let me mull that over.

492
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,360
Let me flip the script though, Justin.

493
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,880
What I'm saying is if you're not certain enough, if you have to ask us, it's not worth it.

494
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,160
Because I think that goes both ways.

495
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,040
I'm not saying if you're not certain that it's a mutual thing.

496
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,560
I'm saying if you are uncertain, it doesn't sound like it's worth it.

497
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,960
Don't fucking say that out loud though, because then nobody will send in questions or a show anymore.

498
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,000
Like if you have to ask us, then no is the answer 100% of the time.

499
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,680
It seems like in this circumstance, you've got a lot to lose for something that you're not prepared to fight for.

500
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,960
But this is the-

501
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,760
But or?

502
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,640
But or?

503
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,440
Way of life?

504
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,720
But or is the new-

505
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,840
But or-

506
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,120
But or maybe it's true love in this.

507
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,800
It's like your life mate and life partner.

508
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,920
And like all of us are married now.

509
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,240
So like we're all on team life partner.

510
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,520
So I mean-

511
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,520
This could be like a Harry Met Sally thing.

512
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,560
You gotta fight for it.

513
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,760
Gotta fight for it.

514
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,840
Like Harry did when he met Sally.

515
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,680
Love means having to fight every day.

516
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Quote, Harry Met Sally.

517
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
It was my favorite thing.

518
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
I'll have what she's having.

519
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
True love for the rest of my life.

520
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:30,400
I don't think you're jeopardizing the familial bonds by asking somebody out on a date.

521
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,640
I mean if they say no, whatever, that's the end.

522
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,120
If you go on a few casual dates, and you know it doesn't pan out, I don't think there's any danger in that either.

523
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
Like I don't think that that's gonna be this like permanent-

524
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,920
Let me-

525
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,920
thing that you can never overcome.

526
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
Let me ask this.

527
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Do they need to run it by the older sibling that they are like best friends with?

528
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,920
It's once you uncork this, this bottle is so tenuously corked right now.

529
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,920
But would you rather, would you rather they just go and ask for the date?

530
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,920
I would rather you just take the cork and you push it so so hard down in that bottle.

531
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
So we're in agreement that it's not worth it.

532
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,920
I don't think that there's any prob-

533
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,920
But there's no risk.

534
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,920
I'm saying there's not a risk.

535
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,920
Like there's not a risk with asking somebody out.

536
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,920
Like that's not a problem.

537
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,920
I think it's a problem if you're like-

538
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,920
If you date for you know years and you have a terrible falling out, yeah that might create some awkwardness.

539
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,920
But I have a saying I just came up with.

540
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,920
That it's better to have loved and lost than not to have loved at all.

541
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
That doesn't make sense to me.

542
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
Yeah but what if you ask out little sister and older sibling's like,

543
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Hey did you ask out my little sister?

544
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Also when you lose shit, it sucks Justin.

545
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
It sucks like a bunch.

546
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Have you ever lost your keys?

547
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
Have you ever lost your keys? I love those keys in the car that they go into.

548
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
But man they're gone. Fuck.

549
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
I think you guys are not being very romantic right now.

550
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,920
Who better to build a life with than somebody you've already shared your younger years with.

551
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
How beautiful is that?

552
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Alright here. Let's play this game then Justin.

553
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Start bouncing off literally any scenario.

554
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,920
Any scenario where you try to make this rainbow connection happen and I will tell you why it is the worst.

555
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Okay. I'm ready. I'm ready to play the game.

556
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,920
Okay. Begin.

557
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,920
Let me finish my first scenario first and then you can tell me.

558
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
Alright.

559
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
You ask her out. You go on dates.

560
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Assuming she says yes already.

561
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Boink.

562
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
That was me poking a hole right in it.

563
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,920
You fall in love. You get married.

564
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,920
You have beautiful kids.

565
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,920
Who's to say maybe you're shooting blanks.

566
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,920
There are so many holes in this juicer.

567
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
You can't live that way.

568
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,920
Let me write this dialogue.

569
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Hey do you want to go on a date?

570
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,920
You're like my sibling.

571
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
I'm going to tell my sister about this.

572
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,920
Tell sister you did what? Bye.

573
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,920
And you're not getting those records back.

574
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,920
You're definitely not getting those records back.

575
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
And now you're out your Allman Brothers records.

576
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
They were rare.

577
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,920
What is the problem though?

578
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,920
Why should it even be an issue that you ask my sister?

579
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Because you want your records back.

580
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
I think you're confusing your metaphors.

581
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Here's a new mantra that I just came up with.

582
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Make new friends but keep the old.

583
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,920
And definitely don't try to fuck them.

584
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Don't.

585
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Because they're gold and you'll lose them.

586
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,920
And you shouldn't fuck gold.

587
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,920
You shouldn't fuck gold.

588
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
Travis suggested something.

589
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
And normally I would never say this.

590
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,920
But it was a decent idea.

591
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,920
I think if you're close enough friends with the older sister.

592
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,920
Then I think that it couldn't hurt to just run up by them and see.

593
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,920
Have they ever mentioned in a romantic context.

594
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,920
Hey he's looking pretty good.

595
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,920
He's looking like he's going to work out.

596
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,920
Are you saying would it bother you if I asked your sister out?

597
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,920
Yeah it would.

598
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,920
I don't think they'll do that though.

599
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,920
I think you're putting them in a position where they can't say no.

600
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,920
But then you know what they don't get to do?

601
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,920
Complain later.

602
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,920
They do because you want to fuck their sister.

603
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,920
I'm not saying you ask for permission.

604
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,920
I'm saying you float it.

605
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,920
Spitball it.

606
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
Hey your sister's looking pretty good.

607
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,920
You don't turn into some kind of weird sex robot.

608
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,920
You know who's looking real good nowadays?

609
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,920
Your sister.

610
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,920
Really grown up.

611
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,920
Not so little anymore is she?

612
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,920
I don't think you want to position it.

613
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Look at them curves.

614
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,920
Hachi-machi.

615
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,920
I don't know what got into you guys.

616
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,920
Make the dog want a bag.

617
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,920
What?

618
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,920
What was the last name?

619
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,920
What? What did you say?

620
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:41,920
I don't understand why floating it by her older sister to see if she's ever thought of you in that context or what she thinks.

621
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
Why that has to become bargaining for her.

622
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,920
I like the hammies on her.

623
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,920
First off I don't know what hammies would be.

624
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,920
Why do you make them out of hamstrings you perv?

625
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,920
Why?

626
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,920
Why are you checking out her little sister's hamstrings?

627
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,920
But also like once you do this.

628
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,920
No he meant her hamstrings.

629
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,920
Once you do this.

630
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:11,920
Once your lifelong friend nay sibling knows that like you have been eyeing her little sister in that way in any context at all.

631
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,920
It is going to be if she also thinks it's like a familial bond it's going to creep her right the fuck out.

632
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:25,920
Listen I am always on the side of like just ask her silly but I'm telling you that there are certain situations where I think that can be very very very counterproductive.

633
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,920
Would it be as weird if it was her brother that was your friend?

634
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,920
If it was like you and a dude and you were asking out his little sister.

635
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,920
Yeah.

636
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,920
Or if it was reversed and it was like two girls wanting to ask out like an older brother.

637
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,920
I don't think gender plays any role in this.

638
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,920
I think it's all about siblings.

639
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:45,920
I want personally for me I don't know if everybody feels this way and I'm not even sure like I feel this way at this point in the podcast.

640
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,920
But I wanted my siblings to be happy before the show started at least.

641
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,920
And if you think that your friend could make your sibling happy at least in like a dating sense early in a relationship.

642
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,920
I don't see why it would be such a terrible crime for you to want to ask them out.

643
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,920
Real talk.

644
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,920
Real talk.

645
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,920
Oh finally.

646
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,920
Here's what I think.

647
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,920
I imagine this is what Marc Maron's show is.

648
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,920
It's because we're all quietly very angry with the other two people.

649
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:19,920
For the lack of professionalism and preparedness that I have come to expect over the past 180 episodes from you two.

650
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,920
Okay so real talk.

651
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,920
Okay.

652
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:29,920
You need to analyze within yourself if this is a passing fancy because this is a girl you know who now is hot.

653
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:35,920
Or if you really have some real feelings that you're willing to like risk something for.

654
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,920
And then step two.

655
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,920
I think you definitely need to float it by the older sibling.

656
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Yeah but I just haven't figured it out yet.

657
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Like I'm pretty good at figuring that kind of stuff out.

658
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,920
And I haven't figured out yet how you broach that without sounding like a bridge troll.

659
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,920
You just say like hey I don't want it to be weird but I'd like to ask your little sister out.

660
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
Is that okay?

661
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,920
I guess frankness is the best course of action.

662
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,920
Because then they go no.

663
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,920
And you go okay cool then never mind.

664
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,920
And if they say yes.

665
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Then no they say no and then you want it more than anything you've ever wanted in your entire life.

666
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
Well then there's that.

667
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,920
Then it's the sweetest fruit.

668
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Gross.

669
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,920
I'm changing the name of this show to gross-a-rooney.

670
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,920
Because that is how I feel full time right now.

671
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Gross-a-rooney.

672
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,920
That's actually Mickey Brooney's little sister that I wanted to ask out.

673
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,920
And he wouldn't let you because he wasn't a lemon.

674
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,920
And then she was all I wanted.

675
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,920
That's all you can think about.

676
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,920
That Mona Lisa smile.

677
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
She was 86.

678
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,920
She was 86 years old.

679
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
She looks good though.

680
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,920
Hey.

681
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Oh so good.

682
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,920
Y'all looks good.

683
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
Drop me a store.

684
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,920
Gross-a-rooney.

685
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,920
Like a dog want a bag.

686
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,920
Come on you can't.

687
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
This cannot be a new thing.

688
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
He said it again and I didn't hear it the second time.

689
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
Like a dog.

690
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
I hate that guy.

691
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
I don't know who the guy is but I hate that guy.

692
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
You don't like that guy?

693
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
I don't like that guy.

694
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,920
Like a dog want a bag.

695
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,920
Yep nailed it.

696
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,920
It doesn't make sense to me.

697
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,920
Well just mull it over.

698
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,920
Speaking of begging.

699
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
We need some money.

700
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,920
So let's go to the money section.

701
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Is beg one of the words he said?

702
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Trav who's this message for?

703
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
This is for Christian Ridley.

704
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Griffin who's this message from?

705
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,920
It's from Jacob Ridley.

706
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Justin what is this message?

707
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,920
To my brother Christian happy.

708
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,920
To my brother.

709
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,920
Okay the brother's name is Christian.

710
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
To my brother Christian.

711
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
God bless you.

712
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
Brother Christian.

713
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,920
Is he speaking in the colloquial sentence?

714
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,920
Happy late birthday.

715
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
Merry late Christmas.

716
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
And happy new year.

717
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:51,920
I hope you enjoy your top three favorite brothers reading message from your fourth favorite brother.

718
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
That's a tough one to admit.

719
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
Thank you.

720
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,920
Thank you Jacob for being damn enough.

721
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
Honestly it's the first step.

722
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,920
Thanks for introducing me to my bim bam.

723
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,920
And I hope this makes up for my previously lacking gift giving history.

724
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,920
From Jacob the obvious golden child.

725
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,920
They are the last man of Jacob.

726
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,920
Lot of truth in this Jacob.

727
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
Fourth favorite brother.

728
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,920
First favorite son.

729
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Is there any metric for how bad we fucked this up?

730
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,920
And how much we miss his birthday by?

731
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,920
Hey we didn't miss his birthday.

732
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,920
No I think we're right in the sweet spot.

733
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,920
It says merry late Christmas and happy new year.

734
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
We're like on the money.

735
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,920
Jacob went into it saying oh I done missed it.

736
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:37,920
If you give to ask us to tell someone a message for you.

737
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,920
You might as honestly you might as well put it in a bottle and chuck it into a well.

738
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,920
Here's the thing Jacob for future reference.

739
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
That's the reliability.

740
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,920
Jacob future reference don't include that you were late.

741
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
Let us take that hit.

742
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
That's what we're here to do.

743
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,920
Take a load off Jacob.

744
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,920
You say happy birthday two weeks in advance and then buy it whenever.

745
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:04,920
A lot of time when someone has that we claim that we miss someone's birthday by weeks.

746
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,920
We are literally getting a telegram from the person as the show is going on.

747
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,920
Wait that's just in.

748
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
Oh we fucked up.

749
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,920
We should charge extra for fuck up mail.

750
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Let's just dig in the fuck up mail bag.

751
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,920
Got a message for Tim Reinhart from Ed.

752
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,920
Ed says dear Tim.

753
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,920
I'm going to add dearest.

754
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
Dearest Tim.

755
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
My dearest Tim.

756
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920
To my dearest Tim.

757
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,920
I write you from the front.

758
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:36,920
Happy holidays to the biggest and pretty much only other Bim Bam fan I know.

759
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,920
Well fuck thanks man.

760
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Just you two.

761
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,920
Screw you too pal.

762
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,920
Ed and Tim out there in the cold lonely oblivion.

763
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,920
It's a gift for everybody it seems.

764
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,920
Thanks for turning me on.

765
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:55,920
Thanks for sharing this shitty unpopular show with me.

766
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,920
Thanks for turning me on to Bim Bam while we were roommates.

767
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,920
Hopefully this message makes it during the holidays.

768
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,920
I squeaked in there.

769
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,920
Yeah we did.

770
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:10,920
This is normally more than I would spend on you so this also counts as your birthday present.

771
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
Happy birthday Tim from your cousin Ed.

772
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,920
You know normally I would think that someone was just inserting a sick burn.

773
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,920
But I think that we were probably getting a little kidding on the square there.

774
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
This was fucking.

775
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,920
This was like.

776
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,920
This is one of the best money zone spots we've ever had because it was it was deprecating

777
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,920
in first second and third person which I really appreciated.

778
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,920
No one came away from this unscathed.

779
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,920
There was a little bit of something a little bit of something from it was the Dick's last

780
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,920
resort of Jumbotron spots.

781
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,920
Speaking of Dick's last resort.

782
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,920
Oh it's Extreme Restraints.

783
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
The magic is back.

784
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,920
Oh man.

785
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:53,920
Extremerestraints.com is your adult superstore for everything you can fuck and stick in holes.

786
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,920
God it feels good to curse again.

787
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,920
I did miss it during the candle nights.

788
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,920
Spectacular.

789
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,920
As much as we enjoyed doing that one candle nights episode where you had to talk about

790
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,920
Extreme Restraints in clean ways like you really got to like get into the filth to really

791
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,920
paint a word picture.

792
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,920
What's your 2014 going to be like because let me suggest this.

793
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,920
Maybe you should just like fucking get it.

794
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
Yeah.

795
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,920
Are you getting it?

796
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Mix it up a little bit with a size matters penis and larger.

797
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:27,920
This thing you put your penis in this and it is it's like sending it away to boot camp.

798
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
It is going to come back a changed penis.

799
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,920
I'm just saying spice it up.

800
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,920
Yeah.

801
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,920
Spice it up.

802
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,920
Right now you a little white rice.

803
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,920
Yep.

804
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,920
You need to throw some sriracha in there before it's discontinued.

805
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,920
Do they have sriracha lube or something?

806
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
I bet they do.

807
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
I bet they do.

808
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
It seems sriracha everything is happening.

809
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,920
You could actually just use sriracha sriracha lube.

810
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,920
A little tip from me to you will save a little money.

811
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,920
Don't.

812
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
Don't.

813
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
Don't.

814
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
This is the reason that we have a disclaimer at the beginning of the episode saying don't

815
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,920
do anything these chuckle fucks say.

816
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
Just throw some sriracha.

817
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,920
I burnt my dick and he burnt his butthole.

818
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,920
Thanks my bim bam.

819
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,920
That'll be two billion dollars.

820
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,920
Go to ExtremeRestraints.com to buy things with the coupon code sexabunga and save 20 percent.

821
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:13,920
But stay for the oddly confrontational pictures of naked people holding sex toys.

822
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,920
A lot of these people are staring directly at you challenging your own preconceived notions

823
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,920
about what sexual pleasure means.

824
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,920
I highly recommend the picture of the gentleman on the hollow stainless steel anal plug.

825
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,920
He's holding it saying are you man enough and the answer is I don't know.

826
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,920
But there's only one way to find out in there.

827
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,920
Yeah.

828
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
Go to ExtremeRestraints.com.

829
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,920
2014.

830
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Are you man enough?

831
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,920
Are you man enough?

832
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
Are you woman enough?

833
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
Cram it.

834
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Cram it.

835
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
2014.

836
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,920
Hey are you cram enough?

837
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,920
Are you strong enough to be my cram?

838
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Extreme Restraints.

839
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
That's the new coupon code.

840
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,920
If sexabunga gets hacked we will change it to are you strong enough to be my cram?

841
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Got a real cram going now.

842
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,920
Welcome to the space cram.

843
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,920
It's your chance.

844
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,920
Get a butt plug at the space cram.

845
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,920
I love Extreme Restraints and I would never do anything to hurt them.

846
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,920
But can we open up our own sex toys store called Space Cram?

847
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,920
Here's what we sell.

848
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,920
You ready?

849
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:19,920
One of those thick plastic cased VHS tapes of Space Jam.

850
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,920
And we say in the product description put it in your butt maybe.

851
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,920
We sell sex toys and organizational tools.

852
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,920
Sergio Diaz plays in a band called Os Mutantes.

853
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,920
His life was changed the first time he heard Elvis Presley.

854
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,920
The great thing in the world it is to discover.

855
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,920
I mean there's nothing better.

856
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,920
I'm Jesse Thorne.

857
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,920
My show Bullseye is about discovery.

858
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,920
We help you find the best music, the best movies, the best books and we talk to the people who make them.

859
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:56,920
It's Bullseye from Maximumfun.org and NPR.

860
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,920
I'm stuck in the runway.

861
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
I'm super thirsty.

862
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,920
Do you have any suggestions for sweet beverage cart hacks like your subway hacks?

863
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,920
I want to get as much refreshment as my ticket allows me to.

864
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,920
That's from Thirsty Dude.

865
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,920
They have to keep giving you drinks.

866
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,920
They have to keep giving you drinks.

867
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,920
If you tell them you're parched, if you press the little button and say I'm parched, they'll bring you something.

868
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,920
I think it's going to be water though.

869
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
I think after the initial beverage.

870
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
That's my favorite.

871
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,920
Sometimes you get on those little like jumps where it's like a 45 minute flight and they come on and go,

872
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,920
Dude, the short flight, we're just going to be doing water.

873
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,920
And it's like, I feel like it's really is a loophole.

874
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,920
You guys like you have to do better in service, but you're just oh yeah, you can't get up.

875
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,920
Hey, you can't be like, I'll have a Bloody Mary.

876
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,920
And I'm like, that's the whole flight is that you they prepare the Bloody Mary for you.

877
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,920
It seems like a mojito and the next three hours of your life.

878
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,920
I actually don't like when they don't have a beverage cart because then they're just like coming to you and ask.

879
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,920
To me, I feel better about asking if you already have the drink there.

880
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,920
If you got to walk all the way up to the moving plane to get my soda, I can usually just wait.

881
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,920
Yeah, and you feel pretty guilty about that.

882
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,920
Isn't there something about it and there's something about how you're supposed to, if you order Diet Coke,

883
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,920
they'll just give you the can because there's something about the altitude.

884
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:21,920
Like Diet Coke takes so long for the like the head of the Diet Coke to go down that it takes them forever to pour it.

885
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,920
And it's sort of like a economy of scale thing at that point.

886
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,920
So they just give you the can so that you can pour the rest of it yourself.

887
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,920
Isn't that a thing?

888
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
I feel like that's the thing.

889
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,920
I mean, the best hack is to hope that your seat mate falls asleep and that you don't know them.

890
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,920
And then you just order their drink for them.

891
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,920
Say like, I would like a Coke and they would like a ginger ale.

892
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,920
And then you just fucking drink their drink.

893
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,920
I like that you lean enough into the roost that you'll drink two different drinks.

894
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,920
You don't want to do the same thing.

895
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Well yeah, you don't want to make it seem like you out have two Diet Cokes.

896
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
One's for him.

897
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:55,920
Do you guys ever feel like, and we are dangerously stepping close to the airplane food joke line,

898
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,920
we may have actually stepped over it already, but I think this is useful information.

899
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,920
I have a real problem with, and maybe it's just because I always get seated at like the very, very, very back of the plane,

900
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:12,920
but I always get the drink and then they give it to me and I have to put the little tray table down,

901
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,920
which I don't like doing because I have like, you know, I'm playing Animal Crossing down there.

902
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,920
I'm jerking off or something.

903
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,920
You're jerking off playing Animal Crossing.

904
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,920
I'm doing both at once.

905
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,920
I'm like, I don't like having the tray table down, but I always feel like they come, give you a drink.

906
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
You have about 45 seconds and they come to get out of the trash.

907
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,920
Like, no, wait, oh, wait.

908
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,920
Can you come back in like 15 minutes, which is like how long it takes me to crush a whole can of Diet Coke?

909
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
No, 45 seconds is all I get, huh?

910
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,920
So I guess I better toss this now or like go the rest of the plane ride with my tray table down.

911
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,920
That's why you got to get the beverage and then run down the aisle away from them drinking it.

912
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:51,920
I like, I actually am equally irritated by the opposite situation where maybe I missed that first pass

913
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,920
and then I finished my drink like right after and then for the next 15 minutes, this cup is my life.

914
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,920
This is everything that's happening to me right now.

915
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,920
That's why you got to tuck it into the little sack in front of the little satchel in the seat.

916
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,920
Yeah, but then you look like a dirty boy for whoever you're sitting next to.

917
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
Oh, yes.

918
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,920
Are you going to leave it there?

919
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,920
That's where I have my, I leave it there every time though.

920
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,920
Me too.

921
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,920
That's where I have all my entertainment.

922
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,920
Oh, that's dangerous.

923
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,920
You get up and get, you know, you catch a connecting flight to Dallas and then you catch another connecting flight back to Austin.

924
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,920
You're like, oh shit, my iPad is in Nashville.

925
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
Idiot.

926
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,920
I got a pretty good beverage hack for you if you want to get the most out of it.

927
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,920
Get their like expensive seats that you can get in the front of the plane.

928
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,920
And man, those motherfuckers are thirsty up in first class.

929
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,920
I tell you what.

930
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Boy, howdy.

931
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,920
They need their drink.

932
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,920
They need their drink while the commoners are still getting seated.

933
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,920
They have to have a drink.

934
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
They can't wait for you to get to your seat.

935
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,920
They have to have a drink right then.

936
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,920
They were so fucking thirsty.

937
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,920
When I flew back from Scotland, we did the like priority plus or whatever.

938
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
And it was like only 80 bucks extra.

939
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,920
And like you get complimentary beer and wine.

940
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,920
That still doesn't sound like it makes up for 80 bucks.

941
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,920
For nine hours?

942
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,920
Yeah, man.

943
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,920
You just gotta like really fucking work for it.

944
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,920
You gotta really commit.

945
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,920
Yeah.

946
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,920
You gotta have nothing left to lose.

947
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,920
I guess that's kind of a weird thing to think on your honeymoon, but sure.

948
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,920
Well, you got a nine hour flight, man.

949
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
Who are you trying to impress?

950
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,920
This is the most special honeymoon ever, baby.

951
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,920
I just feel like we have nothing left to lose.

952
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,920
Glug, glug, glug, glug, glug.

953
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,920
My favorite moment, we were flying back from your wedding, Griffin.

954
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,920
We were on this flight and it had been delayed and it was like a crazy thing.

955
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,920
And this dude was on the flight with us who was clearly drunk.

956
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,920
Like he reeked of booze and like fell asleep as soon as he sat down on the plane.

957
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,920
And the flight attendant woke him up as she was coming back through and was like,

958
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,920
can I get you a drink?

959
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,920
And he was like, huh, wine.

960
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,920
And she was like, well, I mean, that costs money.

961
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,920
And he goes, oh, oh, nothing.

962
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,920
And fell immediately back asleep.

963
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,920
That's a pretty cool scene.

964
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,920
And that man is my favorite man.

965
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,920
That's a good guy.

966
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,920
Can we talk about 2014?

967
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,920
I feel like by this point we've come up with like a catch phrase.

968
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,920
And I feel like we're sort of slacking that we haven't done that yet.

969
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,920
That we haven't, like, sort of like, so to review.

970
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,920
20 does.

971
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,920
20 does.

972
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,920
Getting it in 20 does.

973
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,920
Yeah, and then we had 20 dirt.

974
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,920
20 dirt, dig it up, get it out.

975
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
Get it out.

976
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,920
Now we're in 2014.

977
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,920
I want to hit you guys with this.

978
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:36,920
What do you think about 2014 where we get into sports deep?

979
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,920
Let me throw this out.

980
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,920
20 forte, what's your specialty?

981
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,920
Oh, that's not bad.

982
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,920
That's actually not bad.

983
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,920
I'm kind of into sports already.

984
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,920
Yeah, that's something.

985
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,920
20 forte is about a challenge to you and find out what makes you special.

986
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,920
Gain some confidence in the thing that makes you you.

987
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,920
Let me bounce mine off you.

988
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:03,920
I'm feeling really good about 2015 already.

989
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,920
2014 might be all right, but I think 2015 is where we are really going to cash in.

990
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:14,920
What if this was like a year of preparation?

991
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,920
What if this was like 20 fortify?

992
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,920
I like 20 fortify.

993
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:31,920
Maybe you get in shape for the big, big moves you're going to make in 2015, which is going to be a fucking killer, stellar year.

994
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:40,920
Honestly, Griffin, and I know that I've probably thought this before, but to me, 2015 sounds so goddamn futuristic.

995
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,920
That'll never happen.

996
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,920
It'll never happen.

997
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,920
There's no way.

998
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,920
I mean, the way that Obama's running this country, you're probably not so far off.

999
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,920
Let me hit you guys with this.

1000
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,920
20 fart teen.

1001
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,920
I mean, that certainly has its merits.

1002
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,920
I think the problem-

1003
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,920
There's nothing to go along with that.

1004
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,920
Can I hit you guys with another one?

1005
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,920
Just 20 fart.

1006
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,920
And mine was just Travis's.

1007
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,920
What about this?

1008
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,920
Oh, no.

1009
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,920
See, we missed this because I was thinking 2014.

1010
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,920
That works better with 13.

1011
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:23,920
My problem with Forte and Fortify is that they both presume a lot about the person.

1012
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,920
We don't know who's in a rebuilding year and who's not.

1013
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,920
It's not a rebuilding year.

1014
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,920
It's not a rebuilding year.

1015
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,920
You might have this shit already.

1016
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,920
You got to fortify that stuff.

1017
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:43,920
It's like, okay, if you're playing the risk, you take the territory, so you've got it, and now it's about just shoring up your numbers.

1018
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,920
Shoring up your resources right there to the borderlands.

1019
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,920
That is what I'm saying.

1020
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,920
Maybe you've already got some shit.

1021
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,920
Every year can't be a growth year.

1022
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,920
No.

1023
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,920
You're going to overstretch your bounds.

1024
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,920
No.

1025
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,920
We are going to need to really pool our resources.

1026
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:04,920
As a community, as the Mbim-bam nation, we really need to get together and huddle around for warmth and just get ready for 2015.

1027
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:10,920
I don't want to paint a bleak picture because 2015, we have a light at the end of the tunnel.

1028
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,920
It's 2015, and it's going to be fucking incredible.

1029
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,920
What if it's just 20 forts, and it's just a year of building a lot of blanket forts?

1030
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,920
That would be charming.

1031
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:26,920
My worry with fortify is that we've been talking about how we need to do live shows in 2014,

1032
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:35,920
and I'm worried if we go ahead and proclaim 2014 as a year of basically turtling and hoarding resources and stuff.

1033
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,920
We'll use it as an excuse to not do that.

1034
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,920
No, no, no.

1035
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,920
We have this fan base already, and we are going to start losing these motherfuckers.

1036
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,920
I don't know if you guys have seen our numbers.

1037
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,920
The bleed has already begun.

1038
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,920
The only way we're going to keep them is if we put some fucking FaceTime on the books.

1039
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,920
That's what I'm saying.

1040
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,920
Griffin, let me throw out the opposite and just go with 20 forward.

1041
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,920
Oh, my God.

1042
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,920
Oh, Travis.

1043
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,920
That is visionary.

1044
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,920
20 forward.

1045
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,920
But you're kind of usurping my grand vision.

1046
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,920
This is about momentum.

1047
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,920
This is about acceleration.

1048
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,920
This is about moving forward.

1049
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,920
20 forward.

1050
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,920
If you don't do 20 forward, you can't get to where you need to be to experience 20 forward.

1051
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,920
I like that.

1052
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,920
I like that message better.

1053
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,920
By the way, let me get this out of the way right now.

1054
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,920
Got to be 20 griff teen.

1055
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,920
It's got to be 20 griff teen.

1056
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,920
If we do make it there, it's going to be a great one.

1057
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,920
That's going to be all about griff teen.

1058
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,920
What you guys can't see is there's that hand motion that goes along with 20 forward,

1059
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,920
and it's like a hand swooping for like 20 forward.

1060
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,920
You're reaching out.

1061
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,920
Is 20 griff teen like grift like you're fucking over other people, or is it like for me?

1062
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,920
Like for me?

1063
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,920
Both.

1064
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,920
I don't really grift that many people.

1065
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,920
I'm missing a good opportunity.

1066
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,920
Well, you will in 20 griff teen.

1067
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,920
I probably will.

1068
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,920
Yeah, in griff teen, you're going to get real.

1069
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,920
So move forward with your grifting abilities.

1070
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,920
Maybe learn some sleight of hand.

1071
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,920
You don't do enough three-card Monty.

1072
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,920
I've told you that before.

1073
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,920
Have you ever forged an identity?

1074
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,920
This is the time to do it.

1075
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,920
How is your ledger mane?

1076
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,920
Is it okay?

1077
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,920
I'm going to say we stick with 20 forward now unless something better comes to us.

1078
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,920
I like 20 forward.

1079
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,920
Me too.

1080
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,920
I like the optimism of it.

1081
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,920
We got it out in 2013 this year.

1082
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,920
We got it out the dirt.

1083
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,920
Now it's time to move forward, move on away from the dirt.

1084
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,920
Speaking of live shows, I think I know a pretty good place to do one,

1085
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,920
and that's wherever Tim and Ed live.

1086
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,920
That seems to be a hotbed of Mabim Bam fandom.

1087
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,920
I think they just live on a frozen lake.

1088
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,920
That's what I picture.

1089
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,920
Yeah, that's probably accurate.

1090
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,920
That's probably the only scenario in which there are two Mabim Bam listeners,

1091
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,920
is if there's a frozen lake somewhere, not just like, I don't know,

1092
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:56,920
maybe the entire state of Montana or maybe like 26 other states like Montana.

1093
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,920
Basically every state that's not California or Texas or New York.

1094
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,920
Thanks, California, Texas, and New York.

1095
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,920
You are really keeping us afloat.

1096
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,920
Thanks, guys.

1097
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,920
By the way, maybe tell somebody about the show this week if you could.

1098
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,920
Maybe if we can get like three strong listenership in Utah and Montana

1099
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,920
and the Dakotas, the Badlands.

1100
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,920
Tim and Ed, that's your mission right now.

1101
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,920
Yeah, just tell anyone else that Tim and Ed knows.

1102
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,920
We are bone dry in the Badlands.

1103
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,920
We've got to get that stuff wet.

1104
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,920
I got another question.

1105
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,920
I'm a lover of knowledge,

1106
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,920
and I spend my time researching science, tech, and culture topics.

1107
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,920
I sometimes cannot contain my excitement about these things

1108
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,920
and add them to conversations with my family.

1109
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,920
My older brother has become annoyed with this and repeatedly says,

1110
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,920
you've got too much time on your hands.

1111
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,920
What does that even mean?

1112
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,920
Is this supposed to be an insult?

1113
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,920
Is he telling me to stop learning?

1114
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,920
Do you think I should continue sharing things I learn or stop?

1115
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,920
That's from Jonathan, who isn't going to come up with a nom de plume.

1116
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,920
He's happy just being Jonathan.

1117
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,920
20 forward.

1118
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,920
How is that applicable at all?

1119
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,920
I think it means your brother can go fuck himself.

1120
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,920
So maybe your brother needs to go 20 backward on his attitude.

1121
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,920
I'm just saying that what it sounds like to me is, listen,

1122
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,920
learning and growing and being interested in random facts

1123
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,920
is one of the most beautiful things in the world to me.

1124
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,920
So that idea of your brother getting annoyed with it,

1125
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,920
it seems to me like maybe it's just not his scene.

1126
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,920
But there ain't nothing wrong with it.

1127
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,920
You don't do what this dude is doing.

1128
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,920
You don't have to stop, obviously, and you should definitely keep learning.

1129
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,920
But there's a time and a place for that kind of stuff.

1130
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,920
And there are circles of people who enjoy that kind of heady discussion.

1131
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,920
And if your brother's talking about how his kid did at a soccer game,

1132
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,920
he doesn't want to hear about the origins of the sport.

1133
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,920
You know what I mean? He just wants to talk about his kid.

1134
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,920
It sounds to me like what you need to work on, Jonathan,

1135
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,920
is the beauty of a sequitur.

1136
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,920
Travis, you cannot be the one. You cannot be the tutor.

1137
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,920
No, listen, because I know it's not a strength,

1138
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,920
but God knows I've come miles from where I was when I was like 12.

1139
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,920
But I have watched this.

1140
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,920
That's just not like a super high bar to clear.

1141
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,920
Well, you know, you got to take it where you can get it.

1142
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,920
I am so much better at metaphors than I was when I was a baby.

1143
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,920
Well, I've got friends that know really interesting, amazing things

1144
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,920
about pop culture and science and all this stuff,

1145
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,920
but they don't wait for the prior conversation to end.

1146
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,920
They don't wait for a window to open up.

1147
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,920
They just say it, and that's always going to fall flat.

1148
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,920
You know what I mean?

1149
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,920
It's always going to seem really out of place and out of nowhere

1150
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,920
in a way that no one's going to jump to engage with it.

1151
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,920
Jonathan, the whole point of communication is to express ideas,

1152
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,920
thoughts, emotions, opinions, and it doesn't seem like,

1153
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,920
as far as trivia goes, your brother's really –

1154
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,920
I don't think he's really into getting it.

1155
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:09,920
So you got to wonder, like, if you're making these little bon mots

1156
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,920
for a specific reason, because if it's to entertain, delight, inform your brother,

1157
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,920
then like he is not into it.

1158
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,920
I would think it would be better to remain quiet, confident

1159
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,920
in your own personal knowledge and then wait for like a nice cocktail party

1160
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,920
or maybe a pub trivia where you can really let that flag fly.

1161
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,920
Juicer, I think you just nailed it, where I think the thing is,

1162
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,920
are you doing this for their benefit or for your own?

1163
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,920
Are you saying it to prove how intelligent and the stuff you know

1164
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,920
or because you think that this is a thing that will in some way,

1165
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,920
you know, improve their enjoyment of the thing that they're talking about?

1166
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,920
Because I think it's like anything else where you're talking about making friends

1167
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,920
or relationships of any kind is it's being interested in them.

1168
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,920
So are you doing this to turn the attention to yourself

1169
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,920
or to continue on their moment of conversation?

1170
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,920
Dale Carnegie's dead, right?

1171
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,920
Yeah.

1172
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,920
I'd have to imagine at this point, he gave too much of himself to be able to continue.

1173
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,920
I was just thinking about like royalties.

1174
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,920
Oh, okay. No, we're good.

1175
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:18,920
If it's been over seven years since he died, the trademark on his thoughts and ideas.

1176
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:19,920
No, we're safe.

1177
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,920
Okay, good.

1178
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,920
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo answer question?

1179
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,920
Yeah, sure.

1180
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,920
Sure, I have a Yahoo.

1181
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,920
This one was sent in by Postmaster.

1182
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,920
Those are Gmail names, probably not the general.

1183
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,920
Thanks, Postmaster.

1184
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,920
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Mr. Candy, who asks,

1185
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,920
prior to a date, what's on your checklist?

1186
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,920
Oh, God.

1187
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,920
Well, last time I was on a date, the Pope was Polish,

1188
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,920
but usually this is how I start.

1189
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,920
Why don't you leave the jokes to us?

1190
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,920
I know that you didn't know that your Yahoo answer was going to be on the podcast.

1191
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,920
You should have assumed.

1192
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,920
You should have probably just assumed.

1193
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,920
Physically, this is his checklist.

1194
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,920
Physically, wash car, inside out in full gas tank.

1195
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,920
This guy's like a doomsday prepper.

1196
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,920
Eat a big sandwich because when I'm nervous, I get hungry.

1197
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,920
Excuse me?

1198
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,920
Sorry?

1199
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,920
You lost me already.

1200
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,920
Say it one more time.

1201
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,920
After finished detailing the inside of his car and filling up the gas tank,

1202
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,920
eat a big sandwich because when I'm nervous, I get hungry.

1203
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,920
Wait, what?

1204
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,920
And to avoid eating like a pig in front of the date.

1205
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,920
Shouldn't it be when this person's hungry, they get nervous,

1206
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,920
and that would be the thing they worry about?

1207
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,920
Personal hygiene.

1208
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,920
I just picture them just slamming a footlong sub

1209
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,920
and then checking it off a list.

1210
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,920
Oh, shit.

1211
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,920
I got crumbs in my car.

1212
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,920
Got to go back to step one.

1213
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:49,920
He's really in touch with his body because he's nervous about getting hungry

1214
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,920
because he gets hungry when he's nervous.

1215
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,920
That seems endlessly sort of cyclical to me.

1216
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,920
This is a very fat man.

1217
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,920
Maybe when he eats a sandwich, he's like George Clooney.

1218
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,920
He turns into the smoothest dude ever.

1219
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,920
I hope it's not a spicy sandwich though.

1220
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,920
Oh, but then he gets that moment where he's sitting at dinner

1221
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,920
and you're just here like...

1222
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,920
I hope it's...

1223
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:09,920
I've got to go.

1224
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,920
I hope he didn't eat a spicy sandwich though

1225
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,920
because then he will be a very not nervous car.

1226
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,920
Detail myself.

1227
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,920
Third...

1228
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,920
Third transformative car.

1229
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,920
The third item on the checklist, which again, for context sake,

1230
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,920
has clocked in below detailing the car and filling the gas tank

1231
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,920
and then eating a big sandwich.

1232
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,920
Third, personal hygiene slash shower slash floss teeth, et cetera.

1233
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,920
So that one, I guess it makes sense you want to brush your teeth

1234
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,920
after you fucking eat a big sandwich.

1235
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,920
Washed and pressed clothing slash polished shoes.

1236
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,920
Makes sense.

1237
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,920
Carry a handkerchief in case we sit by a fountain, bench, et cetera,

1238
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,920
and wipe excess water or humidity, et cetera.

1239
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,920
Wow.

1240
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,920
Turn phone on silent mode.

1241
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,920
That one's probably all right.

1242
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,920
Okay.

1243
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,920
Maybe you want to turn it on airplane, just go the extra mile

1244
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,920
in case you get like, I don't know, Snapchat.

1245
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,920
This is okay.

1246
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,920
Those are just the physical notes, the mental notes.

1247
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,920
Okay.

1248
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,920
Include action items like don't use bad language.

1249
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,920
Don't stare at her boobs.

1250
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,920
Yep.

1251
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,920
That's a physical, sir.

1252
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,920
I guess that's true.

1253
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,920
Listen rather than talk.

1254
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,920
Don't think about staring at her boobs.

1255
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,920
Check.

1256
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:27,920
Listen rather than talk.

1257
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,920
Try to be funny but not too much.

1258
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,920
If anything annoys you, act cool and get pissed later at home.

1259
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,920
God damn it.

1260
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,920
Can't believe that.

1261
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,920
Fuck.

1262
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,920
Stay away from alcohol.

1263
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,920
One can look like a fool or something inappropriate could slip one's mouth.

1264
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,920
Safety if driving her home.

1265
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,920
I guess there's some pretty good arguments there.

1266
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,920
Well, and yeah, and apparently this guy is always one synapse fire away

1267
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,920
from staring at her breasts.

1268
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,920
So yeah, maybe avoid the sauce.

1269
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,920
Wait, in all of this, in all of these, some of them very down to earth things,

1270
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,920
can we remember that this is big sandwich guy?

1271
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:08,920
I just want to keep that in the forethought of your mind that this is the guy afraid

1272
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,920
he won't be able to resist eating a big sandwich.

1273
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,920
Never ever look at another woman.

1274
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,920
Whoa.

1275
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,920
Eyes on the sandwich, bub.

1276
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,920
My sandwich is down here.

1277
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,920
Hey, Jared, why don't you slow those peepers a bit?

1278
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,920
Step 10, bring big pants to show her how fat I used to be.

1279
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,920
Big pants will come in handy if transformed into car.

1280
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,920
Don't want to be naked, car.

1281
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,920
Step 11, cover your car, dick.

1282
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,920
Don't smoke near her or at all if she doesn't smoke.

1283
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,920
Yep.

1284
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,920
Have a backup plan.

1285
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,920
Two choices for food and entertainment venues.

1286
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,920
Own a copy of the movie, the backup plan.

1287
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,920
Finally, backup cash in case of emergency.

1288
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,920
I'm telling you this dude is a doomsday prepper.

1289
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,920
I'm telling you this guy is a bunker that he built himself.

1290
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,920
This guy has an ax that turns into a chair.

1291
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,920
Here's the thing.

1292
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:08,920
If you just, like, change the context of all of this, there's nothing weird about it.

1293
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,920
A dude being like, hey, here's some advice if you're going on a big date.

1294
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,920
But there's something about saying, like, I have a checklist that makes it crazy.

1295
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,920
No, the problem I have with this gentleman is that a large majority of his checklist

1296
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,920
should just be applicable to, like, being a person in the world.

1297
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,920
Like, why do you have to remind yourself not to be the worst, the pit?

1298
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,920
Don't look at another woman ever.

1299
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,920
You never know what you'll do.

1300
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,920
Yeah.

1301
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,920
Maybe it's a Medusa.

1302
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,920
Oh, no.

1303
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,920
You're stone.

1304
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,920
Man, there's – but there's, like – don't cut this guy too much slack because there's,

1305
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,920
like, three pretty crazy things on here.

1306
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,920
The fact that he fills –

1307
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,920
I mean, he's the sandwich guy.

1308
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,920
The fact that – you guys pointed out sandwich.

1309
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:54,920
The fact that he fills his fucking gas tank before he goes on any date ever is, like,

1310
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,920
crazy to me.

1311
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,920
Wouldn't you just know how much gas you have in your car, and if you're close to empty,

1312
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,920
you fill it up?

1313
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:05,920
Also, there's a very specific checklist there where his gas gauge is broken.

1314
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:11,920
Plus, his favorite sandwich store is three hours away.

1315
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,920
I have to go.

1316
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,920
I'll be back in six hours.

1317
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,920
I'm very nervous.

1318
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,920
Have you – you guys have been on dates, right?

1319
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,920
Yes, to my knowledge, yeah.

1320
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:28,920
I know it's been a while, you old merry creeps, but have you ever had a backup plan?

1321
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,920
Like, what if Shonis is full?

1322
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,920
I didn't even think about that.

1323
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,920
Is there still a Ponderosa's open?

1324
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,920
You show up to Shonis, and there's an hour wait, and you're like, God damn it, I should

1325
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,920
have planned something else.

1326
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,920
That never – that never happens, right?

1327
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,920
Well, and then you get really mad about it, and you fly off the handle right there in

1328
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,920
the Shonis waiting area.

1329
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,920
No.

1330
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,920
No, you don't.

1331
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,920
You bottle that shit up, and you take it home.

1332
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:52,920
You get angry at home.

1333
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:53,920
You punch a wall.

1334
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,920
Fuck damn Shonis.

1335
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,920
Fuck.

1336
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,920
I need a drink.

1337
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,920
Damn you, Shoni Bear.

1338
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,920
God damn Shoni.

1339
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:04,920
I'm also sort of uncomfortable with the idea of this gentleman as like sort of the date

1340
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,920
tour guide.

1341
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:13,920
Like, it matters very little what the lady in the situation wants to do on said date,

1342
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,920
because he's got a full itinerary with backup plans and contingencies.

1343
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,920
Also, this is a conversation this person has on every date.

1344
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,920
What's – is your food not good?

1345
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,920
You haven't touched it at all.

1346
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,920
Oh, no, I ate a big sandwich before we came here.

1347
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,920
Oh, cool.

1348
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,920
You're a crazy person.

1349
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,920
You know we were going to dinner, right?

1350
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,920
You knew we were going to dinner at a nice place.

1351
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,920
And if this person like gets married, is this applicable for every – this person's

1352
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:39,920
been married for six years.

1353
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:40,920
He's a very sweet husband.

1354
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,920
He takes his – he has date night twice a week.

1355
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,920
That means he fills up his gas tank twice a week.

1356
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,920
He goes to like this big expensive French bistro that he had to get reservations for

1357
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,920
months in advance, and he shows up.

1358
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,920
It's like, again?

1359
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,920
You did it again, Donnie?

1360
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,920
You ate a sandwich again, Donnie, at home?

1361
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,920
Let me tell the count, though.

1362
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,920
Here's Donnie's problem.

1363
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,920
A, you're assuming he's taking her to a nice French bistro.

1364
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,920
Why not just like have some fucking saltines, Donnie?

1365
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,920
Why you got to slam jam a big sandwich?

1366
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:08,920
Yeah.

1367
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,920
I hope this does continue into his married life, because it'll make impromptu dates

1368
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,920
all the more fun.

1369
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,920
Yeah, if this is like a surprise – are surprise dates a thing?

1370
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,920
Because this person would just collapse under the pressure, I feel like.

1371
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,920
I would be willing to bet that all of Donnie's dates are surprise dates.

1372
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,920
Oh, no.

1373
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,920
Oh, boy.

1374
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,920
Do you want to do something this afternoon?

1375
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,920
I don't have time to get to the sandwich store.

1376
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,920
I can't.

1377
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,920
My gas tank's half empty.

1378
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,920
Hi.

1379
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,920
Hey, I'm America's Sweetheart Jennifer Lawrence.

1380
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,920
Donnie, I just met you at LAX.

1381
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,920
I think you're a cool-looking dude.

1382
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,920
I've got two and a half hours to kill.

1383
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,920
Let's go to Chili's to go and hang out, because I think we could have a real connection

1384
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:55,920
with you, and I could take you with me to Hollywood Boulevard, and we could live the

1385
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,920
rest of our lives out happy.

1386
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,920
What do you say, Donnie?

1387
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,920
I know that you have time to kill.

1388
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,920
What do you say?

1389
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,920
I don't know.

1390
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,920
I've got a half tank in the car back at home.

1391
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,920
I've already looked at two women since we've been talking.

1392
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,920
I've got a small sandwich.

1393
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:15,920
I had a small sandwich.

1394
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,920
Oh, shit.

1395
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,920
This has been our comedy advice show, my brother, my brother, me.

1396
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,920
We hope you've had a good time listening to it.

1397
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,920
Listen, don't be like Ed and Tim.

1398
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,920
Share the show with people you care about.

1399
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:27,920
I think they're going to share it.

1400
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,920
We've guilted them into sharing the episode.

1401
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,920
But you should be like Ed and Tim in that if you want to do a birthday message or some

1402
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,920
kind of shout out on our show in which you admit that you don't know anyone else that

1403
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:44,920
listens to our show, just go to MaximumFun.org forward slash Jumbotron, and they can set

1404
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:48,920
you up with everything there.

1405
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:54,920
Thank you to people tweeting about the show using the MBMBAM hashtag.

1406
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:59,920
We certainly appreciate when you guys do that.

1407
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,920
Let's see.

1408
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:08,920
We've got BombsFall, RapUncle, Vladimir, Alonzo Duralde calling us out on our lack of knowledge

1409
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,920
about Grace Jones.

1410
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,920
Sounds about right.

1411
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,920
Sounds about right.

1412
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,920
She's great.

1413
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:18,920
She's just like in that one instance of the Pee Wee's Christmas Special, it's a bit weird.

1414
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:23,920
Maribeth, Joshua Cummings, Megan McCaffrey, Schmoozie, Kellen, Elsie.

1415
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:24,920
So many others.

1416
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:25,920
Thank you so much.

1417
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,920
I sure appreciate it.

1418
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,920
As long as we're passing out the thank yous, why don't I shoot one to John Roderick in

1419
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,920
the Long Winters.

1420
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,920
For the use of our theme song, it's a departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1421
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,920
It's a terrific album.

1422
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,920
I'm sure a lot of you guys got that as Candle Nights stocking stuffers.

1423
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,920
Please note that for Candle Nights, you use like ladies stockings.

1424
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,920
Silk stockings.

1425
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:47,920
Ladies silk stockings.

1426
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,920
You can't get a lot in there, but you can get a CD or a jump drive.

1427

Yeah.

1432
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,920
Kind of got away from it.

1433
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:09,920
Yeah, it's good.

1434
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:10,920

Full disclosure.

1438
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,920
Also, everybody be really careful on New Year's Eve.

1439
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,920
Drive safe and don't drink and drive.

1440
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:19,920
Don't drink.

1441
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:20,920
There's other drunk drivers out there.

1442
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,920
Don't drink.

1443
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,920
You might say something bad.

1444
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,920
You might look at another woman.

1445
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,920
You might turn into like a hot rod.

1446
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:27,920
You might.

1447
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,920
If it's a spicy drink, sure.

1448
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,920
They have those.

1449
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,920
You guys want that final Yahoo?

1450
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:31,920
Yes, please.

Thanks, Kristen.

It's by Yahoo Answers user Laura, who asks, where can I buy the smallest rice cooker?

Justin, what are you doing?

1465
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,920
Strapping a chicken in my arm.

1466
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:24,920
Heard there's some plague out west, so I just wanted to kind of get out ahead of it.

1467
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:30,160
Justin, if you'd ever listened to our medical history podcast, Sawbones, where we talk about

1468
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:34,640
everything from trepanation to bloodletting, you would know that that is a ridiculous idea

1469
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,920
and it will never work.

1470
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,920
I haven't caught it.

1471
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:39,920
Sawbones?

1472
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,920
Yes.

1473
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,920
We do it every Friday on the Maximum Fun Network and we record it together.

1474
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,920
Do you need a doctor or something?

1475
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,920
Yes.

1476
01:02:48,920 --> 01:03:11,920
I'm Justin McElroy.
