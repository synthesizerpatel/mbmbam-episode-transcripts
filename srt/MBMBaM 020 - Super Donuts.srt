1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take your chance on me If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
One, two, three, and fuck it, it's The McElroy Brothers, back for another MV, MV AM.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I feel like here on the advice show for the modern era, we can curse a lot more now that we have Bob Ball telling people, watch out, cursing.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I actually, I have Bob Ball following me around all the time just to do that, like, watch out, Travis is about to curse.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This guy's about to say some shit.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, I'm sorry, I just did it. I just cursed in the disclaimer.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And then he has a guy that follows him around that says Bob Ball is about to curse when he tells you Travis is about to curse.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And hey, pretty soon, everybody's employed. You're welcome, Obama.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hey guys, happy 20th anniversary of the very first show we did. Can you believe it?

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I cannot believe it.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It seems like only 21 weeks ago.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It was.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It was.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It was.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Sorry about that one.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hey, here on the advice show for the modern era, we take your questions and turn them into wisdom.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's Alchemy, and I'm going to kick it off right now.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm almost 30 years old and I've never really had a nickname, says FormSpring.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I think FormSpring is a pretty good nickname, but let's move on.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm starting a new job soon, and I think this might be my last chance. Should I just introduce myself as Highway or Hunter?

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Or do you have any other suggestions?

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Highway Hunter.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah, I was going to say Highway Hunter, but Highway to Heaven.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm Landon.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Whatever it is, it has to be something that refers to either some sort of trait, some sort of physical trait or some sort of physical item that you wear around.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:43,000
For instance, one year I went to church camp, and I had this new pair of shitty sunglasses, and I referred to myself exclusively as Shades.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's why whenever I walk into a room, I say, Hi, my name's Cock Ring.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hi, I'm Skinny Jeans.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Whatever it is, you've got to devote yourself to it.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You can't waver.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's the thing about it.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If you roll up in a church camp and you say, What's up, they call me Shades, and then you go off that for a second, you'll never hear the end of it.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah, the trick is to pretend like this name has been given to you.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't even remember my real name.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If it doesn't say Shades on my birth certificate, I don't know.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Exactly.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't know.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
People have been calling me Shades for so long that I don't really remember what my real name is.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Because it's got to be like back in school and you've got to have a backstory.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You've got to have a convincing backstory for this name.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It doesn't have to be a good one.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The important thing is that it's a casual backstory, not something you've thought about.

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It can't be intricate.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They call me Funyuns.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why?

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I like Funyuns.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I like them.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
They call me Red because I like red.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't know.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I like red a lot.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Better than that.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I think what would be great though is if you picked another name as your nickname.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If you're like, hi, my name is Travis, but people call me Ignacio.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Just don't make it make sense.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I think that's the way to go.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Or in reality, don't give yourself a nickname.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Do not give yourself a nickname.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You just got to pretend.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You don't give it to yourself.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You pretend it was given to you by a group that these people will never ever meet.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So not long ago, this is Leo from Gmail, not long ago, a girl I really liked asked me out

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
on a date.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It went well, even to the point of her coming up with a whole bunch of ideas for follow

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
up dates.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Pre-planning.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Good.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Thinking this meant she dug me, I decided to ask her to our high school prom.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
She said no, even though she didn't have another date and even came and gloated to me when

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
she did find one.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Since then, she's ignored me completely.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This wouldn't be a problem, except we'll both be going to the same university.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We'll be in the same faculty and we'll both be living in res starting in a couple of maybe

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
residency halls.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Something like that.

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I think so.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Starting in a couple of weeks.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So since I'll probably be seeing her somewhat regularly in the next while, how do I make

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
things less awkward?

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Unfortunately, packing up and leaving isn't an option.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Damn it.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Damn it.

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's our A material.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Thanks.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Keep up the great work, Leo.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
My real question is, Leo, what did you do?

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What did you do?

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, Leo.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Shit's on you.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
She was planning other dates.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
How gnarly was that gas you ripped at the end where she was like, never again.

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is the worst toot in history.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The toot heard around the world.

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The toot heard around the world.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Leo, here's something for you to nosh on.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Maybe since you were the one that was wronged in this scenario, maybe you shouldn't be sweating.

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How awkward it is.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Maybe you, Leo, should be just riding that awkward wave.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Give her the pretend you don't know who she is.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That'll go good.

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh, I like that.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You like that?

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I think that's pretty good.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Griffin, how do you make things less awkward with girls like this?

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I shit you not.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Packing up and moving away is one of the few options.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Otherwise, time's going to heal those wounds.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Really, you're going to meet so many new people at university, as you say, that I really don't

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
think it's going to be a big deal, man.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's the thing.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't know what school you're going to, but most of them are big enough that you're

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
not going to see her.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You might see her two times in the next year, so don't worry about it.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But if you do see her, just punch her right in the face.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No, don't punch her in the face.

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Travis, don't punch her in the face.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
My fault.

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I get caught up sometimes.

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
When are we going to get a new brother?

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I am a single young gentleman who relies on the advice from others as a formative measure.

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
When talking to people, I often find myself giving anecdotes and metaphors too frequently.

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Even I will admit that most are pointless and or boring.

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Am I being rude or do I need to refine these skills?

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Please help, Simon.

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't see why I can't be both, Simon, but maybe you are being rude and yes, you need

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
to get better at that.

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Travis, do you have any advice for him?

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You can never use anecdotes and metaphors too frequently.

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
In fact, you should only speak in metaphors.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay, well, that's probably, maybe Travis wasn't the one I should have turned to for

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
wisdom on this.

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
To be fair, I don't know what a metaphor is.

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I can't remember if that's the one with like her ass.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You would probably be well to remember that there's nothing that says you have to speak

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
in any given moment.

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Sometimes I'll mull over five to ten different things I could say in a given situation and

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
then wait till I come up with a really good one and then say that because a lot of times

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
if you talk and don't really think about it before you talk, you'll just, well, you'll

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,000
be recording the show, but sometimes people will let you host a podcast, but it's not

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
the best way to entertain.

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Try asking more questions.

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
As far as being rude goes, Justin pretty much hit it on the head there is the rudeness comes

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
from taking up all of the space in the conversation or in the room.

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If you're a real fatty, that's what it is too.

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I still don't understand how using metaphors in a conversation is rude.

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Maybe they're like overly long metaphors.

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Like today is like a day that it's a simile.

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's like a sun.

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
See, okay, so metaphor is the one with ass, right?

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That would be like saying today is a sun.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Today is a sun.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Maybe, maybe his metaphor is you're a pussy.

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Maybe he's confusing metaphor with your mama jokes.

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Are you not dropping enough of those?

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Because those are pretty important for social skills.

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
In the end, you just need to focus and think about what you're saying before you say it

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
because if it's not something that you would like to hear, then chances are other people

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
wouldn't like to hear it either.

168
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Also, listen to a lot.

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm going to write that down.

170
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Listen to a lot of stand up comedy and steal it.

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Just cold house it and no one will be the wiser.

172
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yahoo answers user Moli.

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Moli asks, oh, and this question was sent in by TJ Madd.

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Thank you, TJ Madd.

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Moli asks, how do you treat someone with an obsession with sticky buns?

176
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm sick of the questions and the buns are mounting.

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So is the mold.

178
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He won't talk about anything else.

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You will see him on Yahoo.

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He's the one with an obsession with sticky buns.

181
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That was a fully formed sentence.

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That was my favorite episode of Hoarders.

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Did you guys see that one?

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I think it was subtitled A Sticky Situation.

185
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I really I guess the only thing you can do is get them hooked on an even more delicious

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
food, although you'd be hard pressed.

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's super doughnut.

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Jesus.

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm obsessed with super doughnuts, but the fact that I'm not in elementary school keeps

190
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
me from eating them for every meal.

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What's up with super doughnuts?

192
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Does anybody have any of those right now in this podcast?

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If you work at a school, a public institution, we will trade you wampum style super doughnuts

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
for t-shirts.

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's a new initiative, the super doughnuts for t-shirts initiative.

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
They're full of nutrients.

197
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They're full of a lot of super doughnuts.

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
They are so full of nutrients and full of flavor and they're always soggy.

199
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Always.

200
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Except that last bit because they're microwaved and that last bit is always the last bit is

201
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
hard like a like some sort of doughnut scab.

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's where the nutrients are.

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You got to suck the nutrients out.

204
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But you wait, wait, wait.

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Don't tell me you've been eating that.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's the rind.

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I didn't know.

208
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's that's nature's handle.

209
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're not supposed to eat that part of the super doughnut.

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's disgusting.

211
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
When I moved into my new house, the gas station right by sold super doughnuts and they were

212
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
right between like the bongs and the lottery tickets.

213
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
There was just a big box of super doughnuts.

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That sounds like the coolest apartment of that gas station.

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It is.

216
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So do you think there are people who went to school in places where there weren't super

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
doughnuts that have literally no idea what we're talking about?

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We sound like mad people, like just crazy people.

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Like people that don't know what breakfast pizza is?

220
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Just Google it and you'll find out.

221
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But basically, they're delicious doughnuts with nutrients and a rind.

222
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm a guy and I'm thinking of shaving my legs.

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
If so, how far up the leg should I shave?

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What are your thoughts on men shaving legs from form spring?

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Bitch, what do you think our thoughts are?

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll tell you how far up you should shave.

227
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Not not up, but to the ankle, to the ankle.

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Shave your just the top of your foot and your knuckles.

229
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Shave your foot, Bilbo.

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The answer is either not at all or all the way.

231
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah.

232
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I don't want any of this half-ass shit.

233
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I want you to shave it.

234
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Inner thigh, outer calf.

235
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And just a lightning bolt that goes.

236
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Leg like a hairy checkerboard.

237
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's what I want.

238
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Carve your basketball jersey number into your inner thigh hair.

239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Better yet, carve mine and we'll be going steady.

240
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You shouldn't shave your leg.

241
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Don't shave your legs.

242
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Unless you're a swimmer.

243
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
If you're a swimmer.

244
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
If you're a professional swimmer or runner.

245
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I bet that Michael Phelps shaves his legs and he could beat the shit out of me.

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He's just all arms and sinew, isn't he?

247
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yes, he's like some kind of pterodactyl.

248
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Like a pterodactyl.

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
He's like an antelope.

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
He's like half antelope.

251
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Half antelope, half pterodactyl.

252
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Can you think of any other reason for shaving your legs other than I'm a professional athlete?

253
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, if you're a drag queen.

254
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
If you're a what?

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
A drag queen.

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If you're a drag queen.

257
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And what I've learned from RuPaul's Drag U is that almost all drag queens are helpful and wise.

258
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
They're the wizards of the modern generation.

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They are the wizards.

260
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If you're starting a quest, don't even trip.

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Don't even hang out with that wizard.

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Just skip to a drag queen.

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
They know everything.

264
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
They've seen the Quinn from both sides and they like it.

265
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
They like what they saw.

266
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I met the most beautiful girl.

267
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
This is from Andrew, Gmail.

268
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen last night.

269
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And she's single, so I want to take a shot at her.

270
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Whoa.

271
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Whoa.

272
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Easy there, DC Sniper.

273
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah.

274
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Let's chill out.

275
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The problem is I'm doing a semester-long program in DC.

276
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh, shit.

277
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh, God.

278
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh, damn it.

279
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
No.

280
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm leaving today.

281
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Should I add her on Facebook and keep in touch while I'm in DC?

282
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Whew.

283
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Or just see what happens when I get back in December so I don't seem creepy by adding

284
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
her after hanging out with her only once.

285
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Andrew from Gmail.

286
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Don't add her on Facebook.

287
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Oh, add her.

288
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Add her.

289
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
No one.

290
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You cares.

291
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I had people that I talked to once in high school that I do not remember, but apparently

292
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
remember me.

293
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Facebook adding doesn't matter.

294
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Well, he can add her, but what's he going to keep in touch with to kind of keep that

295
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
first-time meeting energy alive?

296
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You know what I mean?

297
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Hey, remember that time at Sparrow?

298
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We had that three-minute-long conversation, there were sparks.

299
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You remember the sparks?

300
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The Sparrow sparks?

301
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It was delicious.

302
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If you've already made that initial connection, if you've already talked to her and hung out

303
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
a little bit, Facebook is a pretty good way to sort of stay in touch, to stay in the loop.

304
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You can follow what she's doing.

305
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But also, it can be a great tool for managing her love life until you return to be her special

306
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
guy.

307
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So, if she says on her status, met an interesting guy tonight, might go somewhere, and you comment

308
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
on that status.

309
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Well, let's not be too hasty.

310
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Let's really think about this.

311
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
How well do you know him?

312
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Have you seen the latest AIDS stats?

313
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Everyone's got it.

314
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
They're pretty AIDS-y, so maybe you should just think about that.

315
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, is it Rick?

316
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Who hasn't Rick been with?

317
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah, just add her on Facebook, because A, it doesn't matter, and B, if she is interested,

318
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
then that's kind of a way of, you know, you showing that you're interested.

319
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Kind of a sad way, but...

320
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yeah, kind of a way to make her want to...

321
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Makes me wish that you thought I was cute so you'd shoot me.

322
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
FormSpring asks, Hi Mubim Bam.

323
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I just dyed my hair fuchsia, and I am now thinking of the next color that I am going

324
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
to do.

325
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I am a girl, so the pinks and purples are okay.

326
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What do you think would be a good color?

327
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Thank you in advance, Tony.

328
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I think it's thank you in advance, comma, Tony.

329
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh.

330
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Tony, you are always such a pretty girl.

331
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Tony, I remember brushing out your long brown hair and saying to everybody, she looks just

332
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
like a princess.

333
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
She looks like a young Linda Carter, is what I used to tell people.

334
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I wish you would just dye it brown.

335
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Just dye it brown so you could be that girl we all remember and come home.

336
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
We miss you, Tony.

337
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Tony, come home.

338
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We miss you.

339
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The big city does swallow you up.

340
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The city swallows you up, Tony.

341
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Come back.

342
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm so down with fuchsia-colored hair.

343
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm down with it, Tony.

344
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I think it's great.

345
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I think next color, how about lime green?

346
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Whoa.

347
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Actually, I like that.

348
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You went out there.

349
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Why don't you dye it lime green?

350
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
When people comment on it, say, you know, got to get that money.

351
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
People will be like, what?

352
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's a reminder to get that money.

353
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Tony, are you all about getting that money?

354
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Because if so, I would say green.

355
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I would say Tony with an I, all about that money.

356
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
She's got to get that cheddar, right?

357
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Is she one of the Tonys like Tony, Tony, Tony?

358
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Because then it's all about the money.

359
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Whoa.

360
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Did you ask Tony and Tony what colors they're going with?

361
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
There's nothing worse than showing up to record Poison 2 and people will be like, and Tony.

362
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That was Belle, Biv, DeVoe.

363
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Oh, snap.

364
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Can you edit this out?

365
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm actually going to forward it to Belle and Biv.

366
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But not DeVoe.

367
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Fuck him.

368
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
DeVoe died.

369
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Let's move on to my next question.

370
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh, no.

371
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This comes from, this next question says, no one remembers that I recorded Poison.

372
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What should I do?

373
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
DeVoe.

374
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So sad.

375
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's so sad.

376
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
God.

377
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I feel like the momentum is completely off now.

378
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You know what will pick it back up?

379
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What?

380
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, this question was sent in by Christopher, Yahoo Answers user DK.

381
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I always screw that up.

382
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What did Tony, Tony, Tony do?

383
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Tony, Tony, Tony.

384
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I honest to God, I couldn't tell you.

385
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Griffin, you read the question.

386
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'll do a little googling.

387
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
If I had no loot.

388
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Here we go.

389
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
DK asks, how should I wear a flannel shirt without looking bad?

390
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Now, listen, there's a matrix of options here.

391
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
We need to come up with an algorithm using these metrics that DK has provided.

392
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Okay.

393
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Options.

394
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
White v-neck, black wife beater, white wife beater, black crew neck, gray crew neck, no undershirt.

395
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
How many buttons undone?

396
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Zero, one, two, three, etc.

397
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Bonus.

398
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What type of jeans?

399
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Add or deduct things.

400
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I am a guy.

401
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I am skinny.

402
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I have short hair.

403
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
First off, I want to say how much I appreciate him going through the different numbers of buttons.

404
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Because sometimes I get hitched between two and four and I have to remember, ah shit, three.

405
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That's the one.

406
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It is a red, black plaid flannel shirt.

407
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
He has one shirt that he is dying to wear, but he's just eyeballing it from across the room trying to figure it out.

408
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
He gots to wear it the right way.

409
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I want to wear this shirt.

410
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I have one flannel shirt that grants me wishes and I have to wear it.

411
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
DK, hold on to your asshole.

412
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:57,000
White V-neck, all buttons undone, wrapped around your waist, torn, faded, light blue jeans.

413
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I love it.

414
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
That's the Joey Lawrence is what I call that look.

415
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Whoa, you just blew my fashion mind.

416
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Turn it into a flannel kilt.

417
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That's what I'm saying.

418
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah, but not a utility kilt because I'll leap through the internet.

419
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'll fucking strangle you.

420
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Justin, I believe you were looking for House Party 2 from the House Party 2 soundtrack.

421
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I think that was their big hit.

422
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The House Party 2 soundtrack had a song on it by Tony Tony Tony called House Party 2.

423
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Wait, wait, wait.

424
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I can't tear down anybody's knowledge of Tony Tony Tony, but you think that House Party 2 was maybe their big song?

425
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It reached number 19 on the US R&B charts.

426
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You guys remember when Will Smith did that track on the Independence Day soundtrack called Independence Day?

427
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That reached number 19 on the hip hop and soul charts if I remember correctly.

428
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Welcome to Earth, welcome to Earth, welcome, welcome.

429
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Welcome to Earth, welcome to Earth, welcome, welcome.

430
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Can we get back to the narrative subject at hand?

431
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Can you just read the last couple sentences again, just the part with just the whole thing?

432
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Add or deduct things.

433
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I am a guy. I am skinny. I have short hair.

434
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It sounds so defensive.

435
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It sounds like a math problem.

436
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:30,000
If one douchebag is traveling at 50 miles an hour to Hollister to get a goofy looking red and black flannel shirt,

437
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
how many buttons should he button up?

438
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Add or deduct the fact that he is skinny and has short hair.

439
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Why do you feel the need to wear this shirt?

440
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It sounds like he's causing you a lot of consternation.

441
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Maybe just throw it.

442
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I think the better question is how many failed attempts has he had at wearing this shirt?

443
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
He just comes home dejected and strips it off and goes, today wasn't my day.

444
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I can't do it internet.

445
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Clothes but no cigar.

446
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Do you think he's sitting in his room with like three blackboards surrounding him?

447
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
He's just like madly doing arithmetic.

448
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You have to come out and eat.

449
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Shut up mom, I'm figuring out the shirt continuum.

450
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
No undershirt, one button undone.

451
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Blue jeans.

452
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Honey, we're supposed to be married today.

453
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Why are you saying these things?

454
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Just say I do.

455
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
No, no jeans. Short hair.

456
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm a guy. I am skinny.

457
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So you want to name your child.

458
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The name you want me to put on the birth certificate is one button.

459
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Black crew neck.

460
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm skinny. I am a guy.

461
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Fanny pack?

462
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
For one week, all that's written on the board is just dry letters.

463
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Fanny pack with a big question mark at the end.

464
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's been 30 years and I've never even considered fanny packs.

465
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Fanny pack!

466
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
As he slowly chews on the end of his glasses and then just erases the board and cries.

467
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:06,000
He finally solves it and in celebration he tips over his blackboard and tears the shirt in half.

468
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm B.E. you flannel bitch!

469
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Rod Serling is like, what's up Twilight Zone?

470
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Deal with it. We're out of ideas.

471
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And I'm dead.

472
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Forum Spring asks, Dear Mabim Bam, what's the best way to meet nerdy single women?

473
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Science nerds, video game nerds, animation nerds, movie nerds, whatever.

474
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
BTW, I mean non lesbians.

475
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Overstocked on them, thank you.

476
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Regards, single player.

477
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Ooh, I like that.

478
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Can everyone start whenever they ask questions?

479
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Can they give either like little nicknames like that that are appropriate to the question that they're asking?

480
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Or like, Forlorn and Frankfurt or something like that?

481
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah, I like that.

482
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Griffin, you should know this.

483
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Oh, should I?

484
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I do really well at this actually.

485
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Do you?

486
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
No.

487
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
They, for the most part, don't exist.

488
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
They are cryptozoological in nature.

489
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
They're often seen riding unicorns and such.

490
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yeah, I mean, the best thing you can do is just bounce from GameStop to GameStop just looking for a cute cashier.

491
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
With a net.

492
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
With a net, yeah.

493
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You have to put her in a net, whatever.

494
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
No, don't put anyone in a net.

495
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I really don't know what to tell you.

496
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Facebook's pretty cool.

497
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The internet's alright.

498
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You can meet lots of people in that.

499
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Why don't you go to PAX?

500
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah, go to PAX.

501
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Go to some sort of convention.

502
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
But, I don't know.

503
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
They're not looking to meet dudes.

504
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You put an attractive girl at a video game or nerdy convention, it's just like chum for nerd sharks.

505
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I just, also, I don't think you should be, I don't think anyone should use that as a metric for people that you're looking for.

506
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I don't think anyone should ever be like, oh, I need to find a partner.

507
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
How about someone who's nerdy?

508
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I don't think anyone, like that shouldn't be, there's so many other qualities that are more important than that when looking for another person.

509
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:32,000
That's a great point, because if I had asked this question ten years ago, I mean, this is probably the sort of thing that I would be looking for, right?

510
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Somebody who has similar interest to me, but now that I'm older, I mean, my wife and I don't, we don't have any interests that are similar.

511
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:53,000
We like really disparate things, but we get along probably a little bit better because of that, because we have different spheres of interest.

512
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And the important thing is her nerdiness about certain things is something you find out.

513
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's not like you're going to look at her across the room and be like, oh my god, there's a huge video game nerd.

514
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You get to know someone and find out what their interests are.

515
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Anybody who makes it that obvious, it's probably an affectation, which is not something you want to be attracted to.

516
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And they're probably dressed like a Final Fantasy character, and you don't want to talk to them anyway.

517
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
This is a question that Griffin's going to be able to knock out of the park, so I'm just going to ask it.

518
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm a member of my high school cross-country team, which means I have an hour of jogging a day or more.

519
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Oh, you show off. The problem is, as I get it, OK, we all get it.

520
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
The problem is, as a sensible alternative rock and indie music fan, TMBG and Sufjan Stevens-

521
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Wrong!

522
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Quite.

523
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It's Sufjan.

524
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Sufi? Sufjan? Sufjan. OK, let me try again.

525
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
TMBG and Sufjan Stevens are not kind of fist pumping.

526
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Hi, I'm 29 years old, OK?

527
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You're lucky I can turn my computer on, you slut, so shut up.

528
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Do you guys have any suggestions for music that would get me pumped up for jogging long distances?

529
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Russ, Gmail.

530
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Here, how about this?

531
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yeah, turn us up.

532
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Running and running and running.

533
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
One foot, next foot, next foot, next foot.

534
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
The answer, of course, is Neil Diamond.

535
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Cranked up as loud as I can go.

536
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah, maybe.

537
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I actually listen to a lot of podcasts whenever I'm doing my walk around the neighborhood.

538
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Not my jog. Maybe that's missing something.

539
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Maybe you should stop.

540
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Maybe you should quit the cross-country running team and join the cross-country walking team.

541
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And then listen to podcasts.

542
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Cross-block, cross-neighborhood walking team.

543
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Other than that, man, just find something with fast beat.

544
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Maybe a Daft Punk, maybe an LCD sound system.

545
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Something to just, you know, get the blood pumping.

546
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Get that Fix Up, Look Sharp.

547
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Fix Up, Look Sharp? Yeah, anything off the DJ Hero soundtrack.

548
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah, get the DJ Hero soundtrack.

549
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
That's good.

550
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And you know what?

551
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Maybe you're not listening to the right They Might Be Giants songs,

552
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
because there are some of those that are upbeat and get you pumped.

553
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Can I recommend the House Party 2 soundtrack?

554
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
What was that one song on there?

555
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You were talking about House Party 2.

556
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I have a real problem with listening to music whenever I'm running,

557
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,000
because I don't have one of those sleek little iPod baby iPods

558
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
that you slide into your arm, into your cyborg arm, that just kind of stays there.

559
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Did you say cyborg?

560
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
No, cyborg.

561
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I have like a big Zune.

562
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I have like a big 30-Googlebyte Zune that any time I run it just jangles around in my pocket.

563
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Right.

564
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It makes me look silly.

565
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Are you running a lot more than I knew about?

566
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Is this a big problem for you?

567
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
There's a lot of people chasing Griffin in his new neighborhood.

568
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I've been doing a bit of exercise, yes.

569
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Is that okay?

570
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I mean, I don't want anybody growing.

571
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
No, you should grow.

572
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I want you to grow as a person.

573
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I feel I am.

574
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But it's important that you don't surpass us.

575
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You can catch up to me, and then you've got to stop.

576
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yeah, just get a good design.

577
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
That shouldn't be too hard.

578
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I am 27, and my husband is 28.

579
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
We are coming up on 30,

580
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and I'm wondering if there is something that we should do before we hit 30.

581
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
We don't have kids, so we don't have to worry about that,

582
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and we don't want kids, so please don't say have children.

583
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
We live in upstate New York and have a bit of money saved up.

584
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Any suggestions?

585
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Tony.

586
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Also with an I.

587
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Wait a minute.

588
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Tony's getting a two for this week.

589
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Congratulations, Tony.

590
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You're lucky Travis is negligent.

591
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
No, it's a completely different Tony.

592
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Oh, okay, sure.

593
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
This is Tony Collette.

594
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I think you should act.

595
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Just act as much as you can as Collette.

596
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You're a real talent.

597
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You're a treasure.

598
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Hollywood treasure, Tony Collette.

599
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Upstate New York.

600
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Okay, I have a few suggestions.

601
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
You could, they're skydiving.

602
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
If you say we're on a cross-country amusement park trip.

603
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Rocky Mountain Climb?

604
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You got to stop.

605
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
How about buy an apple orchard?

606
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Whoa.

607
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I like that.

608
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You got to buy something, right?

609
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
When you turn 30, you have to buy something as a gift to yourself for not dying for 30 years.

610
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I really think an apple orchard in upstate New York would be a real treat.

611
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Get some farm hands.

612
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:50,000
When you see people doing weird things in their 60s, they had to have a moment earlier where like they decided to do that.

613
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And this has to be your moment.

614
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
We're like, how did you guys get an apple orchard?

615
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It's like, well, we just.

616
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
At turn 30, we didn't want to have kids.

617
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
These apples are our kids.

618
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Please stop eating my baby.

619
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
David.

620
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
David.

621
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
He wasn't even ripe yet, you bastard.

622
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Your baby's really mealy.

623
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Do you want another slice of bread pie?

624
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
We made it this morning.

625
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It's full of bread, our baby.

626
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So what we're saying to you is you should have an apple orchard and you should make the apples your babies.

627
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And Sharpie on faces on every single one.

628
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I mean, Sharpie faces.

629
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It doesn't have to be an apple orchard, but it has to be something big and irresponsible.

630
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It has to be some kind of orchard.

631
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Yeah, but make sure it has to be something you have no idea how to take care of.

632
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It has to be like in three months.

633
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
A llama farm.

634
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Oh shit.

635
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
All our alpacas are dead.

636
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
These alpacas are dead as fuck.

637
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
We did not think about this before we did it.

638
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I like that.

639
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Do that one.

640
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
My best friend lives about 1.5 hours away.

641
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
That's 90 minutes.

642
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And every time she comes into town, she demands that we hang out all the time.

643
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Now, I would love to, but I have a life aside from her, a job, and sometimes I'm just tired at the end of the day.

644
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And not in the social mind to hang out.

645
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I tell her and she keeps demanding.

646
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
What should I say to her?

647
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Or am I just not appreciating our friendship as much as her?

648
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Hey, do you guys remember that question?

649
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I think it was like last week or the week before that where someone talked about how they went in town to hang out with their best friend, but they didn't want to hang out with them.

650
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Uh-huh.

651
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Uh-oh.

652
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:38,000
We've actually received this question a couple times, and thank you for listening when I said to send it again because I forget all the past questions.

653
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I don't know if they're related, but if so, apologies.

654
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I think you just got to bite the bullet.

655
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:53,000
If I have a friend in town, I'll hang out with them even if I'm not even particularly close friends with them or don't want to hang out.

656
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
My friend is an hour and a half away.

657
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's not like she moved to Nebraska or something.

658
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
She probably sees her once a week.

659
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
You know what I mean?

660
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's not that epic a deal that she's in town.

661
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I love how you think Nebraska isn't close to anything.

662
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Nebraska is universally far away from every point on the globe.

663
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
To be fair, I meant to say Alaska, and it came out as Nebraska.

664
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Regardless.

665
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Earlier, I meant to say Bilbo Devoe, and it came out as Tony Tony Tony.

666
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
That's my fault.

667
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I meant to say house party, too, and it came out as poison.

668
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Yeah, just drop her if you don't want to hang out.

669
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yeah, sorry.

670
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
If you don't want to hang out with her, then that means that you don't want to hang out with her.

671
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And this and there is a quick solution to that problem.

672
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
That means like it's it's not being a friend anymore.

673
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You could come up with like creative like, you know, I can't.

674
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I have the flu or crabs or something.

675
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
But you could keep coming up with those lies, but eventually you're going to get sick of that, too.

676
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And just straight up be like, listen, I don't want to hang out every time you come in town.

677
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I have other things to do.

678
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
If that bothers you, I am sorry.

679
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Because really, what are you out?

680
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Like if she gets really mad and doesn't talk to you for like two months, then what are you missing there?

681
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I mean, she could go like she could go swim fan on her ass.

682
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Oh, shit.

683
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
She could start she could start leaving like dead small animals in her front seat of her car.

684
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Like it's a it's a thorny situation, which is.

685
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Which is why I almost always tell people to pack up and just get the thing is, you can't leave a 40 and that's because swim fans will check the track you down.

686
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Why not split the difference and tell her you're moving away?

687
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Tell her you're moving to Nebraska and you will come visit her.

688
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
When you can.

689
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah, that's the only thing you can do is retaliate.

690
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Don't even move away.

691
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Just go and visit her like every other day and just be a big useless lump whenever you're hanging out.

692
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Just don't talk to her.

693
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Just just say I like your presence or go up there and have her decline you and just be lonely all day and see how she's living.

694
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yeah, because that then the shoe will be on the other proverbial foot.

695
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Deal with that.

696
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I have a Yahoo answers question.

697
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
OK, it's from Dave one, but it was sent in by T.J.

698
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Mad is my second T.J.

699
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Mad question of the show.

700
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
He's a real hero.

701
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Thank you, T.J.

702
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Man.

703
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Dave one asks and to really appreciate the comedy of this question, you have to understand that it's in all caps.

704
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:45,000
OK, he asks, why do we scream or shout loudly when frightened or excited?

705
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
For example, when on a fast ride or something makes you jump.

706
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What's the purpose of making a loud noise?

707
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I mean, it's it's it's really dumb and poorly worded, but he's got a point.

708
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
What are we doing?

709
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
We're wasting our throat meat all these years on screaming for no reason.

710
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Next time you go to King's Island and you're on the vortex, just losing your mind.

711
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Just oh, oh, give it one of those.

712
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It's so fast.

713
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I used to I got I got into a kick.

714
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And I think probably everybody gets to this phase when I would go on roller coasters.

715
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And, you know, they take your picture.

716
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I with everybody screaming, I thought, you know what I'll do?

717
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'll just look super cool.

718
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And then and then everybody screaming, I'll be like, what's up?

719
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
But I found that like maybe it's because of the gravity or or because of like the internal terror.

720
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
But like it always looked like seven people having the time of their life.

721
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
One guy trying not to poop.

722
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
The picture always looked like it sounds like I'm just going to do the screaming thing because maybe that's why.

723
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Because it's either scream or look in the picture like you're trying not to poop.

724
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I always give the I always give two middle fingers up, point them up.

725
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Give two middle fingers because it lets people know how edgy I am.

726
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And that that fucking King's Island attendant who's all whose job is to sit and look at pictures of people having fun all day.

727
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Like worst job ever.

728
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
He sees someone giving the double deuce and he's like he watch him.

729
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I keep an eye on him and that picture loads up and gives a little unknowing smile.

730
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
What I do is I flash my boobies and it's because I'm whimsical because I'm fun.

731
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And I'm also a little bit sexy.

732
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You know what I mean?

733
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
She's a little crazy, a little wild.

734
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

735
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
But before I do, we have a couple of quick housekeeping things, just reminders, basically.

736
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
First off, as always, thank you.

737
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Thank you. Thank you.

738
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
You're telling people about the show.

739
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
You're tweeting about the show.

740
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
We love to see to see that.

741
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Gotta give a shout out to my man, Nick Suttner.

742
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
He's he's in Suttner on Twitter if you want to follow him.

743
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:20,000
But he he promotes the show every single week, tells people, hey, there's a new one of these out.

744
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You should go listen to it.

745
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Ditto for Xander Davis Live.

746
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
He's another one that was talking about the program.

747
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So Charlene five one nine on Twitter is passing it out to her friends.

748
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Someone passed it to her and now she's telling other people about it.

749
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Thank you for that.

750
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It forward pay.

751
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Always said that it.

752
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I would also like to thank Kate Nash on our Facebook appreciation group.

753
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
She posted a picture of her holding the postcard that she's sending to Tristan.

754
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Thank you so much for that, Kate.

755
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
That's so sweet.

756
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Everyone. Oh, the address for Tristan's on the Facebook group.

757
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So if you want to send him he's our favorite Marine.

758
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
We've seen gotten a couple.

759
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I got a mail from last last week.

760
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
He seems to be doing pretty good.

761
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And thanks, everybody.

762
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Oh, thanks to bought T-shirts, too.

763
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Oh, yeah.

764
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Those should be going out from what we've heard.

765
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
All the pre-order shirts are out and about in the world.

766
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Do you want to hear a confession?

767
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Yeah, I just ordered my shirt today.

768
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
You piece of shit.

769
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
What?

770
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I assume they would send me one.

771
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
My name is on it.

772
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I bought mine.

773
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I bought both of mine.

774
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So if you if you want to be like Travis and buy a shirt, you can go to MBNBAM.com.

775
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Click buy stuff.

776
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
There's a link to two shirts.

777
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,000
If you pre-order shirt is in the mail and other orders are being processed as they come.

778
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I'm seeing a lot of people putting up pics of them wearing the shirt on Twitter.

779
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I think we're going to collect all those, put them somewhere either on the side or maybe on the on the on the T-shirt site.

780
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So keep what's the best way just to email us links or what you should do is.

781
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Just put them on Facebook and then link them in the Facebook group, which which we have.

782
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And I don't think we've talked about in a while, but we have a Facebook group.

783
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It's my brother, my brother and me appreciation group.

784
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You got to search for the whole thing.

785
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So put your pictures on there and then we'll grab them from there.

786
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And also, you know, it helps spread the word.

787
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
People like, hey, what's that really fresh, comfortable looking shirt all about?

788
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
If you don't use FB, you can tweet it.

789
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Just always use the NBA hashtag on Friendster.

790
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And no, don't do that.

791
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Just get on the space.

792
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Oh, God.

793
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Or email it if you don't use any of that.

794
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Or fax it.

795
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
We don't fax.

796
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And that's all the housekeeping stuff.

797
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Review this on iTunes.

798
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Subscribe.

799
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And if you want to send in a question, all the methods are on our website, MBMBAM.com.

800
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Which is about to get a facelift, I think.

801
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Oh, yeah.

802
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Oh, it's beautiful too.

803
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
In the works.

804
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Lots of big things.

805
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Lots of big things.

806
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Stay on board.

807
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And it's all, make no mistake, it's all because of you.

808
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Because of me?

809
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
No, not you.

810
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
If anything, you're hindering the process, Mr. No T-shirt Buying.

811
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I bought one today.

812
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Yeah, you're a big one.

813
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Here we go.

814
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Last question from my brother, Griffin.

815
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
My real brother, Griffin.

816
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I make the distinction because he bought a T-shirt.

817
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I bought one today.

818
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Oh, and I'm going to be at PAX this week.

819
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I mentioned it earlier.

820
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I'm going to be at PAX this week, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

821
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
If you are there and you have a My Brother, My Brother, Me T-shirt, wear it.

822
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
If you see somebody wearing a My Brother, My Brother, Me T-shirt, hug them because they've earned it.

823
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Unlike some people on this show.

824
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Namely, Travis.

825
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I found this question on Yahoo Answers Malaysia.

826
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
What's up?

827
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
National.

828
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Shabana on Yahoo Answers Malaysia asks, also in all caps, by the way,

829
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
how can you make your own dildo at home?

830
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
How am I supposed to break this?

831
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I'm Justin McElroy.

832
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I'm Travis McElroy.

833
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

834
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

835
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Kiss your dad and square on the lips.

836
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You will never know me.

837
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Give me something I can break.
