1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:58,880
Aren't we a pair? Me here at last on the ground, you in midair. Sending the clowns. Isn't it bliss?

6
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:09,440
Don't you approve? One who keeps tearing around, one who can't move. Where are the clowns?

7
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:21,440
Sending the clowns. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me 100,

8
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:28,720
a retrospective. I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I am your middle-est brother,

9
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,280
Travis McElroy. I'm the sweet baby brother Griffin. Why are we talking like this?

10
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,720
It's like an NPR special. Like an NPR special remembering the McElroy brothers. Behind the

11
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,880
wisdom. Behind the wisdom, they called it. I think that idea is Terry Gross.

12
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,960
Oh, Terry Gross humor. So welcome everybody. We're walking on broken Ira glass. Those are

13
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:01,200
the only two people I know from NPR. Also, Rick Steves. So what do you know? This show stinks.

14
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,480
That's my what do you know gag about what do you know with Michael Feldman. People have listened

15
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,600
to a hundred episodes of this. That's their bad. This is what we're delivering. These are the

16
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,600
goose we bring to our hundredth episode. This is our hundredth episode. The show of a hundred

17
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,800
goose is what this is going to be called. This is not a lot of people know this, but the hundredth

18
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,120
anniversary is the bad NPR puns anniversary. It's the most treasured gift. So this is our hundredth

19
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,280
show. If you can believe that shit, we started. God, we, we, uh, our first episode I believe was

20
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,440
April 11th or April 12th. Yeah. This is also our two year. I believe it's our two year anniversary.

21
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,360
It is. Yeah. So we've been doing this junk for two years. You've been listening to me to skip

22
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,960
12 episodes at some point or bad. Well, no, there's a, I don't think we numbered the candle

23
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,280
nights episodes. Did we? Uh, and good job on the math there, Griffin. There's 52 weeks. So we'd be

24
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:04,480
at a hundred and four. That's 72 times two. Hold on. Hold on. Six is a hundred. You forgot to carry

25
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,280
it. Did you carry it? Did you do, where's the square root? I dropped the one. Yeah. You never

26
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,880
show your work, Travis. Uh, so this is our advice show for the modern era. Uh, we have, thank you

27
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,960
guys so much for letting us continue to do this for you for so long. Um, thank you for not finding

28
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,800
anything better to do. Thank you for not getting one more extra productive hour in your week.

29
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,600
Although I'm sure you're like cleaning. Are you cleaning the sink right now? You probably are.

30
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,720
Somebody's doing dishes right now. You're doing dishes right now. Hey, if, if there's a couple

31
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,640
doing dishes together while you're watching the show, I want you to look each other and just be

32
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,840
like, it looks like we made it. Cause this is the mo these are the moments. This is like the

33
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,600
equivalent of when you're painting the house together and she's got a handkerchief on her head

34
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,120
and then one of you accidentally gets paint on the other and then oops, roller fight.

35
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,600
This is like that kind of man. Also walking on sunshine is playing. It's like the first,

36
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,720
it's like the first four minutes of up and then hopefully not the two minutes that follow that.

37
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,440
You know, I would like someone who hasn't seen up before to show them up and then like hit stop

38
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,040
after the first four minutes. Like that was it. It was just one of those Pixar shorts. Pretty great,

39
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,040
huh? It's yeah. It's just called happy marriage. This is like the middle five minutes of the,

40
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,360
fuck yeah. Curious jam a button, man. What's that? That old rat pit jam, you know, where they were,

41
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,040
he was old and she was young. Jack. You're thinking of Jack. I'm thinking of Jack.

42
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,040
So let's, let's actually get to helping people. We've got probably too much to do this week.

43
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,800
So let's, uh, let's get right on it. My roommate's girlfriend has taken to spending four or five days

44
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,120
of the week at our apartment. She takes a shower twice a day, uses the toilet, does most of her

45
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,160
laundry here and uses the internet and cable. Is it appropriate to ask her to start paying

46
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,200
utilities or even rent? I know this seems obvious, but we're in college and she's still

47
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,320
paying for her own apartment until the lease ends in August. So I feel sort of bad, but at the same

48
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,640
time, me and my other roommates feel as though we're basically paying her to live here. Brothers,

49
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,640
what are we to do? That's from disgruntled in Delaware. There's I think, I don't think this

50
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,600
issue is as black and white as it, as it seems. No, this question should be called how horrible

51
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,760
it is to be in college. Yeah. Cause this I I'm guarantee you live with six people, right? You

52
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,720
live with six people in a three bedroom house. That's thorny. No matter which way you slice it,

53
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,880
she squatters. She now you have complained that she uses the toilet and I would not bring,

54
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,360
I would not bring that up when you approach her like, Hey, every, every flush, every dump flush

55
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,760
you do. It's like, she's not going to piggy bank on the back of the toilet. She's not going to admit

56
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,800
to her boyfriend that she uses the bathroom for another couple of years. So you don't want to,

57
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,720
you don't want to blow up her spot this soon. Also, I would say that internet and cable might

58
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,240
not be a good argument because they're completely renewable resources. It's not like she's using up

59
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:27,440
anything. You used up all of my Nickelodeon. Yeah. Can I be honest? Like if I don't think

60
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,960
the right solution is to ask for money. Like I don't, I don't think that's the right. I think

61
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:40,160
if you're uncomfortable with how much time she is spending there, then I think that you should ask,

62
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,040
talk to the guy about it. Talk to her too. Well, no, I don't, I don't mean that. I don't mean that

63
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,400
in a misogynist way. I mean that in like a, like he's the one, you know, presumably a little bit

64
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,080
better and it's going to be more comfortable. I don't mean like a man makes the decisions for

65
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,520
here's the thing. Unless she's like invited herself in and some kind of crazy person way,

66
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,280
he brought her into the apartment. He's having her spend the night. What are you talking about?

67
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:14,240
I'm saying the responsibility is on your roommate, not her. I want to know about the crazy person

68
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,800
way in which she's, is she secretly secretly living in the house? Like a, like a borable?

69
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,720
Is that what's going on? Well, I'm not necessarily going that far, but so much as it's like,

70
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,520
she never goes home now and she just like hangs out there all the time. And he's too afraid of

71
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,840
her to like ask her to maybe spend the night at her own house once or twice a week. So I might

72
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,080
be really physically intimidating is what I'm saying. She's like a witch. You mean a witch?

73
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,880
Yes. He's cursed with. Thank you. A witch that inhabits the eaves of her house. Is this what

74
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,880
you're saying? Maybe she's, maybe she sneaks down into the kitchen and steals all of his fruit. And

75
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:58,240
also she's tiny cause she's a borable. I don't think a borable is what you think it is. Is it

76
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,120
not like this? I think you're thinking of borrowers. God damn it. A borable is a thing,

77
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,160
but I think it's like a rat like child. What? I don't know. I think it's a book

78
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,440
dad used to read and talk about borables. I think it's a book dad made up. Let me cruise

79
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,840
into this borables well for a second. So there's a trilogy. They're written by an English author

80
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,640
and they're runaway children who eventually become borabled. And when they wake up,

81
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,200
they find their ears have been pointed. Okay. So they are rat like children. They are very similar

82
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,880
to, to elves and pixies of English folklore. What I meant is that your girlfriend's a borrower.

83
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,480
Your roommate's girlfriend is a borrower. And unless he's a borrower, I don't know. I can't get

84
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,720
behind borrower crossbreeding. I don't mean to sound like that's not, I don't want to sound

85
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,200
bigoted. I don't want to sound bigoted, but just like the physics of it is kind of gross to think

86
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,960
about, you know, a hundred episodes in and the truth comes out. Your freak, your flag flies.

87
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,560
I'm still so disappointed. Your, your flag, you're flying your flag of hatred, the hatred,

88
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,520
hate tolerance and intolerant flag. I think the only time it's appropriate to ask a girlfriend

89
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,880
that's like staying over for rent is if she does not have her own place. You know what I mean? If

90
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,480
it's like, well, my lease, no, I'm saying like, if she's like crashing there for a month or two,

91
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,000
like until, you know, if she finds another place or something, then you sure as fuck ask for rent.

92
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,560
This is like, she has an offshore bank account though. Like she has an apartment that she pays

93
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:39,040
$13 a month for. Cause it's awful. But she stays here on the free skis. Cause she can always say,

94
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,320
oh no, no, no. I mainly incorporated over on six, the dirty part of it,

95
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,400
but you know, this is, and this is where it gets to, especially if you're not paying for water,

96
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:56,400
if like water is included in your rent, you got no, you have no like to stand on. Yeah. You know

97
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:02,880
what I mean? But maybe it's just like, I think here, I think that the money thing is not at the

98
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:10,240
root of this, the root of it is a sort of place to hang your hat, but really like she's there all the

99
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,760
time. Yeah. And this is your, especially if she's there when he's not putting your foot down. This

100
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:24,240
is like your place. Like, you know, any boyfriend, girlfriend, like you get a house and you think,

101
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
okay, well the three of us are going to live here and it's going to be a little crowded,

102
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,200
but whatever we'll make ends meet. Like, and then you have this other person who's always there and

103
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,040
you don't know them and they're not paying anything. So you resent them. Is it also that

104
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:43,120
he just wants to play Madden and make dude farts? Could that be possible? I wanted to eat this

105
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,480
oversized plate of chicken wings and make dude farts. And you're here all the time,

106
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,040
classing up the place. I'm not saying that women can't eat chicken wings and play Madden and

107
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,320
make dude farts. That's not what I'm saying. That is exactly what women do when there aren't men

108
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,320
around. I'm just saying the mixing of the sexes. When you mix, when you crossbreed, you can't,

109
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,120
you can't, you crossbreed men and women does not believe in breeding between men and women. No,

110
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,720
no, it's disgusting. How did the parts even match up at that point? You know,

111
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,520
it says in the Bible, you must be equally yoked and that cannot apply if one of you is a man

112
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,040
and one of you is a woman. It's disgusting. Like if you're not dong slapping, which is

113
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,320
when you hit two dongs together, like the thunder sticks at a stadium,

114
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,040
like at a sports game. Um, or I don't have a name for what it is when you do it to vaginas.

115
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,640
Okay. Yeah. Oh, can we not, you're going to have to bleep that out. Yeah. Oh, I will.

116
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,000
It wouldn't be our hundredth episode without getting feverish questions about what horrible

117
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,480
thing Travis said that we had to bleep out. Um, I hate you. I, I, you just got to talk to him and

118
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,600
say, listen, either, I don't think you can go halfway on this. Either she becomes a fourth

119
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:11,200
roommate and she's there all the time or wait a minute. The lease ends in August. Yeah. Oh,

120
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,560
right. That's, that's a, that's a hike. That's a ways out. Yeah. Um, I don't think the money's

121
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,200
going to fix your problem though. I think she just needs to stop being there so much. And I

122
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,080
think that's really what's bothering you. I think four or five days a week is way too much. I think

123
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:32,320
like two or three is fine, especially. And here's the other thing. If she was just like getting

124
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,160
there at like eight o'clock at night, they'd watch a movie and then she'd spend the night

125
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,920
and then she'd leave in the morning and go to class. But the fact that she's showering

126
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,000
twice and doing her lawn, she's squatting in your home. She's literally squatting because

127
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,680
she's using your toilet and that's not okay. That's inappropriate. You should put, you know,

128
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,800
you got to put nails on the toilet seat like they do to keep pigeons off of subway stops.

129
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,680
That doesn't mean that is wholly impractical. That's exactly what you need to do. Now that

130
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:07,200
literally, literally, uh, we asked you guys, uh, those of you who we've helped and I was using

131
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,160
air quotes over the years, we asked you to check in with us to tell us how things are going, how

132
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,560
things are going with you. How did it work out? Uh, even though we do advise you to never take

133
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:24,960
our advice. Uh, we're very clear about that. Um, some of you still do occasionally. Um, Travis,

134
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,960
give me a check-in. What's, what's the story out there? You answered my question in episode 29,

135
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,800
the quickening. My question was in regard to my older boyfriend, me 28, him 52. And my fear is

136
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,160
about introducing him to my friends. I cracked up at your world's greatest grandpa slash boyfriend

137
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,360
riff, but you eventually gave me some real advice. I would disagree saying that my friends would be

138
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,320
cool. It turns out they were all my friends are now his friends and we've been together for two

139
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,800
years. Thanks brothers. And congrats on your hundredth episode. I listen every week and I'm

140
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,920
a proud maximum fund supporter due to you. You joke, but you really do help more than you think

141
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,320
your faithful listener. Yes. I know it's weird. Oh yes. I know it's weird. I'm so happy to hear

142
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,080
from you. That's so nice. I remember that question. I'm glad everything worked out.

143
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:16,960
Me too. Why does he take our advice? We did. We are very clear about this. Usually we are in no

144
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,240
way legally responsible for anything. Sometimes give so much different advice that you would

145
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,240
almost, I mean, you almost have to make it. We throw the, we throw the advice spaghetti against

146
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,240
the wall and sometimes something sticks, but for every, for every one piece of spaghetti that does

147
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,920
stick to the wall, like 80 pieces fall to the ground. And so in that respect and crush your dog,

148
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,440
we may help more giant pieces of spaghetti. We may help more than we think, but we also hurt

149
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,320
way, way more than we could ever calculate. Right. Because now you got mice. Look at this

150
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,520
pasta on the floor. This is an issue. We need to get, we need to get somebody in here to clean.

151
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,160
But thank you for listening. And I'm glad that we could help. Thank you so much.

152
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,200
Thanks for being a maximum fund supporter. Yeah. Yeah. You guys did amazing with that stuff. We

153
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,840
won't harp on it too much, but you guys are just the best humans. A billion dollars. Yeah. Well,

154
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,760
we raised a billion dollars. A billion dollars a month. Yeah. A billion dollars

155
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,200
isn't cool though. You know, it's cool.

156
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,120
Yahoo answer? Yahoo answer question. I thought you were going for a transition.

157
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,960
No, we're, we're really, we're really rich now. The three of us are getting to a point where

158
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:36,320
we are, I would say we're careening towards pay to hunt Eastern European people in a forest.

159
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,120
Like that's about where we're, we're about like hostile rich. I have actually at this point over,

160
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:50,000
I took over a serfdom. Did you? Yeah. I have a whole army of serfs now. You know, so rewarding,

161
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,000
but it is watching the twinkle in their eye as I give them some services is one of,

162
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,840
I think one of the most rewarding investments you can make. My one piece of advice to you,

163
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,440
keep your eye on Frankie and Annette because they will, they will get out of hand.

164
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:19,360
Serfs. No, I got you. Serving. Uh-huh. Uh, so surfing. Yeah. No, no. Yeah. I know.

165
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,040
It's funny. Cause, cause they're homonyms. Okay. They sound the same, but they're spelled

166
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,520
different. Here we go. Uh, this Yahoo answer is sent by, I don't think two homonyms should get

167
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:34,320
married there. I'm sorry. Stop it. This Yahoo answer is sent in by Earl Parsons. Thank you,

168
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:42,000
Earl. It's by Yahoo answers user Bob, but not a builder who asks, why do kids think it's cool

169
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,200
to sag if they don't know the real meaning of it? Correct me if I'm wrong, but in prison,

170
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,640
if you sag, does that mean you are owned by someone else in the prison?

171
00:16:52,640 --> 00:17:01,440
I, this, this, this is, this is absolutely a guidance counselor who's wanting to go to

172
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,720
school next day and just fucking nail people like, Hey, you know what that means? I read

173
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:14,080
on the internet. He's setting up his own scared straight scenario. Is that what that means?

174
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:19,040
It seems counterintuitive to me to, if you are in prison and you belong to someone,

175
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,480
if you were meant for them and they were meant for you, um, and you, and you show off your,

176
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:31,040
your, your plumage, you know, if you air it out and you show it off and you say, this is mine,

177
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,080
this is what I'm working with. You jealous. It seems like, I dunno, it seems like a better thing

178
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,480
to do would be to like cover it up as much as you possibly could hoist it up to like your armpit.

179
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,800
Like when you get married in real life, you don't, you don't, you know, walk around

180
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:53,200
hanging brain, I guess. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's like you were, you were in a committed,

181
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,800
you were in a beautiful and committed relationship. Um, if I get married in prison to a,

182
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,960
I believe I'm not attempting to offend you. I believe the nomenclature is bitch. When I get

183
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:12,560
married to a bitch in prison, I, what? Justin. Yes. You would be the bitch. Okay. Okay. I mean,

184
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:20,160
I'm just saying I will, I will commit myself to our man in such a way that I will wear a full tarp

185
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,960
that I have fashioned out of paper towels. I saw when the warden wasn't looking and no,

186
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,440
no other man, other than big Ricky Jay is going to have his cart thrower. You will not,

187
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,160
you will not be allowed to be in a room alone with a man who is not your, uh, your, I guess,

188
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,080
butt King. What are they called? You will not be allowed to be in a room alone with a man who is

189
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,240
not your butt King, except for the hundreds and hundreds of men that you like legally have to

190
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,320
stay in a room alone with all the time because you're in prison. Right. But I'll be very cool

191
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,840
to them. I would be very distant. Oh, just an ice, just an ice thousand yard stare. Just really

192
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:12,560
inaccessible. They'll try to chat me up about, I don't know how about that morning. You think

193
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:21,440
they're only talking about breakout Kings and uh, like Alcatraz last night. I wish we could

194
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,160
disappear and travel in time and then Hurley would be there for some reason.

195
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,360
I don't like living in a universe in which there's a secret code enclosed that I'm unaware of.

196
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,720
Is this what a couple of questions. First off, are our kids still doing this?

197
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,880
Yes. Well, okay. Now I'm getting some, I'm getting some conflicting reports on it. My kids aren't

198
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,120
doing it. Okay. God knows. Now here's, I counter argument. Okay. Yesterday when I saw the three

199
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,280
suges, the, there was a part where Larry, let me finish. There's a part where you,

200
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,280
you had to torpedo our comedy by bringing that poison into it. Let me finish. There was a pretty

201
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,240
good bit where a gentleman walked past Larry and he said, Oh, your pants are hanging down.

202
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,080
Let me help you. And then he pulled them up. So that is at least, I think their kids must still

203
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,400
be doing it. Cause why else would it be in the three suges? Well, as you all know, three suges

204
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,200
has their finger on the pulse of the youth nation. I actually, after watching the film,

205
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:32,160
I can confirm it has the finger on the pulse of euthanasia. I actually really, uh, ready to,

206
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,200
ready to go afterwards. But, um, well, pretty good, pretty good, pretty good flick.

207
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,840
I feel like I don't see, I live in Austin. So I see kids wearing their pants actually tighter and

208
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,400
higher up than, than the average, the national average. Um, they like them tight and high here.

209
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,480
So high and tight hearing says, Hey, I've seen this thing where kids only wear one leg of their

210
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:03,840
pants at a time. Explain please. Well, you kind of alternate the other one hangs down off their

211
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,160
dong like an elephant trunk. No, it's just off to the side. You know, when on commercials, when

212
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,240
people do the, I have big pants cause they lost a bunch of weight. Yeah. Yeah. It's like that,

213
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,360
except the side of the pants extent and the other leg is naked. So do they hop around?

214
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,480
Yeah. Like they put like the left leg of their pants on their right leg or they put the right

215
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,600
leg of their pants on their left leg. So like the other side dangles impotently like a skip it.

216
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,280
Yes. Yes. And then they skip it.

217
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,440
The very best thing of all this bit doesn't make sense at all.

218
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:47,200
Oh Christ. Um, I think, I don't know. I don't think that this is what this means in prison.

219
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,080
I think there's another way of showing off, um, that I am committed, but I can't, who can't,

220
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,880
who can keep track? People were talking about all the secret codes in prison. People,

221
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:04,800
people talk about salad tossing a lot in prison movies. I have, I have in my life understood that

222
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,400
to mean at least four different things. I S I do not know what that actually means. And I'm not

223
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,080
sure any of the prisoners do do either. So what means sagging in one, like what sagging means in

224
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,520
one prison may not mean the same thing. And another one does that, does that make sense?

225
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,440
Um, I think I'm pretty sure that dong slapping is the only universal language of love.

226
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,560
Yeah, that is true. Cause that's that that leaves nothing to the imagination. That is,

227
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,160
that is as cut and dry as possible, except it is actually very wet.

228
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,360
Even the name of it is perfectly descriptive. Yeah. When I say dong slapping, you know exactly

229
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,360
what I'm talking about. It conjures a horrifying mental image that you just can't get out of your

230
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,640
head. Horrifying the sound. It's all the sound. It's actually. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's actually quite

231
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,520
romantic. Did you see that episode of planet earth when the two cheetahs did it? There's never

232
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,280
been a more beautiful expression of power in this world. I don't think. Hey guys, Phil from Cincinnati

233
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,240
here. Wanted to call and congratulate you on your 100th episode. I've written in twice and you've

234
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,920
helped me both times on how to talk to my coworkers and also how to get my friends to wash their hands

235
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,960
after they use the bathroom. So thanks again. Take care. Hey, my man. This is known. My man,

236
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,840
fan who's mom Mariko. And I'd like to congratulate you on your 100th episode. And I'll look forward

237
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:34,720
for a hundred more. Lots of laughs, lots of giggles and lots of wiggles. I suppose I am

238
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,720
planning on asking my lady friend for her hand in marriage. My grandma has made it known to me that

239
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:47,680
she would like my girlfriend to have her, my grandma's engagement ring. If I give my girl,

240
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:53,840
my nanny's ring, she will think it is a sweet sentiment or will I look like an el cheapo for

241
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,760
not shelling out for a brand new ring. Brothers help a brother. That's betwixt in Bethune,

242
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:06,720
South Carolina. Bethune. Is that the right pronunciation? Bethune. Bethune. Bethune.

243
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:14,160
Bethany. Bethany. Okay. Oh shit. You fucked that up so hard. There's no why guys. I don't know

244
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:20,880
what el cheapo means. I don't think that anyone has ever received a like, man, I almost said the

245
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,600
phrase hand me down ring. Not what I meant. Finger me down heirloom heirloom ring and been like,

246
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,800
Oh, to cheat to buy your own, huh? Like, I don't think that that translates. It depends on how

247
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,800
shitty your grandma's ring is straight up. What are you dealing with? How many carat is it like

248
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,080
a ring pop? If it's a ring pot, then, oh, well, I mean, if it's a ring pop with candy on top,

249
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,640
then that's bad. But if it's a ring pop with a ring pop size diamond, that would also probably

250
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,360
be back. She couldn't really do anything with that hand anymore. The good thing about this,

251
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,880
uh, question is that you don't actually have to figure out the answer beforehand. Let me explain.

252
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,920
If you go to her, you hand her the ring, you tell her the story behind the ring,

253
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:09,200
tell her it's sort of a family heirloom type thing. You watch her face. If she is touched

254
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,200
and thrilled just at the prospect of the two of you getting married and the fact that you gave her

255
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,040
such a treasured family heirloom, you got a keeper. Great. If you see for a second, something flick

256
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,920
across her face that you did not buy the ring and she's as pleased by that, you snatch that ring

257
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:29,200
back, you make a run for a plate glass window, you smash through it and you never look back.

258
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,320
Okay. You took a much more extreme second option than I thought you were going to say. No way.

259
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,960
No, you listen to me. You smash through the plate glass window and you never look back

260
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,360
because you did it bad. You thought you were doing good when you dated her. You did a bad job.

261
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,960
You found a bad partner. Could he not just say like, no, I've got this ring until I like can get,

262
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:56,160
you know, a different one. No, no, no, no. You gotta go, plan your escape, check the gauge of

263
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,600
the plate glass. Cause if it's too thick, you're just going to bounce right off and that'll be

264
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
embarrassing. Could you use your grandmother's ring to cut through the plate glass window?

265
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:09,600
This is it. This is it. This is a good idea. Yes. Use the ring, use the ring. And then you're

266
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,800
going to find out if you're giving her some whack cubic zirconia. Like you use the ring to score

267
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:21,280
basically a section of the glass that you will be able to smash through. Yeah. A mark shaped hole.

268
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,480
You just make a mark shaped hole where Mark can take a run at it and just really smash through.

269
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,000
Please, please propose to her on the first floor of a building. Yeah. I was about to say,

270
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,440
make sure you plan it on a low level, maybe second, but low level. But listen to me nephew,

271
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,080
you give her that ring and she's disappointed that you didn't buy it yourself. You got to run.

272
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:47,760
You have to run because you did it bad. Um, and get the ring back because your money is going to

273
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:54,160
be pretty upset. Um, well she'll be upset either way. That's her, that's her fucking ring. Just

274
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:59,600
let your nonny have her ring. God damn it. Not the only thing she has left. Hey nonny,

275
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,640
do you mind if I grave robber you while you're still alive? I may be in love with this girl.

276
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,720
I can't, I can't figure it out until I try to give her your ring. Yeah. Uh, I gave,

277
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:15,280
I gave Sydney our nonny's ring and she loved it. I mean, it was because it,

278
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,680
it, if you have the right, if you're getting involved with the right kind of person,

279
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:26,960
they will understand that things like family and things that have been passed down this way

280
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:38,320
have more value than a billion dollar ring. Uh, I don't know. Well, well, if I pawn,

281
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:48,320
I have a chart. If I pawn my nonny's ring, I can get maybe a half gram of meth. Right. Okay. But

282
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,440
if I, you're right. You got to figure it out. If X is the value of how much you love your nonny

283
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:59,360
and how much she means to you versus how old the ring is and the carrot, you can figure out a dollar

284
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,640
amount. I guess is that, if that's what you're saying. That is it. Well, I was just saying that

285
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,800
anytime you pawn something, I don't think anybody's ever pawned anything and then not spent the money

286
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:14,560
on, on methamphetamines. They actually started to do it using that metric in pawn stars. Yeah. They

287
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:21,120
say, you know, I have this, I have this authentic Roy Rogers shirt that he wore in a shuffle down

288
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,800
to Buffalo. Can I have three grams of meth for this? And they would say, no, I'll give you two,

289
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:33,200
two crystals. How is it okay to propose to your girlfriend with your grandmother's meth? Yeah,

290
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:42,480
sure. And I would like to think that you probably know the answer to this. Yeah. Like I would hope

291
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,120
that, you know, if that will mean something to her. I understand what you're, I don't understand

292
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,720
what you're saying, but the, the sentiment in this case will mean more than the, than the dollar

293
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:03,440
amount. And what's Griffin? You don't agree. I'm just, I had a thought. What if it's a, what if it's

294
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:13,520
a toe ring? He didn't, he didn't specify or like a belly button ring. It could be any number of rings

295
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,840
to get engaged in. Cause it doesn't say anywhere that engagement ring has to be a gold band with

296
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,440
a little diamond on top of it. I don't think. Does it? It probably does say that somewhere. Yeah.

297
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,760
Where would it say that? In the book, the book, the book, the book of sales, the book,

298
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:40,000
open your Bible. So the book of sales, if it's a toe ring, then it's a toe ring. Your grandma is

299
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,120
whack. You have a wack nanny and you need to get a new nanny first and then new wife priorities.

300
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,280
Cause your nanny may not be with you forever. You're going to need two plate glass windows

301
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,960
or one very large, very rich. Okay. So you go to your nanny, you say, I'm ready to propose to

302
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,120
Bethany in Bethune. Uh, I need, I need your rig. If you see her reaching for the shoe,

303
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,040
you run at that plate glass and you smash it out. Cause you're done with that money.

304
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:13,120
You need a new one. New nanny. You find nanny too. She says, I keep my rings on my finger like an

305
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:20,080
adult. Then you go to your grave robber and then you go to your girlfriend. Yeah. And you say,

306
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:26,480
I got this ring from neo nanny and I need, and I want you to be mine. And then she says,

307
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:34,640
did you buy that? Was it on a toe? You say, uh, no to both. Find that other plate glass,

308
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,360
smash it, run back to nanny, realize that you went back to first nanny, say, oh,

309
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,960
fuck smash through another one. And by this point you are probably cut to ribbons. I'm pretty tired.

310
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,600
You're probably very tired. Cause this all happened in like two minutes. And then

311
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,760
go to Jared's. Then you go to Jared's and you get it right. You just go to Jared, do it right.

312
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,640
Travis. And then find a new girlfriend. At Jared's. She works the cashier. She knows her stuff.

313
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,920
She's a good, she's a good lady. Propose to her. Travis. Uh-huh. Hey brothers. Help anybody else?

314
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:12,000
Nope. But, um, hey brothers. I was the one who wrote a while back asking if the height difference

315
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,480
between this girl that I like was a deal breaker. She is several inches taller than me. I'm happy

316
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,560
to report that I took your advice and asked her out. We have been happily dating for almost four

317
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,760
months. She usually wears flats. So we're about the same height. Anyway, thanks for the help guys.

318
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,320
You're awesome. And that's from compact in Kentucky. Oh, that's good to hear. That's good to

319
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,960
hear. But I feel like pretty much anybody would have told you that thing. We told you. Yeah.

320
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,080
That was not a tough one. Did you talk to anyone else before us? Were we your first step?

321
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:48,480
Oh Christ, I hope not. That's like the one thing you can't do. What kind of horrible brand of dude

322
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,880
would you have to talk to that'd be like, oh, she's taller than you? No way. No way. Get out of time.

323
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:02,000
Let's just sit around and make dude farts. Pass the Madden Troller. Did you ask Charlie Sheen

324
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:09,600
about this before you came to us? He's a very diminutive man, right? I think Charlie Sheen?

325
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,120
He's diminutive and horrible. Like some sort of troll. Like some sort of swamp monster. Hey guys,

326
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:22,160
check this out. Check this out. Winning. Oh boy. Remember, it was in Three Stooges,

327
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,080
there was a... Is there a scene in Three Stooges where they quote Charlie Sheen?

328
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:32,800
Is that what you're saying? No, but there is a scene where... Justin, I don't want to hear it.

329
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:39,200
It's a scene. No, you do have to hear it. Have to? Have to hear it? For 20 minutes,

330
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,040
maybe 25, it felt like seven hours. That's a pretty good length for a scene. Yeah.

331
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,320
Well, it's comprised of three shorts, three half hour long shorts. The movie is? Yeah.

332
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:57,840
Are you? And in the movie for about half hour, Moe is part of the cast of Jersey Shore.

333
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:08,480
Dynamo, as they refer to him. Dynamo. Dynamo. Dynamo. Dynamo. He's a part of the Jersey Shore.

334
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,160
If you do this, I'm going to start talking about how I watched Joe Dirt yesterday.

335
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,680
I don't want to do this. I'm just telling you guys I saw it. It's pretty good.

336
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,080
I'm just saying that we will do mutually assured joke destruction if you keep talking about Three

337
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,560
Stages, I will bring up Joe Dirt. Let's talk about anything else then. Okay. Anything else?

338
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:30,640
Guys, I watched Hudson Hawk yesterday and let me- No! No! You son of a bitch. How about a Yahoo

339
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:39,680
answer? Please. This Yahoo answer was sent in by Galiayali. Thank you, Gali. It's by Yahoo

340
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:46,320
answers user Lola, who asks, will standing up and eating help me get a fatter butt,

341
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:56,800
not a bigger, rounder, skinnier butt, a fat, juicy butt? I don't want to exorcise her because

342
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:02,720
that made my thighs and my butt skinny. I want a fat, delicious, juicy butt and also thighs.

343
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,320
Please stop saying that.

344
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,080
I want a fat, delicious, juicy butt and also thighs. Will standing up and eating help me do that?

345
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,120
Can you read, Griffin? Can I make a special request-

346
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,280
I want a fat, delicious, juicy butt.

347
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,200
Thank you. That was what I was going to request, actually. So if you want a fat,

348
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,320
delicious, juicy butt, there are three things you must do.

349
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:35,760
Okay. First, avoid those workout tapes by Fonda. That's number, that's super key.

350
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,040
Yeah. They'll give you a light bulb figure and you do not want that. You want an upside down light

351
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,640
bulb. Yeah. And you don't want that. And neither does my anaconda. Travis' anaconda is very

352
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:52,080
particular about fat. Just the juiciest butt for me.

353
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,160
Now you did not comment on the flavor of the butt. And I feel like that's an important modifier.

354
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,240
Like a sweet, juicy butt?

355
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:06,000
Oh, Christ. This is a very hoppy butt. This is a very bitter.

356
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,360
What year is this butt? What year is this butt? This is a fine butt vintage.

357
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,640
Let me tell you, I just started seeing someone. She is just marbled down there. It's wonderful.

358
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:23,200
This is a juicy butt with some hints of, what is that? Grape, tobacco.

359
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,800
You can't smell it though. I didn't mean so. I was sniffling.

360
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,280
You can't smell the butt. You find the butt and it tastes juicy.

361
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,240
You swish it around in your mouth and then you spit it out.

362
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,960
It's so important that you don't swallow the butt.

363
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,760
I, guys, no. I'm butt drunk. Help. You don't get butt drunk.

364
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,200
My favorite scene in Sideways with Leslie.

365
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,240
I could choose your own adventure on that. I'll leave that. You can email the way that bit

366
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,640
concludes to us. I'll give you a mailing address in a second.

367
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,960
Can you move food around your body like some sort of food wizard like this? I didn't know.

368
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,800
You mean by standing up, gravity takes care of it?

369
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,280
If you do a headstand while eating burritos, then you get really, really toned calves.

370
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,360
If you lie on your back and you drink a milkshake, you get a fat back.

371
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:26,240
That's the last thing you want. That's why it's so important not to eat lying down.

372
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,800
That's why hospital beds sit you up so it angles the food to your butt.

373
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,760
Exactly. You actually have to do that thing that they always do in the comedic hospital

374
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,360
scenes where the bed goes haywire and bends them up into a V. You gotta do that so it all settles.

375
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,520
All the blood in your body is just in your fat, delicious, juicy butt.

376
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,000
Well, I just worry that if you did it standing up, you're going to end up with fat, juicy,

377
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,080
delicious feet. That's the worst.

378
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,360
Unless you're some element on Craigslist.

379
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,520
Unless you're a member of a certain community.

380
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,400
Let's call them the feet guys.

381
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,960
My brother and my brother made Fangirl. Ah, feet guys. That's right.

382
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:16,160
Guys, I don't think much about my own butt.

383
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:28,480
When I think about me, and I think about if my butt could be considered by myself or any

384
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:35,040
outside party as being juicy, that's not a good... Any sort of dampness...

385
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,880
I would like a light, airy butt.

386
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,800
I would like a powdery butt. That's sort of my...

387
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,640
A delicious, cakey butt.

388
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:54,560
Something even cakey has intonations of moistness, which I cannot get behind.

389
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,560
So like an overcooked, well done butt.

390
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,760
Yeah, charred. Not like a bursting with fruit flavor. I want it...

391
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,520
With a delicious, juicy center.

392
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,200
Smoke to perfection is what you want your butt to be.

393
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,040
You want a teriyaki jerked butt.

394
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:22,080
Kim, I feel like this is actually an interesting place where the sexes divert in many cases,

395
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,480
but not all. I feel like most women, if asked to describe their butt,

396
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,200
could give you a few paragraphs on that, sort of their feelings on it.

397
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,880
I, most of the time, could not be less aware of the fact that I have a butt.

398
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,800
You know the only time I'm aware of my butt? Long car trips.

399
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,360
Yeah, when it starts complaining.

400
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,280
When I'm driving and my butt falls asleep.

401
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:43,760
Yeah.

402
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,960
If it's humid outside, things get a little juicy. I'm with you.

403
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,640
No, it's because I have zero fat juiciness on my butt,

404
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,560
and my butt bones dig directly into the car seats and tear them up.

405
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:54,880
Yeah.

406
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,560
So, so that's what Travis's butt is like.

407
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,280
What was your nickname when you were taught, Trev?

408
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,080
Bony butt boy.

409
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,120
It's not a very good nickname.

410
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,840
If you must know.

411
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,480
It's legit.

412
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,720
Oh man, that's a good show.

413
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,560
That Travis McElroy, he's got a sharp ass.

414
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,720
That's the sharp ass.

415
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,160
The most acute butt.

416
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,520
He sat...

417
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,800
Not acute butt, mind you.

418
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,640
Nope, nope, it's acute.

419
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,800
He sat on Santa's lap at the Huntington Mall exactly once,

420
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,760
and they would not let him back because that Santa lost his leg.

421
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,720
No, that happened.

422
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,200
It happened.

423
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,280
Hey guys, I have a coworker.

424
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,640
She leaves her stuff strewn about our offices.

425
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,880
She only picks up after herself after being asked to do so several times,

426
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,200
or she waits for someone else to do it for her.

427
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,480
She also takes my supplies and doesn't return or replenish them.

428
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,160
I don't want to make enemies in the office,

429
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,360
especially since I work on a relatively small staff.

430
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,480
How do I nicely ask her to be more considerate?

431
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,080
That's from Irritated in Illinois.

432
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,480
I think you post a note, a passive aggressive note.

433
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:06,980
Yeah.

434
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,560
Does that work?

435
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,040
Can you-

436
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,080
Hey Debra.

437
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,580
Yeah.

438
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,600
I noticed things have been getting a little out of hand lately,

439
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,680
which reminds me I'm missing a stapler.

440
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,040
Put it in my hand, please.

441
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,040
Please.

442
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,120
I'm pretty sure that's more active aggressive than you.

443
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:24,960
Hey babe.

444
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,460
Passage-

445
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,800
Hey, how's Debra?

446
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,680
Hey slut.

447
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,780
No.

448
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:30,880
No.

449
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,200
You can't just say something in that sing song voice.

450
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,360
Hey, where's my three hole punch?

451
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,280
Hey, gonna burn your house down.

452
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,720
Hey.

453
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,920
Hey, how's it going?

454
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,320
Gonna kill your dad.

455
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,320
Bring back with the hole punch,

456
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,960
or I'll put centipedes in your vagina.

457
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,720
Oh, why?

458
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,760
How would that self operation go down?

459
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,960
Without you noticing.

460
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,120
Without you noticing, I'm a wizard.

461
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,520
Christ.

462
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,560
Did you consider becoming a wizard or a witch?

463
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,400
You can hide in the eaves of her home,

464
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,320
flushing her toilet, watching her internet.

465
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,720
A passive aggressive note would be like,

466
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,040
boy, it sure would be nice if people would stop stealing office supplies.

467
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,800
Oh, I gave myself a chill when I said that.

468
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,480
We are not good at this.

469
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,080
We are not good at aggressive, passive aggressive.

470
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,280
Here's the one thing that we macarons can do.

471
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,480
We stew and we stew and we stew.

472
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,880
Then we get aggressive once, regular aggressive,

473
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,400
and then we get embarrassed and we quit.

474
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,040
That's our plan of attack.

475
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,960
So I guess start working on your resume.

476
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,240
I guess, yeah.

477
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,640
Start reaching out to some of your LinkedIn contacts.

478
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,480
Go get a stack of papers together and go to reach for the point

479
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,960
where your stapler used to be and like,

480
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,960
just stop with your hand in the air

481
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,800
and lower your hand and just sigh deeply

482
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,680
and do that like 50 times a day.

483
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,280
Just every once in a while just announce,

484
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,600
I miss my stapler.

485
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:55,840
Yeah.

486
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,800
That stapler was given to me by my nanny.

487
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,680
Maybe you could start stealing things from her.

488
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,000
And then you just have a drawer of all her stuff.

489
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,800
Steal her man.

490
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:08,960
Her identity.

491
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,520
No, that is one way you can have all your stuff back.

492
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,560
If you steal your identity,

493
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,960
you'll be both her and you simultaneously.

494
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,320
So you could just go and lift stuff off the desk.

495
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,600
It'll be like that, what was that movie with Matt Dame?

496
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,760
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.

497
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,560
Good Will Hunting.

498
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,060
No.

499
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,020
No.

500
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,140
It was-

501
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:27,680
The Town of Mr. Ripley.

502
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,180
Being John Malkovich.

503
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,540
Yeah.

504
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,040
Something, something, man's name.

505
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,140
Right.

506
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,520
I don't know how to lose a man in 10 days.

507
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,040
I don't lose a man in 10 days.

508
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,360
I don't lose a man in 10 days.

509
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,240
Is that it?

510
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,320
How to become a man in 10 days is what it was.

511
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,280
How to become another man.

512
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:46,740
Is this a-

513
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,040
It's a fucking stapler.

514
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,600
To me, I have a monetary value of how much I have to be

515
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,840
inconvenienced before I'll start worrying about something

516
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,840
and like put myself through that mental distress.

517
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,040
And it's high, guys.

518
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,280
It's like, it's like 150 bucks.

519
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,960
Can I tell you guys something?

520
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,640
But you're also, you're now amongst the super rich though.

521
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,840
I'm incredibly, incredibly wealthy, but even before the

522
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,440
Max Fund Drive filled my coffers to a preposterous degree,

523
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,200
if someone would like clip my side view mirror and take off,

524
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,360
I would be like, I would get their license plate number and

525
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,720
I would promptly throw it away.

526
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,720
Cause I can, I can fix that.

527
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,520
That's not a big deal.

528
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,040
They were probably in a hurry anyway.

529
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,040
And let me tell you guys, I, I am the other side of this

530
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:29,440
question.

531
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,680
I'm the person with the messy desk that steals everyone's

532
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,440
stapler and tape dispenser and white out.

533
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,080
Oh, and I thrive on knowing that people aren't going to

534
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:38,560
bring it up.

535
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,440
Travis can't, Travis can't finish unless he knows he's

536
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,680
suppressing somebody or some menial issue.

537
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,560
Travis, you can loan Travis things like video games and he

538
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,680
will insist several weeks later that he purchased that video

539
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,400
game.

540
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,280
And I'm talking about like things, things become mine.

541
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:55,600
Yeah.

542
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,600
A full library of games that I fully accept.

543
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,840
I send his way and they will never return.

544
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,880
He doesn't, he doesn't borrow things as much as he can

545
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,920
scripts them.

546
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,520
And the funny thing is I'm super, super anal about getting

547
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,480
stuff back from people.

548
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,040
Well, yes, but that's just because you're terrible.

549
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,080
Yeah.

550
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,080
They have a word for that.

551
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,120
It's a hippo shit.

552
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,640
You know, sorry.

553
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,640
Neither a borrower nor a lender be.

554
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,440
Travis takes that and he kind of makes it his own.

555
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,120
He kind of puts his own spin on it.

556
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,200
Like it's okay.

557
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,360
It's cool to be a borrower, but fuck lending.

558
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,400
I'm out Travis McElroy.

559
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:32,720
Peace.

560
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,600
No, Travis is a good dude.

561
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,400
We like, we like.

562
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:36,640
Yeah.

563
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,440
Travis is great.

564
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,800
That chance you got so much.

565
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,760
I'm trying to get better at it.

566
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,000
Yeah.

567
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,440
I'm trying to get better.

568
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,400
Not actively sure, but you know, like mentally I'm trying

569
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,160
to become more okay with the fact that I do.

570
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:46,400
Yeah.

571
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,440
That is, that is our advice for everything.

572
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,640
Don't fix your problems, but do accept them.

573
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,160
So they're not problems anymore.

574
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,120
They're quirks.

575
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,400
If you could just like send me pictures of my seasons one

576
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,640
through three of Smallville every once in a while, just

577
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,800
so I can like catch up on how they're doing.

578
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,400
Just like a quick status update.

579
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,520
I just want to know.

580
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,960
I'm practicing to be like a totalitarian dictator, like

581
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,560
just slowly taking over annexing the areas around me.

582
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,560
But I started with DVDs and videos.

583
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:16,880
Sure.

584
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,960
I organized my West Wing seasons yesterday and it was an easy

585
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,200
job because it was one and six.

586
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,600
You see something like that, you think, oops, must be Travis.

587
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,880
Hey, my bim bam.

588
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,440
Happy 100 years of podcasting.

589
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,400
Hello, this is Ira Glass from the popular podcast, This

590
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,120
American Life.

591
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,800
And I'm here with Dan Savage from the popular podcast, Dan

592
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,280
Savage.

593
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,320
You can't come to the phone.

594
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,720
I just want to say you kids are doing a bang up job and to

595
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,920
keep up the good work, you know, 100, you know, that's really

596
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,400
impressive.

597
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,640
And I think you guys are going to are going to make it in this

598
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,200
business.

599
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,760
We got another check in email and it says, you answered my

600
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,160
question on how to get my boyfriend to move from Chicago

601
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:06,960
to Indianapolis.

602
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,120
I'm happy to say that after listening to the episode, he

603
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,120
mulled it over and he'll be moving here in about a month

604
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:11,680
from now.

605
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,160
I really think the part where Griffin threatened to kill him

606
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,520
made all the difference.

607
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,240
And that's from soon not to be isolated in Indianapolis.

608
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,040
I don't remember.

609
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,160
Is this the one where we talked about the pies and the

610
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,640
cheesecake and then Griffin said he's going to kill someone?

611
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,120
Yes.

612
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,200
That doesn't sound like something I do, though.

613
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,720
This is the baker.

614
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,760
I definitely, I definitely, definitely killed someone in

615
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,320
Chicago.

616
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:39,680
So hence why you live in Austin under a different name.

617
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,600
So what's your new name, Griffin?

618
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,400
I meant to ask you.

619
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,640
I've been wanting to send you a birthday card.

620
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,120
It's Tyson with the letter T.

621
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,520
Card it's Tyson with two S's.

622
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,800
But no last name.

623
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,200
I did some research.

624
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,840
It's the most off the grid name that I could possibly write.

625
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,320
I miss Griffin.

626
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,680
Tyson's here to play.

627
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,480
Where's the women?

628
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,160
Bring them out, please, for Tyson.

629
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:18,160
Tyson, just so I have this clear, is it T Y S S T I E.

630
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:24,160
It's spelled like if you're like if it's spelled like ties,

631
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,160
son, like you're telling your son about.

632
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,960
Is it hyphen?

633
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,000
It sounds hyphenated.

634
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,400
No, it's just you put a little emphasis.

635
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,640
There's like an umlaut on the second S. Tyson loves to party.

636
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,520
He loves the women.

637
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,480
That's all there is to it.

638
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,200
That's him in a nutshell.

639
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,160
You can't you can't change the direction of the wind and you can't stop Tyson from partying.

640
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,600
That's the one thing about him that I do like.

641
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,000
I don't like not I don't I don't like nothing about Tyson.

642
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,400
The thing about Tyson, though, is that his tastes run a little expensive.

643
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:09,520
Mm hmm. And as a result, we have to every once in a while take him to the money zone.

644
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,280
You said that like we're taking him to show business.

645
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,680
We are the one place you can't take Tyson.

646
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,800
Get in the car.

647
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,920
Tyson in the car.

648
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,440
Put on this paper crown, Tyson.

649
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,200
We're taking you to showbiz pizza.

650
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:35,840
But hey, I'm really excited about this week because we are talking about cast of thrones.

651
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,000
It's it's on iTunes.

652
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,880
Search it right now.

653
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,160
Cast of thrones.

654
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,720
It is the top ranked unofficial Game of Thrones podcast on iTunes.

655
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,760
It is spoiler free.

656
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,680
It is very, very funny.

657
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,160
It will help you make sense of Game of Thrones, which can get kind of confusing.

658
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,240
They they talk to cast members, which is which is very cool.

659
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,680
They've had some some high, high profile guests on there from the program, which I think is awesome.

660
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,040
And as somebody who recently kind of got back into Game of Thrones after stop watching the

661
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,680
series for a while and trying to hop back on, I found cast of thrones pretty invaluable.

662
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,600
Now, what if I've never read or seen Game of Thrones and this might be the first time

663
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,720
I've ever heard of it?

664
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,080
Travis is this a podcast?

665
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,440
Travis doesn't know a Lannister from a start from a Harry Potter.

666
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:23,680
Right.

667
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,240
That's true.

668
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,520
But I would suggest that you download it right now,

669
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,040
because it makes our marketing look more effective.

670
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,800
And then you listen to it later when you watch the show.

671
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,400
Also, why are you not watching the show?

672
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,280
Read these books.

673
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,960
It's made for you, Travis.

674
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,080
It's made for you.

675
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:40,960
What do you love, Travis?

676
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,520
Do you love it?

677
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,480
Do you love incest?

678
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,240
Do you love dragons?

679
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,040
I should not have started with incest.

680
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,520
You like swordsmanship.

681
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,240
Do you like it when brothers and sisters bang down?

682
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,200
Don't ask about that on the air.

683
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:57,760
We can talk about that after the show.

684
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,520
What about when secret kings play dong slaps with each other?

685
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,080
This is fucking classic Tyson.

686
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,880
He has to make everybody so uncomfortable.

687
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,320
There are also things that are in the show,

688
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,160
so if you're not ready for the reality of secret kings-

689
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,160
Can they talk about incest on cast of thrones?

690
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,400
What else would they talk about?

691
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,680
They can't talk around the incest.

692
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,320
It's either that or they talk about the lighting on the show.

693
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,680
Those are the two things.

694
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,360
Sean Bean turned in a particularly thrilling performance,

695
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,480
and also two kings just totally went to town on each other.

696
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,240
Cast of thrones is on iTunes.

697
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,120
You can search for it.

698
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:33,840
You can go get it.

699
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,720
And Griffin wrote this song about it.

700
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,680
I'm going to try and do the actual theme song to the show.

701
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,000
Really?

702
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,680
Thrones cast, game of thrones cast.

703
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,600
It's got incest.

704
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,800
King sex, secret king sex.

705
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,480
Dinklage town.

706
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,320
Prostitutes, it's got prostitutes.

707
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,760
40 prostitutes or so.

708
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:11,680
There's fisting, there's sometimes fisting, cast of thrones.

709
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,840
That was mostly just things that are on the show game of thrones.

710
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,200
Peter Dinklage lives in Dinklage Town in the show.

711
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,600
I'm sorry, did you say fisting?

712
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,720
Did you say fisting?

713
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,040
There's a very long and uncomfortable fisting scene.

714
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,480
I don't want to give you-

715
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,520
With Peter Dinklage?

716
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:31,600
Yeah.

717
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,480
Yeah, it's terrible.

718
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,320
It looks like a deleted scene from the Muppets movie, Nightmare.

719
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,520
Oh no!

720
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,120
Cast of thrones on iTunes.

721
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,160
I just graduated from college in the middle of the school year.

722
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,600
I have a job lined up, but it does not start until July.

723
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,800
Any tips on how I can spend this incredible amount of free time?

724
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,600
I already read, write, and play video games, but I'm looking for some new jams.

725
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,600
Justin's been talking about geocaching.

726
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,800
What's the good word on that?

727
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,880
Anyway, thanks for the help.

728
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,200
That's from Bored Nightly in NYC.

729
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,240
I feel like I can't stop talking about geocaching, but-

730
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,600
Geocaching is the shit.

731
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,080
Tell me-

732
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,120
I got you guys on-

733
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,480
Griffin's not on the tip yet.

734
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,680
I'm sure there's lots of people doing it in Austin.

735
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,880
Like if it's a weird thing that you can spend time on and not get paid for, like Austin's got it.

736
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,380
Yeah.

737
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:31,200
Within like 20 miles of me in Cincinnati, there's like 300 geocaches.

738
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,240
So I bet there's like just millions in Austin.

739
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,160
Did you find some choice caches, by the way, Travis?

740
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,040
Did you find some good stuff?

741
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,200
I found so many choice caches.

742
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,680
I've explored so many parks and had more outdoor time in the last week than I've had in the last

743
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,320
three years.

744
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,320
I know, because you go to all these places that you would never expect to go to, or things that

745
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:52,640
are in your neck of the woods, but you would have no reason to climb or explore.

746
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,600
Geocaching's great.

747
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,640
I would expect it-

748
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,760
There's two different things.

749
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,040
There's one where it's like, I'm going to go explore this park and go for a hike.

750
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,960
There's two where it's like, oh, this is a parking lot I parked in a thousand times,

751
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,680
and there was something hidden under my nose that I didn't know about.

752
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,680
Those are super cool.

753
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,400
I love those.

754
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,600
There was something hidden in a guardrail, and you've driven past it 10 times, and there's

755
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,720
been something there for 10 years.

756
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,400
But you can totally do that in New York, I'm sure.

757
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,120
There's some nice geocaching there.

758
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,920
I made a poop the other day, and a geocache fell out.

759
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,320
I was wondering-

760
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,120
They're everywhere!

761
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,320
I was wondering where you would be- when you would discover that one that I hid.

762
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,360
But I'm glad-

763
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,720
Did you sign the log and put it back?

764
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:45,280
So yeah, geocaching is something you can do to sort of do some free time.

765
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,040
You read, write, and play video games.

766
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:54,080
That's pretty much my whole day, so I can't take you too much deeper than that.

767
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:58,400
Maybe try to watch all the movies on AFI's best films list.

768
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:58,960
You could do that.

769
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:06,480
I suggest going to your favorite grocery store and buying some sort of food item and go home,

770
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:13,520
get on allrecipes.com, search that food item, look up a recipe, I guess go back to the store,

771
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,960
buy the other things that you need to make the recipe, and then before you know it, you're

772
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,840
learning how to cook.

773
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,560
That's how I did it.

774
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,600
And then blog all about that.

775
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,520
Blog about it, because God, I want to hear about it.

776
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,480
Oh, you made crepes!

777
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:22,800
Great!

778
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:23,840
Great.

779
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,480
Great Crepes.

780
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,280
That's your website's name, greatcrepes.org.

781
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,520
Greatcrepes.tumblr.com.

782
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:29,840
Love it.

783
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,360
In our culture, I think when you have a lot of free time, you're supposed to

784
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,680
spend a year doing something that you wouldn't normally do, and then write a book about it.

785
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,680
That seems to be the-

786
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,880
Eat prey crepes.

787
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,760
Eat prey crepes.

788
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,960
Buy a sushi kit and start making your own sushi.

789
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,040
You're wasting everyone's time not doing that.

790
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,440
Yeah, learn to cook something you don't know.

791
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,040
Yesterday, I made steak au poivre for the first time.

792
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:55,600
It's delicious.

793
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,680
It's steak in a brandy cream sauce.

794
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,640
Yeah, sure.

795
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,680
That sounds delicious.

796
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,920
It's really good and easy, but I wouldn't have known how to do it if I hadn't just gone

797
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,920
out there and just done it.

798
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,680
And you could also set a goal like, over the next five months, I'm just going to master

799
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,160
breakfast.

800
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:10,400
Yeah.

801
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,680
Over the next five months, I'm just going to masturbate.

802
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,120
Every day, all day.

803
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,480
You could also get obnoxiously into politics.

804
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,280
Oh, don't do that.

805
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:19,840
Oh, yeah.

806
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,400
Don't do that.

807
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,760
Just super get over your head in politics.

808
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,760
What do we always tell people who listen to this show?

809
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,240
Don't bother getting involved in politics because it's not going to change anything.

810
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:29,360
Yeah.

811
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,640
That's the number one thing.

812
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,720
There's no benefit from being political.

813
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,640
No one person has ever changed anything.

814
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,360
Only 100,000 people working in unison, and nobody can do that anymore, so don't even

815
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,360
bother.

816
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,840
The only time it's happened in the past decade is Coney 2012, and the stress of it was so

817
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,560
much that it made all the guys' clothes disappear.

818
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,160
It made them run around checking off.

819
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,600
That's how powerful that is.

820
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,960
You don't want that hate.

821
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,000
Just live your life.

822
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,840
Try to stay under the radar.

823
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,040
That's my whole thing now.

824
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,000
I'm 31 years old.

825
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,520
Let's just get through this one, and by this one, I mean your entire life.

826
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,680
That's the best advice that we can give you.

827
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,960
Try not to leave a paper trail.

828
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,440
Yeah.

829
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,480
Just keep it discreet.

830
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,480
Just make it to the end of your life without dying, and you'll have succeeded.

831
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:10,800
Yeah.

832
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:10,960
Yeah.

833
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,800
Get to the end of your life and just let it be like a puff of air that no one notices

834
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,360
when you die.

835
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,880
Just like, what'd that guy do?

836
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,520
We're on nothing.

837
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,320
At least you don't want to annoy everybody.

838
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:20,960
Yeah.

839
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,200
Yeah.

840
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,960
Don't get in anybody's way.

841
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,440
You gotta take up a craft.

842
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,760
I think that's the best thing that you can do with your time when you're free time.

843
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,200
If you don't want to feel like you've wasted your time, the only thing you can do is improve

844
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:35,520
something.

845
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,880
It's like the Sims.

846
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,720
You play a guitar long enough, and then you can paint a beautiful painting, because it's

847
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,680
both creativity.

848
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,040
Right.

849
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,520
That's video game logic for you.

850
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:50,400
You know, our personal friend Brian Barth, when he found he had some free time on his

851
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,760
hands, you know what he took up?

852
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,040
Metallurgy.

853
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,400
Learned how to forge shit.

854
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,920
You laugh the first time, because who knows what they're doing with that.

855
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,160
But now that he can do it full time, he can forge his own weapons.

856
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:04,880
That's amazing.

857
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,680
That's a great way to spend your free time.

858
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,880
Yeah, it's super practical.

859
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,400
On a different note, cross-stitching.

860
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,360
You could cross-stitch.

861
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,120
It's kind of like metallurgy.

862
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,320
Did you say cross-tallurgy?

863
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,240
Cross-tallurgy.

864
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,200
Make metal crosses.

865
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,800
Throw them at vampires.

866
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,720
Don't cross-stitch.

867
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,160
You could become a vampire, honey.

868
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:25,600
Wait, hold on.

869
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,400
Vampire honey.

870
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:26,800
Did you?

871
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,400
Aw, girl.

872
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,120
Damn, those fangs are looking nice, girl.

873
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:31,360
Come here.

874
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:31,840
Let me see that.

875
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,200
You have some juicy fangs.

876
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,120
God, those fangs are juicy.

877
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:44,640
No, you got to take up a trade that's going to be impressive to people, like magic.

878
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,760
Like card tricks.

879
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,440
Not the gathering.

880
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,080
Magic cards?

881
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,200
Magic cards, the gathering.

882
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,320
Fucking do that, man.

883
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,880
I had a bunch of free time, so I got good at magic.

884
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,720
We got back from PAX last weekend.

885
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:04,240
Those guys playing magic cards were getting more trim than Matthew McConaughey in 1996.

886
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,440
1996 McConaughey.

887
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,720
Like the peak of his parabola.

888
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,280
Exactly.

889
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,480
Hi, guys.

890
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,840
It's just me, your dad.

891
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:17,040
And well, I just wanted to share this special memory on this special podcast.

892
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:22,800
I remember bouncing you kids on my knee, and now my knees are shot.

893
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,640
So thanks a whole hell of a lot.

894
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,720
Hello, brothers.

895
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:32,000
This is Kathy from St. Louis, Missouri, calling to congratulate you on your 100th episode.

896
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,840
Because of your weeding questions into wisdom, I now know how I feel about man-sized jars,

897
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:42,560
how to place an order for stacum and tubes, how to take a big bite of the recovery sandwich,

898
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,240
when to pack up and move away, and just how gross tropical killers are.

899
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,800
I can't wait to hear the new and delightful nuggets of wisdom

900
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,600
that you will provide in your next 100 episodes.

901
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,360
Congrats.

902
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,520
Uh, Trav, any other check-ins?

903
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,640
Did we help anyone else?

904
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,400
We got one that made me super happy.

905
00:58:59,040 --> 00:58:59,680
Hey, guys.

906
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:04,240
Back on episode 67, I asked if there was any way to keep my mustache without people thinking

907
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,200
I'm a creepster.

908
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,840
I took your advice and went full Sam Elliott.

909
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:11,520
Within a few weeks, I was elected to my college's homecoming court.

910
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,160
Thanks, brothers.

911
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:12,720
Fuck, yeah.

912
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,440
Don't thank us.

913
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,640
Thank irony.

914
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,840
Thanks, irony.

915
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,560
You're the best.

916
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,040
And he attached a picture, too.

917
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,800
It is a lovely mustache.

918
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,760
How is it?

919
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,640
What's the bushiness rating?

920
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,120
I would say impenetrable.

921
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,720
Trav, can you remember to put it in the forums?

922
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,760
People can enjoy that.

923
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,040
I will.

924
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,160
I will attach that picture.

925
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,600
I will make this guy famous.

926
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,400
Okay, good.

927
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,200
He deserves it with that mustache.

928
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,560
Did he have any crumbs in there?

929
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,840
Did he have like a-

930
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:36,560
No, it was well grouped.

931
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,080
Did he have like a full Cheez-It?

932
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,880
He actually had a bird that traveled with him to help keep his mustache clean.

933
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,640
That's the best thing I've ever heard.

934
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,080
I want that now.

935
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,360
Like one of those rhino birds.

936
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,680
Sure.

937
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,880
Guys, we knew what you were saying.

938
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,680
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

939
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:54,400
Thank you, Lisa.

940
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,680
It's by Yahoo Answers user China Doll who asks,

941
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,920
I need a hip hop group name.

942
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,560
Help me out.

943
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:07,360
I need a group name, but it needs to end with girls with a Z.

944
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,840
It's the three of us.

945
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,520
We need something cute that the teens and young girls can catch on to.

946
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,800
Nothing stupid, please.

947
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:16,800
Oh my God.

948
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,840
Fat cheesy butt girls.

949
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,480
Oh, that's-

950
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,720
The phrasing of the part where she says,

951
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,960
we need something the girls can catch on to makes me feel like

952
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:31,360
this is a few teachers that are going to lip sync a terrible song at the school talent show.

953
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,280
Or they're going to do a terrible song,

954
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,320
but like change the words to help promote teen abstinence.

955
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,080
That's what this feels like.

956
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:42,400
They're going to wear those sunglasses with the neon sides.

957
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,000
You know, that classic style.

958
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,280
Maybe some jams.

959
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:52,080
Guys, I've been sitting here trying to think of a parody of a modern song

960
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,360
in which to work abstinence themes into.

961
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,120
And the problem I'm having is that I can't think of a modern song.

962
01:00:59,120 --> 01:00:59,680
Oops.

963
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,720
I think the only song that popped in my head is Marry the Night.

964
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,880
And I think they're selling about like waiting until marriage.

965
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,480
And I don't know what it is.

966
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,840
I can't remember if it was super bass.

967
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,960
I think that's the only song that's been released in the past five years that I've heard.

968
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:12,800
It's a good one too.

969
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,320
That boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

970
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,120
Don't have sex.

971
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,360
I don't have sex and I know it.

972
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,240
That's one, right?

973
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:22,560
Yeah.

974
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,440
I don't have sex.

975
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:31,520
But maybe sort of look at the stars.

976
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,840
I am not having sex.

977
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,240
Sure.

978
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,320
If you're listening to Coldplay, it's assumed that you're not having sex.

979
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:36,720
Yellow.

980
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,640
The Coldplay girls would be a good name.

981
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,040
Sure.

982
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,320
That would be a good name.

983
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,080
Because you've already got like the name recognition.

984
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:44,320
Sure.

985
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:45,280
That's-

986
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,160
And copyright and-

987
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:46,640
No, no, no.

988
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,560
That's how- No, that's how naming the fans works.

989
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,000
Foo Fighters were originally called Beatles 2.

990
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,640
They're called Beatles Foo.

991
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,920
They're like, this is too long.

992
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:58,400
This sucks.

993
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,240
Everything about this is bad.

994
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:03,840
This bit sucks.

995
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,120
Okay.

996
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,400
What about Chunky Girls?

997
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,040
Now hear me out.

998
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,600
Because they know how to move.

999
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:15,280
Here's what I'm going to do for the rest of this bit as we come up with names.

1000
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:15,600
Okay.

1001
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:19,120
I'm going to double check and see if they're actual names.

1002
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,080
Yeah, get on MySpace.

1003
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,840
First up, Chunky Girls.

1004
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:22,880
With a Z.

1005
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,040
Oh, with a Z.

1006
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:25,920
It has to do with a Z.

1007
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,640
Yeah, it's imperative.

1008
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,160
First up, Chunky Girls with a Z.

1009
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,760
Okay, there is a chunkygirls.com.

1010
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,880
Oh, don't click that.

1011
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,560
Do not click that hyperlink.

1012
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,440
Don't click it.

1013
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,040
It's too late.

1014
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:43,440
And chunkygirls.com is also on MySpace, but it does not appear to be a band.

1015
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,080
So Chunky Girls available.

1016
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,600
So you could be Chunky Girls the band.

1017
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,840
Yes, they could be Chunky Girls the band.

1018
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,800
Can I read off the best answer as chosen by Asker?

1019
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,760
Yes.

1020
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,200
It's by Yahoo!

1021
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,920
Insta user guda who says, it's kind of long.

1022
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,720
I've played in bands, sang in bands, and written music for years.

1023
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:07,040
Currently, I manage a group of local bands and singers, including Chainsaw Heart,

1024
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:13,840
all girl metal, Silver Age Heroes, alt rock, Georgia Boy, with an I, rapper,

1025
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:20,720
Terrified, all girl alternative, Red Sun alternative, Denied Metal, and My Pride of Joy,

1026
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,960
a band of three young men by the name of Stolen Ink.

1027
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,000
Check them on Facebook.

1028
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,520
You won't be disappointed.

1029
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:30,960
All these bands I named, and they have good solid names that are fun to say and easy to

1030
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,960
remember, so please take to heart what I say next.

1031
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,000
Misspelling a word and a group name never seems to work out well.

1032
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,440
But if your heart is set on it, here's a few names tossed your way.

1033
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,400
Girls, girls, sorry.

1034
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,720
Girls spelled normally.

1035
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,160
Girls spelled with a U.

1036
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,160
Girls spelled with a Z.

1037
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:49,920
So girls, girls, girls.

1038
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,160
Yes.

1039
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,640
Name of your hometown.

1040
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,120
Girls.

1041
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,520
Monster beat girls.

1042
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,760
Nope, nope, nope.

1043
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,640
Beat girls.

1044
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,240
No combination of beat girls.

1045
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:00,800
Yeah.

1046
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,240
Should ever be in anything.

1047
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,520
TXT girls.

1048
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,520
Text girls.

1049
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,320
Power Supply girls and Rolling Rhythm girls.

1050
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,360
I think Power Supply girls is my favorite.

1051
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,720
Renewable Energy girls.

1052
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,080
Oh, that's great.

1053
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:16,720
Green girls.

1054
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,760
Wind Farm girls.

1055
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,360
Corn-based ethanol girls.

1056
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:26,480
So, guys, it's time for our check-in of the Stolen Ink MySpace page.

1057
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,640
There are, of course, the trio of musicians from Bellevue, Illinois.

1058
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,600
Here are the literal names of the members of this band.

1059
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,520
We got Lucas Holland on bass.

1060
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:35,920
Okay.

1061
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,160
Okay.

1062
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,600
Stone Seerlock on guitar and vocals.

1063
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,880
And then my favorite, Kale Hug on drums.

1064
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,960
Top comment on the MySpace page comes in from Adam.

1065
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,480
He says, OMG, you guys rock.

1066
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,440
If I were a chick, I'd do all of you.

1067
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,680
JK, no, but really, I would.

1068
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,880
And that was posted.

1069
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,920
And that was posted when?

1070
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,920
That came to us one year ago today.

1071
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,680
I don't know if they consummated that.

1072
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,440
It was a day just like today.

1073
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,440
I believe that means they have gone viral.

1074
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:19,360
Then they changed their name to One Direction, and now they're huge.

1075
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,240
Now we know them.

1076
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:25,200
Adam, I have clicked a button to bring Stolen Ink to Honey Twice Virginia on the MySpace page.

1077
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,600
I don't know if that will work, but I have a-

1078
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,480
Give me that ink.

1079
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:29,840
I'm a fan.

1080
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,200
Send it my way.

1081
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:36,800
You know that you've, you know, you know you've got the Google heat

1082
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,400
when the third result for searching for your brand brings up the headline

1083
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,520
office depot manager got rich selling stolen ink cartons.

1084
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,840
You know, you know you're making a dent in the scene.

1085
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:57,200
Um, there is no band that you can put girls in that won't be miserable.

1086
01:05:58,880 --> 01:05:59,840
Miserable girls.

1087
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,640
That's probably the most accurate you're going to get, but

1088
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,320
I don't think it has the penetration required to go viral.

1089
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:09,600
Penetration girls.

1090
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,160
You gotta stop saying the things I say and then girls after it.

1091
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:14,960
Girls after it girls.

1092
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,460
Stop it.

1093
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:17,520
Stop it girls.

1094
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,480
I'll hang you.

1095
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,080
I will hang the life out of you.

1096
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,040
Don't fucking, don't you fucking-

1097
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:23,680
News girls.

1098
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,880
Here's some, uh, here's some bands that have girls in the name.

1099
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:29,200
Okay.

1100
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,840
Uh, brought to you by our friends at allmusic.com.

1101
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,880
They're Spice Girls.

1102
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:33,280
Sure.

1103
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,400
Okay, uh, new girls in you.

1104
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,040
So that's taken.

1105
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:37,840
Oh yeah, I've heard of them.

1106
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,400
Uh, 69 girls.

1107
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,560
That's a large band.

1108
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:45,360
It's like the polyphonic spree, but it's all, it's all ladies.

1109
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,720
Yeah, yeah.

1110
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,600
Girlsmen.

1111
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,440
No, they're bad.

1112
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,240
Is this going, is there like 50 names down the list?

1113
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,920
There's something hilarious.

1114
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,000
You're hoping for a joke, right?

1115
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,640
Where's the pay?

1116
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,680
I'm just waiting for the payoff.

1117
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,080
It's cool.

1118
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,680
We've done this a hundred times.

1119
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,960
I know you know what you're doing.

1120
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,880
Um, can you just edit it?

1121
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,720
Can you put a payoff in post?

1122
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:14,960
Can you, how about, can I come up with a gag later and I'll just fax it to you?

1123
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:19,840
Or I can just, I'll just type it into Microsoft Sam and I'll just put that in later.

1124
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,120
Thanks.

1125
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,040
So here's another check-in email.

1126
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:31,440
Um, I am potential runaway bride from episode 31 who you gave some very serious relationship

1127
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:36,080
advice to regarding a boyfriend who wanted to propose when I was terrified of the idea.

1128
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:40,400
In short, you told me to consider why I was so scared and leave him if it wasn't working.

1129
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,040
I did.

1130
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:44,880
And then I left and I can honestly say it was one of the best things I've ever done.

1131
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,320
With him out of my life, I graduated college early, moved to a new city,

1132
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,720
and am in a wonderful relationship with a new guy.

1133
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,040
Thank you for giving me a dose of reality, brothers.

1134
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,920
Packed my bags and moved away from Charlotte, North Carolina.

1135
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:00,080
This is, listen, I, this is fantastic.

1136
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,200
This, this really does.

1137
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:05,840
It warms my heart and I feel so happy for you, but I genuinely hope that the guy that

1138
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,160
you were dating originally wasn't like General Zaroff.

1139
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,840
It was going to very slowly hunt me, Justin, and Travis all down for making you break up

1140
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:12,340
with him.

1141
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:16,500
Also, I just want you to know like what a huge risk you took.

1142
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,300
Yeah, yeah.

1143
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:18,100
Oh man.

1144
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,380
Acting on our advice.

1145
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,780
I'm so glad it worked out well.

1146
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:25,220
We sound serious when we're saying these things.

1147
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,820
It still doesn't mean we mean them.

1148
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,780
You can't, you can't actually do the stuff.

1149
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,180
I can't have that hanging over my head.

1150
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:37,060
I'm, I'm just terrified of like, it's great that this worked out for you, but I'm terrified

1151
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:40,580
of like the six people that weren't able to write in because they're homeless now and

1152
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:43,860
can't afford the computer to tell us the terrible things that we did to their life.

1153
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:48,260
You have to remember, we've answered an average of six questions over a hundred episodes.

1154
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:49,060
That's six hundred.

1155
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:52,580
Forty people or so wrote in.

1156
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:55,780
So to me, that means five hundred and sixty people are just dead.

1157
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:57,620
Just dead as fuck.

1158
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,020
Dead because of our words.

1159
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:02,500
Yeah, we killed them with our show.

1160
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:03,780
So for that, we're sorry.

1161
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:08,420
What if we get a question in next week that's like, hey brothers, I was going to propose

1162
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:11,540
this girl, but she done, she done dipped on me.

1163
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:13,620
So now I'm pretty much sad all the time.

1164
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:15,060
What do I do?

1165
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:16,660
Now I just sit around listening to miserable girls.

1166
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:18,500
What do I do to stave off the loneliness?

1167
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:21,940
Love, David.

1168
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:25,380
Love, I'm right behind you with a knife.

1169
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:27,460
Yeah, I'm going to kill you.

1170
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:32,660
I'm moving to Cincinnati this weekend for my first grownup job and my first time living

1171
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,380
alone.

1172
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:38,260
I am in desperate need of tips for making the move go slowly.

1173
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:39,940
I've got plenty of family helping.

1174
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:40,580
Smoothly.

1175
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:43,220
I want the move to be as slow as possible.

1176
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:44,820
Can I ride on a giant tortoise?

1177
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:49,460
What's the slowest car that there is to buy?

1178
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:56,660
I got plenty of family helping, but I'd like the experience to suck as little as possible.

1179
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:01,380
I'm appalled with the number of books and video games I've accumulated over the years.

1180
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,140
Thanks, Brothers Gmail.

1181
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:07,380
All right, I'm going to tell you something straight up and it may be too late for this.

1182
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:15,060
I have never ever gotten rid of a physical possession and then regretted it ever in my

1183
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:15,860
entire life.

1184
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:16,900
I completely agree.

1185
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:23,860
I have never gotten rid of a DVD or a game or whatever and wished later that I had that

1186
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:25,780
thing again.

1187
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:26,180
You know what?

1188
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:30,500
I'll take that one step further because I'm a huge pack rat or I was a huge pack rat.

1189
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:36,340
And over the course of like four years from like age 24 to like now, I've moved like eight

1190
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:41,140
times and in moving into this apartment that I'm currently in, I finally went through and

1191
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:46,580
unpacked all the boxes that I hadn't touched in like five moves and they were full of just

1192
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:52,020
literal garbage, like pieces of paper, scraps of things that I just thrown into a box rather

1193
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,460
than like sorting through my shit.

1194
01:10:54,260 --> 01:11:00,100
And I probably would have moved eight last boxes move if I just actually gone through

1195
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:01,140
and sorted through my stuff.

1196
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,300
In your defense, you are half borrower, though.

1197
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,340
Yeah, that is true.

1198
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:05,300
That's disgusting.

1199
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,140
It's disgusting and half magpie.

1200
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:07,700
Disgusting.

1201
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:10,900
Here's what you do.

1202
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,060
You throw away probably well, don't throw it away.

1203
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:16,900
Go to Goodwill, drop off like half your clothes because I guarantee you don't wear half of

1204
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:17,460
your clothes.

1205
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:18,020
Just get rid of them.

1206
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:18,660
They take up space.

1207
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:19,140
They're heavy.

1208
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:19,620
They're gross.

1209
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:20,580
They're moldy.

1210
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:21,380
Get rid of those.

1211
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:23,540
Get rid of old shitty furniture.

1212
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:26,260
It's time for you to upgrade, get some nicer stuff.

1213
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:28,660
I wouldn't get rid of any video games because I can't.

1214
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:33,380
I got rid of all of my Super Nintendo and PlayStation games once so I could buy a computer

1215
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:37,780
and I regret it every day of my life that I don't have my original copy of Chrono Trigger

1216
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:38,980
on the Super Nintendo.

1217
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:40,180
That's got sentimental value.

1218
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:42,980
I'd hold on to those because you're going to want to come back to your-

1219
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:45,460
Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's like a box to put your video game.

1220
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:47,140
That's not like a big deal.

1221
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:47,860
And here's another thing.

1222
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:54,020
If you're willing to invest a little bit of money, go and buy uniform boxes, especially

1223
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:55,300
if you're like packing a truck.

1224
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,580
Having uniform boxes make it so much faster.

1225
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,340
Especially if you have a lot of uniforms.

1226
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:02,180
Those are going to come in super handy.

1227
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:06,180
I mean, like same size, same shape, same construction.

1228
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,060
You're absolutely right.

1229
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:09,860
Seal the bottom.

1230
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,060
Tape up the bottom of the box.

1231
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:11,700
Tape up the bottom.

1232
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:15,460
Don't do that thing where you fold over the four corners.

1233
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:18,260
It always, you're going to drop your books on your foot and you're going to be mad.

1234
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:24,500
Also, if you got a bunch of family and friends helping you, you have to remember that like

1235
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:28,820
your efforts in the move are important, but you got to keep an eye on people that they

1236
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:30,580
don't start trying to do stuff.

1237
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:33,220
Like, you know, all you want them for is manual labor.

1238
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:36,020
If you see people trying to get shifty and start unpacking things.

1239
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:39,780
I just put your pots and pans under the sink.

1240
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:40,340
Oh, great.

1241
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:41,300
Where it's super dirty.

1242
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:42,500
That's great.

1243
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,780
That's where I wanted those.

1244
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:44,420
That's where I hate them.

1245
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:45,220
I hate them there.

1246
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:46,020
Thank you.

1247
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,060
Great job.

1248
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:47,540
Keep it up.

1249
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:54,580
Also, I highly recommend doing furniture first and like when you move it into your new apartment,

1250
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:58,100
furniture first, then carry all the boxes and everything because the furniture is the

1251
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:00,900
big heavy upfront, you know, push.

1252
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:04,020
And then you can take one box at a time and it's less of a stress.

1253
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:08,420
But if you wear yourself up on boxes and then you get to the furniture, you're going to

1254
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:11,860
be so sad that you and listen, don't let people leave.

1255
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:13,220
They're going to try to sneak out.

1256
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:14,260
You can't let that happen.

1257
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,420
You've got to keep an eye on people.

1258
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:17,300
They're going to run.

1259
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:20,260
They're going to try to bolt because everybody hates moving and they hate helping you.

1260
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:23,060
Oh, guys, I'm moving.

1261
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:28,100
I'm moving in like a month or two and I'm just reading this question and us talking

1262
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:31,460
about it, I'm having like a panic attack.

1263
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:36,900
The thing is, moving is once you're all moved in and you've set up your new apartment,

1264
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,260
it's like the greatest thing.

1265
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:43,940
But the lead up to it, like cleaning out your three years of terribleness in your apartment,

1266
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:45,460
it's like the worst.

1267
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:50,500
And you can try to clean your stuff, like you can try to remove the signs of your life.

1268
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:56,980
If it tastes like, why does it take so many passes to like remove the evidence of your

1269
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:57,540
existence?

1270
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:58,980
It takes forever.

1271
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:03,460
And the worst part is like, you look around at your stuff, right?

1272
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:05,860
Right now, everybody stop, take a look around where they are.

1273
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:07,780
You think, I don't have that much stuff.

1274
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:10,820
A couple of books on the bookshelf, you know, some stuff.

1275
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:13,060
You have so much shit.

1276
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:14,420
Like you don't even know it.

1277
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,580
It's under bookcases and inside drawers.

1278
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:17,780
You have so much stuff.

1279
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:20,020
Terrible.

1280
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:27,700
Comedian and hospitality expert Amy Sedaris, she had a pretty good way of doing this.

1281
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:32,900
She would invite people over for garage sales and basically she would just lay out a bunch

1282
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:37,780
of stuff that she owned on tables in her house and you would give her a quarter for anything.

1283
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:40,100
And you would just go through her house buying her stuff.

1284
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,820
She would just sell it to you because you would came over for garage sale party.

1285
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:47,940
Can I just use this podcast as like my own personal Austin Craigslist?

1286
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:51,780
Like guys, I've got like two laptops I just don't use.

1287
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:52,660
I need to hawk them.

1288
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:54,820
I've got a bed that I'm probably going to need to get rid of.

1289
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:55,780
Just like hit me up.

1290
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:59,620
I'll give you very reasonable prices and you can sleep in the bed of a star.

1291
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:03,620
A rich man.

1292
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:04,500
This is a celebrity bed.

1293
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,980
You can roll around in my skin flakes and you'll love it.

1294
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:08,340
Love every second of it.

1295
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:08,980
Dirty boy.

1296
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:10,340
Now you're never going to sell a bed.

1297
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:10,980
So dirty.

1298
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,700
Such a dirty bad bed.

1299
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:14,420
It's got my cheek.

1300
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:18,820
It's got, oh God, go on.

1301
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:19,620
Good job.

1302
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:20,740
I'm talking guys.

1303
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:22,740
100.

1304
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:25,220
Holy shit guys.

1305
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:31,780
I have been listening since episode one and you're about to hit your hundredth episode

1306
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:33,140
and that's fucking awesome.

1307
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:35,140
And I've listened to every single one.

1308
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:36,580
You've answered one of my questions.

1309
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:38,420
You give me shout outs on the show.

1310
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:45,940
I drank fucking a strawberry tropic chillers because of you guys and it was the worst thing

1311
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:49,540
that I've ever done, but I'm, I'm glad that I did it.

1312
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:54,420
I've grown as a person and I couldn't have done that without my brother, my brother and

1313
01:15:54,420 --> 01:16:01,140
me, uh, congratulations on your hundredth episode from, uh, Ian Johnson in Kansas city,

1314
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:01,700
Missouri.

1315
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:03,620
Guys, I got a Yahoo answer from Steve Lewis.

1316
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:04,660
Thank you, Steve.

1317
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:05,460
I should be clear.

1318
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:09,540
I should be clear, Steve didn't ask it because I don't think this is Steve style, but he

1319
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:09,940
sent it in.

1320
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:10,820
Thank you, Steve Lewis.

1321
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:17,300
It's by Yahoo answers user question mark who asks my boyfriend has a teeth fetish.

1322
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:21,140
My boyfriend has a teeth fetish.

1323
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:22,740
Maybe it's a cavity fetish.

1324
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:27,300
He always wants, he always wants to look inside my mouth at feelings I've had done or any

1325
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:27,860
dental work.

1326
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:30,740
He likes to feel my teeth with his tongue while we're kissing.

1327
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:34,580
And he's even, he's even asked if he could see copies of my dental x-rays.

1328
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:35,780
I care about him.

1329
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:38,660
And this is the only persistent problem between us.

1330
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:42,180
So I'd really like to find a way to work around this, but it makes me uncomfortable.

1331
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:46,260
He is constantly asking me questions about my dental history and wanting to look inside

1332
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:46,820
my mouth.

1333
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:50,260
And he has made it clear that it's a sexual thing and he's turned on by it.

1334
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:53,700
I'm not really sure how to handle this because I've never really dealt with anything like

1335
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:54,260
this before.

1336
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:55,220
Any help?

1337
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:57,940
I'd like educated responses only please.

1338
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:59,220
I understand this is a strange question.

1339
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:00,260
I'm aware it's highly ordinary.

1340
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:04,260
No need for anyone to use the response system to blast their personal feelings preferences

1341
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:04,900
on this topic.

1342
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:05,460
It's weird.

1343
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:06,100
I get it.

1344
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:08,420
Dear Yahoo.

1345
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:10,580
I have like the greatest boyfriend.

1346
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:12,740
There's this one little thing.

1347
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:13,060
One ish.

1348
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,420
I've got one ish with him.

1349
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:20,740
I now know that time travel will not be invented in my lifetime because there's no way future

1350
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:25,380
Justin would not have come and snatched the headphones from me just then and said, no,

1351
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:26,500
don't do this.

1352
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,060
Don't do this.

1353
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,020
You can't live with-

1354
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,380
Don't go down this rabbit hole.

1355
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:31,940
Can't carry this burden with you of knowing this is a thing.

1356
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:37,940
Can we- the one thing that is bad about the internet except for all the other things is

1357
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:42,500
the one major thing is I don't need to just do this in your own home.

1358
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,860
I don't need to know about it.

1359
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:48,420
Why would you foist this onto the public consciousness?

1360
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:57,700
Listen, did you not assume any hole that is on or can be made with the human body is-

1361
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:00,020
People have a fetish over that, right?

1362
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:05,540
I just didn't assume that it would get so tiny as cavities, you know what I mean?

1363
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:11,780
I'm just glad that this- because I was sure there was going to be some ambiguity to this,

1364
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:14,900
but thank God that the boyfriend cleared up that it is a sexual thing.

1365
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:19,380
Hey, just real quick, just so there's no confusion, don't let me be misunderstood.

1366
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:20,660
Got to see those cavities.

1367
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:24,260
This is not at all- I don't care about your dental hygiene.

1368
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:26,420
I'm not like studying to be a dentist or anything.

1369
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:28,740
I am boned out for your canines.

1370
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:29,940
I'm boned out for your canines.

1371
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:30,660
Please get them out.

1372
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:31,860
This is really hot to me.

1373
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:33,780
So here's my question to you guys.

1374
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:39,940
When in this guy's younger years, did he have the best dentist ever or the worst dentist ever?

1375
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:45,060
So he had one of those that has turned him into this.

1376
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:47,780
So I just need to clear up which one he had.

1377
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:51,780
You mean like he gave him the gas and was like very comforting to him and like gave

1378
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:54,980
him a free toothbrush with every visit or-

1379
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:59,860
Yeah, or he would just blasting Slayer from all the speakers and ripping his teeth out

1380
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,140
without Novocaine.

1381
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:03,780
One of them is triggering this.

1382
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:09,780
I'm just- I'm trying to decide what the question asker wants to accomplish.

1383
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:15,620
Like is this person asking how do I become okay with the fact that my boyfriend is a teeth guy?

1384
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:20,100
She's trying to do a pro and con scale, right?

1385
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:24,820
And she knows all the pros and she's figured out the value of them.

1386
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:31,140
She needs to know the metric weight of how terrible it is that he wants to fuck her teeth out.

1387
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,140
Oh, very.

1388
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:33,780
Very hot.

1389
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:37,940
I would say 2,000 pounds is how heavy this is.

1390
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,900
A metric, it's a solid ton of bad.

1391
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:47,140
Guys, all she's doing is she wants to share her burden.

1392
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:47,700
That's it.

1393
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:48,820
That's all this is about.

1394
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:50,900
Hey, take a load off, question mark.

1395
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,420
Take a load off, yahoo.

1396
01:19:52,420 --> 01:20:00,500
Take a load freak and tell me about your boyfriend's thing with teeth.

1397
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:03,460
Pulled into internet.

1398
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:06,900
Gotta tell people about my freaky boyfriend.

1399
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:10,740
He likes to jerk off to people's smiles.

1400
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:15,700
His favorite member of the Muppets was Dr. Teeth.

1401
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,460
He's got 20 pairs of dentures in the closet.

1402
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:23,460
He calls it his secret shrine.

1403
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:26,260
You're turning into Randy Newman again.

1404
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:27,220
And everybody knows.

1405
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:31,220
Gives me a cavity search and it means exactly what it sounds like.

1406
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,300
Take a load off, yahoo.

1407
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:36,820
Tell me about the thing with teeth.

1408
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,220
Oh, fuck.

1409
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:40,820
Can we not?

1410
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:42,260
Can we please not?

1411
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:43,780
What's next?

1412
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:44,180
Can we just not?

1413
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:45,780
Is this, this is the end game, right?

1414
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:47,380
What small, I guess, pores?

1415
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:52,820
Every time I hear one of these things, I expect there to be, like,

1416
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:55,540
curtains on the computer that close.

1417
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:57,460
It's like, the end.

1418
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:58,180
The end.

1419
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:00,900
The internet theme.

1420
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:04,900
Hey, thanks for sticking with us this far, Justin.

1421
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:06,340
You've reached the end of the internet.

1422
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:07,460
We've had a good run.

1423
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:09,140
Here's a printout certificate.

1424
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,100
Turns out we were all ghosts the whole time.

1425
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,180
Thanks for hanging in there for a decade.

1426
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:16,740
Uh, thanks for sticking with us through the prodigy years.

1427
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:19,060
We know things were a little rough in the beginning.

1428
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:23,700
This whole thing has been a Truman Show-esque television extravaganza.

1429
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:27,460
People watching you explore the horrifying depths of the internet.

1430
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:32,260
Most of it was user generated content by people who are delighting in your torment.

1431
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:33,700
You've won eight Emmys.

1432
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,220
You're the most famous person in the world.

1433
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:39,940
Uh, it's all for you, Justin.

1434
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:42,980
Because that's what people, that's what people on the internet need to think that they are,

1435
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:46,340
in fact, even more important than they already assume that they are.

1436
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:48,820
Oh man, teeth, guys.

1437
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,940
You know the horrifying thing is that this girl-

1438
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,700
Yeah, I know the horrifying thing, Travis.

1439
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:57,780
No, but there's like, there's like a whole group of people that are like,

1440
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,620
yeah, that's completely normal.

1441
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:00,100
Yeah.

1442
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:01,380
Teeth. Sexy. Sexy teeth.

1443
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:02,500
That's actually the first answer.

1444
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:04,580
So it's weird, so what?

1445
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:06,420
We all have our own little ways of getting turned on.

1446
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:09,380
Yes, perhaps your boyfriend's is a little further out from the mainstream than most,

1447
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:10,980
but if you love him, should not matter.

1448
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:15,060
Like, I don't, and this is where, this is where I, I agree.

1449
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:15,780
Doesn't matter.

1450
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:20,100
I'm, we are all three of us super in, I think we proved last week,

1451
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:23,300
we're both into and knowledgeable about the kink scene.

1452
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,700
We're down, we're down with all that.

1453
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:29,460
Whatever you want to do, just don't tell anybody about it.

1454
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:33,060
Right, like, I'm in the sexual waffle irons,

1455
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:36,580
but like, I would never ever say that out loud in front of another person,

1456
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:38,180
let alone an enraptured radio audience.

1457
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:39,460
Yeah, and like, I can't stop walruses.

1458
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:42,740
I can't stop walruses. Yeah, Travis is like, stuck on walrusing.

1459
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:44,420
And I like sex.

1460
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:45,860
But you know, I keep that to myself.

1461
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:54,500
I like, I like, um, I like sex all, sex, weird sex.

1462
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,380
That's gross, Justin.

1463
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:56,580
That's horrible.

1464
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:57,140
You pervert.

1465
01:22:57,140 --> 01:23:00,260
I was just talking about putting your penis in a waffle iron,

1466
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:02,660
or some, maybe a sandwich maker, make a paninas.

1467
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:09,940
Wait, I'm sorry, did you say paninas?

1468
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:15,220
And the Oscar for podcasting goes to Griffin McElroy for paninas.

1469
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:19,540
The worst word that now exists.

1470
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:23,540
And the worst image, in case anyone is wondering.

1471
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:27,700
The 100% worst thing that is, and you're crushed, toasted dick.

1472
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:31,220
I actually went, I went to the, uh, I went to Panera Bread the other day,

1473
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:33,380
and they had a paninas on special.

1474
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:35,700
Oh no.

1475
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:37,460
Okay.

1476
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:37,700
Okay.

1477
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:41,300
Well, between your paninas and, uh, your delicious, juicy butt.

1478
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,260
I have a lot to offer.

1479
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:43,460
This is the worst day ever.

1480
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:45,060
You got a lot going for you.

1481
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:48,340
This is what happens when we record a two-hour podcast.

1482
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:51,380
Usually when we record a one-hour podcast, we get to like, minute 53,

1483
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:54,740
and we have to pull the ripcord, because something awful has happened.

1484
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:57,380
We've learned something awful about ourselves in the internet.

1485
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,220
This time we have, we have no such luxury.

1486
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:00,580
Yeah.

1487
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:02,020
We're just getting as deep as it.

1488
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:03,700
We're just figuring this out.

1489
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:04,580
How deep this goes.

1490
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:08,980
Uh, we're, we're making callbacks in this episode of things that happened so long ago.

1491
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:11,700
We don't, we no longer remember them.

1492
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:16,820
You know, I, it's a little off topic, uh, of the podcast, but I find that,

1493
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:21,380
I think that this might be a time to answer some behind the scenes questions

1494
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:26,580
that we've been asked over the years of just stuff like, uh, how much editing.

1495
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:27,140
So much.

1496
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:28,660
None.

1497
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:29,940
You guys would not believe.

1498
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:32,660
Well, Justin and I don't do it.

1499
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:33,300
Yeah.

1500
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:36,020
They, approximately zero minutes from both of them.

1501
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:37,620
Well, Justin does it every once in a while.

1502
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:39,700
Griffin, what kind of editing do you do in the show?

1503
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:44,180
The kind where when we say things that aren't funny, I just, I can delete that.

1504
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:46,820
And how much, how many deleted scenes did you say that is?

1505
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:47,540
Half of it.

1506
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:48,100
Half of them.

1507
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:49,220
Half of them.

1508
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:51,300
50%.

1509
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:53,140
One out of every two.

1510
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:56,260
How many, how many, what percentage of that is funny,

1511
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:59,300
but you would never want anyone to know that we said the things.

1512
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:00,500
So you have to delete them.

1513
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:01,860
What percentage is that?

1514
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:04,900
So the, so the, the, the bigoted material.

1515
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:05,380
Yes.

1516
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:08,500
The more, let's say the more bigoted material.

1517
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:11,620
Um, all, all, 100%.

1518
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:12,420
Pretty much all.

1519
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:13,300
It's all funny.

1520
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:17,620
It's just some of it is like the kind of funny that Don Rickles can get away with

1521
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:18,980
because he'll be dead soon.

1522
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:19,860
That's kind of funny.

1523
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:25,300
Once we're 70, we'll release the, the master tapes and people will-

1524
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:27,380
By which we do mean, in fact, the master tapes.

1525
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:32,500
They are, they're master tapes for the master race is the name of that, uh, collection.

1526
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:33,780
No, it's not called that.

1527
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:34,260
It is.

1528
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:35,540
We'll, it will be called that.

1529
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:37,780
But there'll be quotes around it.

1530
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:41,060
And then we'll be at the bottom like, get it?

1531
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:42,260
We're old now.

1532
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:43,380
We're old.

1533
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:44,100
This is cool.

1534
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,220
Travis, do we have any more?

1535
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:47,780
Do we have any more behind the scenes questions?

1536
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:50,420
Was that, was that literally the only thing people don't understand about?

1537
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:54,820
Um, we also get asked stuff like how we pick where we do the live shows.

1538
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:56,100
Fucking no.

1539
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:57,780
Where does one of us live?

1540
01:25:57,780 --> 01:25:58,020
Yeah.

1541
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:02,100
The most convenient place.

1542
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:05,060
If we could do one in our living room, that's what we would do.

1543
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:06,900
We have plans to do other ones now.

1544
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:07,140
Yeah.

1545
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:07,620
The places we'd like-

1546
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:08,900
Now that we're super rich.

1547
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,540
Now that we're super rich, the places we'd like to do live shows.

1548
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:14,260
Well, I think New York is an obvious one.

1549
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:14,500
Yeah.

1550
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:14,740
Yeah.

1551
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:17,220
We, we would love to do one there.

1552
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:21,540
We would, we're doing one in LA for, but that'll be like part of the max fun con.

1553
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:24,420
So we'd love to do one in Seattle.

1554
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:25,860
Yeah, that'd be a lot of fun.

1555
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:26,580
And Boston.

1556
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:28,020
Boston.

1557
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:29,700
I'd love to do one in Philadelphia.

1558
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:32,260
In conjunction with PAX East sometime.

1559
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:33,380
You know, I've been thinking about it.

1560
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:39,380
If you, if you work for a venue or if you are part of an organization that brings people in

1561
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:44,900
and you would like for us to come and do a show, let us know, you know, invite us.

1562
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,100
We'll see what we can do.

1563
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:47,620
DC, we'd like to do one there.

1564
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:49,700
But anyway, that's it.

1565
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:51,700
I mean, those are the places that we'd like to do them.

1566
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:54,740
It's just, logistics can be a challenge.

1567
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:57,380
Maybe a European tour.

1568
01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:00,580
I think, I think the, the Europeans been waiting long enough.

1569
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:02,100
The, we would love to do that.

1570
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:07,140
If you guys can figure out how we, we can make that, like we can pay for it.

1571
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:11,460
If you, if our European friends would be willing to do a Kickstarter with us.

1572
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,460
Don't say don't, but don't just start one.

1573
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:16,340
Don't just start one because we need the money, not you.

1574
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:22,100
But if you guys want us to do a Kickstarter where the end game is that we go to Europe

1575
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:25,380
and I don't know, maybe you donate enough money.

1576
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:28,820
You can like, well, I'll have like a VIP champagne room or something.

1577
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:31,300
Oh, I, where we jerk them off?

1578
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:38,180
No, no, jerk them off with, with comedy, with our mouths.

1579
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:39,780
We jerk them off with our mouths.

1580
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:40,420
We'll giggle bait them.

1581
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,380
Oh Justin, no.

1582
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:43,940
That's called another thing.

1583
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:46,420
No, I, I mean.

1584
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:49,220
That's what it's called when you mouth off to somebody.

1585
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:50,100
That's actually what it is.

1586
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,780
I just really want to go to Europe.

1587
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:57,700
If I got to blow a guy, whatever.

1588
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:02,580
It worked for, it worked for Maggie Gyllenhaal and Cherry, baby.

1589
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:04,580
She got the thing like most of her life that way.

1590
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:05,620
I just want to do it once.

1591
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:07,380
Like, I don't think that's asking so much.

1592
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:09,540
It's asking quite a bit.

1593
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:10,820
It is asking quite a bit.

1594
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:13,540
So here's another question we get asked a lot that I want to go ahead and knock out now.

1595
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:17,380
So we don't go through another hundred episodes of getting this question once a week.

1596
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:21,300
People always ask, they're thinking about starting a podcast.

1597
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:23,460
Do we have any advice?

1598
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:27,700
Do we have how to make it funny, how to do it, anything along those lines?

1599
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:30,180
What if your podcast gets more popular than ours?

1600
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,140
Where does that leave us?

1601
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:32,500
That's why we don't ever answer it.

1602
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,380
Honest to God.

1603
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:34,180
Yeah.

1604
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:36,340
Because there should only be one podcast in this world.

1605
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:37,300
That's not ours.

1606
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:37,940
That's not it.

1607
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:39,940
Hey, stop podcast yourself.

1608
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:40,500
Do that.

1609
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:42,820
You're out of the game.

1610
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:47,300
Jordan and Jesse go, Jordan and Jesse stop, get out, out of the pool.

1611
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:51,380
Throwing shade, throw some dirt on your grave because you're done podcasting.

1612
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:51,860
You're out.

1613
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:55,700
Former Judge John Haught, disgraced Judge John Haught.

1614
01:28:56,660 --> 01:29:00,820
The verdict is in and you have to stop with your show because we're the only ones left.

1615
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:02,340
What else we got?

1616
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,740
WTF, where to find podcasts?

1617
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:06,740
It's nowhere because you're stopped.

1618
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:08,260
How did this get stopped?

1619
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:09,300
How did this get stopped?

1620
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,100
That's pretty good.

1621
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:17,220
I guess the advice would be have two really funny brothers to carry your dead weight for you.

1622
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:19,220
That's been my plan for two years.

1623
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:20,260
It's been working out great so far.

1624
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:21,540
Wait, that's what I've been doing.

1625
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:22,100
Shit.

1626
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,220
I got you guys.

1627
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:27,860
I got this.

1628
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:34,500
I would say the best advice that I have for anyone is don't just start doing a podcast

1629
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:40,340
because you feel like it, like wait until you find a good topic and a good cast of people.

1630
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:40,900
That's what we did.

1631
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:44,420
Yeah, but like we didn't say like, let's do a podcast and start one the next day.

1632
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:45,860
Like we brainstormed and worked on it.

1633
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:46,900
That's exactly what we did.

1634
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:49,060
We workshopped it for like 35 minutes.

1635
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:50,660
Yeah, and all that was coming up with the name.

1636
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:52,660
Yeah.

1637
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:53,700
What was our, do we-

1638
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:56,180
Oh God, I have a text document somewhere with some of the failed names.

1639
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:56,980
Can we do that?

1640
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:57,780
Can you read that?

1641
01:29:57,780 --> 01:29:59,300
Do you have that somewhere saved?

1642
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:01,620
Travis can read a check in while you look for it.

1643
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:03,940
In fact, Travis, do it.

1644
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,060
Got it.

1645
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:10,340
Last summer, I asked for tips and tricks for safely navigating one's first music festival.

1646
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:14,820
In reply, you guys warned me against getting hit by mysterious buses as well as avoiding

1647
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:16,820
the dangers of prostatitis.

1648
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:20,020
I'm happy to report that my trip to Bonnaroo was a rousing success.

1649
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:24,900
I maintained a healthy fear of parked buses and RVs while simultaneously keeping my butthole

1650
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:25,700
game correct.

1651
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:30,260
This year, I will be returning to Bonnaroo and this time I will be breaking the rules

1652
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:32,420
and this time I will be bringing friends.

1653
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:35,540
Congrats on the 100th episode, Battleworn at Bonnaroo.

1654
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:37,460
Now Travis, you giggled.

1655
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:40,020
I like the phrase butthole game.

1656
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:42,900
It's so vital though.

1657
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:44,740
That's no joke.

1658
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:45,380
Yeah.

1659
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:48,660
You want to come home, you'd be like, yeah, I saw Wilco, it was great, got a butt disease.

1660
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:52,580
Travis, another one from this, vegetarians.

1661
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:53,620
Oh, okay.

1662
01:30:53,620 --> 01:31:00,020
Here's another one, I asked you what I should do to feed my vegetarian friends in episode

1663
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:00,820
46.

1664
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:03,380
Somehow I managed to feed them and remain friends with them.

1665
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:08,180
I even managed to pick up more of those delusional friends and am currently dating one.

1666
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:10,100
So I guess everything worked out well.

1667
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:12,980
Thanks and congratulations on the 100th episode.

1668
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:16,100
So congratulations on your vegetarian girlfriend.

1669
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:18,580
You guys, I found the document.

1670
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:18,820
Okay.

1671
01:31:20,820 --> 01:31:26,260
Here's some a few names that we came up with that were really bad.

1672
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:28,900
Bad, brother in my ear.

1673
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:34,340
We got into robots for a while.

1674
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,180
Travis said fat robot.

1675
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:39,460
Not quite human.

1676
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:41,300
Justin said the not quite human fan cast.

1677
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,300
This is all legit by the way.

1678
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:48,180
This is not a bit.

1679
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:52,820
Brother attack, wind brothers attack, heat of the bromant.

1680
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:56,260
Heat of the bromant was such a good, wait, wait, what was it?

1681
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:57,780
Heat of the bromant.

1682
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:58,420
That was mine.

1683
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:02,180
Blossom.

1684
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:13,620
Blossom, it's just blossom?

1685
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:14,500
That's just blossom.

1686
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:16,500
Family circus.

1687
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:21,380
Oh man, some of these are so fucking bad.

1688
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:23,700
Keep going.

1689
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:24,980
I have to know.

1690
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:25,780
Oh, this is great.

1691
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:26,500
Macklejoy.

1692
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:33,460
I was the first one to suggest my brother, my brother and me.

1693
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,900
I forgot that piece of errata.

1694
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:38,980
And then right after that, I suggested Keenan and Kel and Justin and Travis and Griffin.

1695
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:42,100
Let's see.

1696
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:48,900
I remember we had a honorary brother was, was one that we kicked around, brother bought

1697
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:51,860
5,000, I think was one brother bought 5,000.

1698
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:53,700
I do remember bro.

1699
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,380
Cirque du bro, Cirque du Brolet.

1700
01:32:55,380 --> 01:33:01,140
I remember a bro, your own way was one that was very close to becoming it.

1701
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:10,340
The Baldwin's podcasting podcasting, the Baldwin brothers podcast with your host,

1702
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:19,460
the Mackleroy brothers, brother, I think maybe, and you know, how people who really love Mr.

1703
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:25,860
Belvedere, Colin Brock tune, I think that we should maybe, maybe people who are super

1704
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:30,020
fans of the show should pick one of these as a nickname they can, they can use for.

1705
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:30,820
Oh, I like that.

1706
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:35,380
That only they use that only they use, but while still, let's go with Blossom.

1707
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:39,380
Just please make it blossom, but don't check out the latest episode of Blossom.

1708
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:42,180
Well, we're actually trying to, we're still trying to build our brand heat.

1709
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:43,220
So please don't do that.

1710
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:48,500
Let's include the hashtag, the NBA hashtag we do because like, we're just really trying

1711
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,100
to get, build this brand right now.

1712
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:53,220
How about a Yahoo answer?

1713
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:53,780
Yeah, sure.

1714
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:56,660
Are we still doing this fucking bot?

1715
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:58,740
Are we doing like two shows in a row or something?

1716
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:01,060
Yeah, we're going to squeeze in two hours.

1717
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:01,620
Oh my God.

1718
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:03,620
People, it's what people want in.

1719
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:04,980
They've listened to 99 hours.

1720
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:07,380
I only want two more because they're fucking insane.

1721
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:09,540
This one is sent by Mark Turetsky. Thanks, Mark.

1722
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:14,500
It's by Yahoo Answers user Andre who asks 2012 into the world safe places to hide.

1723
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:21,620
I'm not going to read his whole question because it's like six paragraphs of the craziest thing

1724
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:28,020
I've ever read, but he had a friend who used to work at Area 51, told him it's a government

1725
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:29,940
bunker about 1500 miles underground.

1726
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:35,220
He said that in 2012, there will be quote a new beginning that the government knows

1727
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:38,660
all about. It's going to kill 99.9% of the people on the earth.

1728
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:45,140
They're going to save Obama and Bush and Clinton and him, his buddy who works at Area 51, NASA

1729
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:45,780
for some reason.

1730
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:49,140
And it's a no fly zone.

1731
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:50,660
When do you get to the crazy part?

1732
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:56,180
When I said 2012 into the world safe places to hide.

1733
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,180
No, but all of that's true.

1734
01:34:58,180 --> 01:34:59,380
Right from the kickoff.

1735
01:34:59,380 --> 01:35:01,940
No, I saw all of that on the history channel yesterday.

1736
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:03,220
Here's a problem.

1737
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:03,940
No, you didn't.

1738
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:04,420
Yes, it is.

1739
01:35:04,420 --> 01:35:06,740
Here's another. Here's a second problem.

1740
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:09,220
He can't enter this facility.

1741
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:10,820
It's it's limited entry.

1742
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:15,060
He wants to move to the Himalayas, but he's not a mountain climber, but he doesn't know

1743
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:18,820
of any other safe places to hide when the depletion of the human race happens.

1744
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,100
Well, I think the answer is obvious.

1745
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:23,780
Is it Area 52?

1746
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:27,220
It's not.

1747
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:29,300
It's kind of shoddily made.

1748
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:32,260
Area 52 is the name of the pizza parlor next door.

1749
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:34,420
It's hilarious.

1750
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:35,300
Hilarious gag.

1751
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:38,340
What if you can you stand in a doorway?

1752
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:41,780
Can you get can you get in your bathtub?

1753
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:43,620
Get in your bathtub in a doorway.

1754
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:45,780
Build a doorway in the bathtub in the basement.

1755
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:47,780
That's the safest place you can be in any emergency.

1756
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:51,780
That's a you a bomb can go off next to you and you'll be you'll be okay.

1757
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:52,280
Yeah.

1758
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:57,620
That's how that's how Osama survives for so long.

1759
01:35:57,620 --> 01:36:02,420
He actually wouldn't leave the the the door frame in the bathtub in a basement.

1760
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:08,100
They had to carry him around like a like a giant sedan with the guys on the side.

1761
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:09,780
Ah, fuck.

1762
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:12,180
I should have said Area Club 54.

1763
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:13,780
Stop it.

1764
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:14,580
Damn it.

1765
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:16,580
That would have led to like a whole string of goofs.

1766
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:18,100
Oh, yeah, it would have been really great.

1767
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:19,220
I would have been really good.

1768
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:19,700
Well, never.

1769
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:23,140
Maybe if you want to start a podcast, there's a great way.

1770
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:25,540
Just take that goof that Travis left there by the right side.

1771
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:28,020
That's I'd say it's a full podcast with a group.

1772
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:29,380
It's a rich vein of goose.

1773
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:30,660
It's a rich goose vein.

1774
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:32,740
Oh, no claim jumpers.

1775
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:37,140
So claim jumpers would be a great name for a podcast.

1776
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:38,500
Can we change ours?

1777
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:39,380
No, no.

1778
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,980
Travis, listen, I appreciate all the goofs.

1779
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:46,500
We are eight months out from the apocalypse.

1780
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:51,060
So like if we could come up with something, something, maybe a submarine.

1781
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:53,540
It depends on what goes on, right?

1782
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:54,340
Yeah, we don't know.

1783
01:36:54,340 --> 01:36:56,740
The problem with that's the thing, you got to plan for all.

1784
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:59,300
You get in a submarine and go under and you're like,

1785
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:00,580
ha ha ha suckers.

1786
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:02,420
And then what's this tidal wave?

1787
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:03,220
You're caught in the wave.

1788
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:04,500
You're thrown into a building.

1789
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:07,540
But of course, like if Galactus comes and just eats the planet, it's like,

1790
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:10,260
well, I wish I hadn't wasted so much time getting ready for this.

1791
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:13,460
Well, maybe that's why they're taking that's why they're taking NASA with them.

1792
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:16,420
Because they're working on that the spaceship.

1793
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:20,900
But then what if it's like a just like a wave, like a solar flare that destroys the planet?

1794
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:25,380
And then the only people will be safe are the people in bathtubs and doorways and basements.

1795
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:27,060
So just free floating in space.

1796
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:29,300
Guys.

1797
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:33,860
I wish I hadn't taken my clothes off.

1798
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:34,820
I never thought this.

1799
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:37,540
My pee pee's out in space.

1800
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:41,300
Can I look at your mouth?

1801
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:43,220
Um, we're all fucked.

1802
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:44,500
Yeah, it's over.

1803
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:47,540
So I was trying to enjoy ourselves while we got time.

1804
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:50,100
I haven't seen Melancholia, but I watched a few trailers.

1805
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:51,300
Yeah.

1806
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:57,140
That's how you choose to spend your 2012 experiences watching trailers for Melancholia.

1807
01:37:57,940 --> 01:38:00,260
The sad thing about the world ending in 2012

1808
01:38:00,260 --> 01:38:03,060
is that no one will ever get to hear the master race master tapes.

1809
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:04,260
Yeah.

1810
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:06,980
Guys, I know I'm actually thinking about it.

1811
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:08,260
What if it does happen?

1812
01:38:08,260 --> 01:38:11,220
It's not going to happen, but if it does go, then it's inevitable.

1813
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:14,980
You know, no sense in worrying about it unless it's going to.

1814
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:17,220
Here's what's going to happen is people are going to be like,

1815
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:21,380
like when that day comes, what is it, the 20th, December 20th, 2012, right before Christmas.

1816
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:22,820
Five days before Christmas.

1817
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:23,620
Yeah, I know.

1818
01:38:23,620 --> 01:38:24,500
So it's going to happen.

1819
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,020
I'm not doing any shopping, by the way.

1820
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:26,580
Sorry.

1821
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:27,460
Fuck all y'all.

1822
01:38:27,460 --> 01:38:29,940
There's going to be a lot of last minute Amazon in from the kid.

1823
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:34,820
Do you remember when June 6th, 2006 came along and people were like,

1824
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:36,660
oh fuck, here it comes.

1825
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:38,580
666 everyone's dead.

1826
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:45,220
And everyone bought into it so much that there was just rioting in the streets and like people

1827
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:49,780
burning down entire cities and just like people lost their minds until June 7th came around.

1828
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:54,100
It's going to be like that, like people are going to bring it about out of their own,

1829
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:55,300
out of their own fear of it.

1830
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:58,420
See, Justin's kicking it off early.

1831
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:00,260
I got melancholia over here.

1832
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:03,620
Hey brothers, congrats on that hundo.

1833
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:05,940
Hey guys, this is Franz Ferdinand.

1834
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:13,460
Just calling to say, you know, my, my death sparked World War, World War One.

1835
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:18,500
So you can take this to the bank when I let you guys know that you're, you're just tops.

1836
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:22,100
And I really think you kids are going to make it anyway.

1837
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:27,540
I'm in hell because I was never baptized, so I got to get off the phone, but keep up

1838
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:28,340
the good work.

1839
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:35,460
I have this theory that if we go full, like we're entering the third hour of podcasting

1840
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:40,020
that we have, that we're in our third hour of it, which is going to sound hilarious.

1841
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:43,780
People listening and then it's been on for 45 minutes.

1842
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:47,300
Hey, wow, Griffin really does clip a lot of this show out.

1843
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:49,300
This is really heavily edited.

1844
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:53,140
I think it's appropriate that we end talking about the end of the world.

1845
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:57,860
Yeah, I think if we keep going, it would just be clicks, right?

1846
01:39:57,860 --> 01:40:02,420
It would just be a bunch of clicks and noises that don't even resemble speech anymore.

1847
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:09,540
If we continue to podcast on into that infinite night, should we keep podcasting until the

1848
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:10,260
end of the world?

1849
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:11,860
That's my question.

1850
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:14,260
We've only got eight months left.

1851
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:17,220
Shouldn't we dig in and just keep podcasting the whole time?

1852
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:19,780
Let's do one.

1853
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:20,980
Let's do one more.

1854
01:40:20,980 --> 01:40:21,780
Definitely.

1855
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:22,260
Definitely.

1856
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:23,220
You can't stop me.

1857
01:40:23,220 --> 01:40:24,580
This one was sent in by Lisa Holofield.

1858
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:28,660
Thank you, Lisa Holofield, for your, your constant, your unswerving patronage.

1859
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:34,580
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Clayton, who asks, can I call my husband daddy?

1860
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:38,500
Good night, folks.

1861
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:39,860
Do we really want to do this?

1862
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:41,300
Goodbye, everybody.

1863
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:43,220
Tell me right now, should we do another one?

1864
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:48,100
Let me give you some, let me preview out the other ones.

1865
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:50,820
How to make a, how to make a best friend.

1866
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:51,540
Okay.

1867
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:52,180
Could be sad.

1868
01:40:52,180 --> 01:40:53,780
I don't, I'm not, I don't want like-

1869
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:57,060
Why would a girl, why would a girl send another girl a boobs emoticon?

1870
01:40:57,060 --> 01:41:02,740
Uh-huh, don't you think Justin Bieber is turning ugly day by day and losing all his fans?

1871
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:07,700
All right, let's, let's explore that.

1872
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:09,220
It was also sent in by Lisa Holofield.

1873
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:09,700
What do you know?

1874
01:41:10,340 --> 01:41:11,220
Yeah, who answers you?

1875
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:14,420
Deepak Chaiton, who asks, don't you think Justin Bieber is turning

1876
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:15,940
ugly day by day and losing all his fans?

1877
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:18,740
After so many years of ruling the music industry.

1878
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:21,380
Basically, basically King Beebs.

1879
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:26,820
I think he is turning a bit not attractive and he's losing his fans.

1880
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:29,220
Due to the Robert Pattinson and One Direction.

1881
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:32,420
Only Beliebers answer and say the truth.

1882
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:35,940
No false prophets.

1883
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:39,300
I'm a, I'm a Belieber agnostic right now.

1884
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:42,500
I, I'm not sure that I am fully in the Beebs camp.

1885
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:47,460
I'm going to try to find the most recent picture of the Beebs that I can.

1886
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:48,420
Oh, it's awful.

1887
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:50,020
He looks like Donald Sutherland.

1888
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:58,180
Somewhere there's a portrait of him getting more and more attractive.

1889
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:01,780
And Donald Sutherland's like, I can walk without the cane today.

1890
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:02,820
I'm feeling really good.

1891
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:03,860
Yeah.

1892
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:05,700
Thanks, man.

1893
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:08,020
If he's listening, I just really took the wind out of his sails.

1894
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:11,460
If Kiefer's listening, I'm a fucking dead man.

1895
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:14,020
Oh, the Beebs.

1896
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:15,380
How old is he now?

1897
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:17,540
He was born in 2008.

1898
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:22,820
So he was manufactured by government scientists in 2008.

1899
01:42:22,820 --> 01:42:23,780
He's 12.

1900
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:27,220
Hey guys, is it time for everybody to lay off at Justin Bieber yet?

1901
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:28,500
Can we give him a break?

1902
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:33,380
Once you saw Never Say Never, I don't think there's anybody.

1903
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:36,100
I think you meant to say once you saw Never Say Never.

1904
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,100
I thought I made a film recommendation to you guys.

1905
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:41,620
Dude, do you not remember when I said, hey, you guys should watch this movie?

1906
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:43,060
And you said, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's on Netflix.

1907
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:44,340
We'll watch it tomorrow.

1908
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:45,460
I don't remember saying that.

1909
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:47,620
I remember you saying you should watch it.

1910
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:49,540
And I don't remember us saying anything legally binding.

1911
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:52,100
You emphatically, emphatically agreed.

1912
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:56,100
I'm having sort of a problem right now.

1913
01:42:56,100 --> 01:43:01,620
And that is that I went to Justin Bieber's Wikipedia page, and he was born in 1994.

1914
01:43:01,620 --> 01:43:05,860
And there's a section on the Wikipedia page labeled childhood and youth.

1915
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:15,380
And it's like all, all of it, please tell me, still current, current to now, still youth.

1916
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:16,740
He's still childhood and youth.

1917
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:23,700
If the Bieber's youth is behind him, I am a decrepit old, I'm like the Crip Keeper right now.

1918
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:26,020
I can't even keep my limbs on.

1919
01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:27,380
It's like death becomes her.

1920
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:31,220
Like shit's falling off my body if the Bieber's youth is behind him.

1921
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:34,340
Yeah, but now that he's legal, it's like, ew, gross.

1922
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:35,220
Gross, right.

1923
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:43,140
Well, I think youth technically ends when you like fuck a 35 year old woman in,

1924
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:45,540
during your tour in Germany.

1925
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:47,700
Like it doesn't matter if you're 13 years old.

1926
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:49,300
Did that happen?

1927
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:50,180
Come on.

1928
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:51,220
Okay, you're right.

1929
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:52,980
I don't follow the blogs.

1930
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:55,380
What are those new directions kids into?

1931
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:56,260
One Direction?

1932
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:58,980
I don't understand how female attraction works.

1933
01:43:58,980 --> 01:43:59,480
Okay.

1934
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:01,620
I was just sitting here thinking about it.

1935
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:09,620
But it's unthinkable to me that there are people who looked at Justin Bieber and were like,

1936
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:14,420
he's fucking got it going on handsomeness sexy wise.

1937
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:23,220
You know, Griff, I bet a lot of that is like that he is possibly the least threatening person

1938
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:25,300
to have ever existed in the world ever.

1939
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:26,520
Yeah.

1940
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:29,060
You're just saying that because you've never seen Never Say Never.

1941
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:31,700
You don't know how hard he is.

1942
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:36,020
And saying stuff like that just completely undermines your case, Griffin.

1943
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:41,540
When he plays basketball with his friends back in Canada, because he is Canadian.

1944
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:42,040
Right.

1945
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:44,660
When he's playing Canadian basketball-

1946
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:46,500
And writing songs about how he beat Shaq.

1947
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:52,900
When he's writing songs about the party that he threw at his house that he got grounded for

1948
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:56,900
and his older brother Nick is like just killing it in 98 degrees.

1949
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:58,180
Is that what the band he was in?

1950
01:44:58,180 --> 01:45:00,900
Yes. Which one died? LFO.

1951
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:04,100
All of LFO died?

1952
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:09,140
Not all of LFO, but the only one you'd recognize on the street.

1953
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:09,640
F.

1954
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,700
F died.

1955
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:14,660
I love girls that wear black. It's please. It's a funeral.

1956
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:18,500
Was that LFO?

1957
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:20,580
Yeah. I love girls wear...

1958
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:24,740
Guys, Justin Bieber is done.

1959
01:45:24,740 --> 01:45:27,860
I was just thinking about it, did some Google image searching, he's done.

1960
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:29,780
He's fucking, he's gross.

1961
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:31,300
Don't make me look at him anymore.

1962
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:33,140
You're over it? Over the babes?

1963
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:34,580
He's got crow's feet.

1964
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:35,060
It does he?

1965
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:36,260
Who needs that?

1966
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:38,500
Well, he's been a necklace made of crow's feet.

1967
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:41,380
He's been under a lot of stress.

1968
01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:43,140
He's like the most famous person.

1969
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:45,700
Do you know how hard that is to deal with?

1970
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:50,660
I hear during his latest concert when he did Somebody to Love and then like the tour manager

1971
01:45:50,660 --> 01:45:53,860
goes out in the audience and brings a girl up on the stage to be his special someone

1972
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:57,540
and he like gives her the rose and like dances around her like he does at every concert.

1973
01:45:57,540 --> 01:45:59,620
I heard the last concert that he did that out.

1974
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:02,980
He gave the girl the rose and she was like, no.

1975
01:46:04,180 --> 01:46:06,820
And she threw it back in his face and it poked one of his eyes out.

1976
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:08,180
And now he has one eye.

1977
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:12,660
And he's a lot less attractive because he looks like he's always winking.

1978
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:14,100
Hey.

1979
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:16,260
Justin Bieber, here's a question for you.

1980
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:19,780
Does Bieber have to die young?

1981
01:46:19,780 --> 01:46:26,260
Now, hear me out if Bieber Bieber can't do anything for the rest of his life.

1982
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:31,060
That is not exactly this like by the very virtue that Bieber will age.

1983
01:46:31,860 --> 01:46:35,540
He can no longer be Bieber as we have come to think of him.

1984
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:41,060
Does sure is the right plan of attack for a him to like disappear for five years and

1985
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:44,340
then come back hard like five o'clock shadow.

1986
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:49,140
So, you know, I've been through some stuff, maybe some light cursing on his album.

1987
01:46:50,260 --> 01:46:57,780
Is that is that like he needs to like pupate for a while and enter a beautiful chrysalis

1988
01:46:57,780 --> 01:47:00,660
and come out Justin Timberlake, start up his acting career, maybe.

1989
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:02,660
Yeah, that's where this terminate.

1990
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:07,860
I would also like to propose a witness relocation program for aging child stars

1991
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:11,620
and like change his name, become a substitute teacher in Utah.

1992
01:47:11,620 --> 01:47:12,980
Mm hmm.

1993
01:47:12,980 --> 01:47:14,980
Hi, I'm I'm your teacher, Jorsten Blaber.

1994
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:17,860
Today, we're going to talk about social studies.

1995
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:19,860
I'm going to bring one of you girls like a 10 year old girl.

1996
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:24,900
I'm going to bring one of you girls up from here to make you my special someone.

1997
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:28,180
And you have to give your oral report on Custer's last stand.

1998
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:28,500
Get it.

1999
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:31,380
Are we done?

2000
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:32,980
I hope so.

2001
01:47:32,980 --> 01:47:35,780
I can't say anything else 20 minutes ago.

2002
01:47:35,780 --> 01:47:40,340
Yeah, I don't know any other things to say except to say thank you guys.

2003
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:46,500
Thank you guys so much for hanging out with us like through all these years and two years,

2004
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:47,780
I guess not all these years.

2005
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:52,420
It was like some years, but all these both years, all these both years you guys have been here

2006
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:55,460
and you've been listening to us talk about utter nonsense.

2007
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:58,580
And please don't get on Twitter like this episode was whack.

2008
01:47:58,580 --> 01:48:02,340
I don't know if we were aware.

2009
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:02,980
We're aware.

2010
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:04,580
Like we talked for two hours.

2011
01:48:04,580 --> 01:48:07,940
Like at some point, this just becomes like hanging.

2012
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:11,220
We're just hanging.

2013
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:15,380
We did this to prove a point so that you guys wouldn't ask for extra long episodes anymore.

2014
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:17,460
This is an object lesson.

2015
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:21,060
This is a tough love episode of my brother and me.

2016
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:22,260
Do you think we enjoyed this?

2017
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:22,900
We didn't.

2018
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:23,300
Did not.

2019
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:23,620
We did.

2020
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:24,900
We did it because we love you.

2021
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:25,700
Yep.

2022
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:28,580
We're trying to teach you a lesson that you'll never forget.

2023
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:29,780
I'm actually sleepy.

2024
01:48:29,780 --> 01:48:33,380
I'm like, yeah, you're like all your goof energy has been depleted.

2025
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:35,220
You need to go have a hamburger and just chill out.

2026
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:39,300
Get a protein shake and just beer Pilates.

2027
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:41,220
Head to the cool off tent.

2028
01:48:43,540 --> 01:48:44,420
Drink some OJ.

2029
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:47,060
Put my head between my knees.

2030
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:48,740
Just like find my center again.

2031
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:53,620
Guys, I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song.

2032
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:55,620
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

2033
01:48:56,260 --> 01:49:00,500
They just announced on the Max Funcon lineup that he's going to be doing a panel.

2034
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:02,340
I believe at Max Funcon, which I am.

2035
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:04,980
He's doing a panel and I'm doing a panic attack as a result.

2036
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:05,540
Like I can't.

2037
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:06,100
Yeah.

2038
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:06,900
Can I handle it?

2039
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:12,420
I know it's been six days since we mentioned it, but I also wanted to say if you haven't

2040
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:15,860
yet, if you haven't stopped this stupid podcast, go check it out.

2041
01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:17,220
Go check out the cast of Thrones.

2042
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:19,300
They were sponsored this week.

2043
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:21,620
You probably forgotten about it, but they're awesome.

2044
01:49:21,620 --> 01:49:23,620
Well, they're good to go listen to them.

2045
01:49:23,620 --> 01:49:25,460
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

2046
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:35,860
Nor Rockwell, Gali Ayali, of course, as always, Christian Nobano, Joanna Eleven, Action Allen,

2047
01:49:35,860 --> 01:49:41,860
Kambo Soup, Jerez1985, Law and Order PCP.

2048
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:47,700
Thank you guys so much for all your support over these two years.

2049
01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:52,180
And the only reason people are listening to the show is because you, you know, you're

2050
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:57,060
the only reason people are listening to the show is because you told other people about

2051
01:49:57,060 --> 01:49:57,220
it.

2052
01:49:57,220 --> 01:50:03,140
So please don't stop that as we go into our third year and our second hundred episodes.

2053
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:08,260
We can actually, because we are brothers, can never stop doing this podcast.

2054
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:12,820
So as long as people keep listening to it, that would be ideal because we really can't

2055
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:13,620
stop.

2056
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:13,860
Yeah.

2057
01:50:14,420 --> 01:50:20,980
Thank you to Jesse and all of our family members at Maximum Fun.

2058
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:24,100
It's it's it's an honor to be a part of this.

2059
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:30,340
It seriously that was joining this network was a I think that's the best thing that happened

2060
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:32,580
to us in the last hundred episodes.

2061
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:32,820
Yeah.

2062
01:50:32,820 --> 01:50:36,580
Or or the last, you know, 30 years of all of our lives.

2063
01:50:37,140 --> 01:50:43,700
Thank you to our dad for teaching us, making us born, taking us about Chuckles at a young

2064
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:43,860
age.

2065
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:46,660
He was a stern taskmaster when it came to goofs.

2066
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:49,780
And the one thing he told us to never do was to record for more than two hours.

2067
01:50:49,780 --> 01:50:54,660
And yet here you so much to our dad for allowing us to spring forth from his loins.

2068
01:50:55,620 --> 01:50:59,940
It is a complicated and fully grown, fully grown.

2069
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:00,340
I can't.

2070
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:04,340
Is this that's that's pretty gross.

2071
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:05,620
I'm so sleepy here.

2072
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:07,780
I just want the show to be over.

2073
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:09,700
Griffin, you're the only one with power to make it stop.

2074
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:10,900
Please thank everybody.

2075
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:11,460
Thank you.

2076
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:12,580
Thank you so much, guys.

2077
01:51:12,580 --> 01:51:13,540
Seriously.

2078
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:14,740
And thank you for all that money.

2079
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:16,580
I just don't know what you do.

2080
01:51:16,580 --> 01:51:17,940
It's sweet, sweet money.

2081
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:19,220
God, I'm so rich.

2082
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:19,620
Griffin.

2083
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:20,500
I bought a Taco Bell.

2084
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:22,420
I bought a Taco Bell restaurant.

2085
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:23,300
I bought a taco.

2086
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:26,820
So our split may be off.

2087
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:28,580
This one is sent in by Lisa Holifield.

2088
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:29,780

01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:34,660
You our shows would be like half as long without without your questions.

2091
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:34,980
Thank you.

2092
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:38,580
