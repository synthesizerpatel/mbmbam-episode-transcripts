1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,960
Uh, welcome my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,960
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,880
I'm your sweet, sweetest candy pie baby brother Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,280
All right, this is the birthday episode. Well, we already did. We did that.

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,080
No, no, we're, well, this episode we're recapping the birthday.

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,840
Oh, that'll be, that'll be fun for me again for the second week in a row.

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,080
Fun for me and applicable and fun.

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,040
Uh, I have, I cannot tell you how buckwild it has gotten in the mailbox,

13
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,760
in the, in the McElroy brothers and my brother and me mailbox.

14
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:27,360
We got, uh, a, a, a magazine from Galiayali and a Mad Libs book and $15 in stone cold cash.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,240
Like we shouldn't be paying her. Yeah. Just like five, three, $5 bills in an envelope.

16
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,200
Oh my God. It's like a meemaw present. Is Galiayali, has she secretly been our memes

17
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,880
this whole time? She's been our meemaw.

18
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,800
I have one picture of a, of a guy dressed like a pharmacist

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,080
and on the back it has the words pill monkey scared written on it.

20
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,400
Okay.

21
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:56,080
So that's cool. Got a watch out for fireballs, uh, uh, postcard or a podcast.

22
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,120
Uh, wait, the podcast is called watch out.

23
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,680
Watch out for fireballs.

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,600
And they sent you this as a gift?

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,680
A postcard. Yeah. Uh, an ad maybe. Maybe they just tricked me.

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,720
Oh, damn it.

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:14,320
Joshua noise sent us anthrax, uh, by which I mean the greatest hits of anthrax.

28
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,440
Oh God. I think I would rather just have the anthrax.

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,360
Um, oh, we got a wedding invitation.

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,480
Oh, anywhere close by to any of the places that we live?

31
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,120
No, this is to Chicago.

32
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,040
I'd go back to Chicago for a wedding.

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,600
Okay. Well you can, you can go see Kristen Kotowski get married to Alistair Stewart.

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,320
This wedding invite is gorgeous. I wish you guys could see it.

35
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,680
What's the font? What kind of font are we wearing?

36
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,320
Would they go with a syrup? No, I mean it is completely decorated in literally dozens of

37
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,960
different typographies. It's a gorgeous, gorgeous document.

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,560
Are there any gemstones imbued in the, in the, in the paper?

39
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,280
Not as such.

40
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,160
What would you say is the net worth of this wedding invitation?

41
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,720
$13,000. Joe Robson sent me a Pepsi man, uh, action figure.

42
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,360
Oh my God.

43
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,400
And we got Adam, uh, and what looks like Scrans, uh, Mickelson.

44
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,240
That's not a real name.

45
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,160
Sent us a picture, uh, a Grand Canyon, uh, postcard.

46
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,960
And my man, Tommy Fix, sent us Space Jam, a novelization.

47
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,840
This is a brand spanking new copy direct from Amazon, so I don't know.

48
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,760
Okay. Is that book still in print?

49
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,160
Yes. Apparently that book is still in print.

50
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,000
Here's a picture of, uh, 17 babies butts.

51
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,760
Uh, and it says you deserve a 14 bun salute.

52
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,920
And it turns out this is a birthday card from my nanny.

53
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,640
So I should not say I'm sorry about that.

54
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,920
So as long as we're doing a mail call, I got a postcard today or yesterday,

55
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,440
cause mail doesn't typically run on Sundays in the United States of America.

56
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,400
Not as such.

57
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,960
Um, and it has the lead singer of Korn on it, his face.

58
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:09,520
And it says, come hear a motivational speech about the story of the lead singer of Korn.

59
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,640
And I turned it over and it's for a nearby church.

60
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,080
So that's something that I absolutely have to go to, right?

61
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,600
That is non, that is something they've written about him, like fan fiction

62
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,560
about the lead singer of Korn that would really motivate you.

63
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,960
I think that there probably is a preacher somewhere in Austin, Texas,

64
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,040
who has motivational fanfic that they wrote about Korn band members.

65
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,120
Real quick question.

66
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,040
Has any of this been entertaining so far?

67
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,920
It's hard to say, but that's not really my problem.

68
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,080
No, no, it's our birthday month, but that's not important anymore.

69
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,240
Oh, that's not bullshit.

70
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,120
All that's bullshit.

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,200
The only thing I care about is helping people.

72
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,360
You know, that's my thing.

73
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,560
That's where I'm at.

74
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,800
I want to advise people with their problems.

75
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,840
So here's a question from them and then we'll answer it

76
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,760
and see if they're maybe, if not better off, at least not worse.

77
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,800
I like to write a little in my free time.

78
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,920
I'm not super good at it and I'm not trying to get published,

79
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,520
but I have an overactive imagination.

80
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,680
So it seems like a good way to burn off thoughts in my head.

81
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,160
That's nice imagery.

82
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,960
I recently found a good friend of mine also writes for similar reasons.

83
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,600
I've always wanted a writing buddy

84
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,480
where we can both sit down for a week or something and write.

85
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,680
No, sorry, sorry.

86
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,400
Sit down for an hour a week or something and write.

87
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,960
I just want to just come into this sweat lodge.

88
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
We're going to go in a can of writing.

89
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,840
Got a lot of canned food.

90
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,600
We don't have any food or water or anything.

91
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,560
There is nowhere to poop.

92
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,880
Please do not in our sweat lodge.

93
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,280
Turn your phone on silent.

94
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,640
What are you doing?

95
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,880
We are in the sweat lodge of advice right now.

96
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,200
How can you take those kinds of distractions?

97
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,760
I can't.

98
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,440
I'm completely out of the mix.

99
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,120
I don't know what we were talking about.

100
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,320
I don't know.

101
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,120
It was so inconsiderate of dad to text me

102
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,280
to tell me that I have holes in my fantasy football lineup.

103
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,600
Anyway, if we ran into a wall,

104
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,200
we could bounce ideas off each other.

105
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,560
Is this a good idea?

106
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,080
How do I suggest this to my friend

107
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,920
without sounding like I'm pressuring them

108
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,960
or sounding like a dick?

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,760
Fitzgerald, Seeking Hemingway.

110
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,640
First, I suggest not starting off with

111
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,240
I'm not super good at it.

112
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,600
Yeah.

113
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,080
Can I?

114
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,800
Yeah.

115
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,840
Here's a good suggestion.

116
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,440
Go find a new thing that you are actually super good at.

117
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,480
Maybe?

118
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,080
Like, I just want you to start from as high a point as you best.

119
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,040
That is the biggest thing of success is showing up

120
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,920
and being good at the thing that you want to do already.

121
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,400
I think that writing is intensely personal.

122
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,000
For me, it's like a poetry.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,120
It's like writing poetry.

124
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,400
Writing is like writing.

125
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,080
Writing books is like writing poetry.

126
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,880
For me, putting words on paper is like writing.

127
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,800
I've always likened poetry to like writing a song without music in it.

128
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,240
God, that's beautiful.

129
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
That is some lovely imagery.

130
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,200
So like if I said like,

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,600
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over.

132
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,480
I want to know right now what will it be?

133
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,920
And then there's a question mark on it instead of a period.

134
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,400
Whoa, whoa, I like that.

135
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,200
And that's, I can say that's mine because I didn't sing it.

136
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,000
You see what I'm saying?

137
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,280
I think that if you go to someone and lay out this plan for them,

138
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,600
it runs a risk of being the weirdest thing they've ever heard.

139
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,480
I really think-

140
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,400
Like I know that this happens in real life.

141
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Like there are lots of writing teams over the years that have like come together

142
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,040
and they have written books together and plays together

143
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,680
and musicals together and like comedy bits together.

144
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,520
But it always, whenever you hear the story of it or read a memoir about it,

145
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,920
it's always so organic and it's like-

146
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,040
That's the thing, right?

147
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,600
Organic.

148
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,040
Here's what you need to do.

149
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,240
You need to go to and say,

150
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,560
hey, I've been writing something.

151
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,480
Would love to get the feedback on it and see what you think.

152
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,200
And then after they're done reading it, they give you their feedback.

153
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,800
You just stand there and they're out.

154
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,560
And then you say,

155
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,680
is there anything you would like to show me?

156
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,520
And then you wait and wait and wait and do not leave the room

157
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,360
until you have words in your hand that they've written for your adjudication.

158
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,760
I also think, not trying to pass judgment, but I am,

159
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,360
that it's a little bit weird proposition,

160
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,760
especially considering there's no end goal

161
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,560
and you're not trying to do anything with it.

162
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,640
Just saying like, we should get together.

163
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,080
They want to grow as writers.

164
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,400
What's wrong?

165
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,760
They want to waste two people's time simultaneously.

166
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,200
It's not trying to grow as writers because you don't have an end goal.

167
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,400
You just want to burn off excess creativity.

168
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,200
Why can't you just be good at writing, Travis?

169
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,680
I play bocce ball to burn off my excess energy

170
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,200
and I would love to be better at that.

171
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,480
No, what I'm saying is that if you go to this person and say,

172
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,760
I want to grow as a writer and I'd love to share ideas

173
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,080
and bounce it back and forth and give each other notes.

174
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,280
But if you just go to them and say, I have a bunch of extra creativity,

175
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,480
let's talk about it.

176
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,120
Help me purge.

177
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,280
Justin, do you bocce to burn off the thoughts in your head?

178
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,240
Is that what you just said?

179
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,640
Yeah, when I'm angry or it's been a long day at the bank,

180
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,400
where I work, I just go home and I bocce.

181
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,560
Justin is actually incapable of dreaming,

182
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,840
so instead he must funnel his dreams through bocce ball.

183
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,000
My dreams are funneled through bocce ball.

184
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,400
So I just, I go out to the field or the ring or the rink

185
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,520
or the course and he's got a bocce to feel.

186
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,480
I roll or toss.

187
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,360
Is there anything you don't have in common with Cliff Huxtable?

188
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,760
Tell me right now.

189
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,560
Sandwiches?

190
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,280
Check.

191
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,160
Gynecology?

192
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,040
Check.

193
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm not going to fucking sell out to Jell-O.

194
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,120
That's for god damn sure.

195
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,400
Big gelatin is going to keep their hands off my uterus.

196
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,640
Justin's always been custard or nothing.

197
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,520
Custard or nothing, that's my jam.

198
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,720
Hey, real quick.

199
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,480
If we could go, I don't know how long we're going to keep doing the show.

200
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,840
I think we've got at least another 10 episodes in us,

201
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,640
but if we could just go without saying the words gelatin and uterus in the same breath.

202
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,960
It sounds fine.

203
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,200
Yeah, I'd say 10 episodes tops.

204
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,400
But you got to let this, this cannot be a relationship that you pitch.

205
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,880
It's got to be something that you develop.

206
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,840
Start small.

207
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,280
Don't try to say, hey, I would like us to have a writing relationship that

208
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,520
lasts for years and is super productive and helps us both grow as writers.

209
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,760
You just got to say, you got to start at normal.

210
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,560
You know what I mean?

211
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,240
That would be like proposing marriage to the lady at the bank.

212
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,440
Like just say, you know, start at the ground level.

213
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,760
If you introduce this level of formality into it,

214
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
then you're going to have to lay down all kinds of ground rules.

215
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,440
If it's organic, then you know what you're getting into.

216
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,840
But if you have to like write up a constitution for how this thing's going to work,

217
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,480
then you have to be like, you know, I don't want to read your sci-fi erotica.

218
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,520
Like just off the jump.

219
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,480
Like I don't want that.

220
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
If it's got slash fic in it anywhere.

221
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,000
Mm hmm. If you write today show slash fic, I would like to read that.

222
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,640
Yeah, because what if it's like just like the Citizen Kane of slash fic

223
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,720
or Citizen Kane slash fiction.

224
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,600
Al Roker takes out everything.

225
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,720
He gets everything.

226
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,760
You get to see his whole.

227
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,480
It's all out.

228
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,240
You get to see his whole tackle box.

229
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,640
Well, if Scott dials up his list of 100 year old perverts

230
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:50,800
and he calls them over for sex, old smucker sex.

231
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,200
And then Ann Curry's like, how could you do this to me?

232
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,920
Jilted lover Ann Curry returns.

233
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,560
Do you think?

234
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,400
Yeah.

235
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,040
Do you?

236
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,880
You know what I'm about to ask, right?

237
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,240
I know who you're at.

238
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,800
Everyone on today show is secretly fucking, right?

239
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,400
Yeah.

240
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,080
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

241
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,280
When he's like from the moment Roker's like,

242
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,640
that's what's happening in the in our country.

243
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,640
Here's what's happening in your neck of the wood.

244
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,400
He's on that moment.

245
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,320
He's like reaching for the zipper to start blasting.

246
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,400
He's like, get the blasting caps.

247
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,840
I'm going to the sex mine.

248
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,440
I have maybe 45 seconds.

249
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,400
Well, I line up the holes.

250
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,000
It's time to play some Roker poker.

251
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,560
Come over here.

252
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:43,920
Hold on.

253
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,360
Hold on.

254
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,240
Matt Lauer.

255
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,760
Bring your bring your weird leukemia head over here.

256
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,240
Matt Lauer.

257
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,120
I want to blast into it.

258
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,280
Matt Lauer used to look so good and healthy.

259
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,480
What happened?

260
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,080
You'd see that full of the Olympics.

261
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,520
Like, is he competing?

262
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,200
God damn.

263
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,800
He looked fantastic.

264
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,840
He looked fantastic.

265
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,080
I think I think it's like we have like a portrait

266
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,720
of Dorian Gray scenario between Roker and Lauer

267
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,600
because one is looking hundo percent better

268
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,520
and the other one is just shriveling.

269
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,440
Roker's looking fantastic.

270
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Like Darth Palpatus or whatever.

271
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,480
Yeah, Lauer looks like he keeps sneaking peeks

272
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,840
at the Ark of the Covenant.

273
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,280
He's not looking at it full blast.

274
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,840
He's taking little sips out of the wrong grail.

275
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,960
Right, just a little just wetness whistle with that.

276
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,240
Fuck, why are we so mean to people we've never met?

277
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,000
Because we keep hoping that we will meet them

278
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,600
and they'll at least know who we are.

279
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,520
That's all like, that's all, that's my dream.

280
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,800
You guys want a yahoo?

281
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,640
I've always wanted Matt Lauer to just yell at me

282
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,760
across the crowded bar.

283
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,000
Hey, fuck you!

284
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,880
You guys want a yahoo?

285
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,680
Yeah.

286
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,240
God, I have so many good ones.

287
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,520
Thank you everyone who sent them in.

288
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,200
Please keep it up.

289
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,480
It was such a joy to read these.

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,240
This yahoo was sent in by John Tabler.

291
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,040
Thank you, John.

292
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,120
It's by yahoo answers user, Vela OK, who asks,

293
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,600
what does it take to start up a new cemetery?

294
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,400
Commitment.

295
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,520
I guess.

296
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,360
Business is going to be good.

297
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,080
I predict more people are going to be dying all the time.

298
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,480
Yup.

299
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,400
I want to offer.

300
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,200
Bold.

301
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,040
Nice one, Nostradamus.

302
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,920
I want to offer preservative free burials

303
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,840
so the body decomposes faster and gets back to being fertilizer ASAP.

304
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,960
I love that.

305
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,520
I love that.

306
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,640
And what a great trail.

307
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,360
It's pretty green.

308
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:35,680
Listen, let's.

309
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,560
So big on that.

310
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,280
Right off the jump.

311
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,640
Let's say everyone's going to die.

312
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,840
Could be today, could be tomorrow, but it's definitely one of those two.

313
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,720
It is today.

314
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,840
It's either today or tomorrow.

315
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,000
Yeah, everybody.

316
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,400
That's true.

317
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,080
This is a booming business because like, have you been to a cemetery?

318
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,520
Have you ever been to a cemetery and been like, oh, this is so spacious?

319
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,320
No, you haven't.

320
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,280
No, you haven't.

321
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,320
You know, this is a good point, though, because there are many cemeteries.

322
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,200
But at the beginning, you're just going to be that guy that buried a body in his yard.

323
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,680
You know, it's very hard to do this homegrown.

324
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,160
It's very hard to do a grassroots.

325
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,440
You don't see a lot of cemetery startups.

326
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:17,840
Right.

327
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,720
Yeah, it's a.

328
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,880
Just a man and a shovel.

329
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,600
Completely.

330
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:28,800
Going really good, we've moved from a from single hidden corpse to sort of a level,

331
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,320
I would say, tantamount to an Indian burial ground right now.

332
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,840
OK, so here's the thought I just had.

333
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,800
Let me throw this out.

334
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,000
OK, what?

335
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,640
Think of like a food truck, but instead it was like a crematorium on wheels.

336
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:48,880
Travis, if you if you took that show, if you took that show on the fucking road here in Austin,

337
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,520
you would be a quadrillionaire.

338
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,200
Everyone would want to die with you.

339
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,600
This is what I'm saying.

340
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,160
Oh, my God.

341
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,920
And you know, Travis just said that as a joke.

342
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,440
But and but like before this episode's over, he's going to get a harried phone call from DLC.

343
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,480
Listen, I want to do it.

344
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,520
I call as fast as I could.

345
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,920
Your dad, while you do it, just fight, fight with your old fat dad and please.

346
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,080
Can you hire some stupid guy?

347
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,560
Please, please, please hire a dumb guy.

348
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,760
And fight with your old dad.

349
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,440
I was just thinking about it.

350
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,240
It probably wouldn't succeed in Austin because everybody in Austin is like 22 years old.

351
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,680
I think if anyone ever died, if anyone ever died in Austin, it would be like Logan's run.

352
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,560
Like, what?

353
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,200
What?

354
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,480
Why isn't he moving?

355
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,200
This is weird.

356
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,440
Yo, Tyler, wake up.

357
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,320
Here's a PBR.

358
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,080
Come on.

359
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,000
There's a concert in two minutes.

360
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,840
Tyler, God, he's sleepy.

361
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,240
Let's turn him into a Wi-Fi hotspot.

362
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,200
Holy shit.

363
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,560
That could be your business.

364
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,320
Is there any, any cemetery with Wi-Fi in it?

365
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,040
Probably not.

366
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,880
Probably not.

367
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,760
This is what Pop Harm would have wanted.

368
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,760
He would have wanted me to sit here and browse my sites.

369
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,560
Browse my sites?

370
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,480
I'm Instagramming your grave site.

371
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,040
Do you like it?

372
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,080
Sites, we'll call it sites and grave sites.

373
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,840
I came to put some flowers on here.

374
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,080
Instead, I'm going to grow some flowers in Farmville.

375
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,800
I love you, Pop.

376
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,840
I love you, Pop Pop.

377
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,640
You're 22.

378
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,760
What would you call your truck

379
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,280
that drove around the city and let people put dead bodies in it?

380
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,120
What would you, what would you call that?

381
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,960
I was, I've been sitting here trying to think of a way

382
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,560
to play Nash Bridges, like sort of like Ash Bridges.

383
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,440
And I like to-

384
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:43,920
Burnin' Rubber.

385
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,240
Burnin' Rubber is not bad.

386
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,720
It's not bad.

387
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,200
I, what, would you have music?

388
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,680
Like when, like, like an ice cream truck?

389
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,240
Yeah, right.

390
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,720
Exactly.

391
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,080
No, I think you would go, want to go classy.

392
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,040
I think like, hit it with Don't Fear the Reaper

393
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,480
or maybe Wider Shade of Pale or maybe Frankenstein.

394
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,920
Oh, Frankenstein would be good.

395
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,400
All your corpses here.

396
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,920
We turn them into fuel.

397
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:17,280
It's, I think-

398
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
What if that truck ran on the body?

399
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,000
That's what I'm saying.

400
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,400
That's energy for the truck.

401
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,840
And then you call, it's totally green.

402
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,840
Oh man, well.

403
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,160
When you give your loved one over to the loving care of Burnin' Rubber,

404
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,200
first of all, sorry for the Frankenstein.

405
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,240
We are a completely green company with no overhead

406
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,360
and rest assured that your loved one will get us down

407
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,480
to like the corner.

408
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,040
We do need to pick up someone every 20 feet.

409
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,640
Yes, this is going to require a lot of corpses.

410
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,720
So if you've been holding on to them for a while,

411
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,400
that's probably not legal.

412
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,360
And for every corpse that you pay us to burn,

413
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,840
we'll burn the corpse of a needy child somewhere in Africa.

414
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,440
So it's sort of, yeah, it's really nice actually.

415
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,760
It's, I'm so glad Tom's got into that.

416
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,680
We offer a corpse for corpse guarantee.

417
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,480
How do you open?

418
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,120
I'm sitting here, it's a real noodle scratcher.

419
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,080
How do you-

420
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,960
There's got to be an extensive permit process, right?

421
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,680
More importantly though,

422
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,600
you've got to have like a pretty big install base from the get-go, right?

423
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,120
Like you've got to have like 20 corpses at the start.

424
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,920
Well, I bet the toughest part is convincing the first person.

425
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,800
Right, that's what I'm saying.

426
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
You can't just have the first person.

427
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,000
You have to have, they don't want to be lonely in the ground.

428
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,800
You know what I mean?

429
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,160
You got to have like 20 people like to start out.

430
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,800
You got to, there has to be like-

431
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,400
At least enough to keep dogs out.

432
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
There has to be like a train crash.

433
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,040
And then you're like, this is my moment, you know?

434
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,960
I bet though, it's just like when you open like a new condo or something

435
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,000
and you're like, everybody wants to get in on the ground floor

436
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,640
and like you want to, everybody wants under the trees, you know?

437
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,040
Yeah.

438
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,960
Everybody wants to get the spot under the tree.

439
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,520
Yes.

440
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,080
Sure.

441
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,040
God, it doesn't matter.

442
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,200
None of this fucking matters.

443
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,600
Ugh, just leave me in the alley.

444
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,400
Just prop me up beside that jukebox.

445
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,240
Is there a commercial option in the mainland United States

446
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,160
for a Tibetan sky burial?

447
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,520
Is that an option?

448
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,280
Cover me in honey, leave me on a mountain.

449
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,640
Let the birds deal with it.

450
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,960
Fly me into the sky so I can be closer to Jizu.

451
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,560
Everybody read fucking Stiff by Mary Roach.

452
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:28,800
Yeah.

453
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,080
Stop asking about dead people and just read Stiff.

454
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,520
Just friend of the show, Mary Roach.

455
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,880
Dissolve yourself and pour yourself like in a gutter somewhere.

456
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,080
It doesn't matter.

457
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,120
You're just eat honey for like 18 days or whatever

458
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,960
and then die for a while in some honey

459
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,360
and then have people eat you to heal themselves.

460
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,160
Is that a real thing?

461
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,680
Yeah, it's in Stiff.

462
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:48,800
Ugh.

463
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,760
It's cadaver candy.

464
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Stiff is an appropriate name for that book.

465
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,240
Ugh, did you have an erection?

466
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,280
Because of the erection I have, I'm thinking of eating a dead honey man.

467
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,760
And I mean, honey woman.

468
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,640
Shit, is that gay?

469
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,480
You know how I want to go?

470
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,760
I want you to melt me in that stuff from Iframe Roger Rabbit.

471
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Hey Dylan, I finally listened to that podcast you recommended.

472
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,280
Oh yeah?

473
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,920
What did you think?

474
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,520
Well, for the first 15 minutes, they talked about things they got in the mail.

475
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,640
For their birthdays.

476
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,480
They talked about presents they'd receive.

477
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,160
And then they talked about death for 20 minutes

478
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,280
and then I hung myself.

479
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,240
I'm a ghost, Dylan.

480
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,600
Hi Dylan.

481
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,160
And you said they talked about like dildos or something,

482
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,520
but they didn't like electric dildos every week?

483
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,640
They didn't do that.

484
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,920
They talked about Cliff Huxtable and then I killed myself.

485
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,440
Yeah, but you know the one part I did like?

486
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,040
Was the money zone.

487
00:21:47,040 --> 00:22:02,080
I want to tell you guys about ussflagship.com.

488
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,000
They have, first and foremost, of all of our corporate sponsors,

489
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,720
the best call to arms I've ever seen.

490
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Travis, hit me with it because I think only you're going to be able to do justice.

491
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,200
Got it.

492
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,480
What's the call to action?

493
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,040
Well, check out ussflagship.com.

494
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,360
Read our stuff and then do your own thing.

495
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,400
Whatever it is.

496
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,680
Make your dreams come true.

497
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,180
Fuck.

498
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,460
Yeah.

499
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,200
Right?

500
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,640
That gets me so excited.

501
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,680
Guys, I've been waiting for the push I needed and this is it.

502
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,120
I'm opening my own cemetery.

503
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,520
The flagship will host your amateur cemetery.

504
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,320
Guess what it's called?

505
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,640
Cementary.

506
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,840
Cementary, because, because I, god, I fuck this.

507
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,400
I don't know.

508
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:46,720
Don't, don't.

509
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,200
It gets, there's.

510
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,920
No, you did your best.

511
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,840
Cum is involved somewhere.

512
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,560
Yeah, we've got, so there's everything.

513
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,600
I'm looking at the flagship and I'm seeing four or five things that I want to read right now.

514
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:08,240
There's a weekly recap of Dawn of the Dead from a foremost expert on the zombie apocalypse.

515
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,400
There's a, there's a ton of good stuff on here.

516
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,400
ussflagship.com and I always tell people, you know, if you're interested in writing,

517
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:23,040
if you want to forge a writing partnership with somebody else, why not do it on flagship?

518
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,320
So that way you don't have to see the person.

519
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,240
I think literally at the beginning of this episode, we said just stop writing,

520
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,640
which I think the good, good people, the captains of the flagship would be, would disapprove.

521
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah, so they have a website, ussflagship.com.

522
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,680
They also have a Twitter, ussflagship.

523
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,280
A lot of good stuff to read and more importantly, go do your thing there.

524
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,000
Go get busy, you know, get busy.

525
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,520
I have this saying that I came up with, get busy living or get busy dying.

526
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,840
I had this phrase I came up with and it's, get busy child.

527
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,760
And then behind it, there's like this bass is like,

528
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,800
and then I keep saying it like over and over again.

529
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,400
And then all of a sudden all these teens show up.

530
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,880
And they're on ecstasy and there's jumping up and down.

531
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,720
And the lights are going off and we're just like fucking tearing this warehouse apart.

532
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,040
I think I might be addicted to drugs.

533
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:26,000
I was saying that I came up with and it's, we're fighting for our right to live, to exist.

534
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,960
And should we win the day, the 4th of July will no longer be known as an American holiday.

535
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,360
But as the day when the world declared in one voice,

536
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,360
we will not go quietly into the night, we will not vanish without a fight.

537
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,240
We're going to live on.

538
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,680
We're going to survive.

539
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,680
Today, we celebrate our independence day.

540
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,040
Guys, where's the beef?

541
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,560
Got us again.

542
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,360
Is that something you came up with?

543
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,860
Got it.

544
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,120
I did get it.

545
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,800
You got it.

546
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,600
Get busy, child.

547
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
So go to ussflagship.com or follow them on Twitter.

548
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,400
Can I publish all those things I said?

549
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,880
Sorry?

550
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,560
Can I publish those things I said?

551
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,080
Like I want to find some way to profit off of get busy, child, and where's the beef?

552
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,880
But I don't know.

553
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,800
Tell you what, when you feel close to death, I'll visit you every Tuesday

554
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,880
and you just tell me all the smart shit that you know about.

555
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,280
Okay.

556
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,920
And then I'll publish it in a book, Tuesday with Ditto, and we'll both get rich.

557
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,000
I'll get rich, but I'll pay for it.

558
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,480
You'll be dead.

559
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,640
When you make someone rich and then you die, then that shit pays forward in heaven.

560
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,440
And I really hope I get to be there.

561
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,600
If one of the five people Mitch Alba meets in heaven is Maury.

562
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,480
I really hope he's there when Maury wants to slice.

563
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,760
What if it's not?

564
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,320
What if five people show up and Maury and Maury's like,

565
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,600
hey, Mitch, what's up?

566
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,680
I thought we had like a special thing around the middle of the week, Mitch.

567
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,360
Mitch, do you remember?

568
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,640
I remember, Mitch, I can watch your bank statements from heaven, Mitch.

569
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,080
Mitch, me and Jesus are very disappointed in you.

570
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,320
All that wise shit and you've been the one making the bank.

571
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,560
Maury.

572
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,720
Tuesdays with Maury.

573
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,560
His Mitch Alba's hell is he has to spend every Tuesday talking to that old cantankerous bag.

574
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:21,520
But Tuesday, Maury was a beautiful person and he taught me a lot,

575
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,240
but I should have given him more money.

576
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,400
I'm really sorry.

577
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,200
Maury.

578
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,040
If he hadn't been spending Wednesdays with Maury's wife, you know?

579
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,480
I hope the five people I meet in heaven are in sync.

580
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,000
Personally, personally speaking.

581
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,080
What about you guys?

582
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,200
The five people I meet in heaven?

583
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,320
Yeah.

584
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,920
I'm a BSB man.

585
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,840
You're BSB?

586
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,280
At least one of those guys is dead, right?

587
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,440
As far as I know, they're all dead.

588
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:55,920
Travis?

589
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:01,680
I would like to meet the four guys from 98 Degrees and only one of the guys from N-Sync,

590
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,360
but I'll leave that up to Jesus.

591
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,120
Which guy it is, Jesus?

592
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,080
I want to meet the entire cast and crew of the Red Green Show,

593
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,240
because I think that's probably five people.

594
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:17,280
Do you think that the N-Sync in heaven, they're just like fucking swamped with all these five

595
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,320
people appearances?

596
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:18,320
Oh yeah.

597
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:25,840
Oh yeah, like a teenager dies, they're like, oh god, god damn it.

598
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,120
And God's like, what?

599
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,160
And they're like, no.

600
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,520
And then he's like, get to work N-Sync, I brought you here for a reason.

601
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
Do you want to go to hell, like 98 Degrees?

602
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,000
You're on a work release program from hell.

603
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,480
Why are we getting so like, we are engaging with some like really serious death issues.

604
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,640
I feel like we're playing with the Ouija right now.

605
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,640
I feel like we've dipped into the Ouija and we're harnessing its power.

606
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
Hey, just real quick.

607
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,800
Can I change my five people?

608
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

609
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,800
Yeah, sure try.

610
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,840
Okay, because mine is going to be the five main characters from Entourage,

611
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,440
and I'm including Jeremy Pivot in there.

612
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,000
I like that.

613
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,600
Because my personal heaven is that they're all my Entourage.

614
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,720
And I don't mean the actors, I mean the characters.

615
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,560
Can I change?

616
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,640
Sorry, can I change mine again?

617
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:09,840
Yeah.

618
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,720
Okay, cool.

619
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,520
I want to go with the Affleck Duck and I want...

620
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,720
Wait, Gilbert Gottfried?

621
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
No, no, no, the actual Affleck Duck.

622
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,240
I think you said Affleck Duck, like Ben Affleck's Duck.

623
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,320
I want Ben Affleck's pet duck.

624
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,120
What about four Affleck Ducks and Ben Affleck?

625
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,440
Okay.

626
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,400
And you have to guess which one's which.

627
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,240
Frans, we want to take a moment to tell you about our best friend, Bob Ball.

628
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,120
He's a voiceover artist.

629
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,480
He's an entrepreneur.

630
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,440
I think I can say that.

631
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,320
He has a show called Pop Quizical that...

632
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,960
You know, so many podcasts take so much of your time.

633
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Like this one, for example.

634
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,160
And all you get in exchange is us.

635
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,280
A fucking hour of our lives that we've given to you as a fucking gift.

636
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,080
Three total man hours of our precious lives, you thankless thug.

637
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,400
Bob Ball is not as generous as we are.

638
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,920
His show is much shorter.

639
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,880
But it is a pretty great listen week in, week out.

640
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,960
You can find it at PopQuizical.com or you can find his own page at Bob Ball VO.

641
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,600
It's a trivia show that he hosts himself.

642
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,960
It's beautifully produced.

643
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,400
Had new topic every week.

644
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,360
The most recent is about profanity, which is a lot of fun.

645
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,480
It's fucking awesome.

646
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,240
It's fucking great.

647
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,800
Pussies!

648
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,800
He does a hint show every week and the show is great and it's a lot of fun.

649
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,440
And it's sort of a quick, a quick hit to cleanse the palette.

650
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,320
Just a little bump.

651
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,440
Just a little knowledge bump.

652
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:46,960
Just a hint.

653
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,160
I can stop whenever I want.

654
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,080
Even if you want to dip back to episode 20, there is...

655
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,600
My Brother, My Brother and Me is a topic.

656
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,400
I'll listen to you.

657
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,200
Listen, don't listen to the rest of the podcast.

658
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,880
Just listen to the bit that's about us.

659
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,240
Get out of your own asshole.

660
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,080
I didn't, I didn't mean that.

661
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,560
I'm sorry.

662
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,120
Number four.

663
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,160
The fourth one's about us.

664
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,000
Get out of your asshole.

665
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,440
Oh, sorry.

666
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,000
Go to Bob Ball VO or popquizzical.com.

667
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,520
Follow them on Twitter and enjoy the show.

668
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,240
I think you're really gonna like it.

669
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,120
If you hear, while listening to the podcast, a strange echo coming from Justin's audio source,

670
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,960
it's because he's inside his own asshole.

671
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,080
And it's cavernous and marbly in there.

672
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,800
Bob Ball VO.

673
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,520

674

Justin's.

675
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,840
Bob Ball VO Justin's Asshole.com.

676
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,120
Let's have another death question.

677
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,280
This was, Yahoo was sent in by Jacob Locker.

678
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,480
So you know it's gonna be good.

679
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,680
Thanks, Jacob.

680
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,600
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Philip, who asks,

681
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,400
how much would it cost to bronze my corpse when I die?

682
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,880
The first answer is exactly $32,988, I guess.

683
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
Is that including like all the, like the fees?

684
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,360
I like this idea so much.

685
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,680
For me, personally, let me tell you why.

686
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,440
Okay.

687
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:13,440
Just in case I ever do something awesome enough to merit a statue built in my honor,

688
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,400
it's like, pre-pro, you know what I mean?

689
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,440
Like, they don't have to worry about,

690
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,360
I would love to build this statue in Griffin's honor.

691
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,640
I would love to.

692
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,560
He was a very important figure for, insert, important reason here.

693
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,640
But I just don't know that we have the maintenance fees for it right now.

694
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,280
With this, I can say, don't even worry about it.

695
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,840
This is me, and maybe I'm standing up,

696
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,720
maybe I have a piece of pizza in my hand that I also bronzed,

697
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,960
and I'm giving like a hang 10 sign with my other hand.

698
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,320
So kind of a team shooting into the trails past each other.

699
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,840
Maybe a little, maybe a little TMNT, perhaps.

700
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,520
Maybe I have roller skates on.

701
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,360
Maybe the roller skates aren't bronzed.

702
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,080
Well, that's gonna create some tricky feet issues.

703
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,640
Well, that's gonna create some tricky feet issues.

704
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,000
I researched this topic a little bit beforehand,

705
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,360
because I like to bring an expert sort of flair,

706
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,800
I guess you could say, to the show.

707
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:14,080
And I stumbled on a forum where writers ask about things

708
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,400
that could happen in one of the stories that they're writing,

709
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,760
which is always like, basically the best.

710
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,400
Sure.

711
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,120
And Amy Ashley is in here asking if she can bronze a dead body.

712
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,320
She said, I've seen it done in another book,

713
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,800
but technically those bodies were vampires.

714
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,040
So I think that might have been fudge.

715
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,480
Well, I mean, that, okay.

716
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:34,880
So she-

717
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,560
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

718
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,920
Wait, let me finish here.

719
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,840
She has a few people saying that you need to make

720
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,960
a wax sculpture out of it and then bronze it.

721
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,080
And someone else says they think that bronze would melt the flesh.

722
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,840
And then Amy actually dips back in four questions down and says,

723
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,720
actually it isn't truly human, it's more of a fish,

724
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,880
a mermaid to be exact.

725
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,760
I would say definitely cold blooded.

726
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,480
Okay.

727
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,480
Well, that is gonna hold up under the pressure of vulcanized metal.

728
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,100
Right.

729
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,920
Is this something that you guys would be,

730
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,240
because we've never talked about like what we want to do

731
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,840
with and to each other when one of us passes away first, Travis?

732
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,920
Well, first and foremost,

733
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,480
I am bothered by the limitations of the question.

734
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,320
I don't understand why I have to wait to be dead to be bronzed.

735
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,280
Are you talking full bronzing or are you talking like a partial Tremaine?

736
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,200
Oh, I'm just saying like,

737
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,520
I feel like it would be very protective

738
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,160
if I could just go like toes to neck.

739
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,720
Okay.

740
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,720
You know, leave my head out there for all the important shit,

741
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,160
but just go toes to neck.

742
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,760
And so then I know I'm bait.

743
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,120
Wait, is bronze bulletproof?

744
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,000
It depends on how thick it is.

745
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,480
I can tell you this though.

746
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,320
It is poop and peep proof.

747
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,520
There's going to be some outlets.

748
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,880
I'm going to need some outlets cut.

749
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,680
Okay.

750
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,600
So basically what we're talking about is like a shitty Iron Man scenario.

751
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,760
I am Iron Man.

752
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,760
I'm fucking falling over.

753
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,240
Shit.

754
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,520
I landed on my dick outlet.

755
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,160
Fuck.

756
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,720
Help me.

757
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,520
Pepper Potts.

758
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,400
Help me.

759
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,480
I peed and pooped in my bronze suit again.

760
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,640
Watch me shoot my beams.

761
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,680
Oh, I don't have beams.

762
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,720
I'm just made of steel.

763
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,200
Fuck me.

764
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,480
Avengers assemble.

765
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,560
I pooped and peed in here a month ago.

766
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,200
Master.

767
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,080
Yes, Jarvis.

768
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,280
You smell like fucking piss on metal and I hate it.

769
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,840
I'm leaving.

770
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,240
I'm an AI and I hate it.

771
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm deleting myself because of how bad your pee metal smell smells.

772
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,000
I like that Travis is concerned about it being bulletproof

773
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
as if anyone would ever want to shoot a robot.

774
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,560
Travis, you have to worry about it being bulletproof

775
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,400
because I'm saying a week and a half in.

776
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,320
You're going to be like, fucking kill me.

777
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:03,680
Yeah.

778
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,600
Okay, Justin, I want to jump back.

779
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,480
You're going to turn yourself into a- No, if there's any gun-toting criminal

780
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,000
that walks in because there's a man covered in metal, surely he's a robot.

781
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,760
That man doesn't deserve to be mad at me because he's an idiot.

782
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,640
I am not a robot.

783
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,520
I'm still a human being.

784
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,040
I'm just trapped in a metal husk.

785
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,360
Okay.

786
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,160
And the husk that is becoming my life because of my poor pre-planning.

787
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,080
Why would anyone want to shoot a man that has locked himself

788
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,040
with his dick in butthole hanging out?

789
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,680
How is your flat?

790
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,720
The people can look under and he can't stop them because he can't move his arms.

791
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,480
Please everyone stop looking at my dick and or butthole.

792
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,920
I think they have a name for someone whose limbs are encased in metal

793
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,960
but whose sex organs are exposed and that's a fuck prison.

794
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,600
That's what you set yourself up for.

795
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,960
Travis, can you admit to us right now that this actually sounds like your dream scenario?

796
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,920
All that you have to do is have food fed to you and shit where you stand

797
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,240
and it's totally totally acceptable.

798
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,120
I don't like that you assumed that I would be bronze standing.

799
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,600
Okay, what would your sitch be?

800
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,640
What position are we talking?

801
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,800
Reclining on a chaise lounge like Cleopatra.

802
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,200
Okay.

803
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,440
Okay.

804
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,880
Travis, what if that started out as the life but then you turned

805
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,080
into the grand prize in a high stakes race around the world or something

806
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,120
because that seems like you'd be very valuable.

807
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,160
Or like I sunk to the bottom of the ocean like in AI and then like some aliens found me

808
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,280
in a thousand years but I'm still alive because I didn't have to use a lot of energy to just

809
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,480
keep my head alive.

810
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,360
His love is real.

811
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,240
His intellect is not.

812
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,520
First place for this grand prix around the world is this bronze fuck prisoner.

813
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,160
Like what's second place please?

814
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,640
What's last place get me?

815
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,080
A lead fuck prisoner.

816
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:56,240
The worst part about being encased in metal and having people have to feed you through

817
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,440
the hole in your face is that you can never really be particular about sandwich orders

818
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,080
again.

819
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,920
You really just have to accept whatever the person brings you.

820
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,200
Egg salad, potato, potato.

821
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,160
Now you hire someone else to smack things out of your mouth for you.

822
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,080
This is disgusting.

823
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,200
Someone scrape it.

824
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,120
Someone scrape the residue from my mouth.

825
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,000
Oh man, this just this turned into a saw movie in my mind real quick.

826
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,560
Yeah, it seems like pretty bad.

827
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,640
Is this what human centipede was about?

828
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,000
Kind of only instead of bronze it was another human's anus.

829
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,480
Did you guys did you guys see the new Robocop?

830
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:41,280
It was basically just a guy coating himself in metal and having sandwiches in his head

831
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,320
and then pooping himself on Shay's lounge.

832
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,760
Stop that crime.

833
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,360
Hey quit cut that crime out or else I'll make you watch what I do.

834
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:58,080
That would be a pretty good scene at Robocop halfway through the movie he realized that

835
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,240
his suit is metal and it's too heavy for his bones.

836
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:08,400
I want you guys to know that also now in 128 episodes I've now learned that this is the

837
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,160
kind of thing that I say this as a joke and someone out there is going Travis is so fucking

838
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,600
dumb that wouldn't work.

839
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,360
That would never work.

840
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:25,280
Yeah, I can I can say though that after knowing you for almost 30 years well 25 that this

841
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,080
is the kind of thing that you would actually give a lot of thought.

842
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,560
I would research it.

843
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,120
I'm not saying you would do it, but I'm saying out it would occupy a lot of your faculties

844
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,360
for I would say three to four days.

845
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,720
Well because I would also say this in my in my many years of being obsessed with really

846
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,800
weird things that people have done in the past someone has attempted to do this.

847
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,840
Oh sure sure sure.

848
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,160
I mean here's the thing people cryogenically freeze themselves.

849
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,800
You don't think someone back in like the 1600s when people were let's be honest dumb.

850
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,360
Yeah that somebody was like I know how I'll live forever.

851
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,400
I'll be encased in metal when someone like somebody's done it.

852
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,000
Here's the here's the question of the hour.

853
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,040
I die which is never going to happen, but this is this is a you know hypothetical.

854
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,840
I die I get my corpse frozen in bronze.

855
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,240
What do you guys do with that?

856
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,680
What do you do with that?

857
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,400
Do you put that in the independently owned and operated cemetery?

858
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,600
Do you put that in the living room as like some sort of fun statue?

859
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,960
Do you put me in the yard like one of those kind of racist lawn jockeys?

860
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,800
I think that would be a great way to as to act as a seed for your cemetery because people

861
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,000
know you're serious you know I also want to say one body above ground.

862
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,600
That's really good advertising.

863
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,280
It also would be a great moment if you just like had the statue in your home and friends

864
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,360
came over and they were like well that's a really detailed statue and you say oh thank

865
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,760
you it's my brother and they say oh is it like to commemorate him or how did he die

866
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,080
and you're like oh no no no that is my brother that is in fact yeah and p.s a weird person

867
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:04,800
that's in my house if I have a statue cast in honor of my brother it will not have his

868
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,560
genitals exposed yeah so p.s person with him oh where are you going you don't want to see

870
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,840
about the Mormon faith I'm ready to listen it would literally be like I wouldn't even

871
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,800
need to see all of it like around as I came through the door frame as soon as I saw like

872
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,240
the bra like the tip of his bronze dead nose I'd be like oh hold on I've got a phone call

873
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:37,680
in my car in my car phone bye yeah but tip of his dead bronze nose we could play a family

874
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,760
we could play a family feud and have people guess how you're going to end that sentence

875
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,360
and survey would never say nose it would never ever say nose no I've listened to my brother

876
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,440
my brother a few times I'm pretty sure he's not gonna end the sentence with nose let's

877
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:59,120
go to the leaderboard let's check it out survey says no 100 said dick everyone said dick it

878
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:04,800
seems 100 you got 100 points Justin this is the worst Louie Anderson impression I've ever heard

879
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:14,160
let me try again let me try again that's Ray Combs let me try Louie Anderson shut up I'm

880
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,240
trying to do my Louie Anderson wow 100% of the people said dick that's not that's my Bruce

881
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:26,000
Valanche fuck uh I saw Bruce Valanche on Shark Tank yesterday that son of a bitch was pitching

882
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,200
a software to teach old people how to use internet how to use it how to harness its power

883
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,480
I mean I would want I don't know why creating a book to help illiterates learn to read yeah right

884
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,400
like if I could log into computer classes they seem to be in pretty good shape yeah do you guys

885
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,400
remember when before the jump we were like we've got to move through these questions faster but

886
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,880
right now I'm googling Richard Karn to like make a timely family feud Richard Karn joke and I think

887
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,280
that nice Karn ball mall I think maybe we should move on I have a roommate who's constantly eating

888
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:03,920
my food he will always eat 99% of something and leave one item left for example he ate most of

889
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,320
my pretzels but left one and ate a full jar of pesto with said pretzels but left a spoonful of

890
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:16,320
pesto he ate an entire bag of gummy bears but left a single bear I feel petty ask him to stop

891
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:24,080
eating my groceries but he doesn't do any grocery shopping on his own how how should I deal with

892
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:29,680
how should I deal with this without sounding like a petty roommate like okay here's the thing

893
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:36,000
why define what the word petty means to you because eating your shit and doesn't buy his own

894
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,960
shit more more importantly though he's leaving a single element of it left saying now there's

895
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:47,920
still some for Jeff to enjoy there's one Pringle in this fucking can once you pop you literally

896
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,200
have to stop Jeff because I ate the other 99 Pringles did you know every can of Pringles has

897
00:42:53,200 --> 00:43:00,960
exactly 100 Pringles in it Jeff you're basically living with a bear but worse because at least the

898
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,480
bear is it will eat everything and it will like you just gotta throw it away after a bear is done

899
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,480
with it um but this guy's eating you out of house and home there's no I mean you can't like how far

900
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,000
does this go like he leaves one square of toilet paper that you bought he leaves the core of the

901
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,800
apple I boned I phoned your girlfriend but I stopped right before completion can we set can

902
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:31,200
we lay out a a dictate to America and the world but mainly America because I don't know what's

903
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:40,240
going on elsewhere if you cannot afford to live in an apartment by yourself you have to live with

904
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:49,440
your parents or be homeless you can't no one can live with anyone they are not dating anymore it's

905
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,920
that's simply untenable before this all roommates are awful they're the worst not that's not we

906
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,000
throw away listen Brent Brent will floss was my roommate I love him very deeply we are we are

907
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,200
still best friends and we live together for three years if you ask either one of us like did you at

908
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,880
any one point it 100% enjoy living with each other the answer is no yeah but you don't 100%

909
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:22,560
enjoy like any person like that that's you're gonna have 100% in I 100% enjoy my wife my girlfriend

910
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:28,000
I'm saying though like you're gonna have friction with anybody that you live with over something

911
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,680
even if I think the problem is that you don't have friction with the person because then

912
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:38,400
that that's when the real problems arise what I meant I mean I got that you meant like you don't

913
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,040
want to like fuck you fuck fuck your roommate don't fuck your roommate like first off don't

914
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,240
do that I do think that is an option though I think that's an option is to even if you're

915
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,600
heterosexual and you cannot afford to like you have to live with someone of the same

916
00:44:53,600 --> 00:45:01,760
gender as you I want you to eat this last gummy bear only what it's not in the bag where could it be

917
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,400
can we suggest that like can you do maybe not a sexual relationship I meant like in his butthole

918
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,920
and then like he would have oh gosh okay couldn't you thank you for clearing that up I needed a

919
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:20,480
road sign to find that one uh what what if you were to just say like we're not in a sexual

920
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:27,200
relationship but as long as you live here and I live here there is no boundary like we we are

921
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:33,200
literally we we are in this thing together we are living we are living as a unit I think that that

922
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:39,600
might be a possible that what like the majority of 80 sitcoms was about I think yeah like perfect

923
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:45,120
strangers I think was exactly about I don't think the guys in perfect strangers ever fucked each

924
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:52,880
other no I'm not saying implied I I'm not saying they fuck each other I'm saying like they combine

925
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:59,280
their bite and their wiener do not to stand tall on the wings of their dreams like they don't have

926
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,880
two milks there's just the one milk and they're both sharing it and if you don't have any groceries

927
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:12,960
like that that is a problem both of you have listen yeah and and question asker it is not

928
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,440
fucking petty is the worst thing in the world when you come home and you're like oh all I want

929
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,320
is to dive into that bag it's the worst roommate situation in the world okay okay it's not the

930
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,240
worst thing worst roommate situation in the world when like you've been sitting at work and you're

931
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,560
like man I just had the worst day but I bought myself that bag of gummy bears yesterday when I

932
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,680
was shopping for just such an occasion I was gonna dive headfirst in that bag of gummy bears you come

933
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:43,440
home I'm fucking do you remember that one like just super quick real quick sidebar if you're

934
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:49,600
in this situation it may be time to consider getting a new job if if the if the highlight

935
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:56,240
of your day is the gummy bears you're gonna eat later please you might be a redneck yeah time to

936
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:02,320
go to resume her and start seeing what's available because you are in a bad job I don't know what

937
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:07,280
kind of posh high level upper management jobs you've had in your life you've never had a job

938
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,520
where the highlight of your day is going to be the fact that you bought yourself like an ice cream

939
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:17,520
treat uh-huh and then maybe after that maybe you'll kill yourself maybe what so okay Travis

940
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,920
walk me through the narrative here this person goes to the grocery store buys an ice cream

941
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,680
treat says hang tight little buddy I'm gonna talk to you yes I don't know what kind of idealistic

942
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,200
lives you guys have led but sometimes you know you got to buy your bread you got to buy your milk

943
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,800
you got to buy your shit but then you go you know what this box of candy this is just for me when

944
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,080
Travis is in trouble you know this is for this is for emergencies only break glass in case of

945
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:49,040
blank box of mysterious unlabeled candy what could be inside here it's like Jumanji in candy

946
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,040
form I can't wait to eat this when I get home from the office you guys have never had emergency

947
00:47:53,040 --> 00:48:01,120
treats not that defined the course of my entire day no Travis okay out of out of years out of

948
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,360
years of your like 365 days you've never had one day where you think like oh I've got a steak at

949
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,920
home I'm gonna eat that today I have everything better but then I do I just live like a horrendous

950
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,920
food-based lifestyle you've been grief eating for like a decade I think like it's yeah yeah no that's

951
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,960
not great Trav that is not great behave that's not great that's not ideal I'll have you know

952
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,720
that I met with a personal trainer yesterday and he said my body fat percentage was fair your body

953
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:32,160
is amazing but my body is a wonder let's just I this is not it sucks but it's not that do you

954
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:37,200
remember 30 episodes or so ago when the guy talked about how his roommate fucked on his bed and left

955
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,720
like that's the worst left like a love mess whenever he did it like that's one gummy bear

956
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:48,800
sitting in the middle of the love mess yeah he left his leavings and like that fucked in your

957
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,600
bed and also I ate all but one of your gummy bears his detritus I think that you should count your

958
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,280
count your lucky stars there was enough left there that a bloodhound can track him through

959
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,480
the streets of London let's put it that way let's leave it at that um god yeah god I'm so glad I'd

960
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:11,440
never have to do that again do you guys want to yahoo please um this yahoo was sent in by uh

961
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:18,320
Valerie Rogers thank you Valerie it is by yahoo answers user Paul who asks what is the sexiest dog

962
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:22,960
I sometimes jog in the dog park around the corner from where I live the other day I got talking to

963
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:28,240
a model who was walking her dachshund said she would like to see me again I told her I walk my

964
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:34,800
dog there a lot so she would probably bump into me sometimes problem is I don't have a dog I now

965
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:40,720
have to buy one so she doesn't know I was lying to her so I could maybe get laid I am wondering

966
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:46,080
what type of dog I should get I want to get the sexiest dog possible so I'm going to go to the

967
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:51,760
sexiest dog possible so I have the best chance of getting into her pants what kind of dog what do

968
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,440
you dog owners suggest which dog is more likely to drive her crazy having a seizure I also need

969
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:04,080
one that doesn't make much noise because my wife can't find out she doesn't like dogs ah twist oh

970
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:08,960
god right there at the end you didn't think I thought it was so bad but now I see it for what

971
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:16,400
it truly is you got a yahoo chameleon I think it's got to be an afghan hound their hair looks

972
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,920
like a beautiful lady's hair hanging down yeah that's not bad what about something that has

973
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:28,800
even like a suggestive name like a like a schnauzer you know what I mean because whenever I hear

974
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:37,440
schnauzer I think of like how a barbit is actually is called a gun dog by the uh by the united kennel

975
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,040
club well I was more thinking of like you could ostensibly refer to your penis as like your

976
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,880
schnauzer you know what I mean why don't you get a human slave dressed as a dog and walking through

977
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,520
the dog park this is good this is a good line of dialogue for us hey and you want to know something

978
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:57,760
people do that that exists I saw it on an episode on I believe tlc let's let's clear up real quick

979
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:05,120
though just for a second when you say human slave you're talking about an snm thing and not a literal

980
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:11,280
slavery on the black market okay no I'm talking snm a bdsm kind of thing okay and uh the person

981
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,600
you know they wear snout and dog ears and whatnot you get them on a leash they crawl on all fours

982
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:20,720
through the dog park and I don't know whether they use the bathroom like a dog but hey I think

983
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,440
it's safe to assume okay I'm gonna need about 15 minutes to just jerk it real quick can we can we

984
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:31,760
take a break can we have a brief jerk it recess yeah and then we'll edit that out and we're and

985
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:39,600
oh got it there was so much hey can I ask a real quick favor from people who are into snm uh you

986
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:46,400
know I'm into it you know I'm down with you having your lifestyle could you not take that whole scene

987
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:54,800
into a public forum where that's going to be that person's whole week unless unless

988
00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:04,080
there is a special park that's just don't smell his ass just kidding go for it you have to do it

989
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:12,000
you're wild the place in which this I saw this occurring it was uh an sm an snm pair in san

990
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,200
francisco well that seems like the kind of place where that would happen yes yes of course I'm

991
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,480
saying maybe this is a special dog park but can you imagine being a regular dog owner which is

992
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,280
like oh a new dog maybe in like the deeps like didn't texas or something like that like oh this

993
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:33,520
is not a thing that has ever happened in this whole zip code cool cool justin you got real quiet

994
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:44,160
are you okay I just sometimes it gets the walls you try to put up for yourself you think that

995
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:50,960
they're to keep we have an agreement I know it's just an inside but it turns out the walls have

996
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:58,160
been there to keep all this alcohol because maybe just maybe maybe it's your thing it's got to be

997
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:06,000
somebody's thing what if it's my thing like how much of me guarding myself maybe some of my social

998
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,600
anxiety can be traced back to the fact that I'm constantly worried I'm gonna be like woof let's

999
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:18,080
fight I need it but we have to we can't let those fears control where we go on this show you know

1000
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:23,040
we have to have this agreement no limits no restraints take this pill let's go down this

1001
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:28,000
sexual oubliette together some some restraints but only if there are streets yeah yeah right

1002
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,960
let's go down this hole gotta go one way or the other we have to figure we got this show is a

1003
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:38,480
sexual spirit journey in in more ways than one and when we start pulling back a little bit when

1004
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,560
we start holding back the reins do you remember three years ago when we sat down and we started

1005
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:47,280
discussing doing this show and we said we're gonna do this show for one reason and one reason alone

1006
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:57,120
to learn about ourselves sexually come my brother my brother may come listen to three brothers

1007
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:02,880
discover themselves sexually open their flowers to new possibilities you remember when we were

1008
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,000
coming up with names to the show and I thought that ito hermano tombi in was gonna be was gonna

1009
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:21,040
be for recently I do think that making this show has skewed my perception of what it of I don't I

1010
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:27,360
do not think I have a barrier for what is a barometer for what is weird I used to think

1011
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,680
things are weird nothing's weird do you remember everything is do you remember like a hundred

1012
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:37,760
episodes ago we were like hey furries right and now we're all basically furries now and now I

1013
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:44,160
legit no joke if I hear someone out in real life make fun of the furries I will interject into a

1014
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,880
stranger's conversation and be like um excuse me that's actually coming from a very uninformed

1015
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,520
place and let me tell you what you need to know about the furry community are we a microcosm of

1016
00:54:53,520 --> 00:55:00,080
this experiment called America I hope that the amount of progressiveness that we show on this

1017
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:06,000
show every single episode I think if we can take steps forward like that as a fucking nation then

1018
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,160
we are going to turn into like a hellraiser-esque dimension of pain and pleasure I think I think

1019
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:19,760
initially we did have we had a lot of socially accepted bigotry yeah I think when we started

1020
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,960
we had a lot of socially acceptable I was not into interracial marriage I was I was firmly

1021
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:33,440
I didn't believe an older person could truly love a younger person now I know we used to be

1022
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:40,560
be the only person we have gotten irrationally angry at and I have not regretted as jugglers

1023
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:47,120
I still feel like we were pretty much on the money with jugglers I want to keep that feud going but

1024
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:54,080
literally everything else I I am sorry for any time we've judged now is that your Appalachian

1025
00:55:54,080 --> 00:56:03,280
affectation on the word juggalos hey man you got a festival with a bunch of jugglers around I would

1026
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:11,760
marry my first born daughter to a juggalo before I let her date a juggler wow I want to leave it

1027
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:19,600
at that wow out of my by saying that my my future daughter is going to listen to this and date a

1028
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:26,560
juggler to piss me off god damn it's right it's like we work so hard for you to not date anyone

1029
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:34,480
who suspends balls in the air that's all I ask that's all I ask is to stay away from wizards

1030
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:41,200
and press the digitators and jugglers I don't like anybody who does tricks I don't think it's

1031
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,200
so wrong our dad was murdered at a carnival should we have we ever talked about the fact

1032
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,920
our dad was murdered at a carnival no I don't think so okay well it's although I would like

1033
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,280
to throw out uh a special thanks to our our adopted father uh Clint McElroy which I mean

1034
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:00,720
we adopted him you've done such a great job raising us but the scars of our former dad's

1035
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:06,720
carnival murder unsolved carnival murder I feel like it really informs a lot of the stuff we talk

1036
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,720
about on the show I am amazed that like I'm amazed that we've never talked are you sure it hasn't

1037
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:15,840
come up it seems like it would have come up the fact that our dad was killed by a juggler

1038
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,120
well we can't prove that he was the prime suspect could have been anybody could have been a bearded

1039
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:23,360
lady could have been the lizard man could have been dunkin booth maybe a knife thrower that

1040
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:29,360
seems accurate could have been oh shit cotton candy guy candy guy last person you ever suspect

1041
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:34,480
he doesn't have any superpowers cotton candy tastes like my dad what spun to death made it

1042
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:41,040
from Emilio um all right uh guess his weight is what's in the show well I was gonna keep

1043
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:46,240

1051
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:51,040
comparatively I would this one's probably just I don't know I feel like we made people

1052
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,240
we made people come face to face with their own mortality probably more than they're comfortable

1053
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,960
with yeah and their own sexuality like what other podcasts offers you an ability to look

1054
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:04,000
into the future and both see yourself dead and see yourself in a leather dog costume sex and death

1055
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,920
it's the two primal forces of life according to the pilot episode of the wonder years so thank you

nbmbam wisdom it is a twitter feed that only tweets quotes from the show so that's pretty

1062
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:56,640
sometimes when you say the names of people on twitter you say them in like kind of an

1063
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:00,400
incomprehensible manner that makes it sound like you're reading off some sort of incantation

1064
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:08,080
like you're casting some sort of shitty spell I am casting a spell of love uh I want to because
