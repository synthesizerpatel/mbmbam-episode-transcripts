1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,400
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother mean advice show for the modern era. I'm

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,040
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy, and it's time to pay the piper. I'm your middlest brother,

7
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,840
Travis McElroy, and the piper's got bills. You know, he's got stuff to pay for.

8
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,680
I'm Griffin the money man McElroy, and 30 under 30 money boy, and money money money money,

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,200
must be funny, pay us all your dues. I'm worried about the piper.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,320
The piper has been a little bit sad lately because of all the money you owe him, sucker.

11
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:24,960
You've been dancing to our jolly, jolly song. You've been dancing to our jolly song for a

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,600
calendar year, and now he has upended his hat, and he is passing it around, and it's time for

13
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,920
you to pay for the jolly tunes you've enjoyed. Also, the piper's hungry. Be cool. Come on.

14
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,880
Also, if we want to take a different tact with the intro, it's our quadricentennial episode.

15
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,920
It's a big one for us, and we've got a big one for you. A big episode, and a big hug. Come on

16
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,600
close. Thank you. Oh, so warm, so warm. Let me just get that wallet. This one is special as hell.

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,000
Listen, straight up, this one's special, but it's also a special time of year. It's the max fund

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,160
drive. It's the max fund drive. Oh, so excited. It's our annual fundraising drive because here's

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,240
the thing. Our podcasts, our podcasts are free, and we're so glad that you enjoy them, and you

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,880
listen to them, and once a year, we ask you to maybe consider pledging a monthly donation to

21
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,360
support our show and the shows you love. Listen, we McElroy's, we got a lot of shows on max fun.

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,400
I think 36 last time I checked. 43 actually. Oh, we added seven more. That's right, because now

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,560
my dog hosts two. Your dog now hosts, yes, you can pet this dog, and it's sort of a fan cast.

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,120
Come get a pet of this. You'll never believe how much you can pet this dog.

25
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,080
And so if you love the content that you get from max fun and from the McElroy's,

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,840
maybe consider going to maximumfun.org forward slash donate and becoming a donor. We're going

27
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,760
to tell you all the different levels, all the different rewards, but just right off the bat,

28
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,400
I want to tell you, I think the best reward consistently year over year is all the bonus

29
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:15,360
content. There is like, I would say no joke though, conservative estimate, a hundred hours. We've

30
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,400
done the math before. It's many days of podcasting that you can enjoy, especially if you've never

31
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,360
done it before. You have an unfathomable treasure trove there. Including an episode we recorded for

32
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,480
our bonus episode this year, which was us just doing segments from the past, including monthly

33
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:41,520
observances, haunted doll watch, subway hacks, a lot of good, oops all bits. And I used the word

34
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,360
good in there earlier and that wouldn't describe all the segments. We've stopped doing some of them

35
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,400
for good reason. But we've also got a bonus episode of Taz in there where we do a one-off game

36
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,440
called for Sherlock Holmes and a vampire, which is one of the aforementioned Sherlock Holmes.

37
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,080
And even if you've never listened to Taz before, you could just go and listen to that and enjoy it

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,600
because it's completely standalone. We are trying to get to 25,000 new and upgraded members this year

39
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,720
and we have several different donation levels. We're going to break in in the middle and talk

40
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,400
about all that stuff, but we want to thank you preemptively. If you've supported us in the past

41
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,840
and you like supporting content that you love, we really appreciate you. If you are not already

42
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:33,840
on board, you can go to maximumfund.org slash donate. Do it right now. And you get to feel good

43
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,080
because you have supported something that you love and we really appreciate it. So we're going to get

44
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,720
into the episode now and we'll be back in the middle to talk more about like the- Do we want

45
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,960
to say anything to set this one up though? It's a little bit- Yeah, it's a wild one. This one's

46
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,200
going to be- Of a journey. I haven't edited it yet. It's going to be a bit of a Frankenstein,

47
00:04:51,200 --> 00:05:02,800
but we were- Okay. We were invited to do our nasty thing, do our dirty thing, live on the red carpet

48
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,040
of the Broadway debut of Jimmy Buffett's Escape to Margaritaville. For reasons beyond our

49
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,360
comprehension and it's been weeks since we've done it, still beyond our comprehension, but it was a

50
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,440
wild, wild night and we recorded a bunch of stuff from the red carpet. We had a little bit at the

51
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,760
beginning with our good friend, Lin-Manuel Miranda. You're going to hear that too. And you're going to

52
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:32,240
hear us go through various stages of sort of panic and sort of social discomfort and grief,

53
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,400
all the stages of grief. Did we mention there were celebrities on the red carpet that we were

54
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,360
expected to talk to? Yeah, so there's- That's part of it. It's a whole lot. So we thought episode 400,

55
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,640
let's make it a special one by presenting you with the most anxious night of our lives and our

56
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:54,560
careers. And we're going to get into the bit we recorded now with Lin and she'll listen to the

57
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,640
rest of the episode, but we will be back soon to tell you more about the Max Fun Drive. Remember,

58
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:05,040
just go donate right now. Maximumfun.org slash donate. And here comes something, man. I don't

59
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,880
know. Here comes something. Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother and me,

60
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,840
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy. I'm your

61
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,760
middle-est brother, Travis Showbiz McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media

62
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:26,960
luminary, Griffin, big lights, big city, McElroy. I'm visiting gadfly Lin-Manuel Miranda. Whoa,

63
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,960
where did you come from? I was hoping we could do like a layer of like fiction. Like,

64
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,360
oh, he just popped out of the toilet. No, he wouldn't be in the toilet. No, I just,

65
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,720
if you're in Times Square, I appear Broadway. Which one of the costume characters are you

66
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,160
on Times Square? Are you the scary Elmo or the scary Hulk? I am Ecuadorian Iron Man.

67
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,920
We saw two Hulks today, side by side, together. That's gotta be irritating in the exact same

68
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,080
costume. Anyway, welcome to a brought to you by, this week's episode is brought to you by

69
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,720
Escape to Margaritaville. Did you just have to take a second to realize,

70
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,200
because I have done this a few times, is it Escape to Margaret, and we're about to do something

71
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,920
where we need to have this locked in. Is it Escape to Margaritaville or Escape from Margaritaville?

72
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,360
Escape from Margaritaville would be wild. That's the sequel.

73
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,640
Get out. Get out.

74
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,200
Spoiler alert, but they do have to escape from Margaritaville at a certain point in the musical.

75
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,960
We're not here to spoil story beats. We're here to talk about this great musical

76
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,440
for everybody to go see, and we've got kind of a weird situation. A weird day ahead of us.

77
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,840
A bit of a situation. We are going to be, here in a minute, you're going to hear us,

78
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,440
and we have not done this yet, so we're a little on edge about it. Here in a minute,

79
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,400
you're going to hear us down on the red carpet recording our program,

80
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,080
live from the red carpet of Escape to Margaritaville.

81
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,360
The Broadway debut. It's the Ides of March, which is another sort of great omen for us.

82
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,240
Oh, no.

83
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,960
Yeah, we will have no table. We will have no chairs. We will have your questions.

84
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,840
I have not stood up for one straight hour in four years.

85
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,200
I'm very nervous about that.

86
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,640
The only thing we have is the hope that we will appear to supposed to be there.

87
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,000
That's my hope is that it just won't look like we were just like,

88
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,800
hey, what are you guys doing? Can we stand here?

89
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,480
We've never been on a red carpet in our entire life. What can we expect?

90
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,960
Well, if this were the Oscars or the Tonys or movie opening,

91
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,360
you would expect an hour and throngs of press. But this is just Broadway.

92
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,240
So it'll be like five outlets that are the Broadway outlets that go to everything.

93
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,440
Well, I wanted there to be much, much more than that.

94
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,160
I wanted there to be a chance where we could get passed over and be like,

95
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,080
well, they had a lot of other people to get to.

96
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,240
Now it sounds like if they pass us over, it'll be because they looked at us or heard us talking.

97
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,000
What's that Hydra at the end of the line?

98
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,520
How much should we explain to people?

99
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,960
We've got some there's I don't want to talk about anybody specific.

100
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,680
Can I ask something? What happened?

101
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,600
What led to this series of listen?

102
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,720
We love our buddy Jimmy Buffett. How did you end up?

103
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,560
Jimmy just thought it would be funny if we recorded at the premiere.

104
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,400
And I don't think he thought about it much more than that.

105
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,320
He was like, yeah, that'd be funny. Let's do it.

106
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,800
We were like, and then we said to in Jimmy's defense, we said, yeah.

107
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,920
And then we were like, wait a minute, what are we going to do?

108
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,040
What are we doing here?

109
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,200
Oh, no, wait, did one of us like slight Jimmy Buffett in the past?

110
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,000
And this is honest to God, had this thought several times today of at some point,

111
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,480
he'll be walking down the red carpet and be like, everybody else stop.

112
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,360
You three keep going and you pay attention to these three idiot assholes.

113
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,000
Hey, do you remember that joke you made when I was on your episode?

114
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,280
You burnt. Yeah. And then I'll dump pig's blood on us

115
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,560
or margaritas either way or pig's blood margaritas.

116
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,640
Um, yeah. So we're like,

117
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,400
we're going to try to talk to people that are on the red carpet of the show.

118
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,880
And like, I guess we'll ask them your questions

119
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,960
that you send in about vacations to your listener.

120
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,600
So we're trying to hang on to that.

121
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,840
At least we'll be doing that, that we know how to do that.

122
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,680
Did you do a red carpet for Hamilton?

123
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,320
Uh, I did not do the pre-show red carpet cause I was in the show.

124
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
But you had the, the show had one.

125
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,200
Yeah. The show had one.

126
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,240
That's where we didn't get that.

127
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,400
Yeah.

128
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,240
You know what would be funny guys?

129
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,560
Why didn't we, we could have recorded on the red carpet of Hamilton.

130
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,320
Wait, you guys, you guys are anxious about the red carpet of Margaritaville.

131
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,360
I know, but then we'd be more experienced for the Margaritaville red carpet.

132
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,040
Yours would have been the fucking burner.

133
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,680
Like we could have really wasted.

134
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,080
We could have wasted our energy on yours

135
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,000
and then brought our A game to Margaritaville.

136
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,040
I'm sorry I didn't think of that.

137
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,600
I didn't know Jimmy was coming to the great white light.

138
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,200
Probably because nobody's ever recorded a podcast for the premiere.

139
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,800
That's probably the only reason that didn't occur to you

140
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,640
is that nobody's ever fucking done it before.

141
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,440
Whoa, Flips, are we making history?

142
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,000
You might be.

143
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,640
We might be.

144
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,360
This could be the first podcast ever recorded

145
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,840
from the red carpet of a Broadway premiere,

146
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,760
which is not something, it's not a necessarily perfect fit

147
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,640
if you think about it.

148
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,400
It's not like we're going to do it

149
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,720
and everyone's going to be like, how have we not done this before?

150
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,840
It's so good.

151
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,560
Did you hear that?

152
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,720
Hey, Beverly, did you hear this episode?

153
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,000
They sound so nervous.

154
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,280
It's really top-notch content.

155
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,320
It's really good.

156
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,040
We've got to do that on the next WTF.

157
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,240
I've been Marc Maron the whole time.

158
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,560
I will say this, because there is less press

159
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,080
than you would find at sort of a bigger media thing,

160
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,240
a lot of people are going to come talk to you

161
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,040
and they'll be game.

162
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,480
They'll be game for whatever twisted humor

163
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,080
you guys bring to your own slant on things.

164
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,320
How much of our shtick should we explain to people

165
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,600
when we talk to them or should we just go for it?

166
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,600
Go big or go home.

167
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,280
Is that professional advice you're giving?

168
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,880
Are you saying that because you're going to listen

169
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,080
to this episode and you want it to be as entertaining?

170
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,240
Yeah, I'm just a long-time fan, first-time caller.

171
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,600
So you're just fucking with us, right?

172
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,400
Because we are who we are, it's not enough for us to-

173
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,360
I think by the time you say,

174
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,880
hey, we host My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

175
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,640
it's a show about advice, but they're gone.

176
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,120
So just go in.

177
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,320
Okay, you've gone from everybody's going to be game

178
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,480
and down to clown for as long as you want to.

179
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,760
If you tell them the name of your show,

180
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,360
they're going to leave, so which is it?

181
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,760
I will want to know why these three pasty gentlemen

182
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
are assaulting them with advice questions.

183
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,360
Let me hit you guys with this.

184
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,800
We are Jimmy Buffett's three irascible nephews.

185
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,120
This is for a science fair?

186
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,080
My uncle Jimmy said I could ask you some questions.

187
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,120
Is it too late to go out and buy three matching sailor's outfits

188
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,880
and say we're his irascible nephews

189
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,640
doing a project for the school fair?

190
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,680
This is the first time I've heard

191
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,040
the word irascible said out loud.

192
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,680
I've only read it in books.

193
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,800
And I did it twice.

194
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,680
Yeah, so how do you do now?

195
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,160
Sounds right.

196
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,880
Ward Smith.

197
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,560
Should we find me?

198
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,600
I'm so scared.

199
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,880
Talk in your microphone.

200
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,520
I'm extremely, extremely scared of tonight

201
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,560
and how bad it's going to go.

202
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,040
I'm scared about what we just put in our bodies.

203
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,240
We didn't eat a lot of cheese.

204
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,840
Went to a place called Junior's.

205
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,960
And I don't know why they called that

206
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,440
because there's nothing Junior about these portions.

207
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,960
Is that a skew point of view?

208
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,960
So if I bring that tonight, I'm good.

209
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,480
Yeah, you're Travis had a fucking milkshake

210
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,560
with a piece of cheesecake on top of it.

211
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,840
It was on the menu too.

212
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,200
I don't want anyone to think that

213
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,520
I crafted that from my mindscape.

214
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,280
That was an on menu.

215
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,520
You ordered it from your fucking mindscape.

216
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,560
I did make the decision,

217
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,000
but I didn't really want to eat it.

218
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,920
Well, I did, but I mostly was just like,

219
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,800
I must see this.

220
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,080
I told them while they were both eating

221
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,600
their big cheesecake messes,

222
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,760
that if they farted within a 10 foot perimeter

223
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
of Al Roker, I would never speak to either of them.

224
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,520
Watching the sun bake.

225
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,960
Hey, Lynn, wait till you hear this.

226
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,800
I was in Times Square and a guy jammed a CD in my hand

227
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,920
and he says free.

228
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,280
So I took it and then he asked me for a donation.

229
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,600
Can you believe that Swaggy Jeff did that to me?

230
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,080
But you just gave him free publicity.

231
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,000
That's good.

232
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,120
He'll enjoy that and the $20 I gave him for his bird CD.

233
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,320
That is more than you would buy.

234
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,360
That's all I had.

235
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,880
What else can we say?

236
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,440
Here's another track from Swaggy Jeff's mixtape.

237
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,040
We're gonna play that for 30 minutes

238
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
because we're only gonna get about 90 seconds

239
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,640
of usable audio, I feel like.

240
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,360
Listen, I think you're gonna find some real,

241
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,560
I mean, you've only ever done your podcast

242
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,720
sort of from the comfort of your own homes.

243
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,800
This is not true.

244
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Lynn, we've done 50 live shows.

245
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,920
You've been there for some of them.

246
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,200
What are you talking about?

247
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,880
This is like, I don't know, it's like an installation.

248
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,840
Think of it as the sleep no more of podcast.

249
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,600
You don't know who's coming up.

250
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,360
You've got your mask on.

251
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,320
Can I wear my mask?

252
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,160
That would make this easier, actually.

253
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,680
Now, Lynn just said something interesting,

254
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,520
which is that we're not gonna know who's coming up.

255
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,480
And for me, that's going to be true a lot of the time

256
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
because I don't know who anybody is.

257
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,000
Unless it's a cast of Terrace House.

258
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,360
If somebody from Terrace House,

259
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,920
if Ben McKenzie rolls up from the OC,

260
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,360
here's the list of celebrities I know.

261
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,400
Al Roker, he's gonna be there tonight, so that's good.

262
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,240
Now, that doesn't mean we'll get to talk to him.

263
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,960
He might see us coming a mile away.

264
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,880
Don't get all hyped to hear from Al.

265
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,040
Ben McKenzie from the whole cast, the OC.

266
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,520
Dennis Quaid is doing some stuff right now

267
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,120
for the I Can Only Imagine movie,

268
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
which day one, day one, day one.

269
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,760
And then that's it, end of list.

270
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,480
Those are all the people.

271
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,600
That's all the people you could identify.

272
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,800
And that's like to say that the people

273
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,160
that are gonna be here tonight

274
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,400
are not famous and recognized or reconvenerable, you know?

275
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,560
Sorry, was that recognized or reconvenable?

276
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,280
Is that the word?

277
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,840
Yeah.

278
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,560
Okay.

279
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,120
The problem is that I don't know who anybody is.

280
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,200
That might make it easier.

281
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,920
If when I go, who are you?

282
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,200
What's your deal?

283
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,760
I say, who are you?

284
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,640
And then they say, I'm Tony Danza.

285
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,440
Who are you?

286
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,720
I'm Tony Danza.

287
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,600
Let him get that far.

288
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,720
Hear the name.

289
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,320
And then say, wearing.

290
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,120
Who are you wearing?

291
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,480
You didn't let me finish mine.

292
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,040
That's good.

293
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,600
I like that.

294
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,480
Fashion safe.

295
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,960
If there's one thing I know about celebrities,

296
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,920
it's that they just love being treated like normal people.

297
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,880
And I don't know who normal people are.

298
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,080
So why would I know who they are?

299
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,000
So you just walk up and go, I'm Travis.

300
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,640
Nice to meet you.

301
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,400
This will be refreshing to you.

302
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,360
I don't know who you are.

303
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,240
I don't know who you are.

304
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
And I'm going to treat you like a regular person.

305
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,440
Now get out of my way.

306
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,200
I'm trying to talk to Tony Danza.

307
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,840
We're not going to talk to Tony Danza.

308
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,560
Damn it.

309
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,880
Are you worried that we'll try to establish that we're the boss?

310
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:33,680
See?

311
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,480
And that's why we can't talk to Tony Danza.

312
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,280
Now we can't talk to Tony Danza.

313
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,960
I'm going to tweet Tony Danza.

314
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,440
And make sure-

315
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,240
No, Lynn.

316
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,280
Say talk to my friends.

317
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,720
They're the irascible nephews of-

318
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,200
DM him.

319
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,840
Don't tweet him.

320
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,160
I don't know that he follows me.

321
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,920
Tony Danza.

322
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,640
Get it, Lynn.

323
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,960
You know Tony's got those open DMs.

324
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,320
He wants to hear from everybody.

325
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,800
Okay, so anyway.

326
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,360
So this is-

327
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,840
Love you, Tony.

328
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,200
This is before.

329
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,120
And then we're going to go try it.

330
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,440
So the next thing you hear is going to be us.

331
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,800
Try sounds so nice.

332
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,440
Try sounds like we get a dry run with no judgment.

333
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,160
Yeah, you might be about to hear 30 minutes of straight static.

334
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,840
No, we'll edit that down.

335
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,040
We probably wouldn't publish that.

336
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,800
We're going to go do the damn thing.

337
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,200
I'm excited because this feels like a radio version of your TV show.

338
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,920
Where you're kind of being- you're a little out of your comfort zone.

339
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,040
Mayor Steve Williams is the Tony Danza of Huntington.

340
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,600
That is true.

341
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,840
Throws down some sand.

342
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,640
Does some soft shoe.

343
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,320
That's what he says in his campaign commercials.

344
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,120
All right, let's do it.

345
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,600
Let's go.

346
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,000
Let's go.

347
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,960
We're at two bars of battery on this.

348
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,240
We brought other batteries down, right?

349
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,760
We brought other batteries.

350
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,200
10 minutes before everybody comes.

351
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,880
I assume all the celebrities will show up exactly on time.

352
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,760
5.30 and probably not.

353
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,720
5.30 on the dot.

354
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,600
Totally here because everyone knows it's cool to be on time.

355
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,320
We have an audience which I didn't expect and I don't prefer.

356
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,760
I should have thought about that because there will be beloved famous people coming through.

357
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,840
Everybody else is kind of standing up and they're doing stuff.

358
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,120
Should we be over there?

359
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,000
Are we in the wrong place?

360
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,360
No, we're in the right place.

361
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:03,920
This is good.

362
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,480
The nervousness- just to check in because this is what everyone- the nervousness I'm feeling

363
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,120
is unlike any kind of nervousness I've ever felt before.

364
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,760
Yeah.

365
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Not like in a heightened- like it's not the most nervousness I've ever-

366
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,480
but just this nervousness of I'm going to miss something.

367
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,760
It's like Lovecraftian.

368
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,720
It's like a sort of like a cosmic horror that I've never really seen the face of before.

369
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,400
For me, it's a lot of times when you feel anxious before doing something like this,

370
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,880
it's a fear of what if it goes bad?

371
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,160
This is more like- it's like an expectation like it's going to go good,

372
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,280
but what if it goes bad?

373
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
This is more like how bad is this going to go?

374
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,520
Yeah.

375
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,040
How bad is this going to be?

376
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,280
If a scary man came up to you and he was like,

377
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,400
I've got a dire warning for you tonight, you're going to get scrambled.

378
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,120
And it's like, well, I don't even know what that means, but it sounds horrible.

379
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,360
Well, this is also- you can tell everyone around us has done this countless times.

380
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:51,840
Yeah, yeah.

381
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,880
They are old hands.

382
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,160
They're not nervous about this at all.

383
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,080
Would it be weird for us to ask what we're supposed to do?

384
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,040
Let's see who's around.

385
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,120
We can maybe ask the people from Margaritaville TV what we're supposed to do.

386
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,040
They might be able to help us out.

387
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,000
Now, do you think they've done a lot of live red carpet premieres?

388
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,760
Or do you think this one for the Margaritaville musical is maybe among the first?

389
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,200
Maybe this is their first one.

390
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,440
I don't know if the Margaritaville is necessarily a news outlet

391
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,280
that needs to cover every Broadway opening.

392
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,120
Their coverage of the 2016 election was amazing.

393
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,720
It's hard hitting, yeah.

394
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,280
Okay, so there's several people who are sort of videotaping standups from the event.

395
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,200
And we're going to be kind of in the background of those.

396
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,120
They're going to edit us out, I assume.

397
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,560
They're going to green screen that.

398
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,440
Let's save our voices until people get here.

399
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,200
We don't want to lose this solid gold.

400
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,760
Yeah.

401
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,440
Okay, so we're going to get right into the questions.

402
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,640
Let's see here.

403
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,880
We're here with Derek Jeter.

404
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,960
Derek Jeter.

405
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,920
So psyched.

406
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,040
Yo, it's me, the Jeep.

407
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,800
Hi, it's me, Derek Jeter.

408
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,320
This one comes to us from Rose.

409
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,120
I live in a place people go on vacation and I worry that I take the beach for granted.

410
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,520
Do you have tips on appreciating it to the fullest

411
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,320
without quitting my job to become one with the waves?

412
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,440
That's from Rose.

413
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,800
I mean, of course you do.

414
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,680
You live at the beach.

415
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,720
You take it for granted.

416
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,000
Just like I take, I don't know, my bathroom for granted.

417
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,640
It's always there.

418
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:14,960
I live there.

419
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,120
No one goes to the vacation at your bathroom.

420
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,560
I have a very nice bathroom.

421
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,280
I have a bidet.

422
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,240
I've actually been there before.

423
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,120
He does have a bidet.

424
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,200
I'm not looking it up on a Travago though.

425
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,320
I put it on Airbnb.

426
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,040
Just the one room.

427
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,400
It's on Travago.

428
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,400
What do you think the Travago guy's bathroom looks like with him in it while he's using it?

429
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,760
Give me a minute.

430
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,640
Give me a minute.

431
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,200
Give me a minute.

432
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Tell me what you think about the Travago guy in the bathroom.

433
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,880
The first celeb that comes up here, we're going to say,

434
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,840
what do you think it looks like when the Travago guy goes to the bathroom?

435
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,880
This is a blood pact.

436
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,680
I'm not joking.

437
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,280
Walk off the set.

438
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,320
If one of you doesn't say, hello, Mark.

439
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,360
Hello, Marla Maples.

440
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,880
What does the Travago guy look like when he uses the restroom?

441
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,040
What does he look like when he uses the bathroom?

442
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,200
Yeah.

443
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,400
Welcome to the party, bud.

444
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,840
No, but I mean, like, what do you know?

445
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,360
He probably looks the same as he says.

446
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,400
It was everybody else.

447
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:00,560
All right.

448
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,440
So that's one question.

449
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,760
What if the first celebrity is the Travago guy?

450
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,560
I think it's a little bit like this.

451
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,040
I was worried we were not going to have enough to talk about,

452
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,880
but now we got that one in the in the chamber.

453
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,480
Oh, we're going.

454
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,360
Oh, no, we're going.

455
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,840
It's Mark.

456
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,240
We're going.

457
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,080
Mark.

458
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,560
Oh, God.

459
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:17,840
Okay.

460
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,320
It's Mark Helgenberger from CSI.

461
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,280
She's wearing black and white outfit.

462
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,920
Nice.

463
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,360
Good fashion coverage.

464
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,080
This week.

465
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,720
Oh, God.

466
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,600
I'm freaking out.

467
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,640
Travis, you got this.

468
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,720
No, I just got so tense.

469
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,360
You got this.

470
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:31,920
Just relax.

471
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,360
I'm just going to ask right here.

472
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,840
Mark Helgenberger, how do you appreciate the beach?

473
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,320
Okay.

474
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,800
Let's start.

475
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,280
Let's start.

476
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,360
Let's not start off with the Travago bathroom question.

477
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:41,600
Okay.

478
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,640
We'll start with the Travago bathroom question.

479
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,200
Don't open.

480
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,720
We've got a few celebs under the belt.

481
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,400
Just say like, hi, I'm Travis McElroy.

482
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,000
I host an advice podcast.

483
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,560
Hi, we're the McElroy brothers because I want her to know who I am, too.

484
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:50,880
Okay.

485
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,920
We host advice podcasts.

486
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,960
And how do you what do you let's just ask beach activities.

487
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,040
That's like, well, that's less weird.

488
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,920
For beach advice?

489
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,200
Favorite beach activities.

490
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,680
It's going to be cool when she's actually here.

491
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,120
We're going to be totally cool about it.

492
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,400
Yeah, we're going to be like, oh, this you just mentioned like,

493
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,840
hi, we're the McElroy brothers.

494
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,960
This is our 20 second.

495
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,480
We've done this a ton of times.

496
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,400
In fact, I'm pretty bored.

497
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,720
We've done a lot of these before and.

498
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,400
This definitely isn't new.

499
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,680
I have like tears welling up in my eyes and I'm not really sure why.

500
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,080
Do you see?

501
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,040
Are you crying?

502
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,160
Yeah, I think a little bit.

503
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,800
I don't know why.

504
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,040
This is a self-engineered hell.

505
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,440
Yeah.

506
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:25,920
I've put myself.

507
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,880
This is like salt, but specifically for the McElroy brothers.

508
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,720
Yeah, we have put ourselves into hell.

509
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,240
Well, you have to talk to say that that loud.

510
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,880
Just tell her who we are first, because yes, it's going to be weird.

511
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,320
If she's like, and don't mention the Trivago guys bathroom.

512
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,800
We got this.

513
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,280
We're good.

514
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,920
Oh, okay.

515
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,640
We're okay.

516
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,520
Probably feels all right.

517
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,800
So, okay.

518
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,400
So just swing in a day still happen.

519
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:54,960
Okay.

520
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,640
So we've okay.

521
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:56,960
Okay.

522
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,400
Bit of a whiff on that one.

523
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,900
Okay.

524
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,960
Okay, hold on.

525
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,640
Just going to relax and we'll talk casually and maybe.

526
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,400
So I think the problem there is that we were talking about how this was our hell.

527
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,640
Like really loud.

528
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,800
I don't think she's coming back over.

529
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,280
Yeah.

530
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,040
No, I think the red carpet's sort of a one-way affair.

531
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,240
Cause then okay.

532
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,680
So let's talk about this.

533
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:17,920
Okay.

534
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,560
So what happened?

535
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,000
Wait, no, wait, hold on.

536
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,320
Okay.

537
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,720
So Mark Helgenberger just walked right past us.

538
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:22,960
Yeah.

539
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,840
As well she should.

540
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,480
As well she should.

541
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,440
I don't follow her for that.

542
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,240
It's totally cool.

543
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,640
Okay.

544
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,000
I think we're going to have another run at this.

545
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,320
I'm starting to readjust my expectations a bit.

546
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,560
Yeah.

547
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,960
We need to at least talk to one person on this red carpet.

548
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,640
At least one person should talk to us.

549
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,400
Yeah, we'll get, listen.

550
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,960
That's Travis and I guarantee by the end of this hour, we'll have at least one person.

551
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,560
Should we have tried to like vibe a little bit more?

552
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,000
Like not in a sexual way, but like put the vibe out.

553
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,920
We weren't like, we were maybe turned in facing each other and not like.

554
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,160
Okay.

555
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:53,760
Maybe.

556
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:54,720
Okay.

557
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,760
So second whiff.

558
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,640
Her second whiff.

559
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,320
Second whiff.

560
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,520
Looks like Terry Collins, former New York's Met manager.

561
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,280
We're in a gray suit.

562
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,600
Okay.

563
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,400
And get that one.

564
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,920
That was a whiff on our part.

565
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,720
Now, okay.

566
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,200
And this one.

567
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,240
Hold on, wait, stop.

568
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,960
Hold on, wait.

569
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,080
Checkered jacket, gray pants.

570
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,720
What?

571
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,280
Checkered jacket, gray pants, silver watch, and gray shoes.

572
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,200
You have to say what everyone's wearing.

573
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,240
This is red carpet.

574
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,480
Okay.

575
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,120
Justin, there's someone over here getting their photo taken.

576
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,680
Who is it?

577
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,240
Can you spot them?

578
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,480
Okay.

579
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,160
Hello.

580
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,360
Hello, we have a sheet that has pictures of everybody.

581
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,320
There's like 80 people.

582
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,120
That's going to be here.

583
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,680
We'll just play it cool.

584
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,800
Well, we do need to know who they are.

585
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,720
We do need to know who they are, but I don't see them.

586
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,160
Okay.

587
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,880
So Marg.

588
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,520
It's going past us a second time.

589
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,560
We're going to get another run at this.

590
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,520
Marg is back.

591
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,200
She's talking to SiriusXM.

592
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,320
This is going to be fine.

593
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,880
Do I need to step over the rope?

594
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,920
Is that what people are doing?

595
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,360
Is stepping over the rope?

596
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,120
I'm up against my one weakness.

597
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,480
Rules and regulations.

598
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,080
We might have the distinct pleasure of being passed over three times.

599
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,760
We might need to enlist the help of somebody like more adult.

600
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,040
Is there an adult here?

601
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,400
Okay.

602
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,560
So the Mets guy came back.

603
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,720
Is that two?

604
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,360
Oh, no.

605
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,320
Terry Collins came back.

606
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,200
All right.

607
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,760
I don't...

608
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,560
We'll just ask Terry Collins about the scariest sea creature.

609
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:14,800
Yeah.

610
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,320
It's going to be fun.

611
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,240
They were actually, if I'm going to be honest, a little relieved when they just walked past us.

612
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,560
Like, he's like a sports gentleman.

613
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,000
Like, I don't have as much...

614
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,800
What sea creature would you most want to play baseball with?

615
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,960
No, let's just ask him what he likes to do on vacation.

616
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,080
Again, guys, softball.

617
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,760
Then we go scary sea creature.

618
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,680
Then we get to like close out with the Trivago guy.

619
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,840
So we start with what do you like to do on vacation?

620
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,160
We are really building this plane as we're flying.

621
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,720
It's fine.

622
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,360
I need you to not stand on the side.

623
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,000
Okay.

624
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,400
What?

625
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,440
Quick family meeting.

626
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,640
I need you to not stand on the other side of the ropes yelling,

627
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,080
this is fine or this is hell, while making a grim mask of death with your face.

628
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,440
Can you stop doing that for me?

629
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,840
Does it just kind of look like I've been doing this for a while?

630
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,000
Yeah.

631
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,920
You get more flies with honey than vinegar.

632
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,600
It's not even vinegar.

633
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,440
You get more flies offering them honey than making them watch you eat vinegar.

634
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,600
I get more flies with honey than making them think I stink like vinegar.

635
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,200
They should avoid the vinegar boy.

636
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,160
It's been eight minutes.

637
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,840
That's pretty good.

638
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,520
For eight minutes in, I'm feeling very good.

639
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,600
You got some solid content so far.

640
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:19,840
Yeah.

641
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,360
Yeah, not a lot of, not a lot of silhouette.

642
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,800
I think they're all going to dump.

643
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,840
They're dumping in, I think.

644
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,320
But maybe they're just making the, making the runs.

645
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:28,960
This is good.

646
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,600
This is fine.

647
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,120
Listen, I'm actually relaxing now.

648
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,480
You know, I'm relaxing because I don't think anybody's going to talk to us.

649
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:34,800
Yeah.

650
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,120
Right.

651
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,360
I'm not going to put it on the spot at all.

652
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,080
Oh, here we go.

653
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,560
Okay.

654
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,120
I've got this.

655
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,360
Okay.

656
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,240
You got this, Travis.

657
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,120
I believe in you.

658
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,760
Hi.

659
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,080
Nope.

660
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,360
Panic locked up.

661
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:43,920
You're locked up.

662
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:52,000
So, for the folks at home, that was a third walk by Mark Helgenberger from-

663
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And listen, the window was there.

664
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,640
The window was there.

665
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,360
She was probably four inches from Travis.

666
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,200
And I didn't, I opened my mouth.

667
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,440
The amount of time that passed between, I've got this too, I froze up was quite short.

668
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,400
Okay, I'm going to get Terry though.

669
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,520
What's Terry's last name?

670
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,020
Collins.

671
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,280
Mr. Collins.

672
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,080
Mr. Collins.

673
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,400
Former, former manager of Communer Fats.

674
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,320
This one's going to, just a real quick one, because I'm real nervous about this guy.

675
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,040
I'm double intimidated because he's like famous and sports.

676
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,200
Yeah.

677
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,400
So, it's like two things that I'm not great with.

678
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,240
What if he throws a ball at you like super hard?

679
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,040
What if he sees something wrong, but he can mold?

680
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,540
Yeah.

681
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,000
You catch it really cool.

682
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,360
Kids, you got the goods, money ball.

683
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,000
Look, I can see the group on your microphone.

684
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,800
You seem like a-

685
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,400
Joke up a little bit.

686
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,600
What's really fun is every so often I make eye contact with people in the crowd behind us,

687
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,840
and they're looking at me like, why are you there?

688
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,200
And I'm also thinking.

689
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,800
And you're looking at them like, why am I here?

690
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,480
Get me out of here.

691
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,520
We want to make people feel like we're not pranking them, because we're not.

692
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,480
That's not our goal here.

693
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,200
But if we keep yelling about sea creatures, people are going to think we're going to like-

694
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,640
It's like a regular thing that we're doing.

695
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,800
Just have people talk about sea creatures, you know?

696
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,180
Okay.

697
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,460
Okay.

698
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,280
Now, when you are flipping feverishly through the tip sheet and they see that,

699
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,440
that's probably going to hurt their feelings a bit, so.

700
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,200
Justin, faster.

701
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,760
Identify.

702
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,920
I don't know.

703
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,760
I don't know. I'm dizzy.

704
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,240
I'm getting dizzy.

705
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,760
It's not Tony Danza.

706
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,240
I feel like we're playing the most high stakes game of Guess Who?

707
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,040
Maybe.

708
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,760
Yeah, I know.

709
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,120
I mean, the good news is if we keep doing things exactly as we've been doing them,

710
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,080
it's not going to be an-

711
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,760
It's going to be a moot point.

712
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,200
Okay, just to check in.

713
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,240
What's the score so far?

714
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
The score is zero.

715
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,880
We're at 12 minutes, 26 seconds on the recording.

716
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,520
How long?

717
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,640
1226.

718
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,840
So if I can make eye contact with Mark Hellenberger down at the other end,

719
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,000
and she'll feel the connection and come back.

720
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,480
So Mark may come back.

721
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,520
And now at this, at the point I'm at,

722
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,080
I don't actually want to talk to anybody but Mark Hellenberger now.

723
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,200
I feel like so jilted.

724
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,760
Well, it's because she's damned it all up in our minds where we can't,

725
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,200
sorry, I can't with you.

726
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,440
Yeah.

727
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,320
I'm still, I've still got all the questions waiting.

728
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,040
She is loading her own stock in our minds.

729
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,840
Okay, that guy just asked, where is your Margaritaville?

730
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,480
That's very good.

731
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,400
But we were going to ask that though.

732
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,920
No, stay turned.

733
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,760
I'm trying to look at the list of people that are here.

734
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,360
Okay, so Justin is now looking at the tip sheet.

735
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,400
Covertly.

736
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,240
Covertly, using my back as a sort of shield.

737
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,680
That was Steve Croft earlier.

738
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,360
Steve Croft.

739
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,280
Damn, just missed it.

740
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,720
Tim Federal?

741
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,600
Yeah, Tim Federal?

742
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,100
Tim?

743
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,840
Tim Federal?

744
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,920
Tim.

745
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,640
Show me the paper, you child.

746
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,080
No, it's okay.

747
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,720
It's okay.

748
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,440
I, okay.

749
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,120
Okay.

750
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,080
Wins and losses.

751
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,240
One, loss.

752
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,720
He did walk right past this.

753
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,000
Win.

754
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,960
His name was Tim.

755
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,280
Big win.

756
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,080
Big W.

757
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,120
I did invite him and I did recognize him from the tip sheet.

758
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,960
Let's take a quick promotional break to talk about Escape to Margaritaville.

759
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,840
It's more than a musical.

760
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,880
It's a way of life.

761
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,160
You've seen it now.

762
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,800
Just the once?

763
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,280
Just the once.

764
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,840
Tonight the twice.

765
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,160
Tonight is the second time it is opening.

766
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,240
Tonight here at the Marquee Theater and right in the middle of Times Square.

767
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,200
It's a great show.

768
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,560
Come out and see it.

769
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:19,360
Escape to MargaritavilleMusical.com and you can get tickets and plan your escape today.

770
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,960
That's a book by Greg Garcia and Michael Malley who you may remember from

771
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,960
My Name is Earl.

772
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,000
A lot of great shows like that.

773
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,920
Musical lyrics of course by Jimmy Buffett and you should come see the show.

774
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,400
Is that maybe Matt Doyle?

775
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,680
Nobody looks like they're pictures.

776
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,840
Matt Doyle maybe?

777
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,400
Maybe Matt Doyle?

778
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,080
Say his name like 14 more times and then maybe it'll just become true.

779
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,000
I'm thinking we need to be on the other side of the rope.

780
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,600
You think that would be...

781
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,800
So here's, let's set up the scene for our folks at home because let's remember that

782
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,240
we're recording an episode of a podcast.

783
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
Travis, okay Travis is going across the rope.

784
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,800
Yes, this is the right move.

785
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,080
Okay, there's a rope and Travis is going on the other side of it.

786
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,800
This is the right move.

787
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,640
You've got to be a more of a presence.

788
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,920
We're kind of this producers.

789
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,680
We're his supervising producers.

790
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,560
Okay, Travis is across the road that is protecting us from the beautiful people.

791
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,120
So terrified.

792
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,760
Travis is very...

793
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,080
All right, now listen from this point forward, we can't talk about...

794
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,040
Nobody's going to yell at you.

795
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,080
Everybody's across the rope.

796
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,680
Now we're across the rope too.

797
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,320
Yeah, all right.

798
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:12,800
Travis is...

799
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,680
Now he looks like it.

800
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,200
Now he looks like he's doing interviews.

801
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,000
Miss Hughes?

802
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,520
Miss Hughes, right?

803
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,640
Miss Hughes?

804
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,880
Yes.

805
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,200
Maybe don't mention we do a podcast.

806
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,240
Now that I think about it.

807
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,440
Oh no, okay.

808
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,960
There's so many different iterations of how I'm going to introduce myself in my head.

809
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,600
Miss Hughes.

810
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,360
No, I think I don't actually know.

811
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,520
I'm not 100% certain on the name.

812
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,080
Don't.

813
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,400
Yes.

814
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,800
Okay.

815
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,120
Yes.

816
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,600
Yes.

817
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,080
Yes.

818
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,280
Okay, I'm going to give this.

819
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:35,680
Travis.

820
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,200
Travis.

821
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,520
It's okay.

822
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,640
Can we ask you some quick questions?

823
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:39,920
Hi.

824
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,400
How's it going?

825
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,040
Hello.

826
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,080
We do an advice podcast.

827
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,360
Oh, you can just go ahead.

828
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,400
It's a microphone.

829
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,480
We've never done this before.

830
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,920
We're recording a podcast.

831
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,960
Very nervous is the first one.

832
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,280
We do an advice podcast called My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

833
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,040
We were wondering what advice you would give to our listeners as far as like good activities

834
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,240
to do on vacation.

835
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,600
Getting away to Margaritaville.

836
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,160
Oh, I love this podcast question, actually.

837
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,120
So I definitely, I'm a huge hiker.

838
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,320
I love to go hiking.

839
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,400
And I think if you're on vacay, the best way to start the day is by getting up and going

840
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,800
for like a little exercise, a little walk.

841
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,400
And that way, you're burning off the hangover from the night before.

842
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,200
I love that.

843
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,800
You work hard and you play hard.

844
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,760
But it's not working.

845
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,160
You're out.

846
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,800
You're engaging.

847
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,160
You're being good to your body.

848
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,720
Yeah.

849
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,760
So you're not doing anything, too.

850
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,440
That is a novel concept for the three of us.

851
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,440
This is the best advice we've actually ever had.

852
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,240
A healthier.

853
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,480
Yeah.

854
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,120
That's good.

855
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,320
But you've got to be with people.

856
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,760
Otherwise, it feels like punishment.

857
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,800
It feels like work, right?

858
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,040
But if you're with people, then it's just fun.

859
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,600
And if you're alone, you also have to be worried about bears.

860
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,920
But with people, you're less likely to get attacked by bears.

861
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,960
Avoid bears.

862
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,920
Speaking of, our second question is, what sea creatures do you think are most dangerous?

863
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,240
This is a-

864
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,960
I mean, I'm wearing a mermaid dress, so I think mermaids, right?

865
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,000
Mermaids can be fairly terrifying.

866
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,280
Wow, that's a really good point.

867
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,080
They are scary, actually.

868
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,760
That's not an obvious choice.

869
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,760
They'll sting you into a trance.

870
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,960
You'll walk right in the water.

871
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,600
Exactly.

872
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,320
I love it.

873
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,720
Excellent.

874
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,520
Thank you very much.

875
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,160
Thanks so much.

876
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,040
What's your podcast called?

877
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,560
It's called My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

878
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,520
Oh, duh.

879
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,520
Like it's written on the sign.

880
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,680
Jimmy Buffett was on our show, and we asked if we could come do this.

881
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,080
And we didn't really think through the practicalities of actually doing it.

882
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,440
A podcast on a red carpet.

883
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,280
Yeah, this is not really our milieu.

884
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,240
But we're hanging in there.

885
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,960
But you're nailing it.

886
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,840
Thank you.

887
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,360
A lot of people walked past us before you stopped.

888
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,160
So this is kind of the first-

889
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,640
Thank you.

890
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,600
Thank you for stopping.

891
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,760
Hopefully, I will start a trend for you.

892
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,160
Thank you.

893
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,040
I appreciate that.

894
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,600
Thank you very much.

895
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,440
I read the word that we're regular, normal people.

896
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:25,920
I love it.

897
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,720
Thank you.

898
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,120
Real people.

899
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,160
Should I make an announcement?

900
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,760
Yeah, just start yelling at me.

901
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,400
No announcements.

902
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:30,960
Thank you.

903
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,440
Thank you.

904
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,680
All right.

905
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,400
That's one.

906
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,120
That was one.

907
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,520
That's one.

908
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,240
That was so good.

909
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,320
Travis, do you want to come back on the other side of the road for a minute?

910
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,360
I need your cover.

911
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,560
I need Justin getting my back.

912
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,240
Would you say that is Matt Doyle?

913
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,360
What?

914
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,480
Say it's Matt Doyle.

915
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,600
Does that feel like Matt Doyle?

916
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,520
You've got to show me the paper.

917
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,000
I can't tell you.

918
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,280
I heard Justin say it.

919
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,560
So Matt Doyle right here.

920
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,360
Is that Matt Doyle?

921
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,280
Crowds are really filling up here.

922
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,040
If we can't do a positive identification, yeah, we need a clear match.

923
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,640
Justin is now bent over.

924
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
I think that was a lot on him.

925
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,920
You got to talk in your microphone.

926
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,640
I dropped my badge.

927
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,400
And I don't know.

928
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,360
I was just bending over because I dropped something important.

929
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,120
We can't, if we're not 100% positive of ID, we can't do an interview, Travis.

930
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,120
Let's move on to our second question.

931
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,640
Yeah, let's hear it.

932
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,480
My fiance wants us to go to Italy for our honeymoon.

933
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,720
Italy sounds great, but I'd also like to buy a house.

934
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,200
So I want to rent a cabin up north and put the rest toward mortgage.

935
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,320
Where can we go that both feels like a honeymoon rather than a family vacation,

936
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,040
but also doesn't completely drain our savings?

937
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,240
Almost married in Ann Arbor.

938
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,800
So like romantic vacation destinations.

939
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Something romantic, but cheap.

940
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,840
A romantic vacation destination on a budget.

941
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,200
Not costly for not for unwealthy folks.

942
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,480
Justin, how are you doing?

943
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,920
I'm doing very well.

944
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,320
The time is 5 57, which by my watch means we're halfway.

945
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,440
Halfway through the star-studded cavalcade.

946
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,320
We got one person to be on our show.

947
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,240
Which is one more than I was starting to think we'd get.

948
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,640
Marg will probably get back here soon.

949
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,880
When the word gets out.

950
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
When the word gets out about Marg Helgenberger.

951
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,960
Who is that lady?

952
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,480
Oh, that lady is so good.

953
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,880
Brenda, Brenda Maccaro?

954
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,600
I don't think so.

955
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,720
Shit.

956
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,440
I don't know then.

957
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,520
If it's not fucking Brenda Maccaro, I don't know who it is.

958
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,240
What if we, can I tell you guys an idea I just have?

959
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,560
What if we just put this one up completely unedited?

960
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,160
What if we just threw this one up on the channel?

961
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,600
Okay, there's a very handsome guy who I do not know his identity.

962
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,320
But he's so handsome.

963
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,120
But he's so handsome.

964
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,640
He's gotta be somebody.

965
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,680
Is that Matt DeWill?

966
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,200
I swear to God if I hear you say this name one more time.

967
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,320
This guy's so handsome.

968
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,680
I just don't, I'm too nervous to talk to him.

969
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:39,920
Is that handsome?

970
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,840
Can I just approach him as handsome guy?

971
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,440
No, I wouldn't do that at all.

972
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,200
Are you kidding me?

973
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,240
Maybe he's a date.

974
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,920
Some people are people's dates.

975
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,280
And they're not all attention.

976
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,320
And they're just beautiful.

977
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,040
So we shouldn't talk to either of these people

978
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,280
because we cannot be clear of what we're doing.

979
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,400
We didn't talk about that question.

980
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,000
I ain't scared anymore, Justin.

981
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,120
What's a romantic vacation destination?

982
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,160
You know what's nice?

983
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,720
What's that?

984
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,840
If you go to a lake.

985
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,760
We've been called out.

986
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,880
We've been called out.

987
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,600
We've been caught.

988
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:17,600
I literally don't know how to.

989
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,520
We've been called out for talking into our microphones.

990
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,480
Someone yelled at us for talking into our microphones.

991
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,040
Have you ever seen people who stood together

992
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,320
who are just inches away from each other talking to each other on mics?

993
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,560
Don't say I didn't hit it on the nail.

994
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,120
No, you did.

995
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,480
This is our first red carpet event.

996
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,440
We're very nervous.

997
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,000
I don't know how to do any of this.

998
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,640
This is our first red carpet event.

999
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,920
We do an advice podcast.

1000
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,680
We're very vulnerable right now.

1001
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,280
Yeah, we're very vulnerable.

1002
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,480
We're so nervous.

1003
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,840
Is this a radio show?

1004
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,280
Yeah, it's a podcast.

1005
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,000
It's an advice.

1006
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,800
Yeah, we're doing it.

1007
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,840
And we do advice.

1008
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,600
This is my friend Levi Bradley.

1009
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,100
Hi, Levi.

1010
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,800
That's a great question.

1011
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,760
That's actually the only question.

1012
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,600
We actually also don't know the answer.

1013
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,720
Jimmy Buffett was on our show and he thought it'd be fun if we came and did this.

1014
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,760
I asked for this cover.

1015
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,640
They didn't have it.

1016
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,240
Oh, I had to bring it into the place.

1017
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,880
Our question is romantic vacation destinations.

1018
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,680
Oh, that's great.

1019
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,240
You have any suggestions for our listeners?

1020
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,640
Yes, I would go to Bali, Indonesia.

1021
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:28,240
Try to overcome the McDonald's and the Kali Starbucks shop.

1022
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,240
Pass by that and get into their culture.

1023
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,560
Okay.

1024
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,520
But it is a beautiful...

1025
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,160
Are you guys serious?

1026
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,880
Is it a bad McDonald's?

1027
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,200
Yeah, somebody asked when you should go.

1028
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,960
And the Galapagos.

1029
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,440
Okay.

1030
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,960
I like all the animals there.

1031
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,560
They're very different.

1032
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,960
You look so cute with these mics.

1033
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,840
Well, thank you.

1034
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,760
Thank you so much.

1035
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,040
Thank you.

1036
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,840
Thank you very much.

1037
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,000
We'll do your podcast any day.

1038
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,400
Thank you, thank you very much.

1039
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,960
All right, so we lined up a second spot there.

1040
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,280
Okay.

1041
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,480
It's the best.

1042
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,440
We're doing great.

1043
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,800
So that went super good.

1044
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,400
That went so good.

1045
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,480
There's a whole family of handsome people.

1046
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:04,720
Okay.

1047
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,080
I don't want to...

1048
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,120
This is too many people.

1049
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,120
This is overwhelming.

1050
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,840
It's too many.

1051
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,480
Two people walked up that time and I couldn't handle it.

1052
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,320
Does one of the pictures have a whole family on it?

1053
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,480
Just squeezed into one picture.

1054
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,880
Okay, so just to explain, Justin has folded the tip sheet,

1055
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,760
which has the faces of all of the folks walking the red carpet

1056
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,880
and their names into an origami swan,

1057
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,920
making it nearly impossible to read at speed

1058
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,320
that people are coming down the blue.

1059
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,360
It's also a blue carpet.

1060
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,560
Have we talked about that?

1061
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:34,880
Oh, yeah.

1062
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,760
The carpet is blue.

1063
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,280
I think because, give me if I'm reaching too far here,

1064
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,480
like the ocean.

1065
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,760
I think it's supposed to be...

1066
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,040
Wait, who did you just ask?

1067
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,760
The camera guy.

1068
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,240
Oh, I didn't...

1069
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,200
The camera guy.

1070
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,160
Oh, yeah, the zoom?

1071
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,120
It's a dope mic.

1072
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,160
Great mic, sir.

1073
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,840
So I don't know who that is in all the tip sheet.

1074
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,960
We just got to keep pressing through.

1075
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,800
Romantic destinations for a vacation spot.

1076
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,680
Maybe spend some time, stay home, get to know each other better.

1077
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,240
That's okay.

1078
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,840
Go to the lake.

1079
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,320
Here's what I'm going to say.

1080
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,360
What if you just spend some time with your partner,

1081
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,320
making love?

1082
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,120
Oh, making love.

1083
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,160
That's so good, Travis.

1084
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,680
I have one, but you go to Bali, but you do go to the McDonald's.

1085
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,920
And you do go to the Starbucks.

1086
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,520
Go to McDonald's at Bali.

1087
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,600
The McDonald's at Bali is so wack.

1088
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,800
They have the best burgers.

1089
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,480
Hi, brothers.

1090
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,200
I'm getting...

1091
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,400
I shouldn't be checking my phone.

1092
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,160
It does make you look super bored.

1093
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,240
It doesn't make you look like you're not really paying attention.

1094
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,840
This is where I'm getting the questions from, though.

1095
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,920
This is a beautiful family.

1096
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,760
You can't keep saying that.

1097
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,560
So I just want to get the next question going because we answered that one.

1098
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,240
One of the benefits of my job is having a fair amount of vacation time.

1099
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,400
I'm of the opinion it's best to take a couple of days here and there,

1100
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,560
saving off corporate burnout.

1101
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,400
Short vacation or long vacation?

1102
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,520
Short vacation or long vacation.

1103
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,240
That's from Ezra.

1104
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,080
Short vacation or long vacation?

1105
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,400
I do like this because Ezra specifically says like,

1106
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,440
take one day off every so often so you get a three-day weekend

1107
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,760
or save it up and do like two weeks off.

1108
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,080
Yeah.

1109
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,280
I almost always prefer the big one.

1110
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,840
Because I don't work very hard usually.

1111
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:04,960
And so every day is kind of a vacation.

1112
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,880
So you really have to take that many days to even notice...

1113
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,920
To even feel it.

1114
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,920
I got to take a pretty big dose of PTO there.

1115
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,440
I would say that it really depends on how close you live to dope shit.

1116
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,160
Because if you could take three-day weekends and go do awesome stuff,

1117
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,520
but if you get yourself an extra day and then you don't have anything to do with it.

1118
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,880
This is going so good.

1119
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,000
It's 6.04.

1120
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,760
Still time for lots of other people to be on our show.

1121
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,720
And now we're in our groove.

1122
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,320
The heat's picking up now, you know what I mean?

1123
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,360
I'm not nervous anymore.

1124
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,240
I'm not nervous anymore.

1125
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,280
I came back around the other side.

1126
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,480
I'm just a professional doing a job.

1127
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,120
I'm worried that we're going to get too overconfident

1128
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,280
and that'll make us make big mistakes.

1129
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,760
Yes.

1130
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,440
I don't know what the fuck just happened.

1131
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:47,120
And that is both literal and sort of like emphasizing the wildness of whatever you just

1132
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,440
heard.

1133
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,960
I don't know where this break's going to be,

1134
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:55,920
but I bet it was after something just really either skin-crawlingly awkward or delightful.

1135
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,480
That was kind of where I was hovering between.

1136
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,480
It might be skin-crawlingly delightful.

1137
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,120
I don't know.

1138
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,680
Maybe like a Nightmare Before Christmas kind of vibe.

1139
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,960
This is terrifying, but man, I'm really enjoying myself.

1140
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,640
Folks, hey, become a member of the Max Fun Network.

1141
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,880
Jeez, it would be so cool.

1142
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,920
Because if you do it, you can help us meet our goal.

1143
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,360
25,000 new and upgrading members.

1144
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,800
If you're already a member, thank you so much.

1145
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,360
If you've been consuming more content from the network lately,

1146
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,880
maybe think about upping your donation because that'll make you eligible for all the great

1147
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,200
pledge gifts that we're going to tell you about right now.

1148
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,800
Travis, $5, go.

1149
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,760
Well, Griffin, that's a great question.

1150
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,880
At $5, you are going to get a exclusive bonus content that we talked about before.

1151
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,360
You've got, listen, we have been doing Max Fun Drive since 2011.

1152
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,720
So there is seven years of bonus content.

1153
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,800
Oh, this is our eighth year.

1154
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,760
This is our eighth year, my bud.

1155
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,960
This is our eighth year.

1156
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,520
Eight years, about 11 different things, including like some videos we did where we're like riffing

1157
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,840
over old educational shorts.

1158
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,360
But not only that, you're also going to get access to all of the Just Jon Hodgman bonus

1159
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:09,600
content, all of the Adventure Zone bonus content, all of the wonderful bonus content,

1160
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,760
all of the Sawbones bonus.

1161
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,040
Like, it's hours and hours and hours and hours and hours.

1162
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,000
It's incredible.

1163
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,400
Justin, $10 a month, go.

1164
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,480
$10 a month, you're going to get a drive exclusive enamel pen designed by Megan Lynn Cott.

1165
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,560
You pick your favorite, and you're going to get a cool pen.

1166
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,400
The one for this year emphasizes our theme of Stronger Together for Collaborate 18.

1167
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,200
And it is a very cool looking pen.

1168
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,280
And you also get a Max Fun membership card.

1169
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,200
And that is for $10 a month, plus all the exclusive bonus content.

1170
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,760
Yeah, on each level, you get everything up to that level.

1171
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:50,800
So at $20 a month, there's a Max Fun family cookbook with recipes from Max Fun hosts,

1172
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,000
contains dozens of recipes from cocktails to dessert, and you get a set of handsome

1173
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,880
space-themed cookie cutters, plus the pen designed by Megan Lynn Cott, plus the bonus

1174
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,600
content.

1175
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,160
That is a great gift.

1176
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,520
There's a recipe from our...

1177
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,000
I sent in our mom's recipe for chest bars is up in there.

1178
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,320
Did you guys put anything in?

1179
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,640
I think that's the the McElroy contribution.

1180
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,080
That's our contribution.

1181
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,440
Man, you guys are lazy, huh?

1182
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,000
Yeah, sure.

1183
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,560
So there's...

1184
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,760
I guess I'm the only team player here.

1185
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,680
Yeah, I guess I'm just so busy generating hours and hours of wonderful content for our

1186
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,240
listeners.

1187
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,880
Well, I'm the one actually making the wonderful content.

1188
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,280
And that's a fun thing I can say.

1189
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,520
No, I'm making a lowercase w.

1190
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,480
If you want to step it up, we got a $35 a month level.

1191
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,240
So you listen to a ton of shows and you want to support the whole network, $35 a month

1192
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,640
will get you a one liter juice carafe, beautifully and permanently engraved with the Max Fun

1193
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,440
rocket logo.

1194
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,120
It's not just for juice, though.

1195
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,400
And it says that in the copy.

1196
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,560
And I think you're smart enough to piece that together.

1197
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,600
But the copy thinks maybe you need some help with it.

1198
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,800
But it's great for tastefully displaying all your beverages.

1199
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,400
And you get the cookbook.

1200
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,760
You get the cookie cutters.

1201
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,640
You get the pen.

1202
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,080
You get the bonus content.

1203
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,960
And you help support us a whole bunch and we appreciate it.

1204
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,280
And then-

1205
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,240
Now we should be clear.

1206
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,280
Here's the thing.

1207
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,040
The carafe is not just for juice, but strangely the cookie cutters are.

1208
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,560
Yeah, you got to pour juice in the cookie cutters.

1209
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,360
Can't explain it.

1210
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,200
But that maybe wasn't as self-explanatory.

1211
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,560
So just wanted to make that clear.

1212
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,560
There's higher levels you can go donate at.

1213
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,400
And if you want to do that, like, thank you.

1214
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,680
But these levels, honestly, they're sort of the bread and butter of our network.

1215
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,520
And that's what a lot of people can afford to do for content that they like.

1216
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,800
And man, that just-

1217
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,160
It's just the best, y'all.

1218
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,160
Like, it really means a lot to us.

1219
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,880
And we so appreciate you going to maximumfund.org forward slash donate and getting on board.

1220
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,560
These gifts are to make it clear for new and upgrading members.

1221
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,840
So like, if you're at five bucks a month right now, you upgrade to $10 a month.

1222
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,240
You're going to get the pen and the bonus content, obviously.

1223
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,120
And so on.

1224
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,000
So, but if you can hop on at 35.

1225
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,800
Wow, 35.

1226
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,840
That's so flattering.

1227
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,160
Thank you.

1228
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,320
20, 10, 5.

1229
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,840
Anything you can give, honestly, means the world.

1230
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,800
It only takes a couple minutes.

1231
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,640
Go to maximumfund.org slash donate.

1232
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,560
Choose the membership level that's right for you.

1233
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,200
And then you'll choose which max fund shows you listen to.

1234
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,320
And just like that, you are a member.

1235
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,120
And then you've helped us.

1236
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:11,760
You've helped us.

1237
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,200
Listen, when we started doing this, we weren't making any money off of it.

1238
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,520
And we were doing it just as a goofy goof.

1239
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,200
And didn't think anything was ever coming of it.

1240
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,200
And now it's turned into a career.

1241
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,560
This is Travis's whole job right now.

1242
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,440
Dad got to retire from the radio station last year.

1243
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,640
And just do this full time.

1244
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,280
Because the donations you all have brought in for the Adventure Zone.

1245
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,400
Like, this has made it.

1246
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,920
He probably would have retired anyway.

1247
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,200
He's very old.

1248
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,000
He's so old.

1249
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,080
Can't press the buttons on the switchboard anymore.

1250
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,240
Old, old fingers and tired old bones.

1251
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,680
And they're old, hollow bones.

1252
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,160
Withered fingers, no muscle, no skin.

1253
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,760
Just skeleton bones down there.

1254
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,360
But you've helped turn his life a little bit easier.

1255
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,480
Because he doesn't have to press all the dials and knobs on the thing anymore.

1256
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,520
And he still announces loudly what country music song people are about to hear.

1257
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,680
He does it in the privacy of his own house.

1258
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,040
And mostly he's just listening to radio and trying to guess what the next one's going to be.

1259
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,540
Right.

1260
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,040
That's all to say you all have made like a genuine material impact on our lives

1261
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,360
by allowing us to turn this into a career.

1262
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,120
And we are so grateful for it.

1263
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,280
And if you listen, you've never donated before.

1264
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,360
And you want to help contribute to that.

1265
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,640
Just think about becoming a member.

1266
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,720
Maximumfund.org slash donate.

1267
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,760
The one last thing I want to say.

1268
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,960
And we'll reiterate this a couple times over the next two weeks.

1269
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,160
But one of the amazing things about the structure of Max Fund and you the donors

1270
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:40,560
is that your money, your donations, your support is going directly to the shows that you love.

1271
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,640
This is not like an amorphous, you know.

1272
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,400
You don't send your money in and then hope eventually it gets to-

1273
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,760
No, like when you donate, you pick the shows you listen to.

1274
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,320
And that's where the majority of your money goes.

1275
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:57,600
So like if you listen to, you know, My Brother, My Brother, Me, Adventure Zone, right?

1276
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,000
And you're like, oh yeah, I became a $5 donor.

1277
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,520
And then over the last year, you started listening to Wonderful and Sawbones

1278
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,000
and the Schmaners and Trends Like These and Still Buffering.

1279
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,200
And you're like, well, now I get even more content.

1280
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,000
And now I want to support all the co-hosts on those shows.

1281
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,120
It's very direct.

1282
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,440
Yeah, you can then bump it up to 10.

1283
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,600
And now your money is going to support the shows that you love.

1284
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,440
Yeah, listen, we love being a part of the Maximum Fund Network.

1285
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,600
We love the support that our listeners have shown us

1286
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,040
in the eight years that we've been doing this.

1287
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,240
And God, that's wild.

1288
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,680
We are coming up on a decade and that's like a wild amount of time to me to even conceive of.

1289
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,960
It's no joke, the longest job I've ever had.

1290
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,520
This is the longest employment I've ever had.

1291
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,600
So you're curious to hear what other celebrities we humiliate ourselves in front of.

1292
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,280
So we're going to get back to the rest of the episode now,

1293
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,680
but we'll be back at the end to talk a little bit more about The Drive.

1294
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,640
Thank you all so much.

1295
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,800
Maximumfund.org slash donate.

1296
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,640
And just listen to us fall completely on our asses

1297
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,440
in a professional environment that we were not equipped to take on.

1298
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:58,800
Who's that?

1299
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,240
Hey, Justin, who's that?

1300
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:00,960
I hate this job.

1301
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,840
Justin, Justin, look at the faces.

1302
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,120
Justin, Justin, look at the beautiful faces.

1303
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,000
Can you find the face before they get to us?

1304
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,560
Justin, get there.

1305
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:10,960
Come on.

1306
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,080
The fun is in the challenge, Justin.

1307
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:14,560
No idea.

1308
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,160
This is actually very helpful.

1309
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,120
Okay.

1310
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:25,840
So to recap, a woman standing behind us has started narrating into her phone.

1311
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,040
She knows these people more than we do.

1312
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,040
So she hit me in the head with her phone.

1313
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,160
So now she owes me for the information I'm drifting off of her.

1314
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,960
Oh, my God.

1315
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,960
Steve Croft, Steve Croft, Steve Croft, right?

1316
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,320
Steve Croft is, of course, the one and only.

1317
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,000
Justin has a four step process.

1318
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,600
Steve Croft, 60 minutes.

1319
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,160
Fuck off.

1320
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,760
He's going to respect our journalistic chops.

1321
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,120
You guys have four mics.

1322
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,080
Usually I only have one.

1323
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,080
You guys are real pros.

1324
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,160
Hey, it's me, Steve Croft.

1325
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,600
60 minutes.

1326
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,440
He's four feet away from us.

1327
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,480
What the fuck?

1328
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,760
He's fucking about it.

1329
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,680
He's four feet as the crow flies.

1330
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,120
I did my best.

1331
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:17,760
All right, Justin.

1332
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,640
Flip, flip, flip.

1333
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,760
No, I have a page of just handsome guys.

1334
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,120
Maybe that's Matt Doyle.

1335
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,240
It's not Matt Doyle.

1336
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,760
If you say Matt Doyle one more time.

1337
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,520
I've thought four people were Matt Doyle.

1338
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,080
Stop it.

1339
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:28,800
Corey Cott?

1340
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,320
Oh, yeah.

1341
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:30,880
I love that.

1342
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,400
One of those guys is Corey Cott, for sure.

1343
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,160
Travis, I believe in you.

1344
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,240
Travis is going to try to corral Steve Croft into talking to us.

1345
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,560
And we're going to ask him.

1346
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,520
Wait, wait, what are you asking?

1347
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,120
Scariest sea creature.

1348
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:45,760
No, no, no.

1349
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,280
What's the most frightening sea creature?

1350
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,320
Romantic beach.

1351
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:48,800
Oh, we did that.

1352
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,520
No, we did that one.

1353
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,680
Short vacations or long vacations?

1354
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,000
Yes.

1355
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,120
How do you make the most of your time off?

1356
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:53,520
No, no, no.

1357
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,400
Short or long vacations.

1358
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,320
Can we ask you some questions real quick for our podcast?

1359
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,840
We do a podcast called My Brother.

1360
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,600
My Brother means an advice podcast.

1361
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,040
We are wondering, do you think people should take long vacations or short vacations?

1362
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,080
What do you prefer?

1363
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,840
Lots of short vacations or one long.

1364
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm a big fan.

1365
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,280
It depends on how hard you work.

1366
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,280
We don't work at all.

1367
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,400
You don't work at all.

1368
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,840
I think if you have really a grind, I think that the longer vacation is a little bit better.

1369
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,920
You seem like somebody who's on their grind all the time.

1370
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,360
Do you prefer the long extended?

1371
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:25,760
Normally, we shut down for the most 60 minute shut down for the month of July.

1372
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,560
And that's a great four weeks.

1373
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,680
Just live it up.

1374
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,160
Yeah.

1375
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,760
One quick last question.

1376
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,480
What's the scariest sea creature, in your opinion?

1377
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:34,960
The what?

1378
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,400
Scariest sea creature.

1379
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,080
Scariest sea creature, in your opinion?

1380
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,360
Well, the only one I've seen really up close is an anaconda.

1381
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,440
Or not an anaconda, a barracuda.

1382
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:45,920
A barracuda.

1383
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,760
The only ones I've seen up close are a barracuda.

1384
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,280
Like about this far away.

1385
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,480
That's very terrifying.

1386
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,280
That would be it.

1387
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,240
And like a tanker exposed, like the barracuda could get you.

1388
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,920
You're just like inches away from one.

1389
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,440
Yeah, and I had a shiny ring on, too.

1390
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,800
I'm so low.

1391
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,160
Everybody said never wear them.

1392
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,480
Yeah, it was in the Florida Keys.

1393
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,760
I'm so glad you're still with us.

1394
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,080
I'm glad you're here.

1395
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,200
Thank you so much for talking with us.

1396
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:07,840
Thanks for your time.

1397
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,480
Enjoy the show.

1398
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,120
Okay, so professional.

1399
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:13,440
Yeah.

1400
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,000
Yeah.

1401
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,960
So great.

1402
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,440
So great.

1403
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:22,320
He even went back and did a second take of barracuda anaconda.

1404
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,120
A clean take.

1405
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,520
Clean take.

1406
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,560
He gave us a clean take on that.

1407
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,280
He gave us a clean take.

1408
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,520
Well, we shouldn't talk about that because we probably edited it.

1409
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:27,760
Yeah.

1410
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,400
Yeah.

1411
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:28,640
Okay.

1412
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,320
Now, Justin, did you identify this?

1413
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,200
Is this Matt Doyle?

1414
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,040
No, I don't know who this is.

1415
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:33,600
You looked it up.

1416
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,080
You said you knew who it was.

1417
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,120
I think it's Doctor Who.

1418
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,120
It's not Doctor Who, Justin.

1419
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,720
He looks slick and...

1420
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,280
Excuse me.

1421
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,760
What is this person in the suit here coming out with a bow tie?

1422
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,480
Travis is now...

1423
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,240
Okay, great.

1424
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,040
Thank you very much.

1425
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,520
Travis is trying to gather intel.

1426
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,280
Travis is our little spy.

1427
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,720
So we've all got different roles.

1428
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,720
Let's explain our process because I feel like people want to know

1429
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,920
what it's like for us in the red carpet.

1430
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,120
We've all got roles.

1431
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,320
I'm doing tech.

1432
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,680
I'm holding the stuff.

1433
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,280
Justin's over here and he keeps yelling about power and hell

1434
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,040
and everything's really scary.

1435
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,480
He's a misdirect guy.

1436
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,680
He keeps yelling the name Matt Doyle every four and a half minutes.

1437
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,080
And Travis is kind of our Tinker Tailor soldier spy out there.

1438
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,720
Gathering all the deets on all the...

1439
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,760
I'm the face man.

1440
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,640
All the celebs.

1441
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,680
I should have committed this whole sheet to memory.

1442
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,520
Told you so.

1443
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,000
Told you so.

1444
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,800
Corey Cott.

1445
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,600
Corey Cott.

1446
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,080
We got this.

1447
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,880
We're getting into our fucking swing right now.

1448
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,080
Can we cuss when we're talking to them?

1449
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,280
Yeah, fuck yeah.

1450
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,640
Okay, not like that.

1451
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,280
Oh, not now.

1452
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:33,840
You just...

1453
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,680
Four people just turned around to look at you.

1454
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,480
He was in Newsies.

1455
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,280
He was in Newsies.

1456
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,880
He was in Newsies on Broadway.

1457
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,760
I'm sorry, people.

1458
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,360
We don't know who anybody is.

1459
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:41,760
Yeah, we're the worst.

1460
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,880
It's not their...

1461
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,440
Please understand.

1462
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,880
It's our fault, not theirs.

1463
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,040
Is Travis gonna try to corral?

1464
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:47,680
Oh yeah, I'm gonna get him.

1465
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,560
I think grab Corey Cott.

1466
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,200
So this will be what?

1467
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:51,760
Five, six?

1468
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,080
Are you gonna ask about long or short vacations?

1469
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:54,880
We're still on that question.

1470
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,120
Yeah, I think so.

1471
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,560
I might ask a designated...

1472
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,560
Corey, can we ask you some quick questions?

1473
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,120
Hello.

1474
00:52:59,120 --> 00:52:59,600
Oh, thanks.

1475
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,000
We do an advice podcast called My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1476
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,360
It's a weird fit for a red carpet.

1477
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,160
It's a weird fit.

1478
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,360
An advice podcast?

1479
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:05,680
Yeah.

1480
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,160
Oh, cool.

1481
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:06,880
We've never done a...

1482
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,280
Nobody's ever recorded a podcast at a Broadway premiere before.

1483
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:09,920
You're groundbreaking.

1484
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,400
You're a pioneer.

1485
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,440
You're a revolutionary.

1486
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,000
And you're a part of it.

1487
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,960
So, congratulations.

1488
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:13,680
That's one of my history.

1489
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,280
In the Guinness Book of World Records Certificators.

1490
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:15,600
You're here.

1491
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,160
Welcome.

1492
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,640
We're doing beach-themed questions from our listeners.

1493
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:23,760
Okay, cool. The first is, do you prefer to save up your vacation time for one long trip

1494
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,160
or do several sort of short little getaways?

1495
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,280
Short or long vacations?

1496
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,760
I think I'd rather do a long vacation, but I think my life only allows for little short

1497
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,560
vacations most of the time.

1498
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,520
Ain't that the way?

1499
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,240
So, it's more like what I'm allowed to do.

1500
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,320
Yeah, that sounds really restrict...

1501
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,440
You should just do a podcast.

1502
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,000
We do nothing.

1503
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,480
Yeah, it's way...

1504
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,760
This is a vacation right now.

1505
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,840
Yeah, maybe should I just quit and just come with you guys?

1506
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,320
Yeah, you are.

1507
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,920
All right, I'm officially a part of the advice podcast.

1508
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,960
Welcome, Corey Cott.

1509
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,080
This will be the behind the music.

1510
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:48,560
Sure.

1511
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,760
This is where Corey's career...

1512
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,080
Yeah, sure.

1513
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,040
This is where...

1514
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,400
All his promise he left...

1515
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,160
Where he really started making his money.

1516
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,200
Second question, scariest sea creature?

1517
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,080
I mean, probably like a great white shark or something.

1518
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:06,880
That's the correct answer.

1519
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,960
Everybody tries to do these clever answers, but that's why they make a movie about this.

1520
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,520
Sure.

1521
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,400
If I'm actually gonna...

1522
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,640
If I'm swimming by myself in the ocean with nothing around me,

1523
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,960
I'm gonna be most terrified of a great white shark.

1524
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,760
Let me ask you this, Corey.

1525
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,280
Steve Croft's a barracuda.

1526
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,320
It's like a barrac...

1527
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,120
No, no, no.

1528
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,160
Let me ask you this.

1529
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,440
Let's go a little deeper here.

1530
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,800
What would be the sea creature that you wouldn't admit you would be afraid to see,

1531
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,240
but you'd totally be afraid to see?

1532
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,400
Oh, that's a really good question.

1533
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,680
It doesn't mean it's anything.

1534
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,320
Sure, sure, sure.

1535
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,020
Sure.

1536
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:42,080
Well, probably some sort of jellyfish, because I just like octopus.

1537
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,360
I actually like stingrays.

1538
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,840
I feel like stingrays are pretty cool and uncharacteristically nice most of the time,

1539
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,600
at least in my experience.

1540
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,600
But jellyfish, something with long tentacles.

1541
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,100
I don't...

1542
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,000
It's a little freaky to me.

1543
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,880
Good eating, though.

1544
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,360
What's that?

1545
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:55,760
Good eating.

1546
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,320
Good eating.

1547
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:56,880
Absolutely.

1548
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,480
Nothing wrong with that.

1549
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,040
Absolutely.

1550
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,840
That's very true.

1551
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,640
Fry those up, man.

1552
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,360
Fry those tentacles up.

1553
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:01,920
It's a good meal.

1554
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,640
Heck yeah.

1555
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,280
Thank you so much.

1556
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:03,600
Thank you so much.

1557
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,000
Thank you, guys.

1558
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,480
Good luck.

1559
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:04,880
Thank you.

1560
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,840
Thank you.

1561
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,160
Thank you.

1562
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,300
Thanks.

1563
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,800
It's 24 minutes.

1564
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,840
What time is it, Juice?

1565
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,520
It's 6.14.

1566
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:11,760
All right.

1567
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,360
Another 16 minutes.

1568
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,120
There's Ethan Supplee.

1569
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,320
We don't got to look that one up.

1570
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,120
That's a slam dunk.

1571
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:17,840
We're going to get Ethan.

1572
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,200
I'm going to try really hard not to ask him about Boy Meets World.

1573
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:21,760
Don't do that.

1574
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:22,880
Don't do that.

1575
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,000
I'm going to try so hard.

1576
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,040
You're not going to do that.

1577
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,200
I'm going to try so hard not to try.

1578
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:27,680
Look at me.

1579
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,480
You're not going to do that.

1580
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,360
I'm going to try so hard.

1581
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:29,840
Look at us.

1582
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,400
Look at us.

1583
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:30,880
Look at us.

1584
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,360
Look at us.

1585
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,560
You're not going to do that.

1586
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,040
Okay.

1587
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,800
I didn't know you had to like...

1588
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,520
It does...

1589
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,080
Oh my God.

1590
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,920
It's Mary Lou Henner freaking out.

1591
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,320
Okay.

1592
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:38,880
I'm fine.

1593
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,880
I'm fine, everyone.

1594
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,960
So don't ask about Boy Meets World.

1595
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,280
Okay.

1596
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:45,680
Great.

1597
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:45,920
Great.

1598
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,840
Unless it comes up.

1599
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,080
What?

1600
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,520
We need another question from our listeners.

1601
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:49,840
Oh yeah.

1602
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,160
Hurry.

1603
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,720
Something new to ask about.

1604
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,560
I feel like we could do this every week.

1605
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,040
It's easy.

1606
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:55,760
This is our new job.

1607
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,880
The regular podcast is canceled.

1608
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:58,960
Suggestion...

1609
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,440
Oh God.

1610
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,080
When I go on vacation...

1611
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:02,320
No.

1612
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,520
Justin's fucking broken.

1613
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:05,840
Justin.

1614
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,040
I have a problem in my head.

1615
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,000
I took a beat chicken.

1616
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,760
How do you enjoy the...

1617
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,160
How do you...

1618
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,920
How do you take advantage of beats?

1619
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,440
We'll go back to the destination.

1620
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,160
What's your favorite beat?

1621
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,680
Just ideal vacation.

1622
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,960
Drop the beach bullshit.

1623
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,520
Okay.

1624
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,040
This is the beach bullshit.

1625
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,240
And we'll set people up.

1626
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,840
Ethan, can we ask you some quick questions?

1627
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,240
Hi.

1628
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,320
We do an advice podcast called My Brother, My Brother.

1629
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,240
I can hold on to it if you want to or you can.

1630
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:26,480
Okay.

1631
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,360
It's insulting, I feel like, to be like, now you hold it.

1632
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,320
You have work to do.

1633
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:30,960
One job.

1634
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,840
This is our first...

1635
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,120
We have four microphones here.

1636
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,160
This is wild.

1637
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:34,640
We've never...

1638
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,080
We're recording a podcast.

1639
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:36,320
Okay.

1640
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,280
We do an advice show called My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1641
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,400
And we're talking about...

1642
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,440
Who are the brothers?

1643
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,080
All three of us.

1644
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,280
You're all three brothers.

1645
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:43,440
Yeah.

1646
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,400
We asked Jimmy Buffett if we could do this and he said yes.

1647
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,760
And I don't think he really thought through it.

1648
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,480
And I don't think we did either.

1649
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,200
We didn't either.

1650
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:49,920
We've never done this.

1651
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,720
So we're freaking out a little bit.

1652
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,200
But it's fine.

1653
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:51,600
It's fine.

1654
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,920
When you normally do your podcast, are you in a more sound protected environment?

1655
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,440
In our home, in our sweatpants.

1656
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,800
We go to a Kmart.

1657
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:03,360
More importantly, we're in a people protected environment where we don't see so many people.

1658
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,080
I'm with you.

1659
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,160
I like people protected environments.

1660
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,840
This is so hazardous.

1661
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,240
Thank you.

1662
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,600
There's a lot of folks here.

1663
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:10,480
Yeah.

1664
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:16,240
So we have questions from our audience about beach stuff.

1665
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,520
What's your ideal vacation?

1666
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,640
What's your ideal getaway?

1667
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:23,360
My ideal vacation is anywhere with a warm beach.

1668
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:28,160
And I will sit in the water up to my tits all day long.

1669
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,240
Do you take a lot of stuff down?

1670
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,080
Or do you go to the beach by yourself?

1671
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,480
Or do you have a lot of equipment you like to bring down?

1672
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,320
I have four children.

1673
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,040
OK, I hear you.

1674
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,920
OK, I hear you.

1675
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,240
Each child requires their own special equipment.

1676
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,040
So the equipment is nauseating.

1677
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,840
The amount of equipment that we have to take.

1678
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,320
Gadgets and gizmos and things.

1679
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:50,960
Yeah.

1680
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,080
One last question.

1681
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,520
Do you think Atlantis is real?

1682
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:58,400
I told Travis not to ask this because I'm lying that this is just very interesting.

1683
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,120
And I don't.

1684
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,560
But I'm a multiverse guy.

1685
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,880
If we are living in a multiverse, it's real somewhere.

1686
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,080
Holy shit.

1687
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,440
That's a good answer.

1688
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,720
Damn it, that's good.

1689
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,600
Thank you so much.

1690
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,960
I don't think it's here on Earth.

1691
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,520
So stop looking.

1692
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,960
OK, all right.

1693
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,520
Fair enough.

1694
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,400
Well, thank you very much.

1695
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:18,720
Thanks so much.

1696
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,840
Thanks for talking with us.

1697
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,840
Enjoy the show.

1698
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,720
That was so good.

1699
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,760
Yeah, that was really great too.

1700
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,800
Totally professional.

1701
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,240
It felt him or us?

1702
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:26,800
Oh, both.

1703
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,840
But totally professional.

1704
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,600
Yeah, I liked when you said tits.

1705
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,360
Give me something other than Atlantis.

1706
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,920
Scariest sea creature is so good.

1707
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,640
That's a classic.

1708
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,240
I'm going to get Mary Lou Hinner.

1709
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,600
Are you going to get Mary Lou Hinner?

1710
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:39,840
OK.

1711
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,320
Ask about Inverted.

1712
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,920
Which sea creature does she want to own as a pet?

1713
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:44,880
OK.

1714
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,480
What's the most lovable sea creature?

1715
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,520
What's the most lovable sea creature?

1716
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,800
No, that's like benign.

1717
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,760
I want to know scares.

1718
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,880
I want to know fears.

1719
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,640
I want to see any people's souls.

1720
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,800
I'm going to put that sigh in the episode.

1721
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,000
I feel like it tells a story.

1722
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,680
Can we ask you some quick questions?

1723
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,240
Two seconds.

1724
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,280
Super quick question.

1725
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,440
We do an advice podcast, and we're recording here.

1726
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,960
We've never been on a red carpet before.

1727
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,520
One question.

1728
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,360
What do you think the scariest sea creature is?

1729
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,160
Ursula from Little Mermaid.

1730
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,760
Yes, that's a good answer.

1731
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,240
Thank you.

1732
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,040
Thank you, Ms. Hinner.

1733
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:13,520
You crushed it.

1734
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,440
I have a little three-year-old niece who lives with me.

1735
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,960
So trust me.

1736
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,160
And she's always here.

1737
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,920
Terrified of Ursula?

1738
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,800
As she should be.

1739
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,120
Thank you.

1740
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,080
That's a great answer.

1741
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,280
Thank you so much.

1742
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:23,680
All right.

1743
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,840
All right, we need to not scream into the microphones

1744
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,640
as Mary Lou Hinner gives us a very good Ursula

1745
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,600
answer to our question.

1746
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,240
Oh, shit.

1747
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,520
It's happening.

1748
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,000
Is that Jimmy?

1749
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,560
All right, Jimmy will stop and talk to us.

1750
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,400
Is that Jimmy?

1751
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,600
I don't know what Jimmy Buffett looks like.

1752
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,480
I've just realized I don't know what Jimmy Buffett looks like.

1753
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,480
Oh, it's going to be an audio disaster in here now.

1754
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,840
Jimmy Buffett has arrived at the venue.

1755
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,200
Everybody's going nuts for Jimmy.

1756
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,480
This is going to be not usable anymore.

1757
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,160
We're going to lead.

1758
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,960
When James comes, we're going to lead with Scariest Sea Creature.

1759
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,240
Okay.

1760
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,040
And then we're going to ask him why he made this decision.

1761
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:07,920
I think we should maybe, for him, do a little debrief on why the decision was made to include

1762
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,960
us at this event.

1763
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,520
I don't know that we'll be invited to his second Broadway show.

1764
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,880
No way.

1765
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,920
Did you?

1766
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,400
Did I?

1767
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,440
I don't think I ever...

1768
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:21,040
I think it's weird I'm at a point in my life where I could be very stressed out.

1769
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,200
And seeing Jimmy Buffett would put me at ease.

1770
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,440
Oh, there's my friend James.

1771
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,800
Are they still yelling for Jimmy Buffett?

1772
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,560
I don't know.

1773
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,840
I don't know if other people showed up.

1774
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,640
Do you think that all these people here from Margaritaville might be fans?

1775
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,160
Maybe.

1776
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,120
People are going to be very confused about the amount of time we're going to want to

1777
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,080
take with Jimmy Buffett.

1778
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,560
Well, he's a professional.

1779
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,080
He's probably going to breeze right past us.

1780
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:46,560
Yeah.

1781
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,560
That's the question, huh?

1782
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,040
What?

1783
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,320
Can we get Jimmy?

1784
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,040
Can we get Jimmy?

1785
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,920
Can we get Jimmy Buffett to talk to us?

1786
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,560
Probably.

1787
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,720
When he asks, hey guys, real quick, huddle up.

1788
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,120
We have like 30 seconds here because Jimmy Buffett's real close.

1789
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,640
But when he asks how it goes, can we all say it went super good and talk about all the

1790
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,320
great questions we got from Mark and the gang?

1791
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,760
We don't lie to them about how great we did a good job?

1792
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,560
Lie to them and say we did a great job and everybody's been complimenting us on our

1793
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,440
professionalism.

1794
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,000
Yeah, I know you're worried about taking a risk on us.

1795
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,840
We've been very professional the entire time.

1796
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,240
For sure.

1797
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,040
OK, so they told me I could step off the rope.

1798
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,160
I definitely didn't.

1799
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,240
And then I'll send him a special cut of this episode that's four minutes long of our like

1800
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,720
our times where we approach confidence professionals.

1801
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,880
Jimmy's just made a big face at us.

1802
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,080
I think he's going to come talk to us.

1803
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,360
We'll see here.

1804
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,040
The man, the man himself.

1805
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,040
So he's going to come and talk to you.

1806
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:41,680
Hi, Jimmy.

1807
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,400
How's it going?

1808
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:47,120
How's it going, Jimmy?

1809
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,560
How did the Tonight Show go?

1810
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,600
How did the Tonight Show go?

1811
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,800
The Tonight Show went great.

1812
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,360
Bill Hader.

1813
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:51,680
Come on.

1814
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,120
You got to follow Bill Hader.

1815
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,400
I met him as he was going.

1816
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,120
He was coming out.

1817
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:55,760
I was going in.

1818
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,560
I'm a big fan, though.

1819
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:00,160
I know you're taking a risk by letting us on the blue carpet here at the premiere.

1820
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,360
And what happened to the red carpet?

1821
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,960
Well, it's beach themed.

1822
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,760
I spilled a margarita.

1823
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,160
We've been real professional the entire time, though.

1824
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,920
And everybody's really complimented us.

1825
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,120
And they said it's been like we did a great job is what I'm saying.

1826
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,320
We're doing a great job for you.

1827
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,640
They said Jimmy made a good choice by letting you be here.

1828
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,440
And we said I agree.

1829
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,400
No, I'm trying to.

1830
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,240
They're impressed with your work here, you know?

1831
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,400
Those serious people are getting serious over there.

1832
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,480
It's been real good, though.

1833
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,440
We wanted to ask you, what do you think the scariest sea creature is?

1834
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,160
The what?

1835
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,520
Scariest sea creature.

1836
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,400
Well, sea creatures.

1837
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,760
Which one do you find the most frightening?

1838
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,600
Scariest sea creature?

1839
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,800
Again, we've been very professional.

1840
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:35,280
Haven't asked this.

1841
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,400
Moray eel.

1842
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:36,960
Moray eel.

1843
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:37,840
Why moray eel?

1844
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,520
Because I've had an encounter with one.

1845
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,120
Sharks don't bother me.

1846
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,280
Octopus or squid don't as long as they're not giants.

1847
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,640
But moray eel, yeah.

1848
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,080
I had one come out and swim out of the hole, you know?

1849
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,600
Why were you in its hole?

1850
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,720
Why were you looking at its hole?

1851
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,080
Why were you getting like towards its hole?

1852
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,200
Were you just swimming and just happened to be by the hole?

1853
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,280
I was trying to get lobsters out.

1854
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,720
I was hoping it was a lobster that came out.

1855
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,040
What if that was his lobster?

1856
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,480
Well, he can have it.

1857
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,240
You know, I gave it to him.

1858
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:04,740
All right.

1859
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,000
Well, congratulations on the show.

1860
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,360
That was fun yesterday.

1861
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:09,920
Yeah, it was.

1862
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,800
I had a good time.

1863
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,320
You and me and Len was chatting.

1864
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:12,960
It was fun.

1865
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,080
They were all happy about it.

1866
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:14,800
So I am, too.

1867
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,200
So, you know, we're talking about when

1868
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,520
Hamilton goes down to Puerto Rico,

1869
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,560
I'm thinking about doing the Dark Knights there

1870
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,800
and bringing the band over and still raise some money.

1871
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,240
Oh, yeah.

1872
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:26,880
That'd be fun.

1873
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,000
So we're neighbors here.

1874
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,040
We'll be neighbors down there.

1875
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:29,540
All right.

1876
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,280
Great to see you guys.

1877
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,880
And thank you for coming to the show.

1878
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,080
Good luck with the show.

1879
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,800
Everybody listen to my brother, my brother, and me.

1880
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,360
Great pass.

1881
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,600
Thanks, Jimmy.

1882
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,600
Oh, he's saying hi to the fans.

1883
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:41,920
Uh-oh.

1884
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,320
Oh, shit.

1885
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:42,880
Yeah, we did it.

1886
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,560
He's saying hi to the fans, but it's happening right next to me.

1887
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:44,800
There's four.

1888
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,280
Oh, wait.

1889
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,160
We should get a picture.

1890
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:46,480
Hold on.

1891
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,280
Let's get a quick picture.

1892
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,320
I'm going to send Jimmy Buffett.

1893
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,520
Thanks, Jimmy.

1894
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,000
Good luck.

1895
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:50,560
Break a leg.

1896
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,280
Great.

1897
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:51,780
Yes.

1898
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:53,540
Cut.

1899
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:55,940
Did great.

1900
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:56,880
OK.

1901
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,800
I think we need to get in, right?

1902
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,080
It starts at 630.

1903
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,600
You think we've done enough good work here?

1904
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,280
I mean, I feel like we've done our good work.

1905
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,320
I'm now in a photo.

1906
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,760
I've now been pulled into a photo.

1907
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,320
Fans of the podcast, I guess.

1908
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,720
Yeah, I think we should probably, maybe we need to get in there.

1909
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,760
Are you just saying that because you're scared?

1910
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,480
We do have more people.

1911
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,200
We could talk to.

1912
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:18,160
No, I think that that's the end of the chain of celebs here.

1913
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:18,560
I don't know.

1914
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,920
I see some people down there.

1915
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,920
I want to just, I'm feeling great.

1916
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,640
Let's kick it.

1917
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,920
You just want to keep going.

1918
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:28,800
I think it'd be weird if we, on our side, left the red carpet before everybody else.

1919
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,280
OK.

1920
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,280
Yeah, we're not supposed to leave first, right?

1921
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,640
The energy's gotten kind of strange.

1922
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,000
So it's weird.

1923
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,600
It's like everything's been pretty chill until the members of Jimmy Buffett's band showed up.

1924
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,000
And then the people behind us are losing their damn minds.

1925
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,040
Yeah, but it's good.

1926
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:41,680
And it's good.

1927
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,040
I'm glad they're excited.

1928
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,000
And that's not a surprise.

1929
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,320
There's a lot of JB fans in the house tonight.

1930
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:50,640
It's just a little, it's gotten kind of a stressful energy, I would say.

1931
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,600
The energy is quite strange.

1932
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,800
The energy has become a stressful energy.

1933
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,440
I think the thing, let's talk about next time.

1934
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:57,920
OK.

1935
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:03,920
Next time we do a Broadway premiere, the one thing that seemed to fuck people up the most

1936
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,840
is us handing them a microphone to talk into.

1937
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:06,880
So don't do that.

1938
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,640
So that one is weird for us to do.

1939
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,120
Also, stepping over the rope.

1940
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,720
You're not supposed to do that.

1941
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,480
So if you do a red carpet, you are supposed to be on the other end of the red carpet.

1942
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,000
Be more, be aggressive.

1943
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,120
You know what I mean?

1944
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,800
Not too aggressive.

1945
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,080
Don't be weird about it.

1946
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,360
But it's OK to make yourself physically present.

1947
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,400
Also, let's talk real quick about Escape to Margaritaville.

1948
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,320
It's escape to margaritavillemusical.com.

1949
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,120
It's open now.

1950
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,520
You can come see it at the beautiful Marquis Theater.

1951
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,280
Stay at the Mario Marquis.

1952
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,960
It's in the same building as the show.

1953
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:39,680
Super convenient.

1954
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,120
So convenient.

1955
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,400
It's a heck of a lot of fun.

1956
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,120
It's a great show.

1957
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:48,480
If you know Jimi Lovic's music, if you love Jimi Lovic's music, then you got a heart and ears.

1958
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,560
But also you're going to love this musical.

1959
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,520
And a fucking brain.

1960
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,400
And a fucking brain to hear the music.

1961
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,560
And if you don't, then you're brainless.

1962
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,840
And heartless.

1963
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,280
I don't know, maybe at least one lung.

1964
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,200
You probably need a lung.

1965
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,480
And you probably need like a heart.

1966
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,040
I mean, all the essential organs for sure.

1967
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:06,320
You'll barf up one lung from how hard you'll laugh at the great jokes.

1968
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,240
I feel like I didn't do a good job with Mary Lou Hinder.

1969
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,440
I feel like I kind of fucked that up.

1970
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,560
Well, here's what happened.

1971
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,320
You said, who's the scariest sea creature?

1972
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,280
She said, Ursula.

1973
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,320
And then you screamed the loudest noise in the universe.

1974
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:16,820
Yes!

1975
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:17,920
Directly at her.

1976
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:18,640
And I scared her.

1977
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,120
You scared her.

1978
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:23,600
Well, also, right before you screamed, a handler said, you got like two seconds.

1979
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,400
That's freaked me out.

1980
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,240
That's what panicked me.

1981
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,040
It wasn't my fault.

1982
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,160
You listened to her say, Ursula.

1983
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,360
You said that took about two seconds.

1984
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,840
And so you thought you disengaged just by yelling and yelling.

1985
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,400
OK.

1986
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,560
I think it looks like things are thinning out.

1987
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,320
Should we walk through the photo line now?

1988
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,400
That might be interesting.

1989
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,440
That's kind of a different.

1990
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,240
Nobody's ever podcasted across a photo line before.

1991
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,640
We got a pretty mobile operation here, except for our Tangelo snakes that we got.

1992
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:47,600
OK.

1993
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,720
I think we'd call it our last interview will be Jimmy, if that feels right.

1994
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,280
It feels good to me.

1995
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:51,440
Yeah.

1996
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,800
There's a certain dignity to that.

1997
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,240
And we've been going the full hour.

1998
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,120
We did a full hour.

1999
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:57,840
And here's the thing.

2000
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,440
We really don't need to check out with anybody.

2001
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,440
We could just turn off this microphone and walk away.

2002
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,880
We don't need anyone's permission.

2003
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,720
That sounds pretty cool.

2004
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,840
I OK.

2005
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:06,720
Let's close it down.

2006
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,720
Travis, just make sure you grab our placard off the ground

2007
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,560
so that there's no evidence of our even.

2008
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:10,800
Yeah.

2009
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,480
They'll never know.

2010
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,880
Are you guys sure we've got enough?

2011
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:15,200
Yeah.

2012
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,560
It seems like nobody else is coming.

2013
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:16,960
OK, let's go.

2014
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,320
Wait, but if anybody else does come.

2015
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,280
We can start back up.

2016
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,560
We're going to feel pretty silly.

2017
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:21,680
Shit.

2018
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,560
No, can I tell you guys?

2019
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,520
It's Al Roker.

2020
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:23,840
What?

2021
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:24,960
That's Al Roker.

2022
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,120
Oh, it is Al Roker.

2023
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:27,360
OK.

2024
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,360
OK, now we do have Al Roker approaching.

2025
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,480
I'm not talking anymore.

2026
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,440
I fucked up Mary Lou Hinner.

2027
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,720
I'm not going to fuck up Al Roker.

2028
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,920
OK, we're going to talk to Al Roker.

2029
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:34,400
This is going to happen.

2030
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,200
Do we need to talk about?

2031
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:35,760
It's Al Roker.

2032
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,960
We're going to leave like chumps.

2033
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,000
And then we got Al.

2034
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,680
OK, guys, this is a big show.

2035
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,160
Are we going to talk?

2036
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:40,880
This is a big show.

2037
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,280
Al's wearing jeans and a jacket that says USA on it,

2038
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,240
probably from the Olympics.

2039
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:45,680
What a pro move.

2040
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:46,880
Are we going to talk about that one episode

2041
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,040
where I made a bunch of sexual jokes about Al Roker?

2042
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:49,440
No.

2043
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,800
No, we're not going to talk about the one episode

2044
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,240
where we made sexual jokes about Al Roker.

2045
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,840
We're just going to be normal guys.

2046
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,440
I think we talked about playing Roker poker.

2047
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,000
OK, we can't do the advice thing anymore.

2048
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:58,800
It's too weird.

2049
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:03,280
Just tell him we're from regular guy's radio and we're not going to lie.

2050
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,480
OK, just tell him.

2051
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,760
We do an advice podcast.

2052
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,720
How do you like to?

2053
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,720
I'm going to lead the way on this one.

2054
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,480
Griffin's going to talk to somebody for once.

2055
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,680
OK, I'm going to get him, though.

2056
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,160
Here's the motion I like to do, by the way, and it's hard to describe.

2057
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,920
But it's kind of like a lean in, one hand out sheepishly,

2058
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,160
like a minute of your time going on.

2059
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,760
So he's got a microphone that is attached

2060
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,040
to the thing that I'm holding in my hand.

2061
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,000
It's almost like I'm fishing with Travis as bait,

2062
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,680
reeling him in with the microphone.

2063
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,320
There's one man who works here and I'm worried.

2064
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,960
He's the one who said we only got two seconds with Mary Lou.

2065
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,040
But he's also given me the names of people a couple of times.

2066
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:35,600
It's very helpful.

2067
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,800
I'm not saying it's his job.

2068
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,520
I'm worried he's going to see us and say, like, they don't.

2069
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,280
You don't want to talk to these guys.

2070
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,720
They don't deserve Al Roker.

2071
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,080
He knows about the sexual jokes.

2072
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,320
Do you think anyone has ever been this nervous to meet Al Roker?

2073
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,280
Yes or no?

2074
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,080
Yes.

2075
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:50,400
Yes.

2076
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,000
OK, hands down.

2077
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:52,480
I'm cool.

2078
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,800
And this is what he's here for.

2079
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,080
He's here to talk to the podcast.

2080
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,680
He's here to talk to the podcast.

2081
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,600
He's here to talk to the different podcasts that are here.

2082
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,320
And I'm not talking on this one, by the way.

2083
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:05,440
I'm smiling on it because I fucking Mary Lou here so bad.

2084
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:05,760
You know what?

2085
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,440
And I'm going to say this, and this might be even funnier.

2086
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:10,160
Even if you want to talk to me of something really funny and good to say,

2087
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,680
don't fucking, you hear me?

2088
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,560
I'm going to be silent.

2089
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,160
Don't you open that fucking mouth of yours.

2090
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,200
I'm going to be so silent.

2091
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,560
He's going to be like, what's this guy's deal?

2092
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,720
Al Roker's looking at us while we're having this confrontation.

2093
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,000
But I swear to God, Justin.

2094
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,480
I won't answer.

2095
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,160
Even if he asks what my deal is, I won't answer.

2096
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,360
I'll just stare him down.

2097
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,080
Intimidation game, baby, please don't do that, please do talk.

2098
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,280
Now can I turn around?

2099
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,520
Should I should I be your guy's photographer

2100
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,920
and take a picture of you talking with Al Roker?

2101
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:32,240
Yes.

2102
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:33,600
Is that good?

2103
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,680
I think people may not appreciate that.

2104
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,120
I feel like they want to be posed.

2105
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:37,920
They want to be posed.

2106
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:38,160
Yeah.

2107
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:38,720
That's a great point.

2108
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:38,960
Yeah.

2109
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,960
I've got a lot of selfies here on the right card.

2110
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,000
Jimmy was a friend.

2111
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,600
Al Roker is a future friend.

2112
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,480
Al Roker.

2113
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,760
The next time we see Al Roker, the next time we cover a Broadway premiere, we will.

2114
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,480
Next time.

2115
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,040
Next time.

2116
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,680
I am not going to talk.

2117
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,360
What did you guys think about the episode this week?

2118
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,960
Well, it was OK.

2119
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,040
Basically, we watched three people unspool.

2120
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,080
We can't think about that.

2121
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:58,320
No.

2122
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,080
We're going to edit this all until we sound very cool in it.

2123
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,520
I'm going to edit out like 30 of the times that Justin said that one dude's name over

2124
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,400
and over and over again.

2125
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,120
Which one?

2126
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:07,920
Matt Doyle?

2127
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,400
Matt Doyle.

2128
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,880
I thought a lot of you were Matt Doyle.

2129
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,320
This may end up in Matt Doyle's hands.

2130
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,400
And if it does, I'm sorry that Justin thought you were every handsome man who watched.

2131
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,200
This is not a joke.

2132
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,080
Every handsome man.

2133
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,680
He's a very handsome man.

2134
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,360
And we don't know a lot of people.

2135
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,280
Got a couple Matt Doyles coming up the carpet right now.

2136
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,280
You guys are about to get Al Roker, and I'm just going to stand and stare into the-

2137
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:27,520
Don't.

2138
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,480
You need to engage.

2139
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,120
I know what I said.

2140
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:29,920
You need to engage.

2141
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:30,640
It would be weird if you don't.

2142
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:31,440
I'm not engaging.

2143
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:31,920
Engage.

2144
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,000
Justin.

2145
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,560
I'll engage mentally, spiritually.

2146
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,200
Say hi.

2147
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,720
You're going to say you're not going to engage, or then the charm's going to pull you in.

2148
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,840
The Roker charm.

2149
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,120
Oh, he's not going to have time?

2150
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,320
Just one quick question.

2151
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:42,960
One quick question.

2152
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:44,480
Hey, how's it going?

2153
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,680
Real quick question.

2154
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,440
We do an advice podcast.

2155
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:47,920
Jimmy asked.

2156
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,840
How many mics do you guys have?

2157
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:50,160
I know.

2158
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,680
Everybody keeps making fun of how many-

2159
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,480
Freaking octopus.

2160
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,760
Everybody's making fun of me.

2161
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,120
You're an octopod push.

2162
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:55,360
Yes.

2163
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,120
Wow.

2164
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,800
Dude, what the hell?

2165
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,640
In case one goes out, there's three more?

2166
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,760
We've never done this before.

2167
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,960
We don't know how to do this.

2168
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:03,520
Podcast.

2169
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,240
How many microphones do you need?

2170
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:06,880
Too many.

2171
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,960
Technically, this is also a microphone, so that's five.

2172
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,080
You've got a mic, you've got a mic.

2173
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:10,960
What the heck?

2174
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:11,680
Yeah.

2175
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,360
Jeez, is there a question here?

2176
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:13,920
I don't know.

2177
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,920
How many mics does it take to screw in a light bulb?

2178
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,000
How many mics does it take to make a margarita?

2179
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:20,880
We get on.

2180
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,760
Ask a question.

2181
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,480
This is exactly what Justin was afraid of.

2182
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:25,040
Oh.

2183
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:25,840
You got, what's your-

2184
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:26,640
The play's over.

2185
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,200
Got to go.

2186
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,320
Glad we could come.

2187
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,600
Well, now I feel silly asking the questions.

2188
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,200
Oh, now you feel silly.

2189
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,480
Now you feel silly.

2190
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,440
You're holding 18 microphones.

2191
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,720
Now you feel silly.

2192
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,600
This is Jimmy's favorite podcast.

2193
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:47,600
I'm sorry.

2194
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,560
No, you're great.

2195
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,200
That was great.

2196
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,320
I think we're good.

2197
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:50,640
I think we're done.

2198
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,120
We're good.

2199
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,640
Thank you so much.

2200
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:53,600
I learned a lot.

2201
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:53,920
Thank you.

2202
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,760
Well, folks, we had a lot of fun here today.

2203
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,400
The power of record just made fun of us so bad

2204
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,240
that we can't do a podcast anymore.

2205
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:05,440
So you just go ahead and unsubscribe.

2206
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:06,800
Subscribe.

2207
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,480
That'll be the final episode.

2208
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,280
We had a good run.

2209
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,080
This is the finale.

2210
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,680
And I guess now we're going to cut to our post-game

2211
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:14,640
sort of debrief.

2212
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,160
Yeah, we'll debrief after this.

2213
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,600
With a special guest star, Matt Doyle.

2214
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,880
Wow.

2215
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,040
Thank you to us for surviving that because-

2216
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,880
I mean, yes.

2217
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,000
Did we?

2218
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,280
Yes, we're here.

2219
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,320
So I assume we survived.

2220
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,040
I've been living a half-life since that fateful night.

2221
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,680
And thank you so much to James for having us out there.

2222
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,480
I hope you don't regret it after hearing all of the work

2223
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,880
we did at your big night.

2224
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,200
But it's spilled milk.

2225
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,240
If you haven't yet, we would ask you one more time

2226
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,480
to go to maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

2227
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:49,920
And just to recap, this is money that is going directly

2228
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,760
to the shows that you love.

2229
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,960
When you donate, you choose the shows you listen to

2230
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,520
and they are the shows that benefit from your donation.

2231
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:01,920
So if you start listening to new shows and maybe you want

2232
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:06,000
to kick in a few extra bucks, it seriously is the only way

2233
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,520
that we can all sort of keep going.

2234
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,720
So it's really important.

2235
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,000
Don't wait for your neighbor to do it.

2236
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:11,520
You do it.

2237
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,000
No, but-

2238
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:12,640
You can do it.

2239
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,480
But to that point, I also want to say,

2240
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,520
if you are already a Max Fund donor and you're like,

2241
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,400
well, I can't afford to up my donation this year.

2242
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,040
Totally cool.

2243
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,480
Totally understand that.

2244
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:25,760
The last thing I would want is for anybody to make donations

2245
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:26,720
they can't afford.

2246
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:30,720
What you can do is you can go on social media.

2247
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,240
You go online, you talk to your friends,

2248
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,960
you text your friends, whatever you want to do to contact them

2249
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,840
and say, hey, I know that you listen to this too.

2250
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:38,800
I know you enjoy this.

2251
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,440
Are you a member?

2252
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,680
Have you considered becoming a member?

2253
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:43,200
This, the bonus content-

2254
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,800
Of the Church of Latter-day Saints.

2255
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,520
Oh, yeah.

2256
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,080
I thought you were doing something else.

2257
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,840
Have you thought about becoming a member

2258
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,920
and also supporting Max Fund?

2259
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,400
But yeah, get on there, talk about it, tweet at us,

2260
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,680
use the hashtag MaxFundDrive, share that link,

2261
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,680
maximumfund.org forward slash donate

2262
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,280
and help us get the word out.

2263
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,360
So last time, and we're going to wrap up here,

2264
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,600
go to maximumfund.org slash donate.

2265
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,040
Choose a donation level that's right for you.

2266
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:08,000
Pick the shows you listen to where your donation's going to go

2267
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,600
and don't wait.

2268
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,160
Just join up now and tell your friends.

2269
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,800
Help us hit that goal of 25,000 new and upgrading members

2270
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,960
and get some great gifts along the way.

2271
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,120
And let's see.

2272
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,000
I forget how we wrapped it up back in New York,

2273
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,560
but I think we did a really great job of it.

2274
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,000
Probably.

2275
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,120
We're a little buzzed.

2276
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,160
We survived.

2277
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,000
Yes, we did it.

2278
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,600
They can't say we didn't do it and we definitely didn't die.

2279
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,200
We did the red carpet thing, which you heard,

2280
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,680
and then we watched the premiere of Escape to Margaritaville

2281
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:42,480
and I had a hell of a time.

2282
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,760
Had a whale of a time.

2283
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:44,560
I will say this too.

2284
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,040
We were seated behind Martha Plimpton.

2285
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,560
She seemed to enjoy it very much.

2286
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,040
I had many emotions.

2287
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,000
I laughed.

2288
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,080
I mostly had sort of anger

2289
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,240
that Martha Plimpton skipped us in the line.

2290
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:58,640
You okay?

2291
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,200
Justin just had a monster yawn.

2292
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,040
Justin just had a monster yawn.

2293
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,640
I left it all on the court.

2294
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,600
You people heard.

2295
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,480
I left it all on the court.

2296
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,720
It is important to know, people at home,

2297
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:12,880
it's about 9.45 and it feels like it's 2 a.m.

2298
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,400
It's 9.45.

2299
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,680
It feels like it's 2 a.m.

2300
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:17,520
But Travis McElroy, I'm here to tell you,

2301
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,880
it's five o'clock somewhere.

2302
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:19,760
There it is.

2303
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:20,720
Listen, here's the thing.

2304
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:21,840
It's actually not.

2305
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,360
It's 9.57.

2306
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,120
It's 5.57 somewhere.

2307
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,120
It's 4.57 somewhere.

2308
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,080
Somebody's watching the clock like,

2309
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,840
fuck yeah dude, three more minutes.

2310
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,400
They have the Miller High Life just like cracked open,

2311
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,040
ready to part.

2312
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,640
Okay, I have the hint sheet, tip sheet here.

2313
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,120
This thing is a fucking mess.

2314
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,600
This is an old, old pirate map

2315
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:45,280
that Justin aged 50 years by crumpling it nervously.

2316
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,920
I mean, let's start broad strokes.

2317
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:48,320
Okay.

2318
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,240
Debrief about the red carpet.

2319
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:52,000
I screamed at Mary Lou Henner and I feel bad about it.

2320
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,800
You didn't scream at, you were caused to scream.

2321
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,800
He screamed, you were caused to scream

2322
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,720
towards Mary Lou Henner.

2323
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,960
It was, you couldn't get yourself.

2324
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,520
I heard her talking about it outside the restroom

2325
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:05,360
and she said, there was a young man

2326
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,520
who got so excited by my answer,

2327
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,040
it just made my day.

2328
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:09,680
Okay, good.

2329
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:10,400
Well, that's nice.

2330
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,440
Let's just go down the list here.

2331
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:12,320
I've got this list.

2332
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:13,920
Terry Collins.

2333
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,160
Dead to me.

2334
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,960
Former manager of the New York Mets, Terry Collins.

2335
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,080
No, thanks.

2336
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,200
We didn't flag you down

2337
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,040
and so we took a personal in front of the fact

2338
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,720
that you didn't come talk to us.

2339
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:29,200
Before we get to her, I want to say Mark Helgenberger.

2340
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,240
That was on me.

2341
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,760
Mark Helgenberger was Travis's.

2342
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:32,880
Mark, we didn't know.

2343
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,720
There was a moment where I felt your energy

2344
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,280
call to my energy and all I had to do was say,

2345
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,480
Mark, and you would have come over

2346
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,400
and I opened my mouth and I didn't

2347
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,960
and that's on me because I don't get starstruck that often.

2348
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:47,280
Yes.

2349
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,520
But I love CSI so much.

2350
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,640
Brenda Vaccaro.

2351
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,880
That's the legit shit right there.

2352
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,480
Brenda Vaccaro is a legit lady

2353
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,000
who's welcome on my brother, my brother, me,

2354
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:56,720
whatever she wants.

2355
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,280
She desperately wants to come on my brother, my brother, me.

2356
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,080
Sorry, what was it again?

2357
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,360
I had margaritas.

2358
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,280
The margaritas, you shouldn't,

2359
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,280
they should charge like $30 extra for the ticket

2360
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,960
and then there's like four margaritas

2361
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,560
waiting for you at your seat.

2362
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,560
It is such a good friend.

2363
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,720
Your margarita before you watch the show,

2364
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:17,840
escape to margaritaville.com.

2365
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,760
I'm not saying it's necessary to enjoy it.

2366
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,680
It's not, but it's like you're about to watch people

2367
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,400
drink margaritas for literally two hours.

2368
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,160
It is as if it's like a magic eye poster

2369
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,800
where as you watch escape to margaritaville

2370
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,000
and your eyes unfocused,

2371
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,240
the people on stage are actually looking at you going,

2372
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,640
we'll take a break if you need to go get a margarita.

2373
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,880
Justin, can you say Matt Doyle's name 40 times

2374
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,080
just to sort of take me back to-

2375
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,520
Matt Doyle, it wasn't Matt Doyle.

2376
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,560
It was Matt Doyle.

2377
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,520
It was Matt Doyle.

2378
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,840
Justin had an energy on the red carpet

2379
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,560
and we've done some debrief before we started recording

2380
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,120
just looking at the game tape.

2381
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,800
And I think a couple of the screw-ups

2382
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,040
were Justin yelling that this was hell

2383
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,480
literally inches from the people

2384
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:57,920
we were supposed to be talking to.

2385
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:58,480
It was a little uncomfortable.

2386
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,560
And then I think the other thing was him saying

2387
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,680
Matt Doyle over and over again.

2388
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,200
I think it's Matt Doyle he said.

2389
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:07,120
Almost as if Matt Doyle had like murdered his whole family

2390
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,000
and then Justin was having some sort of fever nightmare.

2391
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,120
All right, now it's 10 o'clock.

2392
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,560
Now it's five o'clock, so okay.

2393
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:13,120
Thank goodness.

2394
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,640
Ethan Souffle, great.

2395
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:15,120
Amazing.

2396
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:15,680
So good.

2397
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,600
Turned into a great performance.

2398
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,720
Patton Hughes.

2399
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:19,760
Patton Hughes came to us.

2400
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,640
That was our first-

2401
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,080
An angel.

2402
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,760
An angel from God.

2403
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,280
I will always appreciate that.

2404
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,200
And if I remember correctly,

2405
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,400
I think Patton said like,

2406
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,320
you are doing a good job.

2407
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,760
And it gave me, it was like-

2408
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,000
She was wrong, but like I appreciate it.

2409
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,440
Yeah, check out Patton Hughes' series Heirloom

2410
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,120
that you can go watch about Going Tomatoes.

2411
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,000
It's great.

2412
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,880
Martha Plimpton, again, didn't get a chance to sit down

2413
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:43,920
or stand up with her,

2414
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,680
but I did have a chance to sit down with her.

2415
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,040
We sat behind her at the show

2416
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,120
and she had a hell of a time.

2417
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,200
Corey Cott turned in a great game.

2418
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:51,760
Thank you, Corey.

2419
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:52,960
Yeah, Corey was amazing.

2420
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,000
Triple double on the court today from Corey Cott.

2421
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,720
It was Corey Cott.

2422
01:18:58,720 --> 01:18:59,600
What did I say?

2423
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,560
Corey didn't slip.

2424
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,600
There's a dude here named Geezer Butler.

2425
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,120
I didn't see anyone who looked like a Geezer.

2426
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,480
Is he a Motorhead?

2427
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,040
Yes.

2428
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,400
Didn't see Geezer Butler,

2429
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,400
but I did see Geezer Butler at the check-in,

2430
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:11,600
the hotel.

2431
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,640
So I know he's here.

2432
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,520
Some people went to the show

2433
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,560
and just didn't walk the line

2434
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,840
to talk to plebs like us,

2435
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:16,640
which I get.

2436
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,200
I get.

2437
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,720
I will say, having done it,

2438
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:21,440
if I was one of the guests that was like on that

2439
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,280
and they said, but if you don't want to,

2440
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,880
I'd be like, stop there.

2441
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,440
Don't want to.

2442
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:25,760
I will.

2443
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,600
Mary Lou Hennert was great.

2444
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,920
We had literally two seconds with her.

2445
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,080
That was the amount of time given to us,

2446
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:32,560
which is good.

2447
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,960
Which gave me the fucking yips in a major way.

2448
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,240
Imagine someone looking at you going,

2449
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,800
you have two seconds to impress Mary Lou Hennert.

2450
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,800
I think maybe you need a codex to understand this episode

2451
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,480
and how we interact with people who are famous.

2452
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:46,720
Okay.

2453
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:51,920
I think that I try to just treat them like,

2454
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,240
you know, average Joe on the street.

2455
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:54,560
Yeah.

2456
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,800
Travis goes a little harder than that

2457
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:00,080
in that he wants to be very good friends with them.

2458
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:00,800
No, no, no.

2459
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,520
Let me be clear.

2460
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,720
I have two modes.

2461
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:06,480
Mode one is this person might be my very good friend someday.

2462
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,280
And mode two is I'm never going to see this person again.

2463
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:09,760
Oh, okay.

2464
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,600
You also have mode three, which is full iceberg,

2465
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,600
which is I'm going to grab Mark.

2466
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,360
I'm going to grab, there she goes.

2467
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,360
Well, that's because where you freeze up.

2468
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,320
Justin's.

2469
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,560
Every so often, I do have a moment where I'm like,

2470
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,040
oh, I got nervous meeting John Ross Bowie.

2471
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,760
And he said, hi, I'm John.

2472
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,720
I said, I'm John.

2473
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,080
No, I'm not John.

2474
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,600
Justin does a thing and you heard it with Mary Lou Hinner

2475
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,440
that I think is really fun where he just kind of yells

2476
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,840
as if the person's pulled a gun on her.

2477
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:42,320
Justin has a very controlled energy 99.9% of the time.

2478
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,240
Imagine, here's what it was.

2479
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,840
I was very nervous.

2480
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,600
I think the person I was most nervous about talking to

2481
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:48,960
was Mary Lou Hinner because like,

2482
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,640
in my mind, Mary Lou Hinner is legit.

2483
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,440
Yes.

2484
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,920
She's very, not to say these other people weren't legit,

2485
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,160
but like Mary Lou Hinner's old school.

2486
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,720
She's been in the game, crushing it day in, day out

2487
01:20:58,720 --> 01:20:59,840
for a long time.

2488
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:00,880
She's wonderful.

2489
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,480
And I was very nervous about talking to her.

2490
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:06,160
And then this dude's like, you have two seconds.

2491
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,600
So here's what it was.

2492
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,000
I was very nervous about having two seconds

2493
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,160
to get a good answer from Mary Lou Hinner.

2494
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,920
Mary Lou Hinner gives us a good answer.

2495
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:14,560
An amazing answer.

2496
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:18,720
For me, it was a huge victory because we had used two seconds

2497
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,320
and we'd got an answer from Mary Lou Hinner

2498
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,200
in that two seconds.

2499
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,200
So what you heard was the exaltation of like,

2500
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,600
we had two seconds and we nailed it.

2501
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:25,920
Yeah.

2502
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:26,480
Oh, definitely.

2503
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,120
Because I think that if you had said to Mary Lou Hinner,

2504
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,400
what's the most dangerous sea creature?

2505
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,560
And she'd said, I don't know, sharks?

2506
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,760
Like it wouldn't have landed the same as her just like,

2507
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,600
stepping up and like Ursula the sea witch.

2508
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,280
If you want to tweet at these people to thank them

2509
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,360
for being so nice to us, that'd be great.

2510
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:41,760
Yeah.

2511
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,760
Tweeted Steve Croft from 60 Minutes.

2512
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,400
Turned in a good performance.

2513
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:48,880
Barracuda.

2514
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,400
He said Barracuda and we were like,

2515
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,240
oh, this will be and then the handlers were like,

2516
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:52,720
you're done.

2517
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,960
Your time with Steve Croft is now over.

2518
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:55,920
And I made a joke like,

2519
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,640
I thought I would get 60 minutes, but he was already gone.

2520
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,400
I want to say, and I don't know if you all heard this,

2521
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,320
but worry about Al Roker.

2522
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:04,640
All right.

2523
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,600
So here's Al Roker.

2524
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,960
Okay, time to recap Al Roker.

2525
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:07,840
Time to get into this.

2526
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,000
Let me say a word on Al Roker.

2527
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,880
I don't think it helped as much as the handler person

2528
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,640
thought it did to say, these are the McElroy brothers.

2529
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,600
They host Jimmy Buffett's favorite podcast.

2530
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,040
And that was how he entered.

2531
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,400
Cause he looked at me and said,

2532
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,840
you don't have time for Al Roker.

2533
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,280
And I said, well, no.

2534
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,120
He said Al Roker doesn't have time for you.

2535
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:32,240
I have plenty of time.

2536
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:34,320
I can make time for Al.

2537
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,760
Listen, I'm going to do you all a favor.

2538
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,440
You're too busy for Al Roker.

2539
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,160
And I woke up this morning.

2540
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:44,720
I was nervous that we would do a bad job.

2541
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:47,600
I should have been nervous about the fact that Al Roker

2542
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:53,760
was mere hours away from melting my ass in front of everyone.

2543
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,920
Mark Helgenberger looked back and said,

2544
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,520
oh, I don't want to talk to those boys.

2545
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,320
Look at him.

2546
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,920
His ass is melting.

2547
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,360
Look at the young one.

2548
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:05,280
His ass is dripping out of his slacks because Al Roker just.

2549
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,920
I think you listened to Roker poker.

2550
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,320
And I think he wanted vengeance.

2551
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,760
And I think he melted.

2552
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,800
He melted my ass.

2553
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,080
Al Roker was amazing.

2554
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,720
I was holding all of the sound equipment.

2555
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:22,080
And so all of his melts were directly placed towards me.

2556
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,040
To be fair.

2557
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,360
We look like the biggest fucking idiots.

2558
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:26,400
Like Griffin has.

2559
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:30,880
OK, so Griffin, the visual, if you want to get it,

2560
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,240
Griffin has like the zoom and we all

2561
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,560
have our stupid ass microphones plugged into it.

2562
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,480
And we're like holding another microphone.

2563
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:42,560
Like children doing a bit of like a segment

2564
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,880
for their local elementary school news.

2565
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,320
Griffin is holding a laptop bag that we're not

2566
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,640
using to store anything, but he is using it

2567
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:53,280
as a base to lay the zoom on.

2568
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,800
We look like children.

2569
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,680
I'm dressed in my Easter Sunday best.

2570
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:58,180
Yeah.

2571
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,120
It was earned.

2572
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,240
Yeah, he melted my ass.

2573
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:05,360
And the whole time you all were laughing, having a great time.

2574
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,040
I was getting your ass.

2575
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,960
I was getting my ass melted.

2576
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,840
But the whole time I was like, he's he is right.

2577
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,440
What are we even doing?

2578
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,680
So we had we had a great time and Jimmy Buffett.

2579
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,200
So go see Jimmy.

2580
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,080
Thank you for having us.

2581
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,360
Escape to Margaritaville.

2582
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,120
Listen, I can't endorse it enough.

2583
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:25,680
It's so far.

2584
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:28,080
If you're in New York and you're like, you know what I want to do tonight?

2585
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:34,000
I want to have fun and just kind of like enjoy a really fun night at the theater.

2586
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,360
This show made me feel better.

2587
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,440
Hamilton, Hamilton, some dark stuff happens.

2588
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,880
Yeah, some dark shit in Hamilton.

2589
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,400
There's no murders in this one.

2590
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:47,200
Well, except for the outside before when Al Roker murdered me in your ass, in my ass with his cruel words.

2591
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,280
Anyway, go see Escape to Margaritaville.

2592
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:54,320
Musical.com is the web address to go get tickets, buy tickets, come to New York, see it.

2593
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,600
I guarantee you'll have fun.

2594
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:02,480
And thanks to everybody for letting us pretend to be somebody for a little bit.

2595
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,480
It's well put, Justin.

2596
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:04,880
Thanks.

2597
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:14,880
Goodbye.
