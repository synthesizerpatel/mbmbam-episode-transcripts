1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:45,040
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,280
Welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modular. I'm your oldest brother,

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:01:04,560
Justin Tyler McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis Patrick McElroy. You'll get him next time,

8
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:11,520
champ. I'm hometown boy made good in 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:20,960
I kind of thought I was gonna win. We love coming to Texas.

10
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,360
And playing fucking candy crush while we're doing it. Austin has, it almost feels like home to us

11
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,000
now because we've played here so many times. It's like a home to us, like a second home.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,360
Austin's like a second home. It's like coming home for me. It's almost like we own property here

13
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,160
and all of our shit is here. That's what it feels like. You know, you come, you see old friends,

14
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:51,360
old family, old lovers. I thought it would be better. Old lovers, I actually would love to

15
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:59,520
explore. That's tough. I've had a lot of old lovers. We saw Willie backstage. Saw Willie.

16
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,360
So cool to see Willie. He welcomed us to his street. He welcomes everybody here to Austin

17
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,240
City Limits. When you come in, Willie greets you at the door. I know you're wondering did

18
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:17,360
he smoke us out? He's actually, guys, no. He's very cool. Is that more of a character that he

19
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,120
plays? He plays a character. He's like, please call me Bill. He's wearing a business suit.

20
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:31,520
He was wearing like kind of a business jacket over a polo. Yeah. He's also like 36 years old.

21
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,840
Yeah, that's the weirdest thing. He's also wearing a wire and that's hard too. He leaned over to get

22
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,560
me a Starburst off our Starburst table and I saw it down his shirt and first of all, I was like,

23
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,080
I'm seeing down Willie Nelson's shirt. This is a once in a lifetime experience.

24
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,880
Mental picture, but also I saw the fucking wire. Yeah, I saw the wire, Willie. He does this funny

25
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:57,360
bit though where like every five minutes, apropos of nothing, he'll just say, I'm not a cop. Yeah.

26
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah, it's cool. It's really good. He said one thing that was so cool backstage, he's like,

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,080
I think you guys are going to put on a great show tonight. Can I interest you in some marijuana,

28
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,720
which is illegal within the state of Texas. Just to clarify that, would you still like some

29
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,840
marijuana? And he said, you Travis McElroy. Travis said our names a lot out loud. Travis McElroy is

30
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,320
the one who said that. He's reaching into his pocket. He narrated a lot. Everything we did,

31
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,600
he said, and now you're walking across the room. Speak into the flower, he said a lot. Speak into

32
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,280
my huge comical flower. And when I pulled out my gun, he was like, Bumblebee, Bumblebee,

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,960
Bumblebee, Bumblebee. Just waiting and watching the windows. I don't normally have a gun,

34
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,880
but when you cross the bounds into Texas, they give you one. They throw it in the open window

35
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,680
of your car as you drive past. It was in my luggage actually, which is so weird. I didn't

36
00:03:51,680 --> 00:04:01,040
pack it. It was just in there with some honey, some local honey. Now one of those is for your

37
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,480
allergies. Keep it straight. Keep it straight. It's not the gun. Well, we have returned to you

38
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,960
Austin and the Chilean miners. We have reemerged from the ground. Are the Chilean miners known for

39
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:21,200
returning to places? Guys, can I be honest with you? I miss the fucking cage. Let's go chug it

40
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,000
off. Where's my wallet? Ah, fuck. I'm going back to the cave. Chilean miners too. I have to take

41
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
this. The squeak wall. This time they have to get back in. Oh, they put up some kind of tape over

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,160
the front. What are we going to do? We have to go back. Hey gang, this table's real wet and I was

43
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:46,640
the only other one to do a show out here tonight. That's a cool mystery. Really? So anyway, this is

44
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,720
an advice show. We are not used to playing theaters where there are people in the round here. So if

45
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,280
you feel like you're not getting service- This is actually a thrust. Yeah, it's a thrust. In the

46
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,000
round would be behind us. It's a thrust. Okay, Jesus. Three quarters, to be honest. I know you

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,200
guys get frustrated because you have useless theater degrees. Fair enough. Seemed like they

48
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,120
just came in pretty useful, Griffin. What news story will you be writing about this evening's

49
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:26,720
performance? Anyway, why is James crying? Because he just got dunked on. So anyway, hi. If you feel

50
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,800
like you're not getting service, please let us know silently. I don't know how you'll accomplish

51
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,120
that, but here's the question. I get monthly massages as a way to de-stress and maintain sanity.

52
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,400
Fuck yeah. I have seen the same person every month for a little more than a year. I noticed about

53
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,360
three months ago while massaging my left hand, she seemed to avoid my pointer finger. Your pointer

54
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,480
finger? My pointer finger. My punter finger. I thought- I'm gonna kick it there. I thought,

55
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,200
okay, that's weird. She moved my right hand and massaged my hand and all five fingers.

56
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,160
I thought maybe it was a fluke and I went on with my month until the next massage,

57
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:16,160
it happened again and again the time after. It always is my left hand and always the pointer.

58
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,680
Is there something that could be wrong with my finger to cause such an aversion? I mean,

59
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,520
it's a pretty normal finger, I think, and this is now causing what should be a relaxing time

60
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,640
into an anxious nightmare. Should I say something? What should I say? Please help.

61
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:37,120
That's from Soar Pointer in DFW. Are you here? Okay. Hi. What are you gonna say like, hey,

62
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:45,760
you forgot my finger. If you're ever wondering- No skipsies. If you're ever wondering if you should

63
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,680
ask your massage therapist for a specific part of your body to be deeply serviced,

64
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:59,600
repeatedly, the answer is yes, obviously. How else are they gonna know? How else will they know

65
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,600
what you are? There's a 0% chance it's a normal index finger though, right?

66
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,080
I'm thinking, because I was thinking about it, and if you get the other

67
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,400
hand piggies, right? Sure. And then you skip that one to go for thumb. Yeah. It's harder to

68
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,400
skip it than to just include it. Oh, maybe the massage therapist is super excited to get to

69
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,520
that fucking thumb. Oh. Yeah, maybe it's not a bad pointer, maybe it's an awesome thumb.

70
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,160
They're on the pinky like, oh God, this is the hand. I'm almost there. Ring finger. Oh shit.

71
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,560
Here, the thumb is over. Middle finger. I can't take it anymore. I gotta get somebody down.

72
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,600
How cool is your thumb? It's a cool thumb, probably. Maybe they saw you do something

73
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:50,560
with that finger, huh? Yeah. Something evil. Do you legally have to tell us? This is a podcast.

74
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:58,800
You have to tell us if you did something nasty. What did you do with your secret finger?

75
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:11,040
I'd say you met my finger. What'd you do? No, but really, what'd you do?

76
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:21,040
No answer. No answer. The crime is unspeakable. Terrible crime. Maybe it's just,

77
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,560
maybe your massage therapist is just making sure you're paying attention and they're like bummed

78
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,560
out that you haven't mentioned the finger. Yeah, it's a test on you. I clearly skipped their finger.

79
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,800
This is how these things start to erode though. They skip the finger. You don't notice they skip

80
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,920
two fingers, five fingers, the whole hand, the arm, the whole side of the body. Eventually you're

81
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,720
paying $60 and they slap you on the butt. That's the whole massage. They say good game, chief.

82
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:53,040
Good game, chief. Thanks for the 60 buckaroonies. That's been an hour. I don't think it has,

83
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:01,760
do you know? Fuck. It could be accident though. Your body has so many parts

84
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,840
if you think about it. Everybody close your eyes and try to list out all the parts of your wonderful

85
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:15,200
body. At the top of your lungs. Good Christ. We can't say stuff like that. It's happened by my

86
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,880
math four times. What? That's not an accident. You don't miss the exact same part of the body over

87
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,320
and over and over again. That's true. If it was an accident, they would miss different things like,

88
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,320
oh, didn't get my right foot that time. Is your left index finger maybe somehow bad or the same

89
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,040
exact color of the fabric of the massage table? Do you have camo finger? Do you have one camouflage

90
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,320
finger? Because that would fucking do it. Do you have like a real shifty finger where they go for

91
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,960
and the finger just dodges out of the way and they can't see? Yeah, maybe they're trying to rub the

92
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,440
finger, but you instinctively pull it away because it's your weakest finger. Did you lose your finger

93
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,880
in a lawn mowing accident? Now you have phantom finger. Do you have phantom finger? Do you have

94
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,440
phantom finger? If so, you have to tell us. You legally have to tell us. It's a podcast.

95
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,560
How about a Yahoo? Okay. I feel like we helped enough.

96
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,840
This one was sent in by Graham Roebuck. Thank you, Graham. It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

97
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,200
I'm going to call them Scalver. Scalver asks,

98
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,320
why are we don't see nights in this day and age?

99
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,040
I assume you mean like K nights. Yes, Travis.

100
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,920
Now like why don't we see beautiful starry nights? Homophones good every time. They show up as a joke.

101
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,600
The homophone tree is a giver. Ripe fruits on the homophone tree.

102
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,240
Why are we don't see nights in this day and age?

103
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,800
Maybe we do. Okay. Okay. Griffin.

104
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,280
Griffin, it's me, the cops. You legally can't interrupt your brother for the next two minutes.

105
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,600
Yeah. So Travis, maybe we do go on. Okay. I am saying.

106
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:14,240
Hold on. I'm looking at the timer. No bullshit. Go. I'm saying that maybe when you see

107
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:22,240
on like a BuzzFeed, like a man climbs outside a bridge to save like a puppy on like the leg of

108
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,360
the bridge or whatever it's called, the bridge holder, a man saved it and you're like, oh,

109
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,200
what good person. And I'm like, no, that person's a night.

110
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,480
And the person who put the dog there is an evil night.

111
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:44,240
Okay. Time in. I'm sorry. I made it a good 20 seconds to my great credit.

112
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,680
So there were a lot of things in there that you kind of showed that you didn't know about.

113
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,960
Okay. The bridge one is a gimme. Yeah. Yeah. The bridge is a gimme. I know that there's

114
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,920
bridge pillar. That's not right. Yep. Yep. That's it.

115
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:10,560
It doesn't feel right. Did they night them as a result of their actions or were they nights before?

116
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,280
They were nights before. Okay. That's why they had to save the dog. They were walking over in

117
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,520
the store. They see the dog down there and like, ah, damn it. And then they had to save the goddamn

118
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:29,040
dog. The evil night on his Google calendar had a thing that said get dog and then another

119
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:38,080
appointment right after that that said place dog gotten in previous GCAL entry on top of bridge leg.

120
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:46,560
And so this hope other night doesn't come along. Evil night walks under bridge and just like lifts

121
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,800
a dog up, puts it on top of the bridge leg and says, Ooh, that that's good. That's good stuff.

122
00:12:52,800 --> 00:13:00,880
That's good evil there. I hope you're happy evil Jesus. I've done your bidding.

123
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,480
I am Justin. Good job, Justin. I'm proud of you again.

124
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,520
So how else does the dog get there? All right. We've had a lot of fun.

125
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:24,080
I'm up here turning wine into clamato. Walk on water. No, I walked on your mom's rug.

126
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,000
The one that's just for guests and I wore my shoes.

127
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,240
I found Lazarus and I killed him.

128
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,520
Some of the miracles of evil. Jesus. Sure.

129
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,680
Killing someone isn't really a miracle. Yeah, that's easy. They gave me five fish

130
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,640
and three loaves of bread and I scrum it down on that shit. Okay.

131
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Listen, we all went to Southern Baptist Church for a long time. We can list out all the miracles.

132
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,840
Don't mean to brag. Why the fuck aren't there nights this day? Travis's shit was not real,

133
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,560
was not in the realm of realness. Well, there are. Doesn't the like Elton

134
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,200
John's a night, right? Aren't there moderns? I don't think he's the same kind of night.

135
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:24,320
No, he is. No, he is. He is. He is. If they go to war, the queen calls him up. It's like,

136
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:31,120
all right, strap up. Saturday night's all right for fighting. Let's fucking do this.

137
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,680
You made a fucking promise. It's go time, Elton. You're going to space to claim Mars,

138
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:47,680
rocket man. Prove it. What other songs? So tough. A lot of fun songs. You can use your father's gun

139
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:56,800
so he had another song called my friend. Take a crocodile with you. Sorry, Sir Elton. This is

140
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:05,120
the circle of life. This is the way these things go. From Lion King? Yeah. All right. Here's another

141
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,000
question. Whenever I'm invited to someone's house to hang out, I always bring some kind of food.

142
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,760
This feels like the polite thing to do in exchange for hospitality.

143
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:21,520
The problem is no one ever seems to eat what I bring. My chips and queso go ignored and I'm

144
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:30,800
left picking at it by myself. Oh man, I didn't read that part. That's so sad. Okay. So my question

145
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,560
is how can I enjoy these snacks without looking like I just brought them for myself or what can

146
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,120
I do to get my friends to enjoy these snackums with me? That's from eating alone in Austin.

147
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,400
This seems like a win-win to me. Either your friends enjoy your tasty meal or you get to eat

148
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:54,000
like a pound of queso. Yeah. Okay. If we're all being honest with ourselves. Then let's and let's.

149
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,080
When you present the queso, are you really selling it? Are you like anybody wants this?

150
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,840
That's it. No. Who wants this stinky shitty queso? Nobody?

151
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:12,320
Yeah. We didn't, I didn't see, like I said, I didn't see the part where you said you picked at

152
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,680
it. If you're holding it in your arms the entire time. Come get some queso. Does anybody want some

153
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,160
of this? Who wants to fucking wrestle me for queso? Come in for a chip hug. Yeah. There's

154
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:31,600
some parties that you bring food to. There's some parties that you don't, you can't just decide as a

155
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,880
guest that it's a party everybody's bringing food to. Sure. The host won't know. If I was a, okay,

156
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,360
there's a lot of foods that you can eat without knowing the contents of.

157
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,320
Queso is at the very bottom of the list. You start with queso, then you work up from there.

158
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,400
If I'm the host of this party, I'm going to see that and walk over to my friends like,

159
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:58,560
hey, I didn't, that's not my queso. I don't know. I don't know where that queso came from.

160
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,880
I wouldn't eat that queso. I don't know where it, in fact, I wouldn't even say I'm 100% sure it's

161
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,240
queso. It may not be queso. They don't make transparent cheese. What if they brought queso

162
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:18,800
and no chips? Surely you have chips somewhere. There's a whole bowl right there in front of you.

163
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,040
Look at it. The gelatinous sauce. Enjoy this cheese flavor.

164
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:32,160
Maybe it's just free queso. It has to be microwaved. Gross. Why is that gross? It is

165
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:40,000
gross though. No, you don't like cheese. It's raw queso is what you're saying. Where'd you put it?

166
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:50,560
There's tables where food can go that it is communal, but if you put it under the sink

167
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:56,080
and close it, no one's going to eat that queso. Okay. This is an excellent point because if you

168
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,360
walk in and you put it by the table by the front door where you keep your keys and mail,

169
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,400
if I walk in and saw queso, they're like, well, that's for trick-or-treaters.

170
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,960
They are going to a queso party after this party. That's not for this. No, that's for later.

171
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,040
If I saw it on someone's bedside table, I'd be like, oh, that's their nighttime queso.

172
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:25,680
Yes. Similar point. What are you serving it out of? Because if you're using it on something

173
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:31,280
from the Martha Stewart collection, like a nice oak tray with polished metal handles,

174
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,040
now we're hopefully a bowl also and not just sort of loose queso slip sliding around there.

175
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,800
Now we're talking. If you serve it out of a big toilet that you just got from the Lowe's

176
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,640
and you wheel in on a wheelbarrow or something. Do you remember for a period in the 80s when

177
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,720
everybody brought everything in Shed Spread Country Crock containers? Is that just our family? I guess.

178
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:03,200
I have a Yahoo here. It's from Merit Polymer. Thank you, Merit. It's a Yahoo answers user,

179
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,880
Al the Pal, who asks, why isn't my fruits and vegetable blog getting views?

180
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:27,200
I made a blog to talk about how I love fruits and veggies. Spent $150 to get it started. Sorry,

181
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:35,200
spent $150. Dollars? Somethings to get it started. Beans.

182
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:43,120
I made a deal with a guy for a cow. Spent $150 to get it started. I even made a recipe involving

183
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:52,560
putting cheese on broccoli. The ultimate sacrifice. You pour cheese. I hate to do this

184
00:19:52,560 --> 00:20:01,360
to these good veggies, but it'll get the clicks. I can't believe I ruined the broccoli for this.

185
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes. Sleep now, my sweet green prince. My grandma's broccoli. It's been in my family for years.

186
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:19,200
It's an heirloom. Broccoli. And heirloom tomatoes. I am not getting supporters. How to get popular.

187
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,920
They spelled it super wrong. Alert. I'd like to say something. Yes. It's this. S-E, okra.

188
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,560
Okay. Justin didn't know how he was going to get that one in.

189
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:39,440
I just wanted to say S-E, okra. Thank you. Because S-E-O is search engine optimization.

190
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,400
These people got it already, so y'all don't listen, okay?

191
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,320
Y'all go to the lobby, get yourselves a snack, and come back in 10.

192
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:55,600
Okra. Take it back. Hey, how the fuck did you spend $150 on your vegetables website,

193
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,720
my friend? Maybe it was in buying the vegetables.

194
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,160
What are you supposed to do? Have a vegetables website without any vegetables on it? Come on.

195
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:14,160
I'm imagining somebody with a van of potatoes. How many potatoes can I get for this many?

196
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,160
Just taking them and placing them around the modem like...

197
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,760
This is something. Go, go, go guys. Go, go.

198
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,560
Maybe they like vegetables too much. Screaming at the modem. I like these.

199
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,720
No, I guarantee this person paid like, I don't know, the cool neighborhood kid like $150 to

200
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,320
start them a vlog like they said they would. And they're like, how's the website doing?

201
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,240
And they're like, not a lot of clicks. I think I'm going to need another $20.

202
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,640
Can you give me another $20? Maybe they like vegetables too much on the blog.

203
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,960
Have you all noticed when you read a recipe for vegetables...

204
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,680
Do you want to do this at the stand line? No, they love vegetables already.

205
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,960
Do you ever notice when you read an online recipe for vegetables,

206
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,680
after they write 3000 words about how supportive their husband is, you get to...

207
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,760
You get to the part where they talk about vegetables and it's always like,

208
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:17,200
these tastes exactly like hot butter popcorn. It's like, I don't think so. Actually,

209
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,280
I don't actually think that, but it doesn't even feel guilty for not enjoying vegetables

210
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,080
as much as they do. So maybe this blog is like making people feel a little bit put on the spot.

211
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,400
I would pay $150 for a vegetable website where like the headline of the recipe is like,

212
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,200
do you want to make vegetables palatable? This is fine. This is as close to good as it...

213
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,760
Like it doesn't taste like hot butter popcorn, but it doesn't not taste like hot butter popcorn.

214
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,040
You all are missing the fucking point of this artist's website.

215
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,640
They're not making a blog about how to make tasty vegetables.

216
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,720
I made a blog to talk about how I love fruits and veggies.

217
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,400
It is a little narrow, narrowly targeted.

218
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:10,240
Hut, hail, hail, wary internet traveler. Greg again. This time, asparagus. Love to eat it,

219
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,880
but my pee. What? Little joke. Like and subscribe.

220
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,160
Like this post as much as I like asparagus. Next week, kiwifruits.

221
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,840
Spoiler alert, like them. How much? A lot. Teehee emoji.

222
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,520
That's the whole post. Damn it. I used all my content for next week.

223
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,600
I've burned it already. Anyways, support me on Patreon.

224
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,200
Thanks. I need to recoup some expenses.

225
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,000
Necessary expenses. Kiwis don't buy themselves.

226
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,320
That's right. Not yet. Read on.

227
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,840
I'm Jeff Bezos, and these are my new self-buying kiwifruits.

228
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,360
Why isn't anyone liking this blog? This is when I started to compete with Amazon.

229
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,120
All right. All right.

230
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,240
I don't know why I said all right. It's your turn to read a question.

231
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:11,360
I am a first-time plant dad. My hanging ivy has lived for about a year and a half so far.

232
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,720
I'm not sure how because I've not changed its soil since buying it.

233
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,640
All right. I was waiting to see what the reaction to that was because

234
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,440
I don't actually know if that's... I heard no gasps. Yeah.

235
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,680
I actually don't know if that's something or not.

236
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,000
Can I get a quick... Actually, before we move on,

237
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,320
can I get a quick round of applause if that's something?

238
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,480
Thank you. Okay, that wasn't enough for it to be a thing.

239
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,160
Wait, now stop. Can I get a quick round of applause if you have no fucking idea?

240
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,440
Okay, perfect. So, it sounds like it's something.

241
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,840
If I add those two together, I think that's literally everybody in here.

242
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,920
Okay. I've not changed its soil since buying it and I often forget to water it.

243
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,680
Potting soil is expensive and difficult to move when you walk everywhere.

244
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,000
They put that in parentheticals. Does not address the watering issue, but okay. Fine. That's fine.

245
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,400
Also, water is expensive? I have nothing.

246
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,280
No. However, on my route home, they are building a bowling alley.

247
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,520
A bowling alley with a few trees and planters.

248
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,240
My question is, how do I steal some of that sweet brown stuff

249
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,640
for my struggling plant son, Dirk Bandit in DFW?

250
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,800
Are you worried that someday your plant will find out?

251
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,840
I feel dirty.

252
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,400
Well, hey, are you here?

253
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,640
This is the best fucking short story I've ever read in my entire life.

254
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,960
When the bowling alley showed up, who here was like, okay?

255
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,280
Twist.

256
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,120
Are you taking the plant bowling? Fuck yeah.

257
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,160
Isn't there a Denzel Washington movie where his kid is sick and so he robs a hospital?

258
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,200
This is like that, but the stakes are down here.

259
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,840
Way lower.

260
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,680
I mean, here's an option. I mean, steal the dirt. Don't steal the dirt. You only go around once.

261
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,720
But one option would be to bring your plant son back to the bowling alley and plant them there.

262
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,320
If you love something, you got to let it go. And maybe this is...

263
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,600
You clearly are, if you'll excuse me, a delinquent parent.

264
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,440
I understand the soil expense issue. Fair enough. The watering thing is hard to get past.

265
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,920
Well, maybe there's a bowling alley employee out there with a heart of gold and a thumb of green

266
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,920
who can step in where you have so clearly fucked up.

267
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,200
I would also say if I was a landscaper who was like putting stuff in and I saw someone doing it,

268
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,480
I was like, hey, what are you doing? And they're like, I'm planting a plant here.

269
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,800
I'd be like, well, that's 10% less work for me to do.

270
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,840
Perfect.

271
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,800
Sounds great.

272
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,960
Excellent. Thanks for the help. Appreciate it.

273
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,240
Sounds great. Excellent. Thanks for the help. Appreciate it.

274
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,920
I mean, don't steal the dirt.

275
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
You would be the worst thing you go to prison for, by the way.

276
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,960
No, it's not you wouldn't go to fucking prison because it's dirt and you can't own that.

277
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,400
God owns it. But also...

278
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,280
We've all watched Pocahontas.

279
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,920
It is weird how if it's dirt is on the floor, it's like, ugh, God, clean it up.

280
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,280
If you put the dirt in a bag, that'll be $8. Like, why?

281
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,240
Yeah. Good point, guys.

282
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,160
You wouldn't go to jail for it. What would happen would be way worse.

283
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:46,400
The stigma associated with somebody seeing you rob dirt is some next level shit.

284
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,320
Hey, what are you doing?

285
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,240
And why?

286
00:27:50,240 --> 00:28:00,800
I'm taking a sample. We've had reports in the area of ash beetles.

287
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
You're doing a really good job at this.

288
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,840
I'm testing this at home.

289
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,080
No, wait, my lab, my lab, my lab.

290
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,120
My home lab.

291
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,800
Do you really need that much dirt for your tests? You're taking a good wheelbarrow full there.

292
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:24,080
Hey, listen, if you are an expert on ash beetles, like me, Dr. Ash...

293
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:27,860
...Beetle...

294
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,320
...Steen...

295
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,760
...then you can do the rigorous testing.

296
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,440
Well, that all tracks.

297
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:37,920
Yep.

298
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,000
Anyway, another suspicion here.

299
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,000
Sounds good. Sounds good.

300
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,040
Anything I can do to help? You need any money?

301
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,160
Money? I just want to walk away.

302
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,840
Are you peeing your pants?

303
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,680
It's a different test.

304
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,440
It keeps the beetles away.

305
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,640
It's a different test.

306
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,120
It's a base level for the pH balance. I have to...

307
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,720
It's the control.

308
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,480
Hey, why are they building a bowling alley?

309
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,160
Hey, yeah, wait, huh?

310
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,880
It's 2018.

311
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,760
2018? All right.

312
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,000
I guess people here want more bowling alleys.

313
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,120
I'm not saying it's bad to have more bowling alleys.

314
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,920
I'm saying, aren't there enough bowling alleys?

315
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,920
To be fair, we do come from a city in West Virginia where there's at least

316
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,040
two empty, waiting-for-someone bowling alleys.

317
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,440
No, no, no, they closed down Colonial Lanes, didn't you hear?

318
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,720
But it's still there, right?

319
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,240
I mean, yeah, you can fucking bust in the windows and go bowling.

320
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,120
No, but that's what I'm saying is you don't need to build a new bowling alley

321
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,160
if you want to own a bowling alley.

322
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,440
You can clear away some of the ivy and bowl in there, I guess, if you want.

323
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,120
You can have the last of us bowling.

324
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,360
But if I say, like, this is my bowling alley now, I feel like it is.

325
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,080
Do you would like a Yahoo?

326
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,600
I'm becoming a Yahoo answer.

327
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,040
Um, yes.

328
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,280
Unless you want me to just...

329
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,240
The fucking audience even knows you're not going to let me get through it.

330
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:11,040
Throw your clothes onto the bed.

331
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,840
Oh, okay.

332
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,360
And wait for me by the tree.

333
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,280
I'm gonna swing, sing jingle bells to your head.

334
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840
That's a Christmas to me.

335
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,080
That's a Christmas to me.

336
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,680
That's a Christmas to me.

337
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,160
Making love in the light of a tree.

338
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
That's a Christmas to me.

339
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,160
Okay.

340
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,680
Pass me a glass of that mulled wine.

341
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,560
Been 20 years since we've been like this.

342
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,920
And yet it feels oh so fine.

343
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,040
We're under the mistletoe, let's kiss.

344
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,640
That's a Christmas to me.

345
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,480
That's a Christmas to me.

346
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,160
You and me and a little bit of holly.

347
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,680
That's a Christmas to me.

348
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,680
So this is a segment.

349
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,960
This is a holiday special.

350
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,480
That was a fucking joke.

351
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,320
That was a fucking journey.

352
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,280
Yeah, I want to explore before we get into this great segment.

353
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,320
That's a Christmas to me.

354
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,560
Let's explore what happened.

355
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:45,120
I was a little thrown at the beginning when you said throw your clothes out of the bed.

356
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,240
Yeah, so you first I'll see you by the tree.

357
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,120
Yeah, Paul.

358
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,240
Paul, I need another drink.

359
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,080
Paul, if you can hear me, Paul, I need another drink.

360
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,880
Let's throw our clothes not just on the floor as we prepare to make love,

361
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,360
but do scoop them right under the bed.

362
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,080
By the way, we haven't done this in 20 years.

363
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,120
Thanks, Paul.

364
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,080
It's been 20 years since we've been like this.

365
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,880
You don't have to, you don't have to Tom Cruise and cocktail it for me.

366
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,640
I'll just blend it myself.

367
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,360
Thanks, old friend.

368
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,240
Okay, I'm just going to ride it out.

369
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:27,920
So in the segment, in the segment, that's a Christmas to me.

370
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,200
Travis, don't look at the iPad.

371
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,240
Don't look at the iPad.

372
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,800
It doesn't matter.

373
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,440
You wouldn't be able to tell.

374
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
In the segment, that's a Christmas to me.

375
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,280
I read the description of two Hallmark Christmas films that are real

376
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,160
and one that I created in my mind's eye.

377
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,880
Now, if you are a listener, my brother, my brother,

378
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,600
me not familiar with this segment, it's because it's one episode old.

379
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,040
So don't worry that you've missed a lot.

380
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,640
Technically speaking, it's one day old, but it's only a holiday segment.

381
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,600
So I got to get a lot in.

382
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:55,920
Yeah.

383
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,240
He can't do this and say, I don't know any other months of the year.

384
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,640
Right.

385
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:00,960
Okay.

386
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,720
So here we go.

387
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,640
And by the way, we're going to take a poll.

388
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,960
If you actually know the answer, please don't vote because it will spoil.

389
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,440
Okay.

390
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,200
Unlike a lot of elections, if you know the right thing, don't vote.

391
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,600
So first film is Switched for Christmas.

392
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,520
Switched?

393
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,360
Switched for Christmas.

394
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,880
Not a Switch for Christmas.

395
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:31,280
Just because they are identical does not mean these twins even like each other.

396
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,200
Estrange twin sisters played by Candace Cameron Brewer get together.

397
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,760
That's right.

398
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,640
Say that last name one more.

399
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,000
Candace Cameron Brewer.

400
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,160
Okay.

401
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,480
That's Candace Cameron's new name.

402
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,360
Candace Cameron Brewer.

403
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,360
Estrange twin sisters get together for an obligatory pre-Christmas lunch

404
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,120
a year after their mother's death.

405
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,240
Sorry.

406
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,360
Both women are unhappy and frustrated with their own lives, though not close.

407
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,200
Each is envious of the other's life.

408
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,520
It's a nasty Christmas movie.

409
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,320
What's a twin do but to take advantage of this?

410
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,920
And who would be the wiser?

411
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,760
They do what any identical twins in need of new outlets would do.

412
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,080
They swap lives until Christmas day.

413
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,800
That's a fucked up thing to say about identical twins.

414
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,240
And by doing so, each woman discovers the true meaning of her life

415
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,200
and gains a deeper perspective and appreciation for what she already had.

416
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,800
That's Switch for Christmas.

417
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,160
That sucked so bad.

418
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,720
The plot of it sucked and the way it was written was quite bad.

419
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,000
So I hope that one wasn't yours.

420
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,360
Also, I would say if that movie is real,

421
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,640
100% chance there's a scene with a husband involved of like,

422
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,120
hey, honey, let's make love tonight.

423
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,680
Oh, no, it's my twin sister's husband.

424
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,800
And that's in there, right?

425
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,000
Also, no disrespect, but nobody has ever said,

426
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,040
we're making a movie.

427
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,280
I would love to get Candace Cameron in it twice.

428
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,600
How is that supposed to be no disrespect?

429
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,560
Fairly disrespectful.

430
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,440
Can I move on?

431
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:55,920
Yes.

432
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,240
The next film is called A Shoe Addict's Christmas.

433
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,080
As Christmas approaches,

434
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,320
Noelle, played by Candace Cameron Bure,

435
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,960
is at a crossroads in her life when it seems that love,

436
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,400
a connection with her father, and her dream career are out of reach.

437
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,080
When she stays late at her job in a department store on a snowy Christmas Eve,

438
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,640
she accidentally gets locked in after closing.

439
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,680
She isn't too concerned about the prospect of spending the night in the store

440
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,680
until a quirky woman appears out of nowhere in the shoe department

441
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,240
and tells Noelle that she's her guardian angel.

442
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Soon, Noelle finds herself revisiting Christmas's past, present, and future.

443
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,520
She must work with her new neighbor, a handsome, Christmas-loving firefighter,

444
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,000
to plan the annual...

445
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,720
How would you describe yourself in three descriptive terms?

446
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,240
There's a fucking Christmas tree in that apartment, no!

447
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,480
Not like this, Jesus!

448
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,200
Not like this, Jesus, God, who I love for Christmas!

449
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,560
The annual Christmas charity gala will,

450
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,320
visiting the holidays of yesterday,

451
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,080
and tomorrow, help Noelle take new chances and discover the true spirit of Christmas.

452
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,880
And in realizing the only thing standing in her way is leading a fulfilling life as herself,

453
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,480
will the love she has longed for all her life be the best surprise gift of all?

454
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,400
And that is a shoe addict's Christmas,

455
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,920
starring Candace Cameron-Burr and, as her guardian angel, Jean Smart.

456
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,520
Hmm. Hmm.

457
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,200
Last film. A tailor-made Christmas.

458
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,120
New York fashion designer Grace Preston, played by Candace Cameron-Burr,

459
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,440
isn't thrilled about spending the holidays in her tiny hometown of Charity Falls, Wisconsin.

460
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,640
But when the dress her step-sister Anna's Christmas Eve wedding is lost in shipping,

461
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,920
Grace is guilted into crafting a last-minute replacement by their overbearing mother,

462
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,000
played by Mary Margaret Hume,

463
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,840
who you'll remember, of course, from Dawson's Creek.

464
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,640
Ah.

465
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,920
Grace is making the best of a bad situation until she meets the best man at the right time.

466
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,040
And that's when she finds out she's the best man in the world.

467
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:56,400
Grace is making the best of a bad situation until she meets the best man at a pre-wedding luncheon

468
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,680
and learns it's none other than her high school boyfriend, Brad Phillips.

469
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,720
After a college football injury ended his dreams of going pro,

470
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,960
Brad turned his attention to Tailor Made,

471
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,200
a charity that provides handcrafted business,

472
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,760
sorry, handcrafted business attire to homeless men and women heading to job interviews.

473
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,360
Brad is kind, caring and intelligent,

474
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,800
but he's also put down roots in Charity Falls as Christmas Eve approaches.

475
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,400
Grace must choose between a life with Brad and following her dreams in the fashion industry.

476
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:22,800
Fuck.

477
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,920
These are three films.

478
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,080
I can't fucking believe one is not real.

479
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,720
One, those are all so good.

480
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,200
They're all really good.

481
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,320
They're all a Christmas to me.

482
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,520
I mean, not good.

483
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,160
No, they're quite bad.

484
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,640
Okay, listen.

485
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,040
They're all a Christmas to me, but I want to know which is the one that is a Christmas to me.

486
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,560
Should we take audience poll first?

487
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,880
No, I want to hear you two before they bias you.

488
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,000
The first one, Switch to Christmas, has to be real

489
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,080
because I know there's more than one of that exact movie that exists out there.

490
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,880
So if there's more than one, this is probably among the crew.

491
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,800
I have my guess, Travis.

492
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,960
But if I found two Candace Cameron Bure movies,

493
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,520
boy, a good punchline would be a movie with two of her in the same film.

494
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,480
That would be a good punchline.

495
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,440
No, no, no, no.

496
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,480
I'm okay.

497
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,200
I've got mine.

498
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,080
I got mine.

499
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,720
Okay.

500
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,240
I'm going to Shoe Addicts Christmas.

501
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,600
Mine is also Shoe Addicts Christmas is Fake.

502
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,720
Shoe Addicts Christmas is Fake.

503
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,440
I think there's a lot of diversion in there.

504
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,120
Like you say, oh, and it's got a Jane Smyrna.

505
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,960
We're going to take a quick poll from the audience.

506
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,000
The first we're just going to do just by cheers.

507
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,320
First film was Switch to Christmas.

508
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,600
Round of applause if you think that's fake.

509
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,500
Okay.

510
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,600
Second film was a Shoe Addicts Christmas.

511
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,880
Round of applause if you think that's fake.

512
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,280
Okay, thank you.

513
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Our third film was A Tailor Made Christmas.

514
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,960
A round of applause if you think that's fake.

515
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,280
The film that I made up.

516
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,040
Well, actually Sydney made up mainly,

517
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,320
but I hope is A Tailor Made Christmas is a fake.

518
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,520
Switch for Christmas is real?

519
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,320
Switch for Christmas is so fucked

520
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,720
because one of the women has two children.

521
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,160
I can't deal with these idiots.

522
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,280
I can't deal with these idiots at Christmas.

523
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,360
Bye.

524
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,920
Bye.

525
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,000
I'm living at my sister Deborah's apartment

526
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,120
and loving it.

527
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,560
Hey, idiots.

528
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,520
Mom's gone.

529
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,000
Bye.

530
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,640
Enjoy my kids for Christmas.

531
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,880
Have you and Sydney thought about pitching movies

532
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,240
to the Hallmark Channel?

533
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,000
She's got a gift, honestly.

534
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,960
A lot of this is like, you know that scene

535
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,280
where Sally Aries like throwing the music around?

536
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,480
Like, how does he do it?

537
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,800
That's me typing these down when Sydney's like,

538
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,640
and then Candace Cameron Brewer is like,

539
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,480
this woman was, the mother of my children

540
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,120
was dictating scenes to me that would be in the movie

541
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,600
if she filled it out to a spec script.

542
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,200
She was like, there would fully be a scene

543
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,360
where her company is like,

544
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,200
good news, Bloomingdale's loves your new collection,

545
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,560
but they want to see more by New Year's Eve.

546
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,160
So we need you back here immediately.

547
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,200
And she would then have to choose.

548
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,040
The name of the city was Charity Falls, right?

549
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,160
Charity Falls, Wisconsin, yeah.

550
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,280
That should have been the giveaway.

551
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,240
No, I actually thought that was so Hallmark

552
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,720
that it was about a charity called Taylor Merck.

553
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,600
Bro, it's not a giveaway.

554
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,920
The woman in the last film is called Noel.

555
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,120
Like, it's not a giveaway.

556
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,000
They're all like this.

557
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,480
Half the towns in these fucking movies are Christmas.

558
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,960
Christmas town or Christmas city, Christmasburg.

559
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,920
I live in Christmas Eve town.

560
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,120
Hello, party people, and welcome.

561
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,360
Thank you for listening to this episode.

562
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,480
Travis, oh, Travis.

563
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,400
You've heard so much of it already.

564
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,240
Oh, help me, Travis.

565
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,680
Oh no, Griffin, what's wrong?

566
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,720
I busted my cut laughing at this great episode

567
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,720
and all the great jokes that we had at Austin, Texas.

568
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,840
I've heard of it, yes.

569
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,640
It's my favorite.

570
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,600
And so now we are going to tell you about our sponsors.

571
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,080
The tragic thing is I've clicked away

572
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,320
from where the list of the sponsors is.

573
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,840
Well, can I say, Griffin,

574
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,360
if you have injured yourself,

575
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,400
might I recommend laying down on this Casper mattress?

576
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,680
No, no, gotta go to the hospital.

577
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,240
Did you not hear me?

578
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,680
My tummy busted open, Travis.

579
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,280
I got sepsis.

580
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,760
Because I have found that when I am injured

581
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,000
and want to rest and recuperate,

582
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,760
well, there's no place better to do that

583
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,520
than my Casper mattress.

584
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:20,960
This is true.

585
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,040
The other day, and listen, I'm not a doctor.

586
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,520
The other day, my hand hurt really bad.

587
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,760
I think I'd injured it signing posters

588
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
and books and stuff at the Austin show.

589
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,960
So fucking bougie.

590
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,000
And I laid down.

591
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,360
I took a nap, half hour.

592
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,760
When I woke up, my hand was completely healed.

593
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,760
So I attribute that to-

594
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,320
Christ, Christ-like these mattresses are.

595
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,120
That's what I'm saying.

596
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,720
They're the Holy Ghost of mattresses.

597
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,040
Oh, that's great.

598
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,520
Thank you.

599
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,080
And you can check them out now.

600
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,440
They offer affordable prices

601
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,120
because Casper cuts out the middleman

602
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,720
and sells directly to the consumer.

603
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,800
Casper brand mattresses combine

604
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,960
multiple supportive memory foams

605
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,640
for a quality sleep service

606
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,680
with the right amounts of both sink and bounce.

607
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,640
It's eight sink and 14 bounce.

608
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,440
That's it.

609
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,360
Well, Griffin, you gave away a-

610
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,320
Oh, shit.

611
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,840
Secret family recipe.

612
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,280
And you can be sure of your purchase

613
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,800

619
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,280
Can I tell you about some shops?

620
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,000
Yes, please.

621
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,840
Can I tell you about a little bit of stomps?

622
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,440
Please tell me about stomps.

623
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,640
Listen, it's the holidays

624
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,400
and around the holidays times

625
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,800
is when you must use stomps the most

626
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,280
on your boxes and your letters.

627
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,080
To Santa.

628
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,560
To Santa Claus.

629
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,160
He loves receiving your letters.

630
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,600
If you don't put stamps on them though,

631
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,720
he shreds them.

632
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,360
He shreds them.

633
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,720
You get put on the naughty list,

634
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,360
which is just a short walk to the hell list.

635
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:53,760
Yeah.

636
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,520
And also the no fly list.

637
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,720
Add the no fly list.

638
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,560
But if you put it on the,

639
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,640
if you put a stomps on the letters to Santa,

640
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,920
you get TSA pre-check.

641
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,640
Just like that.

642
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,800
So stamps.com is great.

643
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,600
It's very convenient.

644
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,840
I hate leaving the house for virtually any reason.

645
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,520
And stomps.com is there for me

646
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,400
because they have the technology

647
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,360
that they give to you

648
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,920
so that your house technically becomes a post office.

649
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,480
You got to be careful

650
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,520
because people are going to come to you

651
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,560
wanting to buy stamps.

652
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,840
And I think that's illegal for you

653
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,160
to open up a secret stamps resale market.

654
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,440
So maybe I shouldn't even mention

655
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,920
that possibility in this an advertisement for stamps.

656
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,960
It is convenient though,

657
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,200
because your breadbox will become a PO box.

658
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,240
So that's nice.

659
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,120
It is nice.

660
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,320
Anyway,

661
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,160
stamps.com can help save you a bunch of time

662
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,200
during the holiday season.

663
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,280
You can buy and print official US postage

664
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,120
for any letter, any package, any class of mail

665
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,640
using your own computer and printer.

666
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,840
Then the mail carrier picks it up

667
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,280
and you don't have to go to the post office.

668
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,240
You're going to save a bunch of time.

669
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,360
You're going to save a bunch of money.

670
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,720
Stomps.com is the best gift

671
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,640
you can give yourself this holiday season.

672
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,320
You can enjoy the stamps.com service

673
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,280
with the special offer

674
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,360
that includes a four week trial plus postage

675
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,280
and a digital scale without long-term commitments.

676
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,880
Go to stamps.com,

677
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,720
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage

678
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,560
and type in my brother, all one word.

679
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,000
That's stamps.com.

680
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,520
Enter my brother.

681
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,560
This message is for Michael and it's from Rebecca.

682
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,640
Michael Felix says,

683
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,360
which in Bubba speak

684
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,880
means that we both love you

685
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,120
and your poopy butt bones a whole lot.

686
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,320
Hey, come on.

687
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,360
It's what it says.

688
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,840
Listen, some of us suffer from poopy butt bones

689
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,520
and you don't got to make it sound jovial.

690
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,280
That was a sad sentence, Travis.

691
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,360
Love you and your poopy butt bones a whole lot.

692
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:31,840
Thank you.

693
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,280
Thanks for letting me harass you all the time,

694
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,400
you sweet birdie.

695
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,400
Now, please remember to Febreze the bathroom

696
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,200
when you come out.

697
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,080
I mean, there's a lot in there.

698
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,920
Yeah, a lot about his poopy butt bones

699
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,960
and sort of the issues that Rebecca has with them.

700
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,360
But I guess now Michael's going to take that stuff

701
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,960
a little bit more seriously.

702
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,920
But who's Felix?

703
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,640
Who is Bubba?

704
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,760
Who are these characters?

705
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,640
It don't matter.

706
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,920
Here's one for Lewin

707
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,160
and it's from Taylor and Ginger who say,

708
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,160
happy 22nd birth from your...

709
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,680
Whoa, 22...

710
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,120
That's it.

711
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,320
You beat the Duggars, right?

712
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,800
That's a lot of births from your two best buds.

713
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,480
We've spent 16 of your birthdays together,

714
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,560
but I'm still sorry I missed the first five

715
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,080
and Ginger, the first 16.

716
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,160
You're a strong, beautiful, bespectacled bear

717
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,360
and one smart cookie.

718
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,360
Thanks for sticking with us in life and D&D

719
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,840
even though you forced Ginger to flirt with you

720
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,080
as a Southern fantasy sheriff.

721
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,720
We love you.

722
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,960
Have you been there, done that, huh?

723
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,880
Wait, was Ginger the fantasy sheriff or was Lewin?

724
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,040
I think all of them were.

725
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,400
I think they're doing a Deadwood,

726
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,240
but they're all playing the handsome man, you know, him.

727
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,160
I just think I would like to see this game

728
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,400
where a fantasy sheriff was like, flirt with me.

729
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,640
Deadwood was just sort of a bunch of nasty men

730
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,600
looking very sort of bedraggled,

731
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,920
but then the one handsome man does come to town

732
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,440
and it just goes around being all handsome.

733
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,400
I haven't seen all of the show,

734
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,360
but that's what I remember of him.

735
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,320
Are you talking about Timothy Amundson as the handsome man?

736
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,680
I'm talking about Timothy Olyphant as the handsome man.

737
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,640
So anyway, this is for nobody.

738
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,000
We can debate that later.

739
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,920
Sure, and Travis is gonna read the last one.

740
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,680
This is for Gabriel and it's from Kelly.

741
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,520
Happy all events and holidays

742
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,520
that fall in the first half of 2018.

743
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,400
Well, we missed that.

744
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,480
There is no one else I would want to share this crazy life with

745
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,600
whether it's going to Taiwan, a train trip to Texas

746
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,040
for the cotton bowl or yelling at the lions every Sunday.

747
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,400
I love you more than anything.

748
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,000
Oh no, they got lions outside their house, Griffin.

749
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,280
I know, but they read the right books

750
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,360
because yelling at them is the best way to fight the lions.

751
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,040
You gotta yell and you gotta make yourself look big.

752
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,960
Yeah, and you gotta yell stuff like,

753
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,800
oh hey, I hate lions, I hate them.

754
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,520
Oh, lions smell like poopy butt bones.

755
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:42,960
Can we not?

756
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,080
I'm so sorry, Griffin.

757
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,840
So I hope you all enjoyed these Jumbotrons

758
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,440
because they are the last.

759
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,000
Oh yeah.

760
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,500
Yeah.

761
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,120
They are the last of the Jumbotrons.

762
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,440
Yes, we're changing shit up

763
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,080
and it's weird that we're doing this without Justin here.

764
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,040
But yes, we are going to stop doing Jumbotrons

765
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,200
both on My Brother, My Brother and Me and Adventure Zone.

766
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,520
We're gonna continue doing them on our other shows

767
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,560
because the reality of the situation

768
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,280
is that selling them on our shows

769
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,840
has become a very, very, unbearably difficult

770
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,040
and competitive and disappointing process

771
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,720
for virtually everybody involved.

772
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,600
And yeah, we've enjoyed doing them

773
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,240
and it's been a fun way to interact with y'all

774
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:28,960
as we keep going on.

775
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,880
But now we have lots of fun ways to interact with y'all

776
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,920
and so we are putting them to bed.

777
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,080
Now the Money Zone's gonna be a little bit tighter,

778
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,400
which I'm sure a lot of people are gonna be also excited about.

779
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,680
And yes, big programming update.

780
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,360
Also, thank you all for listening to the show.

781
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,400
You won't hear us again.

782
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,040
We have some big things coming up this week

783
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,080
so make sure you pay attention.

784
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,360
Oh shit, yeah.

785
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:51,920
Yeah, dude.

786
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,520
To the My Brother, My Brother and Me Twitter account

787
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,320
so you don't miss it.

788
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,960
For real, we say shit like that all the time.

789
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,040
It's going to be a pretty big week.

790
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,600
Again, I can't believe Justin's not here.

791
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,640
Yeah, so make sure you keep an eye on that

792
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,920
because there's some stuff coming up

793
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,800
and you can pre-order the Adventure Zone graphic novel

794
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,040
at theadventurezonecomic.com.

795
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,880
We did a lot of this shit at the end of the live show.

796
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,680
Let's just get back to it.

797
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

798
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,000
All right, well, that's it.

799
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,600
Well, yeah, keep your eye locked on the Tweetos

800
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,840
and we'll catch you later.

801
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,480
Hi, this is Rachel McElroy.

802
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,000
Hello, this is Griffin McElroy.

803
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,040
And this is Wonderful.

804
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,480
It's a podcast that we do as we are married

805
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,240
and how's the ad going so far?

806
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,840
Because I think it's going very good.

807
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,400
We talk about things we like every week on Wednesdays.

808
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,000
One time Rachel talked about pumpernickel bread.

809
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,400
It was so tight you cannot afford to miss her

810
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,000
talking about this sweet brown bread.

811
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,240
We also talk about music and poems

812
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,160
and, you know, weather.

813
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,440
There was one, weather?

814
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,920
One time Rachel talked about Baby Beluga,

815
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,440
this song for like 14 minutes

816
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,280
and it just really blew my hair back.

817
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,560
So check us out on maximumfun.org.

818
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,800
It's a cool podcast with chill vibes.

819
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,480
Amber is the color of our energy

820
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,000
is what all the iTunes reviews say.

821
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,360
They will now.

822
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,840
How about a Yahoo answer?

823
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,340
Yeah.

824
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:14,660
This one was sent in by a lot of people.

825
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,820
Thank you everybody who got a hand on this ball.

826
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:21,620
It's from Yahoo Answers user NoSummertime who asks...

827
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:24,900
Oh wait, for Justin.

828
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,820
Why the hell don't I like potato salad?

829
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:43,540
I love potatoes, baked french fries, mashed hashbrowns,

830
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,060
grilled side dish things.

831
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,300
But the potato salad tastes like ass to me.

832
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,780
WTF is wrong with me.

833
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,900
It angers me and makes me want to punch someone in the face.

834
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,900
It's the mayonnaise.

835
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,700
It's the mayonnaise.

836
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,620
Justin says mayonnaise.

837
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:04,660
I buzzed in first.

838
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,020
It's the mayonnaise.

839
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,180
Mayonnaise tastes bad and things like that.

840
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:08,900
It's the mayonnaise.

841
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,540
It's the reason you don't like it.

842
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,300
It's cause mayonnaise is a weird thing to bind something with

843
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,860
and the reason you don't like it is the mayonnaise.

844
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,540
Come at me.

845
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:26,100
You didn't leave us much air to breathe in the bit zone.

846
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,700
Maybe it's not mayonnaise.

847
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,420
I mean, I do want to pitch this from Yahoo Answers user

848
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,460
who says there are lots of ways to make potato salad.

849
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,940
The one you have tasted probably wasn't very good.

850
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,980
No big deal.

851
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,900
Punching someone because you don't like potato salad is a bit over the top.

852
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,460
The only one at fault here is you for not liking it.

853
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,220
Punch yourself if you must.

854
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:56,100
Anyway, that's my new SNL character.

855
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,740
The guy that takes Yahoo Answers literally.

856
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,300
Well, the question asker really liked it

857
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,700
because they decided this was the best answer.

858
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,100
I love the idea of like tasting some food and like, I don't like this.

859
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,340
Don't blame that on anyone but yourself.

860
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:15,700
Yeah, I will say that Yahoo Answers user NoSummertime does not like potato salad.

861
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,620
They do like a slice of humble pie.

862
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,660
That's what they were served up.

863
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,820
They gobbled it down and said, you're right.

864
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,020
You know what?

865
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:22,500
You're right.

866
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,620
That was over the top.

867
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,500
I should not.

868
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,620
I'm the asshole.

869
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,220
I'm the one who tastes like ass now.

870
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,500
It could be the coldness of the potato.

871
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,740
You don't eat a cold potato most of the time, huh?

872
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:36,740
It's probably the mayonnaise.

873
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,860
It's just there's nothing else.

874
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,100
It's just that it's definitely the mayonnaise.

875
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,180
Mayonnaise is like a fish song.

876
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:42,820
Now hold on.

877
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,900
Listen really carefully because this part won't be in the show

878
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,620
because it won't be funny, but it's true.

879
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,380
Mayonnaise is like a fish song.

880
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,220
If you listen to Kill Devil Falls, right?

881
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,180
Or Free or any other great fish track on the album

882
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,100
and it's three minutes and 30 seconds long,

883
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,780
you're like, that was great.

884
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,820
Great song construction.

885
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,540
Great recording.

886
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,340
Fantastic.

887
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,620
You see it live.

888
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:06,660
It's 30 minutes long.

889
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:07,860
That's enough.

890
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:08,500
Thank you.

891
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,420
If you have a little bit of mayonnaise on a thing,

892
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,100
I don't remember sandwiches being this wet.

893
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,460
Welcome to the welcome.

894
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,300
It's not like sloppy sloppy,

895
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:25,140
but it's a little bit wetter than I remember.

896
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,580
It's a little bit indulgent.

897
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,100
And then there's like a line

898
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,300
and it's the seven minute mark of the Kill Devil Falls,

899
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,980
you know, Sioux City Falls, Iowa version of the song.

900
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,420
They've got them all on Spotify

901
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,620
and you listen to it for 17 minutes.

902
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,780
It's like, that's enough mayonnaise.

903
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,540
Hey Juice, are you real into fish?

904
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,980
Cause what the fuck, bud?

905
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,260
You got to tell us this shit.

906
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,140
It was improvisational comedy.

907
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:55,620
It wasn't.

908
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,340
You knew a lot about fish, friend.

909
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,700
You knew a lot about fish.

910
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:58,900
All right.

911
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,980
Here's the tip off that I pulled out on my ass.

912
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:03,060
I was talking about Kill Devil Falls

913
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,700
and I said Sioux City Falls, Iowa.

914
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,100
Okay.

915
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,540
So that was made up.

916
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,660
Anyway, too much mayonnaise.

917
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,860
After the whole Jimmy Buffet thing,

918
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,220
I don't know who to trust anymore.

919
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:11,540
Okay.

920
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:15,380
Okay.

921
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,380
I work at a local coffee shop

922
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:18,980
and over the last couple of months,

923
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,740
we've had a regular customer who comes in,

924
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,140
sets up his personal home office in the shop

925
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,420
and very loudly takes phone calls for his dental practice.

926
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:31,460
I recently noticed that he has four cell phones on him

927
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:34,580
at all times and uses all of them

928
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,020
to take these business calls.

929
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,140
Should I be concerned?

930
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,500
Is he involved in some sort of black market dental operation?

931
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,900
That's from Leave My Teeth Alone.

932
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,740
Being a dentist isn't like writing a screenplay, right?

933
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,220
That's not something you can just like post up

934
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,980
at a Starbucks and do it.

935
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,540
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

936
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:54,500
You know what?

937
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,300
What do I know?

938
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,820
It's 2018.

939
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,700
Maybe they're an at-home dentist.

940
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:00,260
Thank you.

941
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,220
They do house calls.

942
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:01,540
They'll come.

943
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,460
Do you have a chair that reclines

944
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,620
and a good bright flashlight?

945
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:10,020
Good bright flashlight and teeth hooks.

946
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,140
I don't really have anything.

947
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:11,860
I don't have anything.

948
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,140
Do you have a toothbrush?

949
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,100
You have a toothbrush.

950
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,500
This is how I know you guys aren't dentists

951
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:21,060
because you can't just buy a dentist store

952
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:26,260
and then go in there and go in there with your chair

953
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,580
and the light and the metal thing

954
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,340
and open the door and say, I'm ready for teeth.

955
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:32,820
Yeah.

956
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:34,580
And then expect people to go.

957
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,740
You have to build your client base

958
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,900
through networking and...

959
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,940
And Patreon.

960
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,020
And Patreon and entrepreneurship.

961
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,820
And you have to build your client base before.

962
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,220
You have to say, would you be interested

963
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:50,020
in a value-priced dentist who's just learning

964
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,620
and cutting his teeth, if you will.

965
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:53,140
But I won't.

966
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:53,700
Hey, hey, hey.

967
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,700
But I won't cut your teeth

968
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,980
because I've only been in dentists for a week,

969
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,740
but I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to do that.

970
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,460
I know you don't.

971
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,140
I don't know much yet.

972
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:01,700
Yet.

973
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:02,020
Yet.

974
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,940
But I don't think I'm supposed to cut your teeth.

975
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,540
I do know this, teeth are mad hard.

976
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,300
I don't think you can cut them if you try.

977
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,460
I've heard a lot about drilling

978
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,300
and I plan on YouTubing that later

979
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,380
to see if I can find some tutorials.

980
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,420
I went to Home Depot.

981
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,820
The drill seemed pretty big.

982
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,300
So...

983
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,700
If I'm being honest, I wouldn't want that.

984
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,660
If you know of a...

985
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,980
This could sound silly, but like a dentist depot.

986
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,900
That would be funny to have the dentist

987
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,180
come to your house for the fourth time

988
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,500
and say, good news, got my own place.

989
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,900
You can come visit me there from now on.

990
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:33,140
Yeah.

991
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:35,060
I've got lots of old highlights magazines.

992
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,700
That would be the day I stopped going to that dentist.

993
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,980
Like what would be better than a dentist

994
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,340
who comes to your house?

995
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,940
A dentist who doesn't come to your house.

996
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:44,660
Fair.

997
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:45,540
I'll grant you that.

998
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,860
So we have some audience questions.

999
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:50,020
I want to keep talking about this fucking dentist.

1000
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:50,900
Are you serious?

1001
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,340
Yeah, we can't leave this guy alone.

1002
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:53,780
Okay.

1003
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:56,580
For a lot of mostly because what he's doing is illegal,

1004
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:57,940
so we should keep an eye on him.

1005
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:00,580
What, okay. The four cell phones.

1006
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,860
Let's talk about that for a second.

1007
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,460
One's for his mistress, probably.

1008
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:08,820
And then the other three, we can talk about the...

1009
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,300
I feel like he's probably calling other people

1010
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,700
and saying like, hey, this is your dentist.

1011
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,380
I got arrested for getting drunk in the job

1012
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:22,340
and I don't think I'm going to be able to do that.

1013
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:25,060
I'm not going to be able to teeth.

1014
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,580
Drill right.

1015
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:30,420
Drill right clean through someone's whole head.

1016
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,340
So you should probably find a new dentist anyway.

1017
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,700
I'm scared of teeth now.

1018
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,900
I'm really scared of teeth.

1019
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,980
I got a phobia now and I got to go.

1020
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:39,380
Bye.

1021
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:42,900
They have one phone that they call other dentists with

1022
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,980
and they're like, hi, this is Timothy, dentist.

1023
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:50,900
And I was asked, I'm doing a book report about dentistry.

1024
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,500
Can you tell me where you get your tools

1025
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:58,180
and also how you do every part of your job?

1026
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,180
No, maybe their dental practice,

1027
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,260
their dental middleman and somebody calls them

1028
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,940
that you got it and then they call a dentist

1029
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:09,540
and then they just hold the phones together.

1030
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,900
Are you guys done yet?

1031
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,860
Okay, sorry.

1032
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,460
For 10 minutes, he sits in the corner

1033
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:27,700
and makes his phone 69 and I don't know why.

1034
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,580
What's that?

1035
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:29,940
You need an orthodontist?

1036
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:30,900
I got a third phone.

1037
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,220
I put you on the party line.

1038
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,820
Okay, so we will.

1039
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:37,940
Well, let's do audience questions.

1040
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,780
Yes, we have some picked out.

1041
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:40,260
We do it.

1042
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,060
We're doing it a new way.

1043
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,980
Probably since the last time we were here in Austin.

1044
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:45,060
Yeah, we're going to call some names and some seat numbers.

1045
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,420
You're going to come on down to the microphones.

1046
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:49,220
Can we get the spotlights down on the microphones

1047
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,060
in three, two, okay.

1048
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,100
Hey, what's up?

1049
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:52,580
Hello.

1050
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:53,380
Hey, who are you?

1051
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,100
I'm Brooks.

1052
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,340
Hi, Brooks.

1053
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:00,980
So my question is my boyfriend keeps on going

1054
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:08,740
into the pantry and grabbing handfuls of fettuccine uncooked.

1055
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,420
I would hope he's not grabbing handfuls

1056
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,860
of cooked fettuccine, Brooks.

1057
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,820
In your pantry?

1058
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:17,380
No, and eating them raw and he keeps calling them chips.

1059
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:17,620
Okay.

1060
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,660
How do I make him stop?

1061
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,940
Is your boyfriend here?

1062
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,180
Yeah.

1063
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:25,780
You're a monster.

1064
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:29,380
Words mean things.

1065
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,420
Does anybody remember?

1066
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,980
I haven't been to Olive Garden in many moons,

1067
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:36,820
but they do have like a little like fettuccine bottle

1068
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:38,580
that you can just grab them out of and shoot.

1069
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:38,980
Hold on.

1070
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,500
Was this a prank you guys pulled on me

1071
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,140
when we went to Olive Garden as kids?

1072
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:43,860
No, stop.

1073
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,740
Everybody shut up.

1074
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,740
Do they give you raw fettuccine to chew on

1075
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:50,100
in the lobby of the Olive Garden?

1076
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,380
You fucking bastards.

1077
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,700
The prestige.

1078
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,860
And now you have IBS.

1079
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,260
I did.

1080
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:10,980
We got him.

1081
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,220
What I need you, Brooks, we'll get back to you.

1082
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,300
What I need you two to understand is

1083
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:21,460
that was not the only time I went to Olive Garden.

1084
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:25,780
There were...

1085
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:28,820
Were there never employees around?

1086
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:38,020
I, wanting to seem like an authentic metropolitan diner,

1087
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,940
would always grab the fettuccine

1088
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,220
and walk over to my friends like,

1089
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,580
yeah, I'm a little peckish.

1090
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,020
I can't believe you did that.

1091
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,620
I can't believe literally I'm finding out

1092
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:51,140
in the worst imaginable venue.

1093
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,660
Speaking as a former Olive Garden employee,

1094
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:58,820
if I saw a little kid eating raw fettuccine,

1095
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,820
the odds of me stopping them are negative 1000%.

1096
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,540
Okay, Brooks.

1097
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:06,100
Brooks.

1098
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:09,700
Brooks, yeah, so I'm gonna sit this one out, Brooks.

1099
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,140
Brooks, is it possible that your boyfriend

1100
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,900
has been laboring under the same delusion

1101
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,820
as my brother for all these years?

1102
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,860
Oh, wait, they sell this for you to take home?

1103
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:22,260
Okay, a little fancy for myself then.

1104
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,660
Brooks, is it possible your boyfriend does not

1105
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,220
believe these are chips,

1106
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:34,340
but instead likes to annoy you by calling them chips,

1107
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,260
a thing I, not exactly that,

1108
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,420
but similar, do to my wife all the time?

1109
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:43,540
Is it possible your boyfriend loves chips

1110
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,180
and you never have chips

1111
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,340
and this is his way of passive-aggressively

1112
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:50,580
sort of guilting you into going,

1113
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,340
these are tasty chips.

1114
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,340
And as a raw fettuccine eater myself,

1115
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,900
I can tell you it's not a good chew.

1116
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,780
You do it and you put it in your mouth

1117
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,380
and your six-year-old brain thinks

1118
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:04,260
it'll turn the fettuccine in the heat of your mouth.

1119
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,540
It doesn't work like that.

1120
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:06,900
It doesn't work like that.

1121
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,260
It just doesn't work like that.

1122
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:08,760
Brooks?

1123
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:10,180
Yes.

1124
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,700
Did you eat all your boyfriend's chips?

1125
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,660
No, but he does bring that up

1126
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:19,700
every time he loudly crunches on them next to me.

1127
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:21,860
Brings what up?

1128
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:23,300
That I don't have any chips.

1129
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,060
Okay then, Brooks, that's the answer.

1130
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,940
All right, Brooks, we've got to buy this.

1131
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:28,340
We've sold it.

1132
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:32,420
You've got to buy some chips, Brooks.

1133
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,020
Somewhere in this audience,

1134
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,380
Brooks' boyfriend is going, yes.

1135
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:39,140
And now I shall have chips.

1136
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:40,900
Follow-up question.

1137
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,500
I don't know where to get chips from.

1138
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,340
Have you ever seen your boyfriend

1139
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,700
with a pot of boiling water

1140
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,140
cutting the bristles off a broom into it

1141
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,340
saying we're out of fettuccine?

1142
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:55,700
Oh, Brooks, here's what you do.

1143
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,380
Have you ever seen this boyfriend,

1144
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,580
plug your ears.

1145
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,500
Okay, go buy a bag of chips.

1146
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,420
Dump them all in the garbage.

1147
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,980
Put some raw fettuccine in it.

1148
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,700
Put a chip clip back on it.

1149
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,940
Put it back in the pantry and wait.

1150
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:11,860
And he's going to think he's in like

1151
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,460
a weird Twilight Zone episode

1152
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,380
where there have never been chips.

1153
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:16,340
Never been chips.

1154
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:17,460
Wait until-

1155
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:18,820
And then what's that you're boiling?

1156
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:19,460
Doritos.

1157
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:20,740
Yes, yeah.

1158
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,460
Wait until your boyfriend starts making fettuccine

1159
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,140
if you're real and walk over and smell the pop

1160
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:29,060
and say, mm, chip soup.

1161
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,260
My favorite.

1162
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,340
Delicious.

1163
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:32,900
Does that help?

1164
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:33,940
Yes.

1165
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:34,500
Okay, good.

1166
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:34,980
Thank you.

1167
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,100
Please go ahead.

1168
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:42,820
Luke, what's up?

1169
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:43,460
Luke.

1170
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,020
Hey.

1171
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:44,500
Hell yeah.

1172
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:44,820
Get casual with that mic.

1173
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:46,500
I really enjoy your question.

1174
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:48,420
Thank you.

1175
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,860
First of all, Luke Baker,

1176
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,540
sophomore at School of Mass Communication

1177
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,460
and Journalism at Texas State University.

1178
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,420
Yeah.

1179
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:56,900
Is this your LinkedIn?

1180
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,980
Yeah, but I gotta tell you,

1181
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,660
that shit's broken bad for us in the past.

1182
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:01,460
I thought you were going to be like,

1183
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,500
my SoundCloud is-

1184
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,220
Just ask the question, Luke.

1185
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:05,860
I will warn you,

1186
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:06,820
if you're about to do that,

1187
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:07,860
the last time it happened,

1188
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,380
the person was booed so hard

1189
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,980
they sunk into the mantle of the earth.

1190
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,620
Let that be a lesson to all of you.

1191
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:14,900
It was fucking brutal

1192
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,500
and I loved every second of it.

1193
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:19,940
We will do nothing to stop it.

1194
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:23,060
We will do nothing to stop it.

1195
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:24,260
Thank you for warning me.

1196
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,300
So my question is,

1197
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,060
what is charcuterie?

1198
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:33,640
Because-

1199
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,220
You don't need to clarify beyond the earlier-

1200
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:38,820
I would be interested to see why.

1201
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,020
That word's been kind of haunting me

1202
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:42,900
for the past month.

1203
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:45,380
I've just heard it so many times.

1204
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:46,580
Where?

1205
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:49,540
Just like in passing-

1206
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:50,420
Menus though, right?

1207
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:50,920
Right?

1208
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:54,660
Not just like on park benches and stuff.

1209
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,040
I don't-

1210
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,100
Dude, just like in casual conversation,

1211
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,780
I've never really had the heart to like,

1212
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:00,500
be like,

1213
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,380
okay, what is that?

1214
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,500
So I figured you guys would-

1215
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,700
Do you have any,

1216
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:05,380
any gl-

1217
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,220
Don't you fucking lie to me, Luke.

1218
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:09,460
How much do you actually know about charcuterie?

1219
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,180
Literally nothing at all.

1220
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:13,060
Okay, Luke.

1221
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,140
Let me take a crack at it.

1222
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:16,260
It's cheese and meat.

1223
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:16,500
All right.

1224
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,180
Well, but also sometimes it could be almonds

1225
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:22,260
and it can be almonds and it could be a pickle

1226
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,260
and it could be jam of some sort.

1227
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,380
Honeycomb is sometimes on there.

1228
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:26,900
It can be crusty bread.

1229
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:30,340
I think it's whatever the fuck they got laying around.

1230
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:30,900
Yeah.

1231
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,220
It's a fancy word for leftovers.

1232
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,500
That are easy to make.

1233
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,420
If it took work to make little ones,

1234
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,820
that's an appetizer or an hors d'oeuvre.

1235
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:45,380
If they just cut up something from Pepperidge Farm,

1236
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:45,620
that-

1237
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:47,460
You got charcuterie going, my friend.

1238
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:50,020
What's the one with the little vegetables?

1239
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:50,820
What's that called?

1240
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,340
A plate of little vegetables is called-

1241
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:53,140
Crudite.

1242
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:53,620
Crudite.

1243
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:54,420
Crudite.

1244
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:56,100
Crudite is vegetables.

1245
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,140
Charcuterie is cheese and meat.

1246
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:59,380
Charcuterie has vegetables on it too sometimes.

1247
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:00,420
Listen, let's dial in.

1248
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:02,500
Let's start with what isn't.

1249
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,700
What isn't charcuterie?

1250
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:04,980
A car, a truck.

1251
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:06,340
A child's laughter.

1252
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:07,060
Child's laughter.

1253
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:07,940
That's where we breathe.

1254
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:08,820
The stage I'm sitting on.

1255
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,180
A dream of your grandparents.

1256
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:10,900
Yes.

1257
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,500
A memory of summer's past.

1258
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:14,100
These things-

1259
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:15,300
Well, wait.

1260
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,300
A memory of summer's past could be charcuterie.

1261
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,700
Yeah, my grandma made the death of charcuterie.

1262
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,860
Also, your grandparents might've dreamed of charcuterie.

1263
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:22,180
I don't know-

1264
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:24,180
And a child might be laughing at charcuterie.

1265
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:24,500
Okay.

1266
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:27,780
That's some funny charcuterie they'd say.

1267
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:32,260
When a bread becomes too hard to safely consume,

1268
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:33,700
it is now charcuterie.

1269
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:39,620
When a thin meat is deemed too flavorless,

1270
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,820
it has become charcuterie.

1271
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:42,020
And room temperature.

1272
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:44,900
When a cheese has been deemed to be too flavorful,

1273
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:46,980
now it's charcuterie.

1274
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,100
Are you following me?

1275
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,220
I get it.

1276
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:49,940
There's imagine...

1277
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:52,660
When you go and you have to work at a restaurant,

1278
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:54,100
you go get your food handler's license,

1279
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,020
you learn about the safe range of temperature.

1280
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:56,900
Yes, the danger zone.

1281
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:00,180
There's a secret gauge they don't tell you about,

1282
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:02,420
and it is when does bread become so hard,

1283
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,780
now it's charcuterie, baby.

1284
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,900
And also, it should be clear,

1285
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,300
these can't be loose things.

1286
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,460
One piece of bread is not charcuterie.

1287
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,460
One piece of cheese is not charcuterie.

1288
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:14,660
One piece of meat, no.

1289
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:16,820
Put it all in the same area.

1290
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:18,420
Maybe it's like a hunk of wood.

1291
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:20,100
Or maybe it's a stone slab.

1292
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,620
Maybe it's someone's face.

1293
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:22,340
I don't know.

1294
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:23,620
Now it's charcuterie.

1295
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:25,620
Another big determining factor.

1296
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:28,100
If it costs $30, that's a charcuterie.

1297
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,220
That's a charcuterie.

1298
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,780
If it's complimentary...

1299
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:35,700
The $6 offering at Applebee's is a ham party.

1300
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,900
Or, as it's called on the menu, a ham slam.

1301
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:41,860
A ham slam.

1302
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:44,100
That explains so much,

1303
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,940
because the reason I was pitching myself earlier

1304
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,460
is because I'm not worth $30 yet.

1305
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:48,500
So...

1306
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:49,000
Yes.

1307
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:51,780
No, no, no, don't all that.

1308
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,300
That's a fucking goal.

1309
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,500
That's an aspiration.

1310
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:56,900
I remember the first time I ate charcuterie,

1311
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:00,020
I went, oh, that cheese is...

1312
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:00,520
Wow.

1313
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,820
I went, taste that, taste that, taste that.

1314
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:05,060
It's really pungent, huh?

1315
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,100
But I've made it.

1316
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,180
Because it was $30 that I had.

1317
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:08,820
That's the thing.

1318
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:13,220
Charcuterie is like the noted excess of food.

1319
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:14,260
Because it's literally like, hey,

1320
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:16,180
do you want a delicious appetizer?

1321
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:18,820
Or like a plate of actual food you're gonna eat?

1322
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:19,700
No, no.

1323
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:22,420
Give me a big hunk of wood with some leavens on it.

1324
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:22,820
Sure.

1325
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:23,780
For $30!

1326
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:24,580
For $30.

1327
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:26,500
If you run, if you own a...

1328
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,180
I know this is a food scene, Austin.

1329
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:29,220
I know it because I live here.

1330
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:31,380
If you're a restaurateur, restaurant owner,

1331
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,780
please Christ do this,

1332
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:36,420
because it's the best idea I've ever had in my life.

1333
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,260
If your restaurant sells charcuterie,

1334
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,020
and it costs $30,

1335
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,500
it's got flavorless ham and stinky cheese on it.

1336
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:46,100
It should also come with a sticker that said,

1337
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:47,540
I had charcuterie today.

1338
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:54,900
They put that on you.

1339
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:59,460
You go to any job interview in the fucking city.

1340
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,020
What are your qualifications?

1341
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:05,140
I have $30 to throw around.

1342
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:11,300
My teeth are hard enough to chew through the firmest breads.

1343
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:14,260
Luke, does that help?

1344
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,300
That helps me immensely.

1345
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,260
Thank you so much, guys.

1346
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,060
Thank you, Luke.

1347
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,340
All right, and thank you.

1348
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:19,300
Yeah, we got one more.

1349
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,060
Yes.

1350
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:21,460
Hello.

1351
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:23,060
Hi.

1352
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,020
Hey, what's your name?

1353
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:24,420
Camille.

1354
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:25,140
Hi, Camille.

1355
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:25,780
Camille.

1356
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:30,420
Hi, so my question, I guess, was,

1357
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,180
at work a while ago,

1358
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:35,140
we were all kind of reminiscing about how fun college was

1359
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:36,820
and fun stuff we do with our friends.

1360
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:40,340
And I told my coworkers about the inside joke,

1361
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:41,220
me and my best friend,

1362
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:42,580
who we lived together for three years,

1363
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:45,140
had where when one person would come home,

1364
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:47,620
whoever was already at home would pretend they had died.

1365
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:52,020
And when you find your best friend's dead body,

1366
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:54,820
you have to react like you fell, excuse me,

1367
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:56,660
found and murdered.

1368
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:58,740
Camille got worked up for a second.

1369
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,900
It's hilarious.

1370
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:01,540
Yeah, sure.

1371
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:05,380
My coworkers did get really weird though.

1372
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,660
Well, because here's-

1373
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,420
No, what's your question?

1374
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:11,540
I just, I know they think it's weird,

1375
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:12,980
but they tried to laugh it off like,

1376
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:14,820
oh, yeah.

1377
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,340
Was that also because human beings are awkward?

1378
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:20,980
Oh, yeah.

1379
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:24,180
Camille, let me say this.

1380
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:25,620
I don't think the game itself is weird,

1381
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,300
but the thing that struck me about it

1382
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:31,460
is the chance that you would get halfway through

1383
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,900
doing a very dramatic like,

1384
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,900
oh, oh no, oh God, wait.

1385
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:37,700
Oh, ah, fuck.

1386
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:41,940
Yeah, that's a game you win until you lose.

1387
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,500
And then you ain't gonna win it again.

1388
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:50,260
But you will get A's for the rest of the semester,

1389
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:50,980
which is nice.

1390
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:54,900
I've heard that.

1391
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:55,460
I don't know.

1392
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,940
I just heard it in a movie.

1393
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:00,020
I mean, it's like a fun game between us.

1394
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:00,900
We both know we're playing it.

1395
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,260
I'll say this more than once.

1396
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:04,980
In your defense, everybody here,

1397
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:07,140
when you heard about the rules of this game,

1398
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:09,700
you may say out loud, oh, ghoulish.

1399
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,900
I want everybody to just round of applause

1400
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,980
if your mind didn't immediately start racing

1401
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:16,820
of the scenarios you had concocted.

1402
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:19,060
Yes.

1403
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:19,940
Right.

1404
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:20,440
Yes.

1405
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,740
So maybe, Camille,

1406
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:25,700
the reason that your coworkers reacted like that

1407
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,220
is because they were distracted

1408
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:29,940
thinking about how they would fake being dead later.

1409
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:32,180
Yeah, how they wish they had done it

1410
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,380
because it sounds fun.

1411
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:33,880
Yeah.

1412
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:39,000
Oh, I would just wrap myself up in mummy stuff.

1413
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,840
That would get a good scare, wouldn't it?

1414
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,240
I would put a whole pile of me

1415
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,680
underneath a magician's trick.

1416
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,360
Like the prestige.

1417
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,400
You got me again, Justin.

1418
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,040
It's a lot of expense and it's worth every penny.

1419
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:03,400
I'm going to have to talk to Nikolai Tesla.

1420
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,920
I would get one of my bones out of my body

1421
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,640
and just sort of put it on the kitchen counter

1422
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:15,080
and then stay at a hotel for a month.

1423
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,280
I would slowly, over many months,

1424
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,120
collect some pints of my own blood

1425
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:24,120
until I have enough to fill the whole house.

1426
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:28,120
I would stab myself with a knife, but a bat stab.

1427
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,040
Wait, bat in...

1428
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,160
That looked good.

1429
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,320
That looked like, oh, he dead.

1430
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:36,040
But I wouldn't be dead and it would just be...

1431
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,080
I would miss the liver by an inch.

1432
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,000
I would kill my twin.

1433
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,500
Yes.

1434
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,160
Androids.

1435
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:44,680
That's the end.

1436
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,280
Camille, does that help?

1437
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,120
Your game kicks ass.

1438
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:48,680
Congratulations.

1439
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,480
Congratulations, Camille.

1440
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:49,720
Thank you.

1441
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:50,280
Your game is awesome.

1442
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,920
And you, Austin, are awesome.

1443
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,600
Thank you so much for being so kind to us.

1444
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,120
We really appreciate it.

1445
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:56,760
You can turn the lights off.

1446
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,800
You can turn the lights off because it's terrifying.

1447
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,400
You want to shut them off?

1448
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,360
Couple of things real quick.

1449
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,720
First, if you haven't already,

1450
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,920
there's posters out on the lobby that...

1451
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,200
Listen, we have a lot of really amazing designers

1452
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,080
that we work with for the live shows.

1453
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,120
This is one of the...

1454
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:16,760
It's fucking so good.

1455
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:20,120
They did a great job and you should support her.

1456
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,480
Similarly, there's some copies,

1457
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,760
if you haven't got one already,

1458
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,560
of both the Adventure Zone graphic novel book one

1459
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,040
and the Sawbones book out in the lobby.

1460
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:28,360
Maybe.

1461
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:29,640
They're signed.

1462
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,600
So if you want to check those out, you can do that.

1463
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,160
Thank you to...

1464
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,040
I was commenting on this backstage.

1465
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:38,040
I do not know that I've ever performed on a stage

1466
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:41,400
where I have seen so many shows beforehand.

1467
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,920
This theater and ACL in general fucking rules this city.

1468
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,440
It's so lucky to have it.

1469
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,160
I am lucky to...

1470
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,760
I'm lucky to live in Austin because of this place.

1471
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,840
I've seen more concerts here than any other place in my life.

1472
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,080
So the fact that we're performing on the stage is buck wild.

1473
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:57,880
It's a beautiful theater.

1474
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,000
Thank you all so much for having us.

1475
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,080
Thank you to American hero, Paul Sabourin.

1476
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,200
Thank you to Paul.

1477
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:02,440
Paul.

1478
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,000
Please enjoy the music of Paul and Storm.

1479
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,400
Thank you Rock on Tour, Clint McElroy.

1480
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,240
Yeah, for your great work.

1481
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,680
Thanks to Wonderful, a fantastic podcast

1482
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:18,520
that you should enjoy if you do not already.

1483
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,040
And thank you to our various family members

1484
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,160
who weren't included in the two previous things we just said

1485
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,640
for being here to support us and travel with us

1486
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:28,360
and do the shows and everything.

1487
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,480
I have one last one.

1488
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,400
Every year our listeners get together

1489
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,600
and there's this list called Empty Stockings

1490
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,880
that Huntington, West Virginia,

1491
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,720
newspaper Herald & Spatch puts out.

1492
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,800
And it is all the people who have things

1493
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,600
that they wishes for Christmas

1494
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,520
for kids that aren't going to have anything.

1495
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,160
And every year our listeners look at that list

1496
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,680
and burn it to the ground.

1497
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,040
They fucking destroy it.

1498
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,000
Generosity.

1499
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,160
And that was a weird way of putting it.

1500
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,320
But if you can help with that.

1501
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:59,400
I'm going to fuck that list up.

1502
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,920
If you can help with that,

1503
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:04,600
MBAMangels.com is the place to go.

1504
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,560
You can claim a gift.

1505
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:06,680
You can donate money.

1506
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,680
Whatever you can do really means a lot.

1507
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,120
When we say wish list,

1508
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,920
we mean stuff like they need socks.

1509
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,360
Yeah, socks or a mattress or stuff.

1510
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,400
I wasn't going to get into it

1511
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,440
because it's kind of like a live show

1512
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,960
and I want everybody to have a great time.

1513
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,040
But yeah, I mean, it is very sad.

1514
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:20,680
Thank you, Travis.

1515
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:21,400
Poverty is sad.

1516
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,160
Hey, who wants a final Yahoo?

1517
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,520
It's a real ripper.

1518
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,960
Yeah, fart it out, bud.

1519
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,400
We thanked everyone.

1520
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:30,200
John Roderick.

1521
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,240
John Roderick and Max Fun.

1522
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:31,960
Y'all got it.

1523
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:32,920
Good work, y'all.

1524
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:36,440
Let's rip it up with a funny fucking final Yahoo, baby.

1525
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,960
James Cockwell sent this in.

1526
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:44,920
Thank you, James.

1527
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,440
It's Yahoo Anonymous.

1528
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,400
Yeah, Yahoo.

1529
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,120
So I'm going to call him Bill Asks.

1530
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:55,080
Is buying calcium enriched milk like bone insurance?

1531
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,920
My name is Justin McElroy.

1532
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,040
I'm Travis McElroy.

It's been my brother.

1535
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:21,240
Make kids your dad's square on the lips.

Hey, it's Janet Varney of the JV Club podcast, and I am so excited to be joining Maximum Fun.

1541
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:38,200
If you're not yet familiar with the JV Club, it's a podcast with me and some of my favorite women

1542
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:43,320
and, in the summer, men, as we explore the highs and lows of our terrible teenage years

1543
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,640
into our adult lessons.

1544
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:50,840
For example, hear about Alison Breeze's humiliating moment at a gymnastics competition,

1545
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:56,600
experience the shame of a knocked-out tooth with Jamila Jamil, or drop in as Jon Hamm

1546
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,800
imagines what would happen if Bambi met Godzilla.

1547
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:04,200
So join me and all my once-awkward, often-still-awkward friends every Thursday

1548
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:22,200
by subscribing to the JV Club on Maximumfun.org.
