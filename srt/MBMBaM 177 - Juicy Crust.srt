1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,200
Welcome, my brother, my brother of me, isn't it? I'm Justin McElroy.

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,480
He's out of stroke.

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:03,840
I was in England for a week, wasn't I? And now I am. Now this is how I sound, isn't it?

8
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,440
This will be, we are making podcast history right now, because it's definitely the first

9
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,800
time in podcast history that one of the hosts of the podcast has spoken for the entire episode

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,840
in one long word. One long, joined, constant word.

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,080
Well, I can't help, can I talk, can I?

12
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,200
I also think it's possible that we have somehow traveled back in

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000
time and changed the past so that Justin is fading away.

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,840
I spent a week abroad, didn't I? And this is how I talk now. Me and Obama. Madonna.

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,680
You and Obama?

16
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,360
Madonna. You're Darma and Greg.

17
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,720
You're Jeffrey Dahmer?

18
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,600
Madonna.

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,920
You donger.

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,040
She's a singer, isn't she? From Bronx. Now she's from England, like me.

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,800
Madonna. He's saying Madonna.

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,880
This is going to be a fun, like, word search episode.

23
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,440
It's like a word search episode where Justin says dumb shit and you can't understand it.

24
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,120
You got to look at it diagonally and upside down. There it is. Madonna.

25
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,000
Circling.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,040
Pretty sneaky, sis.

27
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,480
Pretty sneaky, Madonna.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,560
It's an embarrassing story, isn't it? I was, I was practicing this voice when I was in London one

29
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,800
night and I accidentally might've said it in front of people who lived here, didn't I? Didn't I?

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,040
They, I mean, they're not here.

31
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,720
There was a lot of pronouns. You kind of lost me.

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,920
You know, it gets confusing.

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,960
Yeah, there's a lot of pronouns in British.

34
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,200
Because I still feel like I'm over there, don't I?

35
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,800
Yeah. Yeah. What is it about, what is it about your current environment

36
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,960
that makes you think you're still in London?

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,160
Is it just the fact that you're speaking with this preposterous accent?

38
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,400
Well, it's all the vinegar, isn't it?

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,760
It's also not so much of an accent.

40
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,080
Hold on, Travis. Travis, I hate to, I hate to interrupt you,

41
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,320
but Justin has just made the proclamation that he's surrounded by vinegar,

42
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,880
which is somehow a defining characteristic of London.

43
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,440
I bought a lot of vinegar over there, didn't I? Don't have room to store it, do I?

44
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,640
I feel like there'll be epic customs problems with that.

45
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,680
I told him I sold vinegar. I got a work visa for the States, didn't I? To sell vinegar.

46
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,440
Oh, so your accent was so convincing that the customs people believed that you were immigrating out of.

47
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, they knew I was a Brit, didn't they?

48
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,840
There's a lot of holes in this story, Justin.

49
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,480
Are you immersed in vinegar? Are you taking like a vinegar soak?

50
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,080
I want to help you blimey blokes from the States side with your advice show, don't I?

51
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,280
I'll tell you, don't I?

52
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,000
You sound exactly like Russell Brand. Exactly the same.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,480
You also sound incredibly uncertain of yourself.

54
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,240
You also sound like you require our verification for every single sentence that you say.

55
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:53,440
But well, I'm bi-coastal now, aren't I? It's harder to judge what I'm saying.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,640
No, it is definitely much harder to judge.

57
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:06,240
I mean, what time is it? Isn't it 9? 4? Can the Brits not tell time?

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,320
No, but I'm like bi-coastal now, aren't I?

59
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,400
I don't- bi-coastal means something totally- I mean, I guess it's on a different coast,

60
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,000
but the coast is on a different continent. When you be intercontinental.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,440
Now it's international waters. Let's get the quiz show started.

62
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,880
Okay. Representing England, let's man it.

63
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,320
All right. Everybody, thank you for listening to-

64
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,760
The show is canceled forever.

65
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,240
Very long-winded episode of My Bim Bam. We're all going to have a lot of fun with accents

66
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,520
and voices and cadence, and we're all just going to have a blast. No advice this week,

67
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,760
just accents. So strap it- strap it in, strap it on, and let's just get loose.

68
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,600
Are you all excited about Thanksgiving, aren't you?

69
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:51,920
Okay.

70
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,880
Okay. What's that? I don't have Thanksgiving.

71
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,080
I think in the-

72
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,600
Go blind, we gov!

73
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,320
Oh, okay, no.

74
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,480
Hello, hello, what's all this then?

75
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:00,880
Justin has bitten-

76
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,720
Oh, it's contagious, ain't it?

77
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,840
Justin has bitten Travis, sending the virulent stream into his blood.

78
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,480
What are you guys doing? Get away- guys, get away from me. I said get the fuck away! Oh, no!

79
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,280
Oh, Apple!

80
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,040
Oh, Colin!

81
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,840
Lock, stock, and barrel. Snatch. Don't you know?

82
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,600
Gov, I'm itchy, aren't I? Reference is hilarious.

83
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,840
Crisps!

84
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,720
Please, Christ, please, Jesus Christ, please.

85
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,960
We don't have them in my country, do we?

86
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,880
Here, we call him Jeezy Crazy.

87
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,960
Jesus Crisps.

88
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
Juicy Crust.

89
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,200
We love his miracles, don't we?

90
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:51,520
Watered wine, wine vinegar, we love it.

91
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,000
Juicy Crust, heal my accent.

92
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,320
Shit, we're not going to say anything funnier than that.

93
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,520
We have an hour and we're not going to say anything funnier than that.

94
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,160
Maybe if you believe harder.

95
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,520
Oh, Juicy Crust.

96
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,160
Juicy Crust, everybody.

97
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,080
I'm going to work on my American accent for the rest of the show, aren't I?

98
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,400
Okay.

99
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,880
All right, okay.

100
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,760
This is, all right, this is a strain.

101
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,000
You sound like Hugh Jackman.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,640
And wait, is Hugh Jackman- it's hard to tell, isn't it?

103
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,040
It's like Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

104
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,520
Isn't it?

105
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,480
Isn't it?

106
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:40,980
Nope.

107
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,780
Here's the first question.

108
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,580
So my buddy-

109
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,500
God damn it.

110
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,020
My buddy gave me- God, I'm going to get it.

111
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,580
My buddy gave me his iPhone 4 after dropping it,

112
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,060
breaking the screen and getting an iPhone 5 right away.

113
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,460
After I offered to pay him, he said-

114
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,140
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

115
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,380
Okay.

116
00:06:59,380 --> 00:06:59,940
Not correct.

117
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,580
Correct course.

118
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,700
Okay.

119
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,540
After I offered to pay him, he said, quote,

120
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:11,140
I was going to throw it away anyways, so just have it, end quote, for free.

121
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,860
I am now, after about three weeks, selling it on eBay.

122
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,860
Do I owe him anything?

123
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,660
What if he asked for it back for some reason?

124
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,420
My gut instinct is that I only owe him a sucks to suck when he asks.

125
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,020
That's from Clueless in Cleveland.

126
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,180
Yeah, that's funny.

127
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,300
When I first read this question, my immediate impulse was,

128
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,900
of course you don't owe him anything.

129
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,340
He gave it to you.

130
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,020
What you do with it is your business.

131
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,180
But then, just hearing it just then-

132
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,220
Hearing it out loud.

133
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:41,460
Yeah.

134
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,100
All I could think was, you've only had it for three weeks.

135
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,540
Why did he give it to you?

136
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,780
Was there some arrangement, like you needed the phone and it still worked,

137
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,220
even though the screen was cracked?

138
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,180
Or did he just kind of like toss it to you and go,

139
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,820
I was going to throw this away, so whatever, fuck it.

140
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,940
I'm assuming he didn't give it to you like on consignment.

141
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,860
Like he probably thought you were going to use it, right?

142
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,500
Yeah, right.

143
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,180
It's a tricky situation.

144
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,940
That's all I mean, that's all that I have.

145
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,820
Because listen, I've broken my fair share of iPhones in my day,

146
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,020
like seven of them, and I still have all of them.

147
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,580
Do you remember when dad broke your iPhone?

148
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,180
Yeah, the first time.

149
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,140
Dropped it on the side of a pool, like face down,

150
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,300
and it just, that thing fucking exploded.

151
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,260
And then he very nonchalantly picked it up and handed it to you

152
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,220
without acknowledging it, and then was like,

153
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,980
what's up, later.

154
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,700
What's up, later, and turned to walk away.

155
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,540
And you're like, hey Pops, you exploded.

156
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,540
One second, my little sly fox.

157
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,500
I think that the fact that you're asking us

158
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,780
and not like talking to your friend about it,

159
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,420
lets me know that maybe you know there's something up.

160
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,140
Like if your morality is scratching the back of your cerebellum

161
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,460
and saying, hey, maybe this isn't, you know, cool.

162
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,620
I will tell you the scenario in which I know 100%

163
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,420
it is not cool.

164
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,860
If your friend broke his iPhone, replaced it,

165
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,940
and you said, well, I've always wanted an iPhone,

166
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,140
but I couldn't afford one.

167
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,380
And he said, well, here you go,

168
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,820
I was just gonna throw this one away.

169
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,420
And then you turn around and sell it.

170
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,540
That he was then in that case,

171
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,860
then he sees you using your flip phone again.

172
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,620
And he's like, oh, what happened to the iPhone?

173
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,540
And you say, oh yeah, no, I sold it.

174
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,300
Don't worry, I got 20 bucks for it.

175
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,980
And I use that to get drunk.

176
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,140
I'm sorry, but that's homeboys problem

177
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,740
for not fucking thinking of that,

178
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,420
thinking without that, you know, mercantile edge.

179
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:36,980
You know what I mean?

180
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,180
He was gonna throw that shit in the fucking garbage.

181
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,860
That's money straight out of your pocket, dog.

182
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,940
That's a lot of, that's a lot of moolah potential.

183
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,700
Assuming he just gave it to you,

184
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,220
not with the intent of you using it,

185
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,620
but just to like, give it to you.

186
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,620
I think what I would do in your scenario

187
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,100
is call him up and say, hey, I got some sucker

188
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,340
to give me some money for that phone you gave me.

189
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,860
You want to split it halfsies.

190
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,140
You want half this dough.

191
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,500
And then only give him like 20%.

192
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,100
Yeah, you don't know.

193
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,540
Don't tell him how much you got.

194
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,380
Then it's a windfall for both of you.

195
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,540
Otherwise, I think you're gonna feel weird about it

196
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,580
because you're right.

197
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,020
There's every chance he could say like,

198
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,180
hey, listen, if you're not using that phone,

199
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,700
my sister needs one.

200
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,340
So I'm just gonna get that back from you.

201
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,020
Why do you, why did you want a broken iPhone?

202
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,900
Well, trust me, as someone who's broken it,

203
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,260
there's two layers of screen.

204
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,220
No, it's no good.

205
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,100
It's no good.

206
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,380
No, you can still use it.

207
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,860
No, it's not like perfect and new anymore.

208
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,860
Listen, it's never going to impress anyone.

209
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,300
That's the thing, you own an iPhone

210
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,420
so that someone looks at it and goes,

211
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,380
oh God, your tactic is so beautiful.

212
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,180
Biggest question I guess precedes that one,

213
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,260
which is why would you want an iPhone 4

214
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,900
even in working condition when the 5 is already out there?

215
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,420
Once the 5, I don't know if you guys knew this,

216
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,540
once the 5 came out, the 4 and the 4S were broken already.

217
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,500
Do you know what I mean?

218
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,340
Just like in principle, they did not work anymore.

219
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,380
See, that's why I advocate not getting anything,

220
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,100
no iPhones, no phones until it's reached.

221
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,100
Wait till they say this is the last iPhone.

222
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,380
This is the last, this is the final iPhone.

223
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,820
There are no new iPhones out.

224
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,700
The iPhone 63 is the best.

225
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,980
Does this only apply to iPhones

226
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,060
or is like, has my HTC One been broken

227
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,380
since I brought it out of the AT&T store?

228
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:21,860
Yes.

229
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,900
Since I looked at it and said,

230
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,980
oh, you look special and different.

231
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,260
Hey, chumps that bought the PlayStation 4, too soon.

232
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,340
Wait for 63.

233
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,660
They all stop at 63, by the way,

234
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,660
except for the Nintendo 64.

235
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,180
The Nintendo 64 was so amazing.

236
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,420
Broke the mold, really broke the mold with that one.

237
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,540
You guys want a Yahoo?

238
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,180
Please.

239
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,700
This Yahoo was sent in by Jared Anger.

240
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,260
Thanks, Jared.

241
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,060
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Fiss Jorg.

242
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,060
Fiss Jorg who asks,

243
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,900
can I get in trouble if I take off the clothes

244
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,180
on the mannequins in a store?

245
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,260
I'm 18 years old and a guy who's never had sex

246
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,460
or even had a girlfriend before.

247
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,020
Okay.

248
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,340
That much was clear from the subject matter.

249
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,460
I keep telling myself,

250
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,260
I'm going to go looking for a girl to have sex with

251
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,300
sometime soon,

252
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,780
but don't feel fully prepared to do it yet.

253
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,380
I thought about-

254
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,900
Because that's such a production.

255
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,140
I know.

256
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,460
You gotta take a shower.

257
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,700
You have to powder your jimmies.

258
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,140
Have to find girls.

259
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:21,860
Where are they?

260
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,420
Also that.

261
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,060
I thought about practicing how to take off clothes

262
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,340
on mannequins for practice.

263
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,740
My plan is to go into a store where they sell women's clothing

264
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,260
and have female mannequins inside.

265
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,060
Then I can practice on how to take off pieces

266
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,300
of women's clothing such as bras, panties, etc.

267
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,900
by doing it on the mannequin.

268
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,580
I don't want to seem like an idiot the day

269
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,540
that I actually do have sex and won't know

270
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,860
the proper technique in order to take off a girl's panties

271
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,820
or bra or whatever.

272
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,900
Sorry for saying panties, everybody.

273
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,140
Will I get in trouble if the employees of the store

274
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,500
see me doing this though?

275
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,140
If so, could I just take the mannequin in the bathroom

276
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,700
and do it?

277
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,820
They won't see me.

278
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,300
Yes.

279
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,780
You should always just take the mannequin in the bathroom.

280
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,940
That will look way less suspicious.

281
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,140
It is if nobody sees you.

282
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,420
Because this kid sounds like a sneaky criminal mastermind.

283
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,060
You are-

284
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,700
Okay.

285
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,100
He's gonna-

286
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,980
Let me just like outline it mathematically

287
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,900
because I think that that latter option is obviously

288
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,540
the best option because this kid doesn't know

289
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,020
his- the fucking way around that whole situation,

290
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,900
that whole scene.

291
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,380
And it does take practice.

292
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,620
You guys can pretend to be smooth criminals all you want,

293
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,260
but it does.

294
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,580
It's gonna take this kid five to six minutes

295
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,180
to solve this puzzle.

296
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,260
Let me throw this out.

297
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,900
It would take him much less than five to six minutes

298
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,500
to perform like an exfil to the Sears bathroom.

299
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,860
You know what I mean?

300
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,420
Let me throw this out.

301
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,660
This is how you get away with it, right?

302
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,460
An employee stumbles upon you stripping down a mannequin

303
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,140
and they're about to say something

304
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,380
and then they notice the blackboard upon which

305
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,140
you are scribbling notes and equations.

306
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,220
Yeah, that's gonna be-

307
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,580
They're gonna be so dumbfounded

308
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,460
that they're just gonna go,

309
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,100
oh, well, clearly this is bigger than both of us.

310
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,900
I just want-

311
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,580
You're saying that anytime anyone has a blackboard

312
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,340
doing things on it,

313
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,820
people won't question their scientific methods?

314
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,060
Have you seen the show Numbers, Griffin?

315
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,100
Because that's all that happens on it.

316
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,860
People scribble on a blackboard

317
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,700
and then someone gets arrested.

318
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,260
Have a check, have a clipboard with you

319
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,220
with like a sheet that you can make check marks on

320
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,620
while you're taking the clothes off the-

321
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,460
Oh, oh, and then when the salesperson says something to you,

322
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,940
you say, oh, it took you four and a half minutes

323
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,660
to say something.

324
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,780
Oh, the Western branch did way better

325
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,820
and then run out of the store.

326
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,660
Loss prevention, not your strong suit here.

327
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,900
Loss of innocence prevention.

328
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,940
What are they losing?

329
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,980
What is being lost in this scenario?

330
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,180
Loss of mannequin shame.

331
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,620
I look forward to the moment

332
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,180
when this kid perfects his clothes taking off game

333
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,500
and then he finally meets that special prostitute

334
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,740
and he gets her back to the hotel room

335
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,700
and he gets all the clothes off

336
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,980
and then he has this staggering realization

337
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,180
that he has no idea what comes next.

338
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,500
He has obsessed about-

339
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,460
The weirdest part of this whole thing.

340
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,860
He will take his hand, hold it in the air

341
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,940
as if he's doing a high five in one swift motion,

342
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,020
karate chop it to the ground

343
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,780
and in that smooth motion,

344
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,700
all of the women's clothes are gone

345
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,100
and she'll say, holy shit, that was amazing.

346
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,060
Do me now.

347
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,300
And he says, do what now?

348
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,660
Do you who?

349
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,340
I was under the assumption that that was sex.

350
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,060
I thought that that was the thing.

351
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,660
I'm gonna go.

352
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,340
There's some definite gray area here.

353
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,220
There's definitely some moral ambiguity in this issue.

354
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,220
If you fuck a mannequin at the store, that is a no-no.

355
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,980
You can shoplift from that store all the fuck you want

356
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,020
because they're not gonna do stuff

357
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,980
but you have made yourself vulnerable in a big way.

358
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,700
You have violated God's laws

359
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,020
and state and city laws probably too.

360
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,980
I also wanna throw out internal policies of Lane Bryant

361
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,460
just in general violated.

362
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,700
Can you imagine being a sales associate at that store

363
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,380
after this kid has had a couple of months

364
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,060
to perfect this technique

365
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,780
and it's just like naked mannequins everywhere

366
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,380
and you cannot catch the blur

367
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,060
that is stripping these nannikins to the ground

368
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,900
in 0.02 seconds.

369
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,820
I'm pretty sure they call him the streak.

370
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,700
Well, not really

371
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,500
because the streak didn't make other people naked, did he?

372
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,180
That really wasn't part of his legacy.

373
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,700
Or the joke.

374
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,500
Either one, it's just because naked.

375
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,340
I'm just saying it was built on a faulty premise.

376
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,700
The streak himself was naked.

377
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,700
This kid obviously has no interest

378
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,140
in taking his clothes off at all.

379
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,260
You're assuming.

380
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,300
I'm assuming.

381
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,020
You're right, Travis.

382
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,380
I think that this kid would be the greatest

383
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,620
criminal mastermind ever if he could pull this off

384
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,300
because if the cops catch up with him

385
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,620
and draw their guns or go to draw their guns,

386
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,980
only wait, where's my gun?

387
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,660
And my pants and my shirt.

388
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,380
And my bra.

389
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,060
And my bra and my underwear

390
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,020
and my cock ring that I wear for that.

391
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,540
I think that you can do this

392
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,260
but while you're conducting these experiments,

393
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,020
you have to loudly announce, just aloud,

394
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,660
you know, I think this will fit me

395
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,580
but I'm not sure if this will fit me.

396
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,660
And I think if you do that,

397
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,300
then everyone will assume that you're just gonna try it on

398
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,260
as sort of like a cool gender-bending,

399
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,940
metrosexual kind of look.

400
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,020
It's possible.

401
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,340
I do not think the physiology of a real life woman

402
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,700
is the same as a mannequin though.

403
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,700
I think there's probably a little bit more.

404
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,500
There's been a lot of advances in mannequin technology

405
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,940
over the last couple of decades.

406
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,660
They don't have any kind of fleshy give, I'm assuming.

407
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,380
Have you checked?

408
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,220
I haven't, no.

409
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,660
Well, you know what happens when you assume.

410
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,340
I have, you're right.

411
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,980
I'm making a lot of assumptions here.

412
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,700
Yeah, I worked at Land's End, trust me.

413
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,100
You had fleshy, fleshy mannequins?

414
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,620
Fleshy, squeezable mannequins.

415
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,820
Fuck, that sucks.

416
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,980
Oh man, that's a bummer.

417
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,300
Have you ever seen that Nickelodeon show

418
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,500
with the mannequin with the hat on?

419
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,420
It was like that but in reverse

420
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,860
because they were like human all the time.

421
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,260
In retrospect, Land's End might've employed slaves.

422
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,100
Okay, that's kind of what it sounds more like.

423
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,420
Now that I'm thinking through it,

424
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,620
they were crying a lot.

425
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,100
Okay, so I don't wanna-

426
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,300
They might've been just customers.

427
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,620
Yeah, that's why I got fired.

428
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,260
This weekend I went on a date

429
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,740
and the girl pulled in, I forgot my wallet.

430
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,620
The only thing is later after I pay for a meal,

431
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,940
she told me to put something in her purse

432
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,740
and the only thing in there was her wallet.

433
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,420
Everything else after that went great.

434
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,420
Otherwise she seemed pretty cool.

435
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,060
Is this a deal breaker or should I agree

436
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,900
to a second date and see?

437
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,300
That's from Cond in Canada.

438
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,700
If she had a purse and the only thing in it was a wallet,

439
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,780
why didn't she have a clutch?

440
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,460
I guess that's my biggest question.

441
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,100
Good question.

442
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,380
I hate to go fashion police on this woman, but-

443
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,980
Is it possible that it was not actually a wallet

444
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,180
but just some sort of makeup case or maybe a gun?

445
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,380
You think it was a gun?

446
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,260
Like a gun in a case, not just like a wallet-shaped gun.

447
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,980
That's stupid.

448
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,380
I'm saying like a Derringer.

449
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,980
No, but that would be in a garter on her hip.

450
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,620
What am I saying?

451
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,420
I'm sorry.

452
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,500
Yeah, you would not keep a Derringer in your purse.

453
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,380
There is no universe of all the infinite multiverses

454
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:53,460
that exist throughout the string of oblivion.

455
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,820
There is no universe that exists where this is actionable

456
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,140
because you done checked out this girl's open purse

457
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,620
while she wasn't looking and that's a crooked move, man.

458
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,980
No, no.

459
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,460
She told him to put something in there.

460
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,540
But you don't want to go Columbo.

461
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,260
You don't want her to think that it's like a fact-finding-

462
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,140
Just one last thing.

463
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,940
There's only a wallet in there.

464
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,620
There's a wallet in there.

465
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,580
One last thing.

466
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,540
Let me throw this out.

467
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:24,660
Is it possible that she said that she forgot her wallet

468
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,900
because instead she did not have the funds

469
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,500
in her bank account to cover this?

470
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,300
And rather than say, oh no, I'm broke.

471
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,020
She just went-

472
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,580
That's why this is an actionable information.

473
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,260
Yeah, that could be the case, Travis.

474
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,300
In which case you'd be history's greatest monster.

475
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,500
Congratulations.

476
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,700
You're a real dick.

477
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,900
So I'm saying that, you know, if it went well otherwise-

478
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,940
Okay, I want to roll it back for a moment though.

479
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,180
I understand when you say she pulled the,

480
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,540
I forgot my wallet.

481
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,500
What was the dialogue leading up to that

482
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,980
that she felt the need to volunteer that information?

483
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,900
I did think that too, Travis.

484
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,620
Have you guys not ever-

485
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,700
I guess I should start from the bottom and work my way up.

486
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,540
Have you guys been on a date before?

487
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,580
Yeah, but was there a point where a question asker said,

488
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,100
you're going to pay for this, right?

489
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,500
No.

490
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,020
Or we're going to split it?

491
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,500
Dummy.

492
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,580
That's probably not how it happened.

493
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,900
It was probably more like the end of the meal came.

494
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,500
There's this awkward moment where if it's your first date,

495
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,900
there are so many sexual politics to figure out

496
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,100
who is going to pay.

497
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,780
By the way, split it every single time,

498
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,620
which is I imagine what happened.

499
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,260
She went to get in her purse and said,

500
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,460
oh, I forgot my wallet.

501
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,140
Oh man, actually in this scenario, she lied to you.

502
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,460
Yeah.

503
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,980
She definitely did lie to you

504
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,940
unless she thought she forgot her wallet.

505
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,260
How big was this wallet?

506
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,900
Because he said he saw the wallet in the purse.

507
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,460
If the purse was gigantic and the wallet was very tiny,

508
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,860
but if the purse was only slightly larger

509
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,420
as to only allow the whole thing of the wallet-

510
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,700
The purse didn't have anything in it

511
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,540
when she went to look in it, right?

512
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,540
She opened up the purse, no wallet in there.

513
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,700
Oh shit, I've been carrying around an empty wallet.

514
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,860
You would think that maybe she would have felt that.

515
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,100
Again, an issue that definitely would have been solved

516
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,900
if you had a clutch,

517
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,860
but let's go ahead and ignore that part

518
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,140
of the equation real quick.

519
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,180
Where was the wallet?

520
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,540
It was in her fanny pack.

521
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,500
Later on, she realized her mistake

522
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,780
and was very embarrassed.

523
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,620
Transferred the wallet from the fanny pack

524
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,900
to the empty purse and then realized her faux pas,

525
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,820
then decided to put together this test

526
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,900
of Solomon's wisdom for you.

527
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,740
Had you, gave you permission to look inside of her purse,

528
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,340
putting the ball in your court,

529
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,700
do you love this woman?

530
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,900
Do you love this woman enough

531
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,700
to look over this possible transgression?

532
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,940
Because if the answer is yes, the truth will out,

533
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,460
the truth will be exposed,

534
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,780
it was a mistake the entire time she didn't lie to you.

535
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,860
This woman is how I met your mother,

536
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,940
end of series, series of what?

537
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,660
I am, I don't think the right move is to bring this up.

538
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,940
There are too many variables to consider and-

539
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,340
Not really, I kind of just outlined the whole thing,

540
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:10,840
didn't I?

541
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:18,440
I think I am a little bit unnerved by this-

542
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,760
Purse that only has one thing in it?

543
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,360
What is she doing?

544
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:22,760
Get a clutch.

545
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,160
You don't have any starlight mints or ticket stubs.

546
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm not crazy about, first off,

547
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,360
you know this question asker is lying

548
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,280
because I've never seen a person with one thing in it,

549
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,920
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.

550
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,320
By definition, purses have a hundred things in them.

551
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,960
If I had a purse, it would be loaded to the brim

552
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,880
with every, oh man, I wish I-

553
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,240
I would have so many Milky Way minis in there.

554
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,200
Anyway, I am a little concerned about this person

555
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,160
running a grift on their first date.

556
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,160
I don't like that.

557
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,880
I think that it's a little weird

558
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,640
that the first time out of the gate,

559
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,320
you're running a grift.

560
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,240
Yeah, I also need to know, was this an online date?

561
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,760
Because let me tell you the statistics.

562
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,360
Of all the online first dates there are,

563
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,000
do you know what the percentage of dates

564
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,760
that don't make it to date three?

565
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,000
What?

566
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,640
It's a hundred.

567
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,760
It's a hundred percent.

568
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,480
A hundred percent.

569
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,280
It's a hundred percent.

570
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,920
We're talking about a quick turnaround on these bad boys.

571
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,680
We're talking about two ships passing.

572
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,840
So what about the people that get married

573
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,680
from people they met online match.com?

574
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,440
Is that they just get married on date two?

575
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,400
Not, they don't exist.

576
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,080
Where have you met people like that?

577
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,760
On match.com commercials.

578
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,160
That's right.

579
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,920
Do you guys think it's weird?

580
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,680
I'm trying to get to the bottom of this still.

581
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,440
There is a lot to unpack.

582
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,560
Do you think it's weird that on their first date,

583
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,880
this woman asked her her beau to put her suitor

584
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,480
to put something in her purse?

585
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:49,720
Yeah.

586
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,840
I don't want to out you dude,

587
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,880
but I don't think that happened.

588
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,840
I think you peed their purse.

589
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,520
You snooped a poop.

590
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,320
You sneaky creep.

591
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,920
You know he did because there's no woman alive

592
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,920
who would be like, thank you for paying for dinner.

593
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,960
And could you put these mints into my purse?

594
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,280
I don't know you or really anything about you.

595
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,120
You may be an incredibly violent human,

596
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,920
but go ahead and look in my little chest of secrets here.

597
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,800
Go ahead and look right in there.

598
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,760
In fact, if you want to stick your filthy paw,

599
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,040
I don't know where that paw has been

600
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,400
because I don't fucking know you.

601
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,880
Go ahead and put that in my treasure prize.

602
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,160
Go look in that place that holds the secret to that one lie

603
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,400
that I definitely remember telling you earlier.

604
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,000
Also, I don't want to JFK this,

605
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,120
but like what position?

606
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,240
Where were she standing?

607
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,080
You standing in the purse placement.

608
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,120
That she could hand you something that you could put

609
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,720
in the purse that she couldn't reach her full.

610
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,600
A single fluorescent light bulb hung overhead.

611
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,040
You got a direct 90 degree stare down in this bad chasm.

612
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,480
What's in there?

613
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,480
How intense was this game of Twister

614
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,960
that she could not come get put in her purse?

615
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,400
Maybe it was like a direct challenge.

616
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,760
She was like, put the lipstick in the purse.

617
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,120
And you're like, no, that's not how to put it in the purse.

618
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,960
The purse does contain my wallet,

619
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,320
which occupies every square inch of space within the purse,

620
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
except one lipstick size cavity.

621
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
And it's up to you to find out where that is.

622
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,320
Go ahead and root around in there for five to 10 minutes.

623
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,400
Oh no, my secrets.

624
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,640
Yeah, I don't know.

625
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,200
When did this date turn into legends of the hidden temple?

626
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,880
You have to uncover.

627
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,000
Ah, temple guard.

628
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,240
No, like I said.

629
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,680
No, that's just the waiter who is also a temple guard.

630
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,440
This is a weird restaurant.

631
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,840
Man, I got, there's nothing actionable.

632
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,920
Like there is too much going on here.

633
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,400
I think you need to just scrap this and start again.

634
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,720
No, I say you go set a date and see how it plays out,

635
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,200
but be ready to j'accuse her.

636
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,640
Oh shit, no, wait, grift her back.

637
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,640
Double grift.

638
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,360
Double grift, that's the only-

639
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,480
I forgot your wallet.

640
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,440
If you really like this girl,

641
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,800
you need to come to terms with this woman is a grifter.

642
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,440
And the only way she's going to respect you

643
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,520
is if you grift her back in a big, big way.

644
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,720
You gotta take it over the top.

645
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,360
You know what I mean?

646
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,160
God, this is the start of like

647
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,320
the greatest Match.com commercial ever.

648
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:57,800
Yeah.

649
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,320
I met John because his profile said that he was interested

650
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,440
in taking care of dogs and fostering pets.

651
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,920
And so I stole like $15,000 from him on day three.

652
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,960
We're married now.

653
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,200
And this dumb fuck didn't even see it coming.

654
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,000
So now we're married.

655
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,680
Take it from me.

656
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,280
The waiter was my husband and he stole the credit card numbers.

657
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,840
Match.com has been the site of more grifts.

658
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:27,480
Okay, Cupid is where you go if you want to fuck.

659
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,880
And Match.com is where you go if you want to get fucked

660
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,600
and lose all of your money, lose all your savings.

661
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,640
What is- what's Living Social?

662
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,440
Is that a dating site?

663
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,880
Maybe that's for long cons.

664
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,600
No, that's- I'm sorry.

665
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,040
That's like a Groupon-esque deal site.

666
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,340
Okay.

667
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:53,580
Let's run a grift of our own in the money side.

668
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:59,740
The grift is Hulu.com.

669
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,620
It's a website.

670
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,820
And really what we're going to do-

671
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,740
I don't think we're going to say that about Hulu.

672
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:08,540
No, here's the thing, you and me and Dupree and our audience

673
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,380
are going to run a grift on the money side.

674
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,980
Run a grift on Hulu.

675
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,660
Now, you know Hulu Plus.

676
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,860
They're sponsoring.

677
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,380
They're responsible.

678
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,580
Just hear me in the end, okay?

679
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,020
Do they have you, me, and Dupree on Hulu Plus?

680
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,220
It's impossible to say.

681
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,020
You can watch your favorite TV shows like SNL,

682
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,820
Jimmy Kimmel Live, Shark Tank, and Scandal.

683
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,220
I just watched Shark Tank on Hulu today.

684
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,720
Thank you.

685
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,660
There's old episodes you can binge on.

686
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,420
Lost, Doctor Who, Community.

687
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,020
Hulu Plus is a service that lets you watch all this stuff

688
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,460
for just $7.99 a month.

689
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,500
There's a bunch of ad-free movies, kids content,

690
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,900
tons of great stuff on there for just $7.99 a month.

691
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,540
But here's the grift.

692
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,420
Are you ready for the grift?

693
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,140
I should also mention there's Hulu Originals,

694
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,980
like The Wrong Manson, Behind the Mask.

695
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,500
But here's the grift.

696
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,380
You're going to go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother

697
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,660

At HuluPlus.com slash my brother,

700
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,460

701
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,140
Run the grift on Hulu Plus.

702
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,420
They're begging for it.

703
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,740
They left this back door open for you.

704
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,180
Stick it right in there.

705
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,980
Stick it right in their back door.

706
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:25,020
Stick it to Corpo and just take all this premium original

707
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,620
and syndicated television programming for free for two weeks.

708
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,460
Yeah, it's for free.

709
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,620
Yeah, but really, make sure you check out Behind the Mask

710
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,900
because it's a former costumed character.

711
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,780
Oh, shit.

712
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,420
It's so true.

713
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,940
They did not get us up in the mix.

714
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,740
No.

715
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,380
Like, hey, so when you played Cowabunga,

716
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,460
how many kids tried to touch your cow dick?

717
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,420
Like 18.

718
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,260
All of the kids.

719
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,660
How is your dirt?

720
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,220
My dirt is deep.

721
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,500
It's deep, deep, deep in there.

722
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:00,220
I've been trying to get at it, but it's in my folds.

723
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,020
You know what I mean?

724
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,140
Oh, yeah.

725
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,740
You can't get in there with liquids.

726
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,940
Can't do it.

727
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,660
I try, man.

728
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,500
And I've gotten the full fucking, what was that, guys?

729
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,460
Andy Kaufman.

730
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,020
You know what I mean?

731
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,540
I used to like swallow a cheesecloth

732
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,540
and like just like get in there.

733
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,260
Yeah.

734
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,220
I've been giving him the old college, but it's tough.

735
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,540
I bet my buddy Travis has a solution for you.

736
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,820
Guess who's back?

737
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,100
Stack Soap is back.

738
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,620
Put your soap in my soap.

739
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,100
That's right.

740
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
Stack Soap's the only soap with a divot in it

741
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,980
so you can take the stupid sliver that you get

742
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,540
at the end of soap bar usage and put it right in the divot.

743
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,060
It's infinite soap.

744
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,500
It's better than ever.

745
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,620
Tell me about the new versions.

746
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,060
Peppermint, jasmine, and unscented.

747
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,820
There is nothing better than minty soap.

748
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,140
Nothing.

749
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,780
It is the most refreshing.

750
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,740
I popped a bar into the bathrooms at work.

751
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,780
It was like down to that stupid sliver.

752
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,580
It was down to the nub in like a week.

753
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,820
Everybody was jamming on it so hard.

754
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,620
And then I just popped it right into the new soap.

755
00:30:59,340 --> 00:30:59,580
That's how Stack Soap works.

756
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,260
And everybody's mind was blown.

757
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,220
They just fell down on the floor shaking, crying.

758
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:04,940
It's amazing.

759
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,820
It's a miracle.

760
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,500
Get it for people this Christmas.

761
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,820
It makes a great gift and you're really going to free people out

762
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,820
because they may not have heard of it before.

763
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,660
And then you're going to seem like a real sharp person.

764
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:21,340
You can get them at Whole Foods in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland,

765
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,740
Washington, DC, Virginia, Kentucky, and South New Jersey.

766
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,740
Now that is the best way to do it because if you get it there

767
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,780
then Whole Foods will start carrying it to other stores.

768
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,740
But if you buy that shit on Amazon, it doesn't give a fuck about Stack Soap.

769
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,300
No, but if you're not in any one of those places,

770
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,220
Amazon's the way to go.

771
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:40,540
Yeah.

772
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,420
And you can get it there.

773
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,820
Go to StackSoap.com.

774
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,380
You can get all the info, but we love Stack Soap.

775
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:51,580
They're our early sponsor of our show and they have helped make it possible for a long time.

776
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,700
So go to StackSoap.com.

777
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:57,980
Buy it for people you love or people that you hate.

778
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,860
That stink.

779
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,980
That stink like you do.

780
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,340
Shitty, shank heads.

781
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,820
All right, this next message is from Mary Ricks.

782
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,460
I'm going to break it down for a minute.

783
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:06,860
Okay.

784
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,620
The next message is from Mary Ricks.

785
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,820
It's from Blaine Flowers.

786
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,020
Happy birthday to my amazing wife.

787
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,420
I wanted to get you a unicorn, but they were out of stock at Bed Bath & Beyoncé.

788
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:23,740
I hope this message delivered by the world's top experts on God's most beautiful creatures

789
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,260
will do the trick instead.

790
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,460
All of the love, Blaine.

791
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,860
Do we have any metric for knowing how bad we fucked this up and how much we miss this

792
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,500
birthday by?

793
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,580
Yes, we've missed her birthday by 11 to 12 days.

794
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,180
That's not bad, guys.

795
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,420
I think that's a bit under our average actually.

796
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,620
So 11 to 12 days of shipping on this birthday wish.

797
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,420
I appreciate all these Jumbotron messages.

798
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:56,220
It truly is amazing to me that like our listeners care enough about the show that they like

799
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,540
give us money just to say people's names out loud.

800
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,820
Like that's fucking crazy to me.

801
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,500
And I am truly very thankful for that on this very thankful week.

802
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,100
But stop asking us to do birthdays.

803
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,860
How about birth months from now on?

804
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,180
Because that's something I bet we can nail the birth month thing.

805
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,860
We're kind of fuck ups, but I think we can get that right at least.

806
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,900
And you should know that it's not always our fault, except it almost always is.

807
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,940
Sometimes it's no one's fault.

808
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,940
Sometimes it's just chronology of time.

809
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,220
Yeah, you know, always trying to fuck us.

810
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,460
Something Mary knows something about.

811
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,620
Just keeps on a marching, doesn't it, Mary?

812
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,020
It's all right.

813
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,980
You hang in there.

814
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:38,540
There's another message for Ian Clowery from Patty Kavanagh.

815
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:43,900
I want to wish a happy 30th birthday to my buddy Ian from Wexford in Ireland.

816
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,540
He turned me on to NBNBAM and I thought a personal message would be a nice thing to do.

817
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:53,660
And nothing says personal like three dudes thousands of miles away wishing you a happy birthday.

818
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:59,020
Maybe now that maybe now that you're 30, you can finally grow out that beard like mine from Patty.

819
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,220
There's something a little better than a birthday wish that comes with a little bit of intimidation.

820
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,100
Yeah, just right at the end, like, and also you got a shitty beard.

821
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,100
Also, your beard is bullshit.

822
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,700
Happy B-Day, which does not stand for beard because you're an idiot.

823
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,260
Maybe you want it.

824
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,100
You can touch my beard if you want to just this once because it's your birthday.

825
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,020
You gotta get some of that testosterone rub.

826
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,900
Put it directly to the face.

827
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,740
Go ahead, Justin with this jingle, please.

828
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:27,980
Subway hacks.

829
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,220
See, I was imagining something a little bit more like Americana.

830
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,580
Something a little like Springsteenian.

831
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,980
Little diddy, but Subway hacks.

832
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,780
Yeah, something down in that red is Subway hacks.

833
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,460
You know what I mean?

834
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,780
You like sandwiches on the cheap, Subway hacks.

835
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,020
I think Travis should be in charge of jingles for Subway hacks.

836
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,940
I think he's got a better grasp.

837
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,900
I'm in touch with the people.

838
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,420
I know real America.

839
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,540
Subway hacks.

840
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:56,860
Always.

841
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:01,420
Getting extra cut, getting extra couple inches on that $5 footlong.

842
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:06,620
It's Subway hacks for American, American lunch.

843
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,380
Cold cuts, cutting corners with Subway hacks.

844
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,340
You know them motherfuckers got mozzarella cheese.

845
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,700
You just gotta ask for it.

846
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,180
Take it from your pal Garth Brooks.

847
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,860
Subway hacks.

848
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,660
I'm out of retirement to do this bit.

849
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,580
There's one more project I always dreamed about working on

850
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,580
and it's a fake jingle for a podcast for a segment of it.

851
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,180
Subway hacks.

852
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,380
Gotta catch them all, Subway hacks.

853
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,500
Call them Baton Rouge.

854
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,900
Oh, I got friends behind glass counters.

855
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:51,820
Faith Hill's got a mean and insatiable hunger for Subway sandwiches.

856
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:56,380
And the only way I can feel it is with their sponsorship, Subway hacks.

857
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:02,460
Also at some point I became Tim McGraw apparently instead of Garth Brooks.

858
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,660
Oh no, I've exposed the fact that Faith Hill left Garth Tim McGraw.

859
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,940
Fuck, they're all the same.

860
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,500
God damn it.

861
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,580
They're all just a bunch of fucking slack shod yokels

862
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,820
wearing the same fucking hats and playing the same three chords.

863
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,540
God damn it.

864
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,060
What's wrong with you?

865
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,940
Subway hacks.

866
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,020
Always ask for spinach as the first topping.

867
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:27,260
They'll try to trick you by asking lettuce or tomato, but stay focused.

868
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,500
And by saying spinach and tomato instead,

869
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,380
they will give you as much nutritious expensive spinach

870
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,140
as they would icy cheap lettuce instead of a measly five leaves.

871
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,380
And add a bonus, when you later add lettuce to your sandwich,

872
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,380
they will flash you a look of defeat as they're now a card carrying member

873
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:48,540
of a secret Subway hacking society.

874
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,220
That's from Victor.

875
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,340
This is obviously a very tremendous valuable tip

876
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,460
that's going to save all of our listeners thousands of dollars every year.

877
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,180
But I don't know that I would call any scenario

878
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:05,420
that results in me eating more spinach as a successful hack.

879
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,100
Yeah, I think you have been hacked.

880
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,220
It's not about the action, it's about the outcome, Griffin.

881
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,300
It's that you can then just throw the spinach away in front of them.

882
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,500
This hack will get you two giant free fistfuls of lima beans.

883
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,220
Like, cool.

884
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,140
I could not hack it and then not hack those.

885
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:26,780
By the way, sir, I hate to call Victor out here,

886
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:31,260
but I think once I've got one vegetable on my sandwich,

887
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,340
I'm already pretty proud of myself.

888
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,420
I don't think I need to show off by putting two on there.

889
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,300
I just have to assume you're announcing that loudly to the audience

890
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,300
or maybe calling your wife to tell her

891
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,820
how many cookie points you earned

892
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,140
by getting both spinach and lettuce on your sandwich.

893
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,700
Cookie points.

894
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,620
Does Subway let you redeem cookie points yet?

895
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,860
Is that an actionable currency yet?

896
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,580
No, not yet.

897
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,100
We'll get that going.

898
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,340
This next one's from Chelsea T.

899
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,580
Who says it is cheaper to order a veggie sandwich

900
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,620
and pay to add ham than it is to buy a ham sandwich.

901
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,420
If you want, you can ask for a clump of cookie dough instead of a cookie.

902
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,980
You can also ask them to put the cookies in the toaster for 30 seconds

903
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,580
and the chocolate chips get all gooey and great.

904
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,020
No, no, no, I can't do a fucking hack

905
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,020
that requires me to like get this poor Subway engineer

906
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,060
to do extra work and like hold up the line.

907
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,340
All right, first off, first off, they're artists, all right?

908
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:30,220
They're not just cobblers putting together sandwiches

909
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,300
free of any sort of artistry.

910
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,260
These are artists.

911
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,540
You're right, my apologies.

912
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:38,700
I want to say this, though, that if you are the dude in line at Subway

913
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,060
and they're like, would you like a cookie with that?

914
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,860
And say, no, what I want is a lump of dough.

915
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:46,860
And if you could ask them to toast a regular cookie

916
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,100
and you can ask for a lump of cookie dough,

917
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,420
can you ask for a lump of cookie dough

918
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,660
and ask them to cook it right in front of you?

919
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,140
I really want a cookie, but I want to be there for the process.

920
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,900
I have to see that it's free range.

921
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,700
I have to see.

922
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,980
I want to be all up in every step.

923
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,140
I have to see that it's a cruelty free cookie.

924
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:33,020
I'm sorry.

925
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:37,260
And the best comedians in the English speaking world for international waters.

926
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,620
Go to maximumfun.org or look for us in the iTunes store.

927
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,460
I'm a guy in his early 20s.

928
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,580
Oh, you got a Yahoo, don't you?

929
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,380
I do, I got a few.

930
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,300
This Yahoo was sent in by Meredith Mahan.

931
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:46,860
Thank you, Meredith.

932
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:51,340
It's by Yahoo Answers user Voltorb8787.

933
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,820
Thank you, Voltorb.

934
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,420
Who asks, are double ghosts real?

935
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,420
I know regular ghosts are real.

936
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,620
Wait, hold on real quick.

937
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,260
Yep.

938
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,580
I want to guess what he means before you say it.

939
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,980
Why don't you write it down on a piece of paper?

940
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:09,980
Okay, wait, hold on.

941
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,980
I'm going to type it into the Skype window.

942
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,460
Keep going.

943
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:12,700
Okay.

944
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,500
I know regular ghosts are real.

945
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,060
I want Travis to type it first.

946
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,540
I'm sorry.

947
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,700
This has become much more important to me than the question.

948
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:21,900
Okay.

949
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,260
It's a fun little metagame that really none of our listeners are going to be able to enjoy,

950
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:25,660
but we'll see.

951
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,980
I also enjoy it afterwards.

952
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,180
He is a slow type.

953
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,100
I know, Jesus Christ.

954
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,940
Are you just hunting and pecking?

955
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,180
Yes.

956
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:33,420
Okay.

957
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,820
This is actually two guesses, Travis, which is kind of bullshit.

958
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,340
Well, it's double ghosts, so double guess, bitch.

959
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,700
All right, Griffin, go ahead.

960
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,740
Are double ghosts real?

961
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,740
I know regular ghosts are real.

962
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:49,980
My cousin said that a ghost could die and be a double ghost,

963
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,980
and the ghost's connection to the spirit world is stronger and it's more powerful.

964
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,620
See, I would think it would be weaker.

965
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:57,820
Why is that?

966
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:03,900
Well, because the ghost already can't manifest as much as a human being is,

967
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,900
so you would think then the second ghost would be even flimsier than the ghost.

968
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:12,700
See, we're getting into some Channel 101 prison-prison break territory right now.

969
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,580
The prison inside the prison where prisoners go for breaking the rules.

970
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,700
We are really getting fucking deep down in it.

971
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,460
There's different planes, right?

972
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,340
There's got to be different...

973
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,620
God, I just watched Poltergeist.

974
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,540
I just watched Poltergeist. I feel like they address this.

975
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,980
The problem is, is that how deep does that rabbit hole go?

976
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,420
Can you have triple ghosts?

977
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:37,820
Well, eventually there's just going to be one ghost in the deepest verse, right?

978
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,860
Unless you're talking about like a ghost, like quintuple ghost murder suicide.

979
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,140
Well, you can have a quintuple ghost because that's how God was born.

980
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,300
God's a quintuple ghost.

981
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:48,860
I don't...

982
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,340
But where did he come from?

983
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:51,980
You know what I mean?

984
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,340
That's always a good question, isn't it?

985
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,580
Whoa, it's a real chicken and egg kind of thing, isn't it?

986
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,220
Yeah.

987
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:56,700
How would you...

988
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,900
What if each time...

989
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:02,300
Okay, what if each time the ghost died and came back, they were just 1% smaller?

990
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,460
Okay, I like this.

991
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,660
But then, okay...

992
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,980
But also 1% denser.

993
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,220
And so then eventually you get like a dark matter kind of thing, right?

994
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,660
Where you have a very tiny but very dense ghost.

995
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:22,780
That ghost is going to be super A, easy to eat, B, delicious.

996
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,620
Ghosts are going to eat the fuck out of smaller ghosts.

997
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:32,700
So you're saying like once that process, once a ghost is being eaten by other livelier,

998
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:38,380
I guess, for lack of a better adjective, ghosts, they get super fucking fat.

999
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,340
I bet you guys...

1000
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,300
No, not fat.

1001
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,180
Dense.

1002
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,540
You know what I bet, guys?

1003
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:48,460
I bet that Pac-Mens have protests about people creating quadruple ghosts for eating

1004
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,900
because it's cruel to ghosts.

1005
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,540
Oh, shit.

1006
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,980
I didn't even think about that shit.

1007
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,140
Pinky and Bunky and Inky and all those dudes.

1008
00:42:54,140 --> 00:43:00,620
They've got to be like trillions upon trillions of layers deep.

1009
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:07,100
They're like foie ghosts and they have been raised, farm raised, killed multiple, multiple,

1010
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,780
multiple times to be the most delicious to the residents of Pac-Land.

1011
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,500
Yeah.

1012
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,780
How do you kill a ghost though?

1013
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,380
That is a huge question that I have been struggling with.

1014
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,300
I feel like in my encounters...

1015
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:23,820
If I know one thing from Final Fantasy, you cast cure on them.

1016
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,420
Yeah, that definitely hurts their HP.

1017
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,420
But it's more of a banishment.

1018
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,420
I feel like you can only banish a ghost.

1019
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,940
I feel like killing a ghost...

1020
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,700
Well, you can bust them.

1021
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,180
You know what I mean?

1022
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,020
You can also shame them.

1023
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,940
That's really just a containment, isn't it?

1024
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:41,420
I mean, ghosts aren't being busted so much as they're just being imprisoned.

1025
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,420
The whole thing's a misnomer.

1026
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,940
Well, when you bust them...

1027
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,940
Imprisoning makes me feel good.

1028
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:52,540
It's sort of like when you're on the basketball court and someone does an ankle breaker and

1029
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,660
dribbles around you and they busted you.

1030
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,380
You got busted.

1031
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:56,860
You know what I mean?

1032
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,540
So it's embarrassing.

1033
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,140
So you've also embarrassed the ghost.

1034
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:07,340
Could a ghost be ill and recover or be mortally wounded but not die?

1035
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,420
You can't be mortally wounded if you're already dead.

1036
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,220
It doesn't make any sense.

1037
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:10,700
That's what I'm saying.

1038
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,620
You could be immortally wounded.

1039
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,180
Whoa.

1040
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,060
Like Highlander.

1041
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,100
That's tricky though.

1042
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,260
Griffin, can you read the question again real quick?

1043
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,180
Sure.

1044
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,220
Are double ghosts real?

1045
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,060
Did you need more or just the synopsis?

1046
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,740
I know regular ghosts are real.

1047
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:30,060
My cousin said that a ghost could die and be a double ghost.

1048
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:36,060
I just wanted to stop you right there and point out that this guy has the sweetest cousin ever.

1049
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,860
This guy is cousin-ing so hard and that is exactly what a cousin should be doing.

1050
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,780
Not only reinforcing your own dumb belief in ghosts,

1051
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:48,700
but expanding your horizons on what a ghost can be.

1052
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,660
Because one of two things is going on.

1053
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,740
Either that cousin just went back to his friends like,

1054
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:57,500
oh my god, you guys, I totally told Todd that ghosts could die.

1055
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,500
Or that cousin is Stephen Hawking.

1056
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:07,660
There are some people who responded to this question

1057
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:13,820
and the tone of their answers possess a level of certainty

1058
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:19,020
with which I speak about like the deliciousness of cinnamon toast crunch

1059
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,420
or the fact that the sun rises in the morning.

1060
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,660
They are so so certain that they have solved this conundrum.

1061
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,820
Like for instance, you can't die twice.

1062
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:31,020
A ghost can only stay in its current state or move on to the other side, one word,

1063
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,980
accepting that it is no longer part of the physical world.

1064
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,980
If the ghost crosses over, they become a spirit,

1065
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,660
which is the soul's natural state.

1066
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,580
In that sense, the spirit would be more powerful

1067
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,420
because it would no longer be tied to the physical realm

1068
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:42,700
or to its own past anymore

1069
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,580
and would also obtain knowledge and support from the other side.

1070
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,900
So it sounds like being a ghost is kind of a shit deal.

1071
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,340
Yeah, I thought something I want to sign up for.

1072
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,820
Yeah, but I mean, how is that any different from how we used to speak

1073
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,460
with certainty about the sun revolving around the earth?

1074
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,780
You're saying ghost technology hasn't come far enough for research.

1075
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,380
I'm just saying that, listen, you can believe with your mind all you want.

1076
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,060
You got to believe with your heart.

1077
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,900
And I believe ghosts can die and come back with my heart.

1078
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,860
That doesn't make it true, Travis.

1079
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,940
I believe with my heart.

1080
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,260
Listen, he's got mustard seed faith in his heart

1081
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:20,300
about his hypothesis of ghost murder.

1082
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,700
Let's just let it be

1083
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,100
because we're obviously not going to be able to change his mind about it.

1084
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,140
Travis, are you set in your ways?

1085
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,820
No, because it's not in my mind, it's in my heart.

1086
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,580
Right, in your mustard heart.

1087
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,660
Is there anything I can say to you to change your mind?

1088
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,500
You can show me a ghost who hasn't died.

1089
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,260
I'm sure there are tons of ghosts that haven't died

1090
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,580
just in the same way that there are tons of humans who haven't died.

1091
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,380
Show me.

1092
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,540
Show you, right, you can't prove a negative.

1093
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,220
Show you a human that hasn't died?

1094
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:43,420
Yes.

1095
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,740
Pierce Brosnan, Emilio Esteves.

1096
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,860
We're getting off track.

1097
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,340
Courtney Love.

1098
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,380
You're using me with your logic.

1099
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:48,780
Me.

1100
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,820
What are your damn science?

1101
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:54,140
The heavens opened up and juicy crust came down from heaven above

1102
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:58,380
and said, Travis, ghosts can never die.

1103
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,140
What would you say then?

1104
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,820
I know, because I invented them.

1105
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,700
I invented ghosts.

1106
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,780
I would say that I was an American and I would wait to hear from our Jesus.

1107
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,580
Which Jesus?

1108
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,500
Jeezy Creasy.

1109
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,580
Yes, I can't argue with that.

1110
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,300
I'm a guy in his early 20s.

1111
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,860
In an effort to step out of my comfort zone,

1112
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:24,060
I recently started taking Zumba classes in secret.

1113
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,660
However, through sheer bad luck, I found out my boss,

1114
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,540
who happened to be randomly walking by the studio I go to,

1115
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,380
caught a glimpse of me shaking my bodacious booty.

1116
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,460
Now my entire team knows.

1117
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:40,060
How can I play this off effectively and still save face?

1118
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,300
That's from Crumping in Columbus.

1119
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,900
And you'll be happy to know the question asker

1120
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,220
has gone through the trouble of making the Columbus with a K.

1121
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,580
You have got to lean into it.

1122
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,820
You have got to lean into it.

1123
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,300
Just like-

1124
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,700
Are you gonna be still the butt of jokes

1125
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:02,220
when you have got just like an incredible Zumba crafted body?

1126
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,940
No, you'll be the envy of the whole office pool.

1127
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:08,220
I'm saying show up like full jazzercise outfit.

1128
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:12,220
Whoa, you're saying like develop an entire identity around Zumba.

1129
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:12,720
Yeah.

1130
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,700
You become Mr. or Mrs. Zumba.

1131
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,140
Because here's the thing, they can only make fun of you.

1132
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,460
They can only make you the center of the butt of the joke,

1133
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,580
as long as you let them.

1134
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,100
You have to show them that it doesn't bother you.

1135
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,780
You have to show them that it doesn't bother you.

1136
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:25,900
Are you saying-

1137
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,020
And keep drinking your milk.

1138
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,380
You own the Zumba.

1139
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,300
You become Dr. Zumba.

1140
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,220
Attorney at law.

1141
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,260
It's worth it, man.

1142
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:38,540
If this guy is an attorney, he can be like the David Comey of Austin, Texas.

1143
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,300
The attorney, the caveman attorney that rocks.

1144
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:44,220
And be the attorney that fucking undulates.

1145
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:48,220
You're saying guy, but do we know if this is man or woman?

1146
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,460
Says I'm a guy in the early 20s, so-

1147
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,660
He does say guy, okay.

1148
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,220
Yeah.

1149
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,260
That's right.

1150
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,860
Second, here's my question.

1151
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:55,900
Is your boss fat?

1152
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,580
Oh my God.

1153
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,700
That would be sick.

1154
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,460
Welcome to my new Spike reality show, Is Your Boss Fat?

1155
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,060
You're watching Undercover Fat Boss.

1156
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,980
Who's this new fat employee we have?

1157
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,860
This new fat employee sucks at his job.

1158
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,020
Why did we hire this new fat employee?

1159
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,260
But I know it's our boss, because nobody's this fat.

1160
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,380
Nobody's this fat except-

1161
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,780
No, wait, what about Undercover Fat Boss?

1162
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,620
You take a boss who's very skinny.

1163
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,020
You take him away for six months and fatten him up,

1164
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,100
and then bring him back as the boss again.

1165
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,540
Hey, hey, Gordo.

1166
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,380
Do you have a good trip?

1167
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,740
Jesus Christ, this guy.

1168
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,620
Did you eat all the pigs in Hawaii?

1169
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:33,900
Fat fuck.

1170
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,460
Wait a second.

1171
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,380
I see the seams.

1172
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,580
Are we on Undercover Fat Boss right now?

1173
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,820
Man, this show sucks dick.

1174
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:49,180
Wait, I'm not signing any waivers.

1175
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,700
I don't want my personal brand associated

1176
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,700
with this bullshit TV show.

1177
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,980
I got a brand to maintain.

1178
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,780
I can't be seen on Undercover Fat Boss.

1179
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,580
People give you trouble over you getting healthy.

1180
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,180
Like, I guess if you can take it on the chin

1181
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:08,700
and just let it roll off your back

1182
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,100
and just wait for these fat fucks to die.

1183
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,620
Because really, here, break it down.

1184
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,860
Why would they make fun of that?

1185
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,780
A, because you're a dude?

1186
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,540
Well, that's sexist.

1187
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,780
B, because they think it's stupid?

1188
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:21,900
Well, that's judgmental.

1189
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,340
And they're probably not healthy

1190
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,500
because they think exercise is stupid.

1191
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,820
Or C, they're just judgy assholes.

1192
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,580
Like, what does it matter?

1193
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,780
You're not doing anything wrong.

1194
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,540
It's not like they caught you doing something shameful.

1195
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,420
I don't think it's sexist so much as it's zumbist.

1196
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,580
Because I think it would alter my perception of man or woman

1197
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,420
if I knew that they were into zumba.

1198
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,220
Not in a bad way.

1199
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,660
It just changes my outlook.

1200
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,300
I traded in my iPod for a zumba a long time ago,

1201
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,580
and I don't regret the decision.

1202
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,460
I actually bought a zumba to clean my floors

1203
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,180
when I wasn't home.

1204
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:53,660
I got a zumba.

1205
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,580
No, go ahead.

1206
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,700
Keep it rolling.

1207
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,860
I got zumbas.

1208
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,340
It locks my car.

1209
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,700
So I think that every dude that gives other dudes shit

1210
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,380
for how good they are at dancing

1211
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:13,500
is absolutely jealous of the fact that this person

1212
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:13,980
is very good at dancing.

1213
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,180
Oh, yeah, it's such insecurity.

1214
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,740
Like, there are very few things that I think that about.

1215
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,900
I think that there are people that harbor prejudices

1216
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,260
against certain activities,

1217
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,700
and thus they give people a guff over those activities.

1218
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,300
Dancing, I do not think, is one of them.

1219
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,220
You see, like, fucking Savion Glover,

1220
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,460
like, just destroying it.

1221
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,940
You can't be like, look at this dude fucking tap dance.

1222
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:36,380
No, no, like, the most uncultured human being alive.

1223
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,860
I always said Gregory Peck, but I think I'm behind.

1224
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,940
I think you think Gregory Hines.

1225
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,260
You ever seen Gregory Peck dance?

1226
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,820
God, get it out of his finch.

1227
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,220
He can probably, he can probably move it.

1228
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,660
I mean, not anymore, obviously.

1229
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,380
But the same charge could be leveled

1230
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:56,620
at Gregory Hines, fellow dead person.

1231
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,860
You think they have a dance in double heaven.

1232
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,740
God, there's only one thing that could make

1233
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,980
ghost Gregory Hines better at dancing

1234
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,580
is if he was a double ghost.

1235
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,820
I don't want to, I don't want to commit this theory to paper,

1236
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,820
but both Gregory Peck and Gregory Hines passed away in 2003.

1237
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:18,860
I think that they are, if they have gone through the path,

1238
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:22,380
the multi-ghost pass, I think they're probably

1239
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,660
at about the same level.

1240
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,340
Best Greggs.

1241
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,380
Best Greggs forever and ever into oblivion.

1242
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:29,980
You guys want Yahoo?

1243
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,280
Sure.

1244
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,900
This Yahoo was sent in by Hilary Armstrong.

1245
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,380
Thanks, Hilary.

1246
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:34,940
It's by Yahoo!

1247
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:38,060
who answers user Megan, who asks, what are the tactical demands

1248
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:38,780
in badminton?

1249
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,020
Good question.

1250
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,420
Doing an assignment in BTE-C sport

1251
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,020
and really stuck on this question.

1252
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:45,500
Help.

1253
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,420
No idea what BTE stands for.

1254
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:48,540
BTE?

1255
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,040
C.

1256
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,700
BTE-C.

1257
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,820
BTE-C.

1258
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:52,300
BTO.

1259
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,100
BTE.

1260
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,100
It's taking care of business.

1261
00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:02,300
I think it's badminton, tennis, electro, and cart.

1262
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:05,580
So it's a new bad-ass sport that blends the best elements

1263
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,260
of those four.

1264
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:07,580
Yes.

1265
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,540
Please repeat the question.

1266
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,940
What are the tactical demands in badminton?

1267
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,660
You got to take out the weak first.

1268
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,780
It's not Hunger Games.

1269
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:17,500
You understand that.

1270
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,300
It's like, it's like-

1271
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,700
You got to outlast, outsmart, outplay, outdance.

1272
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,900
Travis, you confused the survivor.

1273
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,900
You got to say shuttlecock without laughing.

1274
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,940
I think you got to do a lot of things in this sport

1275
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:30,060
without laughing.

1276
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:30,540
You know that?

1277
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,700
OK, you know that move where you kind of wind up like you're

1278
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,100
really just going to smash the shit out of the shuttlecock,

1279
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,420
but then you just kind of tap it over the net?

1280
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,140
There's that move.

1281
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:41,020
OK, so I have a theory that everybody is, at least,

1282
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:46,380
every sport has claimed at least one life, right?

1283
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:47,660
Football, definitely.

1284
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,580
Baseball, almost certainly.

1285
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,300
Baseball, definitely.

1286
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:52,940
Baseball, definitely.

1287
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,860
Yeah, I killed that kid's mom in Owen Meany.

1288
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:56,380
What?

1289
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:56,620
No.

1290
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:00,460
No, hockey, sure, definitely.

1291
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:03,260
You're talking about slippery, slippery foot knives.

1292
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:07,260
Badminton, I think is the exception to the rule.

1293
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,220
I do not think a badminton in any measure-

1294
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,060
Let me, let me paint you a picture.

1295
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,180
Could possess lethality.

1296
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,460
Because obviously the first consideration-

1297
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,580
OK, they go, wait, they go for a power spike, power spike,

1298
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,660
shuttlecock, someone's opening their mouth saying,

1299
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,460
I got it, shuttlecock, down the throat, choking to death.

1300
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:22,860
But no, you can't-

1301
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,340
Time look won't work because it's got the spines on the net.

1302
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,700
It's a safety pop, Travis.

1303
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,500
It's covered in a-

1304
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,140
It's got a giant rigid net on the end.

1305
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:30,620
That's just-

1306
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,420
No, that's what I'm saying.

1307
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,420
That's what lodged it in the throat.

1308
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,660
Nobody has a throat big enough to get that stuck in there.

1309
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:36,220
Nobody does.

1310
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,100
Not anymore.

1311
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,980
Back in the day, you must have used to have a much thinner,

1312
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,260
smaller girth cock.

1313
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:43,980
Don't you fucking laugh.

1314
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,100
Don't you laugh at that.

1315
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:45,660
Don't.

1316
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,460
A person lost their life because of that cock.

1317
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:51,820
So Justin just linked this fucking badminton forum.

1318
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:54,140
Sorry for speaking out of turn, everybody,

1319
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,980
because someone definitely died of a heart attack

1320
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,100
while playing badminton.

1321
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,780
But listen, if I was playing badminton-

1322
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,140
No, if I-

1323
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,300
Justin serves the internet.

1324
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:02,940
All right.

1325
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,060
It's a fun part of the show.

1326
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,260
But if I was playing badminton,

1327
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,260
somebody ran onto the court and stabbed me to death,

1328
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,860
that's not a badminton related injury.

1329
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,340
Because there's no way that you could-

1330
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:14,380
Nobody's worked up a sweat playing fucking badminton.

1331
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:14,860
You know what I mean?

1332
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,660
Like the physical strenuousness of this task

1333
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:20,140
did not cause this person to keel over and fucking die.

1334
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,460
It's impossible.

1335
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,660
Mythbusters?

1336
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:24,700
Myth busted.

1337
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,380
We don't need to send this to those guys.

1338
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,620
We can do this shit ourselves.

1339
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,620
We can DIY this myth bust.

1340
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:33,500
Hey, we've been relying on mythbusters for too long, America.

1341
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,260
It's time we take this matter into our own hands.

1342
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,260
Nobody has ever died playing badminton

1343
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,260
because nobody moves playing badminton

1344
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:42,460
and everything is made out of unkillable materials.

1345
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,620
Can't be done.

1346
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:45,100
Can't be done.

1347
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,340
The rackets weigh like half a gram.

1348
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:47,740
Can't be done.

1349
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:48,300
What if you-

1350
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:48,780
Oh, okay.

1351
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,980
What if you were running too fast,

1352
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,980
you slipped, hit the net, decapitated?

1353
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:54,380
Nobody runs while playing badminton.

1354
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,380
It's little kid tennis.

1355
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:57,180
Okay, okay.

1356
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,300
You're playing badminton.

1357
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,940
There's a light sprinkle of dew upon the ground.

1358
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,500
You slip, you fly backwards.

1359
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,780
I accidentally hit you with my racket.

1360
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,020
You did.

1361
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,940
Why are you on my side of the badminton court?

1362
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,780
Because we're playing doubles.

1363
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,540
What if you make a bet with the person you're playing against?

1364
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,060
If they lose, they have to eat their whole racket.

1365
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:19,260
That's good.

1366
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:23,260
Or if they lose, you get to kill their wife.

1367
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,580
We're going to play badminton and whoever loses

1368
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,260
gets killed by the other person.

1369
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,660
It's the most dangerous game to the sequel.

1370
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,980
Hey, listen, we liked your first book.

1371
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,460
I don't know so much about this new one.

1372
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,780
It is kind of implausible.

1373
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:37,900
You're playing badminton, right?

1374
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:38,540
You go back.

1375
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:39,020
I'm not.

1376
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,700
So that's like, I guess, step one.

1377
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,620
Like, let me undo this theory

1378
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,140
because I'm definitely not playing badminton.

1379
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,380
Okay, person A is playing badminton

1380
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,260
and person B has hit the shuttlecock into a high arc.

1381
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:51,820
You're scooting back to get it.

1382
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,260
You knock over the grill.

1383
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,780
You set the house on fire.

1384
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,460
Oh, sleeping grandma dead.

1385
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,620
Why wouldn't you go get her?

1386
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,340
Because playing badminton hardened you.

1387
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,980
And plus you need to finish the game.

1388
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,860
I want to thank you guys so much for listening.

1389
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,980
Sorry, we can't move on from the fact

1390
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:15,180
that Travis is just painting a picture of two people

1391
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,460
who are so fucking into their badminton game

1392
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:20,460
that not only will they allow themselves

1393
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,140
to lose every piece of property they own,

1394
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,300
they will allow their grandmother to fucking die.

1395
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,300
They'll allow their grandmother to fucking die.

1396
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,140
It's two out of three and they're tied one, one.

1397
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,620
Oh man, this actually does sound like a clutch scenario.

1398
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:31,820
Can I put money on this game?

1399
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,260
Sorry, Travis made it up.

00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,140

Both of them are British shows that are hilarious.

Did you finish it, Juice?

1434
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,100
No, not yet.

1435
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:50,140
I got kind of behind because I made me bored.

1436
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,020
I don't know what it was.

1437
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:54,140
I'll get back on it.

1438
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,660
Out of your fucking mind?

1439
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,500
Is that everything we have to do?

1440
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,540
Griffin, you have to thank

1441
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,820
John Rodgers and the Lawn Renders

1442
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,700
for the use of the theme song

1443
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,660
as a departure off the album.

1444
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:04,620
Put in your days to bed.

1445
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:05,900
Do you know how fucking shitty I feel

1446
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,660
that I can't go see them in concert?

1447
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,540
I mean, I could, but like,

1448
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,700
I would have to like fly to the Pacific Northwest

1449
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,660
and I don't think I have.

1450
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,220
I don't think I can.

1451
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,660
And then there's the restraining order.

1452
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,100
There is the restraining order.

1470
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,340
But until that time,

1471
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,780
Griffin McElroy is here to take us away.

1472
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:47,740
Guys, my kitty just broke into my office.

1473
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:48,620
Adorable.

1474
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,380
What are you doing here, you little thief?

1475
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:52,380
Well, now he's stuck inside.

1476
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,900
I wish I could share him with our listeners.

1477
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,700
This Yahoo was sent in by Aaron McVicker.

1478
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:00,940
Thanks.

1479
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,140
Oh, just one second.

1480
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,380
This, thank you, Aaron McVicker.

1481
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:07,180
It's by Yahoo answer to user Kelvin who asks,

1482
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:10,380
where is a good place to eat if you like to watch

1483
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:11,900
old people spill stuff?

1484
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,100
Oh, I'm just a McElroy.

1485
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,300
I'm Travis McElroy.

1486
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,660
I'm Travis McElroy.

1487
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,100
Get your popcorn.

1488
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,940
It's more better than my brother, Marie, isn't it?

1489
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:26,300
Kiss him.

1490
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:40,460
Pretty close.

1491
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:46,380

Listener supported.

1495
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:53,980
Justin, what are you doing?

1496
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:56,540
Uh, strapping a chicken in my arm.

1497
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:58,140
Heard there's some plague out west,

1498
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,860
so I just wanted to, you know, kind of get out ahead of it.

1499
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:04,220
Justin, if you'd ever listened to our medical history podcast,

1500
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:07,100
Sawbones, where we talk about everything from trepanation

1501
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,300
to bloodletting, you would know that that is a ridiculous idea

1502
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,340
and it will never work.

1503
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,300
Sawbones, I haven't caught it.

1504
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:14,780
Sawbones?

1505
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,780
Yes, it's every Friday on the Maximum Fun Network

1506
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,540
and we record it together.

1507
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,020
You a doctor or something?

1508
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:23,520
No.

1509
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:53,440
Yes.
