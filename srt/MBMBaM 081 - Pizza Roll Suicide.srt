1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,320
The new recipe crust from Domino's.

6
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,720
My tiger print silk pants.

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,800
Um, those pop-tarts that don't have frosting on them.

8
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,960
Asian people.

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,400
Old car smell.

10
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,200
Old Asian people smell.

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:27,520
We are thankful for so much here at My Brother, My Brother, and Me. We just wanted to take a moment

12
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:37,680
to express the things that we are thankful for. Now, was what I just said racist? No. No.

13
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,440
It's a celebration. You love the smell of like Pat Morita and all other old Asian people. He's

14
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,320
dead. He's dead as fuck, isn't he, Pat? Yeah, I would not enjoy that smell, I think.

15
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:59,040
I don't like it. This is Thanksgiving week at My Brother, My Brother, and Me. Just give a thanks

16
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,680
saying, have you taken a moment to say like, this is what I'm thankful for. I'm thankful for that

17
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:15,920
guy on my Facebook that only posts pictures that he found like that got forwarded to him by his

18
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,480
grandpa. It's like, look at this girl. Can you believe how chubby she is and she's in a wedding

19
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,160
dress like that guy. I'm thankful for him because he makes me feel pretty good about my whole whole

20
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,880
deal. Yeah, I'm thankful for the people that every time you talk about how much you're looking

21
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,240
forward to Thanksgiving, they remind you about, you know, genocide and stuff. Do you have people

22
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:46,720
in your life like that? Yes, I do. Well, not anymore. Griffin, what is the Turkey Day procedure

23
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,680
like in Texas? Everything's bigger there. Are there like giant... Do you know how turkeys are

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,800
descended from raptors? Yeah. That's basically what we're working with down here is raptors

25
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,560
sized turkeys. You have to... Just turkeys lying on the shelves the size of sumo brand bean bag

26
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,600
chairs. You gotta come at them from the side, these turkeys, because they're so big. They're

27
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:20,080
goblers. They will just swing their goblers around like flesh maces. They'll take you down.

28
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Is that what those things are called? Gobblers? I think they're called waddles. Waddles? Waddle

29
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:33,040
gobble. Waddle gobblers. I made an ascot out of a waddle gobbler once. Oh yeah? Yeah, Tim Gunn

30
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,720
panned it. He said no. That guy is so authoritative. He looked at me. He looked at me in the eye and he

31
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,920
was like, make it jerk. And I was like, you're hurting my feelings, but that wasn't like a good

32
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,800
burn. You didn't do it. That's like a good burn. Did not sense Tim. Yeah, Tim. Timothy. Are you drunk,

33
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,920
Tim? I'm super drunk. Justin. Favorite Thanksgiving food? Go. Sweet potato casserole. Me too.

34
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,920
Right there with you, Travis. Hey, everybody. Is it all right if I, I mean. No, give us the

35
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:11,520
dissenting. We have given the main and concurring opinions. It's pumpkin roll. Oh, pumpkin roll?

36
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,480
Yeah, the dessert. Pumpkin roll. Let me see your pumpkin roll. It's a pumpkin log though, isn't it?

37
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,480
I always, I prefer. That sounds unappetizing. Pumpkin roll. Anything with log in it always

38
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,320
sounds gross. Now this could be, I don't know if this is a, a, a Baptist thing, a Southern thing,

39
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:41,680
what part of our, our raising this reflects. If you don't eat, uh, your, your, uh, sweet potatoes

40
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,680
with, uh, pecans and brown sugar on top. What are you doing? I, what are you doing?

41
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,920
What if they're allergic to pecans? Yeah, eat it anyway. Suck it up. Suck it up. Have yourself some,

42
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,360
some pumpkin pie and epinephrine. Like just chill out. Yeah, I, it's one day a year. Treat yourself.

43
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,320
If you were putting marshmallows on that, I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get what you're

44
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,960
doing. Aren't you thankful? That, that seems to me like when people tell me that that's like,

45
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,120
it just seems like, and then I put some ice cream cake on top of it and then I covered in chocolate

46
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,800
chip. You're an adult eating with pecans and brown sugar. Yeah. Something sweet, but it highlights

47
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,680
the nutty. This is an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

48
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,520
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin. Hey guys, let's get right into the advice. I'm dating a girl right

49
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,080
now and things aren't going so well. Problem is that she thinks things are going fantastic.

50
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,680
We started, this isn't funny, sorry. When we started dating when we were 16 and now we're 21,

51
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,200
I would love to start seeing other people and doing single guy things. I know breaking up with

52
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,680
her is going to kill her, but at some point I have to put my happiness first, right? How can I let

53
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,280
her down as easily as possible without ruining our lifelong friendship? Oh no, no, no, no,

54
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:06,720
so many misconceptions. No, this isn't funny. Let's answer the last question first. How can

55
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,480
you let her down as easily as possible without ruining your lifelong, your long friendship?

56
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,560
You can't. You can't. Goodbye, friend. Surprise. Goodbye. You know how people say like,

57
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,600
I didn't want to date him because we were close friends. I didn't want to ruin it. This is what

58
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,640
they mean. They mean this. To be fair, to be fair, they have been together for five years,

59
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,200
so it's not like, well, this didn't work out. They were together for five years. I mean,

60
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:37,280
five years of good good lovin' is roughly equivalent to one lifelong friendship, I feel like.

61
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:45,120
I think you are being greedy for wanting more out of this relationship than is natural,

62
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,040
than is reasonable. She ain't gonna wanna have shit to do with you, and honestly, I will tell

63
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,960
you, in all seriousness, we've had some fun here today, but in all seriousness, you are doing her

64
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,680
a disservice by trying to stay in her life, I feel like. If she wants that at some point,

65
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,200
that might be one thing, but you're gonna have to just pull the bandage off and leave. I mean,

66
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,360
just that's the situation. You guys have been together now from your teens, and now you're

67
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,360
entering adulthood, and one of the lessons you learn as an adult is sometimes for the greater

68
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,680
good, you gotta hurt somebody, and there is no way that you can end this and have it end easily

69
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,360
and nicely, and you guys are like, okay, cool. Do you wanna go get some frozen yogurt? You guys

70
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,800
aren't going to be the same kind of friends after this. Just get okay with the fact that,

71
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,520
I'm assuming she's also, yeah, she's 21. Get okay with the fact that she is 21 years old,

72
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,120
and this probably isn't going to be the worst thing that ever happens to her,

73
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:55,200
even as far as romantic things go. There's a whole lot of other shit coming down the path.

74
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,960
The most important thing is, don't let her listen to this, because there's not a way to do it,

75
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:08,160
but you just gotta sit her down in person, and it's gonna be, I mean, it's gonna suck,

76
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:15,760
but you've given each other five years of your life. That hurts. That sucks.

77
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:23,200
This is almost literally like surgery. No one's really excited to go under the knife and be put

78
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:29,920
out and everything, but you're cutting this part of your life away. It sucks, but it's necessary.

79
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,040
You have to do it. Yeah, there's no anesthesia. Well, there is.

80
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:42,480
You're 21 now. You're 21 now. There's adult anesthesia. It's just gonna suck. You're just

81
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,320
gonna have to sit down and say, but be direct about it, be honest about it, and just say that

82
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,760
she's great, and it's just she's not the right person for you. As great as she is, it's not.

83
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,520
I mean, that's gonna suck for her to hear. It sucks to get dumped. It sucks, it sucks, it sucks,

84
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,920
but you're right in that you're not doing anybody a favor by staying in a relationship. You're not

85
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,920
happy yet. That's not good for her. It's not good for you, and she's quickly arcing past

86
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,120
her sexual prime. Oh, you got it. You've got to let her. She has like another six months. She's

87
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:29,760
got six months tops. Stop. What is the prime? What's the prime? When is it? Well, for girls,

88
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,720
they peak at like 21, and then they're done by 22, and then they have like 20 low years,

89
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,560
and then they come back up 40, and they're cougars. Yeah, they're banging. I think 21.5

90
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,880
is the prime. That's the target. It is a prime number. Jesus. What is it for men?

91
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:57,600
For men? It's 12. 12 and then 76. 12 to 14, then we're out of it for a few years. 12 to 14 is like

92
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,960
your middle school teachers. Those ladies are like, hey, I see what he's cooking up.

93
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:13,360
The scrambled up spice channel. Then you drop out from like 14 to, if memory serves, about 25.

94
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,520
You're kind of out of the game, and then once you get out of college,

95
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,120
I hope you've latched on to somebody by then. Yeah, by the time you get out of college,

96
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,960
you have like three days of sexual crime. I have a chart somewhere. I'll show you

97
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:35,440
sometime, Griffin. It's a sliding scale. Here's the point. We're all past it. Long story short,

98
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,640
we're old. It's basically like the lifespan of a fruit fly. That's how long we have to mate,

99
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:48,640
really. Darius, no, but here's the thing about this. You should dread it. You are not going to

100
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,520
get out of it easily. You are not going to. You're not going to get out of it without ruining your

101
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:03,840
friendship. It is what it is, but you have to accept that sooner rather than later so you can

102
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,280
get to the actual doing of it. Because after it's done, you are going to feel a lot better,

103
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,440
and she will be better in the long run, even though she won't feel better for a much longer time.

104
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,160
There's also a good chance the problem of she thinks things are going fantastic is that that is

105
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:28,160
a defense mechanism because she feels that you are drifting away. So that idea of trying to keep

106
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,720
things going as well as maybe they went in the past. So she probably knows that something is

107
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,600
going wrong. Something's gone awry. Right. Something's gone askew, but you got to do it.

108
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,880
Is there a polite, non-offensive way to ask if someone is gay? I have a friend, and everyone who

109
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,440
hangs out with him thinks he might be gay, but of course no one wants to ask him. It's not that we

110
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,600
care one way or the other what his sexual orientation is. We just want to know, but it

111
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,880
doesn't seem like something you could ask point blank, wondering in Wisconsin. I would argue you

112
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:11,200
do care one way or the other because you want to know. You understand? Right? I mean, if you didn't,

113
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:18,400
like, I don't care what the special is at Tudor's Biscuit World tomorrow, and as a result,

114
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,640
I have not endeavored to unearth that information. Here's what you're going to need to do.

115
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:31,040
It's stewed tomatoes. You're going to need to set up like a kickball game,

116
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,680
and then when you're establishing teams, you say, everyone who's straight is on that team,

117
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,680
and everyone who's gay is on that team. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. I think that's

118
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:50,800
pretty good. Oh, God. Just a quick straw poll. Anybody here gay? And if he raises his hand,

119
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,920
you know that he is. Yeah, that's a good trick. That is great. What I find funny about this idea

120
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,360
of wanting to ask this, is that when you meet someone that you think is straight,

121
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,320
you don't ask them if they're straight. Hey, what's up? You straight? Huh? Huh? Like,

122
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,960
I don't know. Maybe the reason that he doesn't go around telling people whether he's gay or

123
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,840
straight is he doesn't want to be identified by sexual preference. That could be it. Yeah.

124
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:26,880
That's what are you even talking about? That is how I define myself, is a straight. Hey,

125
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,720
everybody. I'm straight Travis. Hi, I'm Griffin, and I like ladies. To be fair, that was also the

126
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:40,640
name of my spoken word album. Straight Travis. Straight Travis, no chaser. That was a really,

127
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,240
I thought you were doing some really bold work there. Thank you so much. The one segment where

128
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:53,280
you just whistled the theme song to mash for like 15 minutes. I thought it was a really,

129
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:59,440
really impressive statement. And you know, that was one take. No kidding. Yeah. No chapping.

130
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,200
No, not at all. I had a, an assistant with a spray bottle. Okay. Just keeping it moisturized.

131
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:11,840
Yeah. That visual image is bad for me. You know, you can't do a hundred percent water blend. You

132
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:21,280
have to do a 99% water, 1% Vaseline blend to keep it. That's actually what the Occupy Wall Street

133
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:28,960
protests are about. They're about luby lips? They're about the 99% water, just letting everybody

134
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,640
know. Make sure you have 1% Vaseline. This is the gobbledygook, what you're saying right now.

135
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,400
I'm going to flip it. The gobbler. Don't, do not ask if your friend is gay.

136
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,160
Oh, of course not. No, don't do that. Oh, real quick, just to jump back. Yeah, don't do that.

137
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,720
Either they're not gay and you're going to offend them, or they are gay and maybe they don't want

138
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,200
to tell you that. Just mind your own, you got to mind your own business and you can't have a big

139
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:03,280
deal out of it. Here's how it goes. It goes one of a few ways. One, no, I'm not gay. Why would you

140
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,480
think that? Whoa. That's a weird conversation you're going to get into. Other option. Yeah,

141
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,760
I am gay. Why did you want to know? Are you gay too? Are we going to be, do you want to go on

142
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,080
like a date or something? Not saying that like that is the immediate conclusion, but that would

143
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,240
be the only reasonable reason. That's the only reasonable reason somebody should be asking.

144
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,920
Even the middle of the road, if he's a gay, why does that matter to you? Because it shouldn't.

145
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,240
Just crack, you know, I'm just, uh, just want to crack, crack the case. I just want to, I just

146
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,560
want to make sure you were different from me is all crack the case. When a, uh, when a gay person

147
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,080
is sired, they, they will actually, uh, ask out the, the, just the very next person that they see.

148
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:52,000
Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's totally, it's a, it's a totally weird biological imperative. I don't,

149
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,760
I don't understand it, but I like it. That's the only reason, that's the only reason, uh,

150
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,600
Ellen DeGeneres was dating Portia de Rossi. Yeah. Yeah. She's just an expert. She hove it into her

151
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,200
field of vision. She's watching Arrested Development and like a baby chick who hatches.

152
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:14,800
Ellen was like, whoa, I'm gay at ports. I got it. No, I think that my, well, I think that it's the

153
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,360
opposite of that situation. Oh, okay. Cause that is the only thing that makes sense. Portia de Rossi.

154
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:29,680
Uh, yeah. You with me now? Can we, hold on. Okay. Now, no, hold on. Ellen DeGeneres is a very

155
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,880
attractive woman. What are you talking about now? She is aging very well. She is, she is well

156
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,960
preserved. You can tell she's got her, uh, her water Vaseline blend down. Oh yeah. Right. I don't

157
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,120
like really, you don't get to be, you don't get to be like a talk show superstar unless you have

158
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,240
your Vaseline water blend down. Look at Dr. Phil. He is half Vaseline. Look at that. Look at him

159
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,800
glisten and you could tell star power coming out his, his well hydrated bottom. I learned that in

160
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,160
the classic biography, Straight Oprah. Yeah. Straight Oprah and her chaser. You know, I love

161
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,280
that 15 minute whistling solo she does in that album. This is a very cyclical episode. I heard

162
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,960
it was all one take. That's true, but she had to have an assistant there with a spray bottle.

163
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,600
Yeah. Do you guys want to Yahoo to stop this please? Desperately. This one was, this one was

164
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,520
sent in by Jacob blocker. Thanks Jacob. It's by Yahoo answers user Edward Alec, who asks,

165
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,480
could I eat an entire bag of pizza rolls without dying?

166
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,040
My friend says I'll die or something. If I eat an entire bag of pizza rolls, 90 count,

167
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,080
but I know that it's complete poppycock. I'm a 15 year old girl. Who's 125 pounds. Will I die?

168
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,600
Doubt it. Get sick. Probably. I have a bigger problem than 15 year old girl using the word

169
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,480
poppycock. Yeah. What are you doing? So let me do a little quick math here. Okay. 90 pizza

170
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,880
roll. It totally matters. If it's Totino's, everyone knows that those roll. Are they,

171
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,000
are they super stuffed? Yeah. Are they straight cheesy? Are they pepperoni? Because I don't know

172
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,280
that your liver will be able to process all of the, the fat, the unsaturated saturated triple

173
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,600
meat. What if it's double meat? Well, triple triple triple would be our triple meat. So if

174
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,520
you're looking at one's more sausage, if you're looking at pepperoni, which I think is the only

175
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:30,720
sort of, yeah. I mean, that's the only reasonable thing that in a 15 count bag, no nine doing

176
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:41,040
90. I know. No, I'm doing a little math here. Count bag. You're looking at a 7.5 ounces. Okay.

177
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,560
Well, that's not that many. No, that doesn't seem that bad. Then multiply that by eight,

178
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:57,200
six, six, seven point five times six times four times six equals 45 ounces. That's the by that

179
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,280
by 16. It's about 12 pounds. We're talking. Okay. Well we're talking about three pounds of pizza

180
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:11,600
rolls basically. Man, that's going to be a rough night. What kind of day did you have

181
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,520
that you need to drown it in pizza rolls? Pizza in the morning, pizza after school time,

182
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:24,080
pizza, never a goddamn gin. Cause that one time I ate 90 pizza rolls. What I like is if,

183
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,040
Griffin, could you read me the last sentence again? Uh, will I die? Doubt it. Get sick.

184
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:35,680
Probably. So she knows that it is a bad idea, but she will at least get sick. Well, if,

185
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:41,680
if sorry, if you're, if you were asking yourself the question, will this thing kill me? And your

186
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,880
answer is doubt it. That means there's a shadow of a doubt in your mind that yes, in fact,

187
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,680
eating nine pounds of pizza. You know what though, Griffin, I would say that

188
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,520
that man could have safely stayed on the surface of the earth and just stared at the

189
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,360
moon for the rest of his life. But he was willing to risk it. I'm saying that find out what would

190
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,200
happen eating that Travis is saying this because Travis's daily diet is rated by how much the

191
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,640
likelihood that it will kill him. I'm saying bacon and applesauce, maybe Travis using your

192
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,200
space metaphor, eating three pounds of pizza rolls is going to be going to the moon is going to be

193
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:23,440
the challenger actually is what's going to happen. Oh no. Oh no. Oh golly. Three pounds of pizza

194
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,400
rolls. It's going to be that fucking, it's going to be gluttony from seven. You're going to die

195
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,600
fat on a table and Brad Pitt's going to be like, Oh gross. I'm so thin and he's so fat.

196
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:43,680
High school. Three pounds of pizza rolls. Imagine when you do have to go to the hospital,

197
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,920
the doctor's like, we have a patient here. She's got an overdose of flavor. She's got flavor. She's

198
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:53,120
got terminal flavor. She's been flavor blasted. She's got that Italian zest. Oh, I hit her right

199
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,640
in all the right places. I tell you what's definitely going to be, what's definitely

200
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,960
going to happen is your mom is going to get pissed because you ate all the fucking pizza rolls.

201
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,880
We were saving that from pizza roll night. She just got that at Sam's club. She's got to go all

202
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,920
the way back out to the goddamn Sam's. Why the fuck did I even get the Sam's club membership?

203
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,360
I could have just bought you four bags of pizza rolls at the Walmart and all the Vaseline's gone.

204
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:27,920
Don't you know the blend? All right. Nine to one. Nurse get me the disaster. This woman ate the

205
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:38,240
Super Bowl. Please. Jesus. What if she accidentally messes up her digestive system so much that she

206
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,920
can no longer be full unless she eats three pounds of food? Like she stretches it out to a point of

207
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,960
no return. Right. Exactly. Just looks like a colostomy bag hanging out of her navel. All I

208
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,800
can picture is that she's just finished the 89th pizza roll and her greasy slimy hands are clutching

209
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,400
the 90th as she's like shaking and sweating. And she's fallen over at this point because she is

210
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:10,560
as fat as she is tall. And she's rolling around like violet Beauregard and still she finishes

211
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:18,320
the bag. Wouldn't it be? That was a real great dismount. You know, this sounds like an episode

212
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:27,520
of my favorite show on TV right now, which is suicide. Watch man versus food. It's like man

213
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,000
versus food, but instead of going to restaurants and trying their food challenges, he just buys

214
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,480
a lot of shitty food and then tries to eat it at home in the dark. All right, today I went around,

215
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:45,280
took a long time, but I collected every type of Pringles that there are. If the first half was him

216
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,600
buying the food he was going to destroy with and the second half was watching him eat it as sounds

217
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,360
of silence played in the background, I think I would be really into that show. Only if they had

218
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,640
a special sound effect every time an attendant at the grocery store said, can I help you? And

219
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:07,280
you just look at him and go, yes, please. Somebody, I need someone. Sir, I think you have enough

220
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:14,640
Pringles. I think over the credits he should be, he should say like, oh well, because I have to

221
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,320
keep on living. And like over the credit should just be him trying to uncancel his dentist's

222
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:27,920
appointment and the battle of man versus food. Everyone loses. I really want this show to be

223
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:35,120
made now. I want to see, I want to see a man astride a mountain of hot pockets just yelling

224
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,840
that God is dead. This is what I want from television. Give me that. I just want to see

225
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,520
a man surrounded by an ocean of empty Pringles cans just saying, I thought the fun would never

226
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:52,800
stop. Yeah, but it did. Once I popped, I couldn't stop until I died, until I died, until I was

227
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,240
finally shuffled off this mortal coil. Take me there Pringles man. Here's the sad thing about

228
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,960
all this. Okay. Now I'm really wanting pizza rolls. I could really go for some pizza rolls

229
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,600
and Pringles for lunch. That'd be great. What's the like five o'clock cocktail rule for pizza rolls?

230
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:17,120
How early is too early for pizza rolls? There's nothing, it's never too early. If pizza, if Bagel

231
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,320
Bites can rock the like pizza in the morning thing, then I don't see why they have more of

232
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,560
a claim on it than pizza rolls. Do you know the coffee commercial where someone like starts a pot

233
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,800
and it like wakes everyone in the house up? I would like to make that pizza rolls commercial,

234
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,560
but then everyone comes downstairs and they're just like, what the fuck? What the fuck? It's

235
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,960
nine in the morning. What's the matter with you, Tony? Jesus. You know, Congress just declared

236
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,520
pizza a vegetable. So technically it's like, it's like a pizza, it's like a vegetable roll.

237
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,920
You're starting the morning off with your, it's like a V8, a crunchy V8. Are you fucking kidding

238
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,840
me? Is that a goof? That thing you just said? No. Congress declared that pizza is a vegetable

239
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,280
because of food lobby. Red is now a number. What are you doing in Congress, Congress?

240
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,760
Maybe Congress was just rubber stamping a bunch of stuff without really reading it all the way

241
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,360
through. And then like the next day they're like looking in the paper and it's like pizza,

242
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,400
vegetable, and I'm like, damn it. God damn it. We're not going to be able to put the genie back

243
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,720
in the bottle this time guys. Yeah. Pizza's unvegetable. Congress declares, listen, we were

244
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:33,440
really baked. Yeah. What's the point in, we rolled a big vegetable and smoked it. Can't we just leave

245
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:41,920
that up to science? Can't we let science declare what is and is not or logic or the church. I think

246
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,800
separation of church and state, you, you let the church decide what's a vegetable or not. Yeah.

247
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:55,360
Yeah. Oh God. Unclean. Just wash it. It's just DDT. Just wash it off. That's fine. Not a big deal.

248
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,680
Hey, a lot of people say, guys, you, you are famous. Don't you have famous friends that you

249
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,800
can bring on your show? Don't they need advice from time to time? Why are you keeping them out?

250
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,360
Why are you in my room? Why are you in my room? Get out of here. And then we say,

251
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:17,520
but you have a point before you go. We should admit that you, you do have a point. Uh, so we

252
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,960
asked some of our famous friends how we could help them. This week we have a question from our dear

253
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:34,080
friend, a video game parodyist, humorist, singer, songwriter, Brentle Floss. Uh, and let's listen to

254
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:41,280
his query right now. Hey there, three ME bros. So I've worked from home for a little over a year now.

255
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,920
The majority of my weekday time is spent in my room. I've recently started to worry that maybe

256
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,920
the lack of social interaction isn't good for me. And I remember that at least one of you works from

257
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:55,120
home. So do you have any tips for how I could continue working from home, but still be a healthy,

258
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,640
productive person? Thanks a bunch. Schlappy the wonder taint. Working from home.

259
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:08,480
It's a, it's a mixed blessing. I think more blessing than, than curse. I've been, uh,

260
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:16,320
working out of my house, uh, for, for I guess three years now. Um, it is really hard not to

261
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:24,480
turn into a little bit of a little bit of a hermit. It gets a little hard to deal with the

262
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,080
emotions of people in the real world. Like, cause you're used to kind of controlling everything

263
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,680
like a hermit, you know, you get, you get to, you see the allure of the lifestyle,

264
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,640
the hermit lifestyle, and it's kind of hard to run away from it. You start to watch extreme

265
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,320
coup bonding and go, yeah, I get it. I get it without the, without the aid of emoticons.

266
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,240
I just don't know. I don't know what expressions people are giving me. I don't know. That's

267
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,200
actually Jerry Griffin carries around a book of facial expressions. Uh, just so you can compare

268
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,720
what people are trying to convey. Your eyes look like semicolons. So that must mean you're trying

269
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:13,120
to fuck. Um, I, I, you do have to make every concession to have human contact when possible.

270
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:20,080
I used to think that meant when I heard the FedEx truck pull up running outside to maybe just strike

271
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:26,320
up a combo, but it's gotta be more substantial than that. Hi Deb, if you're listening by the way.

272
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,080
Mine's Marty. Thanks for all the packages. That's crazy. Marty is your dude? Yeah,

273
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,640
he's really great. Um, sometimes it's a new person. I'm like, hey, get out of here.

274
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:42,400
Where's Marty? Let Deb bring, bring Deb back. You gotta do your laundry. That's important.

275
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,600
You're going to feel the need to not do it because who gives a fuck? You gotta,

276
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:54,240
you gotta divorce yourself from the ideology of fuck it. You can't, you can't give into fuck it.

277
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,360
Who have I got to impress today? Uh, in computer because then when people come over to visit and

278
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,200
they can't open the door because of the stacks of newspaper. Yeah, exactly. You are at a constant

279
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,880
Griffin. So right. You have to constantly be making the choice to not fuck it. You have to

280
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,160
be making the choice to say, I'm not fucking it today. Today I'm putting it, I can't, this is a

281
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,040
true, true. I joke a lot about, you know, I work it out of my house somewhere and sweat pants all

282
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:29,040
the time. I can't wear sweat pants or my, I don't have a workday. They're like, they're like kryptonite.

283
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:35,680
Like I wear them. It's like I lose, lose all my ability to function as an adult. So wear real

284
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:42,240
pants. That really helps shower, shower by at least 10 o'clock or at the most 10 o'clock. And,

285
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,080
and you got to put on real big boy clothes and you got to pretend that maybe your desk is next

286
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,880
to a super cute girl's desk and you want to try and impress her with your good posture. You know,

287
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,600
let me ask you guys this cause I do not work from home nor have I ever. So let me ask you this. Do

288
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:06,240
you guys set up like a, a work schedule? Do you know that at a certain time your workday is done

289
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:13,280
and you can, is it like homeschooling? I kick it, I start kicking it at nine. At one I take a shower

290
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,000
or no, I'm sorry. That's when I lunch it. And then, and then I'm out by five or six,

291
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,120
depending on the workload. Now how much of that time is spent hiding from the boss?

292
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,160
I don't understand. How much, a large amount of my day is spent flirting with Rebecca from

293
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,560
accounting, which is weird. Standing around the water cooler. Standing around the water cooler,

294
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,440
just gossiping. God, it's so sad to see me gossip. You should see it.

295
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,600
I like to, I'd like to talk about the voice with anyone who will listen,

296
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,280
but unfortunately I'm the only person at home. So I usually just wait for Marty to come by.

297
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,880
I say, Hey, thanks for the package. Just check the voice last night.

298
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,240
But he never did. He never watches it. I don't think he has a TV.

299
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:06,800
Christmas gift this year. It's, you gotta put, I don't understand these people by the way,

300
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:15,280
who are putting off their showers. Me, I get up. My day does not start until I shower. I can't do

301
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:22,960
anything until I've gotten the, just washed off the night and the day freshly.

302
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:32,560
Wash off the sea salt grime from the docks. The crying myself into my pillow to sleep.

303
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,480
After judging through the seedy underbelly of Huntington, West Virginia.

304
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,240
Yeah. After an ecstasy fueled night of raving, you got to get the ecstasy sweat off.

305
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,280
Just wash the glitter off. It won't come off. You wipe off the grease paint.

306
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,600
The glow in the dark. You cry in the mirror.

307
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,640
Glow in the dark highlighter all over your arms. The residue from candy necklaces.

308
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,960
Five different bracelets from five different dive bars.

309
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,920
Seaman. Strange seaman.

310
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,160
Well, okay. You might've taken it a bit too far.

311
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:14,720
This is a weird seaman. This feels like a 99% 1% bachelor.

312
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,520
Peculiar. What does this seaman look like to you?

313
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,800
Peculiar. It looks to me like the state of Montana.

314
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,880
I want to do anything other than continue this conversation. So let's go.

315
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,160
Let's go to the money zone.

316
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:44,240
Oh, this is a special one. This is our dear, dear, dear friends,

317
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,040
Lindsey and Devin Pavlis. And I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

318
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,440
Cause they truly are wonderful people. It is a happy one year anniversary,

319
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,760
birthday, and Thanksgiving. It's a triple holiday. And he says, I love you.

320
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:07,120
Triple holiday wife. This is a great value I think he's gotten here.

321
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,520
Cause he is really covering all his bases right now.

322
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,560
You know, the federal government could really learn something from Devin.

323
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,200
Let's stack a few more on there. We're close enough to Christmas,

324
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
I think that we can throw Christmas up in the mix.

325
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,880
Happy Hanukkah.

326
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,360
Happy Hanukkah. Happy Candle Nights.

327
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,640
Happy Candle Nights, everyone.

328
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,160
Happy Candle Nights, everyone. It's coming around the bend so fast.

329
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,040
I'm just, I'm happy that these two people are on the earth.

330
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,880
Me too. They're great people. They make my life a little better.

331
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,840
I'm glad they found each other in this crazy mixed up world.

332
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,560
It's so hard.

333
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,360
So hard to find someone.

334
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,240
Against all odds.

335
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:50,720
Against all odds. So happy birthday. Happy Thanksgiving.

336
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,640
Happy Candle Nights. Happy anniversary.

337
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,160
And just in case anyone was wondering, I've decided that from henceforth,

338
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,600
the one year anniversary is the podcast anniversary.

339
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:01,760
Okay.

340
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,840
Does he get him a podcast?

341
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,520
So everybody make your plan ahead now.

342
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,200
Get your requests in early.

343
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,440
I'm Jesse Thorne. Whether it's music, movies, comedy, books, or whatever,

344
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,120
each week I talk to creative people about how they make their thing.

345
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,560
About the moment when their craft went from a hobby to a career.

346
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,520
And about the thing that surprised them most about the process.

347
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,520
It's The Sound of Young America from MaximumFun.org and PRI.

348
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,280
Public Radio International.

349
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,280
Guys, I have a pressing answer that we need to press.

350
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,080
Okay.

351
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,120
Good.

352
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,000
It's by, oh, I did not read this name.

353
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,320
I'm just going to run right at it.

354
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,240
Mike Skolendulis.

355
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,200
Thanks. Thank you, Mike S.

356
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,320
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Salim, who asks...

357
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,360
Skolendulis sounds like something you chant before a football game.

358
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,400
That's what it's gonna say!

359
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
Skol-go-do-do-do-do-do!

360
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,920
It is by Yahoo Answers user, Salim, who asks...

361
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,160
What are the risks of at-home circumcision?

362
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,720
My girlfriend gets freaked out by my aunt, Peter Wiener.

363
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,440
I am going to police her and get a circumcision, but I don't have health insurance.

364
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,680
I will do it tomorrow after school, but I want to know what the risks are.

365
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,360
He says I will be using alcohol and scissors, but that is so dumb that I can't believe it's true.

366
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,560
Did he say it's so dumb, or did you say it's so dumb?

367
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,720
That was my own editorializing, I apologize.

368
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,120
Okay.

369
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,600
Ed note.

370
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:31,920
Okay.

371
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,560
Ed note.

372
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,880
This guy is fucking out of his mind dumb.

373
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,080
Oh, God, I guess the biggest risk is that he doesn't die from it.

374
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,580
Yeah.

375
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,760
What are the risks?

376
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,200
All of them.

377
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,000
All of the risks.

378
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,440
This is nothing but risks.

379
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,040
Like, the whole thing is a risk.

380
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,480
It's all risk, no reward.

381
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,760
What are you doing?

382
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,560
Don't double down.

383
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,320
It was okay.

384
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,600
I took a huge risk so that I could have a mangled penis.

385
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,100
Yeah.

386
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,840
I mean, unless you did it...

387
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,800
And here you go, sweetie.

388
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,300
I got...

389
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,880
I care about you so much.

390
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,380
I did...

391
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,640
Every night, I was like, I don't want to do it, I don't want to do it, I don't want to do it.

392
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,560
I'm treating you to a poorly crafted turtleneck sweater.

393
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,080
Like, with fraying at the edges.

394
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,600
My poorly sculpted member.

395
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,960
The reward is, if he does it right, you have a clean and healthy penis tip.

396
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,640
No toboggan required.

397
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,180
Yeah.

398
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,040
But...

399
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,000
And that's a great look.

400
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,360
It's a great...

401
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,320
It's totally in this season.

402
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,520
Streamlined.

403
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,960
It's streamlined.

404
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,640
That's really the only thing that's going for it, I guess.

405
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:35,760
Yeah.

406
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,240
You can just...

407
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,120
It makes the tip of your penis look like Joe Pesci's head in Home Alone.

408
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,440
Yeah.

409
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,240
Which is really nice.

410
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,000
Oh my god.

411
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,680
After he gets his head burned by the...

412
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,560
Oh man.

413
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,120
Yeah, I know.

414
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:47,920
Fuck, I can think of...

415
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,160
Oh god, I can think of exactly what you're talking about.

416
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,560
Now I can't...

417
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,000
Time for you to meet the wet bandit.

418
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,320
Oh, it's sticky.

419
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,440
Is it sticky bandit?

420
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,800
It's sticky bandit the first time, then they become the wet bandit.

421
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,760
They become the wet bandit.

422
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,560
Well, they find the right mixture of Vaseline and water.

423
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,060
Fuck.

424
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,320
Downtown.

425
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,360
The risks are actually...

426
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,240
This may surprise...

427
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:10,800
No risk.

428
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,880
Nothing could possibly go wrong.

429
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,000
You have actually...

430
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,360
Yeah, there is actually no...

431
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,840
There are so many risks, you've actually negated the risk.

432
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,720
The risks all cancel each other out.

433
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,920
It's like algebra.

434
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,360
Algebra of dumb.

435
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,640
It's like that scene in the cartoon where somebody goes flying off a ledge and

436
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:35,120
and bounces past the glass factory and over the tack truck and into the pillow canal.

437
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,960
That's what's gonna happen.

438
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,640
What you've set yourself up with right now is a sleepwalking olive oil situation.

439
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,400
Just baby hearing all the way.

440
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,720
You're fine.

441
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,840
It's like a baby...

442
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,200
Basically, it's a baby's day out of dumb shit to do your penis.

443
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,240
Oh god.

444
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,160
It's a penis day out.

445
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,720
You are gonna need...

446
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,400
Hey, Chris Columbus, you're welcome for all these goddamn residuals that slide in today.

447
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,800
Chris Columbus, you make me so sad.

448
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,200
You are going to need the sharpest scissors and all of that.

449
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,360
And the steeliest will.

450
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,600
Yeah.

451
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,800
And steel wool to just get it around.

452
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,840
What you really can't do is get halfway through and give up.

453
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,840
Just looks like a banker's visor down there.

454
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,160
Are you wearing a surgeon's mask?

455
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,040
What's going on?

456
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,880
It's like a bloomin' onion down there.

457
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,520
You got some hanging chad, it looks like.

458
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,920
I got a Pez dispenser for penis.

459
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,720
The only thing it dispenses is...

460
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,240
Is he wearing a fanny pack?

461
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,520
What's going on down there?

462
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,480
Fanny pack, look.

463
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,840
It's cool.

464
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,360
It's like a visor.

465
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,560
It's like a motorcycle helmet.

466
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,360
You just lower it.

467
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,880
No risk.

468
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,280
No risk.

469
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,240
Actually.

470
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,320
To make your shroud of yuck.

471
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,600
I would like to get a follow up on this, though.

472
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,480
Yeah, I'd like to talk to that kid's dad.

473
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,200
It would just be a Yahoo answer that just read, oh no.

474
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,880
There's blood everywhere.

475
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,600
I newly single, got a Joe Pesci penis down there.

476
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,320
And I just went to work and I meet some ladies who are forgiving.

477
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,440
Hey, hey, don't do this thing.

478
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,560
If you're listening, sir, don't do it.

479
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,520
It's good for us, but bad for you.

480
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,120
I honestly don't think it's good for us.

481
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:29,920
I think that like karmically, like from a Zen point of view, this is going to negatively

482
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,200
affect everyone in the world.

483
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,120
This one decision, like a butterfly flapping its wings.

484
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,560
This is a snake eating its own horribly ruined dick.

485
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,720
Get your mouth off of there, snake.

486
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,120
Why is everybody?

487
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,440
Can I?

488
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,120
Are we living?

489
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:55,680
OK, between this and the pizza roll challenge lady, I can't help but wonder, is there some

490
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:02,400
like primal instinct need for adventure that is not being met, that we are somehow trying

491
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,440
to generate danger in our lives?

492
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,640
Like somehow it's overriding common sense to give us the feeling of being threatened.

493
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,840
Like we need it.

494
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,720
This kid is cutting off the tip of his penis to feel alive.

495
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,960
Instead of going like spelunking or whitewater rafting, you ruin your, you ruin, you ruin

496
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,680
your treasure.

497
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,880
You ruin your gift.

498
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,240
That was your gift.

499
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,800
That God gave.

500
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,080
That was your perfect flower.

501
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,920
God gave you that gift to give to a special, your wife.

502
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,200
And you know what you did?

503
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,800
You unwrapped it early.

504
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,640
You unwrapped that gift.

505
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,120
You took the bow off.

506
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,920
Took the bow off.

507
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,760
Took the bow off.

508
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,960
And then stabbed it over and over again.

509
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,080
Now it just looks like those paper caps that you put on turkey legs at Thanksgiving.

510
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,000
Now he's just going to be cold all the time.

511
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,440
I've recently started a new relationship.

512
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,000
Sometimes when I'm chatting with my boyfriend, something that I did with my ex or something

513
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,680
that happened while we were together comes up.

514
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,120
Seems kind of tactless to keep saying me and my ex did this or one time my ex said this.

515
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:14,240
But I feel like I'm being disingenuous if I just say my friend, help me, my bim bam.

516
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,120
Which do I use?

517
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,320
Or do I just avoid these stories altogether and risk never having much to add to the

518
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,640
conversation exed out in England?

519
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,360
Whoa, bummer.

520
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,160
This is, this is, wow, this is like, it's a weird, this could be written by our first

521
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,600
question asker just like later.

522
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,440
I think you might be selling yourself a little short here.

523
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:41,440
I, I, I don't, I don't believe that anybody, regardless of how like into a relationship

524
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:47,760
they've ever been, I don't think anybody only has stories about their ex or why, why

525
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,680
do you like, why do you even have to address it?

526
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,720
There was another person there.

527
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:58,960
Like instead of saying like, Oh, me and chambers went and saw, um, we wouldn't saw men in black

528
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,360
too.

529
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,560
Why can't you just say I, yes, I have seen men in black too.

530
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,520
And it was excellent.

531
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,720
It's another, why can't you just use the dude's name?

532
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,040
Yeah.

533
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,240
Well, I mean, that's that's why can't you just drop it and be like, yeah.

534
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,760
Chombers and I went and saw him.

535
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,640
He's Chombers.

536
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,080
He's going to is a unique.

537
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,560
Yeah.

538
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,360
Yeah.

539
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,280
I mean, but why do you have to say my ex and I, well, that's not it's you're missing

540
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:19,680
the point.

541
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,840
I think it's not that they, the, it's not the terminology is trying to avoid it.

542
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,000
It's the, the existence of chambers.

543
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,080
This dude doesn't even, right.

544
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,560
I see.

545
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,240
How do you broach the subject?

546
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,200
And the answer is you don't.

547
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,520
Yeah, well, there's so many options here.

548
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:33,840
Really.

549
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:39,920
One is I think we've all heard a story that someone has told and then thought, oh, I wish

550
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,040
that happened to me.

551
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,200
And then like six months down the road, you tell that story and it did happen to you that

552
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:45,680
time.

553
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,640
Now it's happening to you.

554
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,880
You just, you just repurpose the story.

555
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,240
Do that, but outsource it to somebody.

556
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,280
You can tell the story.

557
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,960
It's just, it happened to other people.

558
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,400
Oh, I see.

559
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,560
Yeah.

560
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,880
Then you have something to add in a little fiction, double line, basically, double lie.

561
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,480
Super lie to him.

562
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,840
This person you love and trust.

563
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,440
Yeah.

564
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,640
I think that in this circumstance, it's kind of, you gotta, you gotta dip your toe in the

565
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:10,880
water.

566
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,200
And like the first time you mention your ex, just see how your boyfriend reacts.

567
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,880
And maybe he doesn't care.

568
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,760
Like I don't care when Teresa mentions her ex-boyfriend, but she with me now and that's

569
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,480
all that matters.

570
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:22,640
Yeah.

571
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,560
But you're very secure in your relationship.

572
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,120
But if this is an early thing, you guys have been together for a while.

573
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,640
You shouldn't be talking about it at all.

574
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,040
You know?

575
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,680
Yeah, right.

576
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,320
I mean, you talk about it exactly once to get that out of the way.

577
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,960
Like, yeah, I dated this dude.

578
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,760
We live together.

579
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,200
I resuscitated him back to health after his motorcycle crash.

580
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,480
And we proposed to each other under the Parisian night sky.

581
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:49,840
And maybe-

582
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,920
I think you, I think you can go even vaguer and just say, I have dated before.

583
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,200
We spent, we spent one entire day together in Venice.

584
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,160
I met him on the train.

585
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,360
He was a stranger.

586
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,880
We fell deeply, deeply in love.

587
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,440
That's, that is before, before Sunrise, the movie.

588
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,480
That's not what I was thinking.

589
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,280
That's not a real thing.

590
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:10,720
No.

591
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,840
I mean, it is, the movie is real.

592
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,560
The movie is great.

593
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,840
And let me just say delightful.

594
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,760
There's a real great performances by Ethan Hawke.

595
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,040
Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.

596
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,160
Great work, guys.

597
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:20,800
Keep it up.

598
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,040
Yeah.

599
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,360
I wish Ethan Embry had been in it.

600
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,480
I'm trying to bring him back.

601
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,040
Where'd he go?

602
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,960
Where'd he go?

603
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,160
I love that guy.

604
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,440
Can't hardly wait.

605
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:29,840
Great.

606
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,360
Does that one have vampires in it?

607
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,960
Can't hardly wait.

608
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,160
Or before, before Sunrise.

609
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,760
Yeah, it does.

610
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,120
Cause that's, they're both vampires.

611
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,800
They're both vampiric in nature.

612
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,240
So it goes, it goes-

613
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,440
It's, it's Sunrise.

614
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,720
Before Sunrise.

615
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,440
And then the second movie is from Dust Till Dawn.

616
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,880
And then the third one is Twilight.

617
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,040
Yeah.

618
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,120
It's all-

619
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:51,680
Keep it going.

620
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,480
Keep it going, Trav.

621
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,360
You got a Lost Boys, got a Lost Boys goof you can drop on us.

622
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,640
No.

623
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,000
Girlfriend, I think you're missing this goof.

624
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,960
His goof was Times of Deck.

625
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,080
It was Times of Deck.

626
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,360
It was a good, it was a pretty good run.

627
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,840
And we were looking for Times of Day.

628
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,800
What about-

629
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,200
Times of Day.

630
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,560
That was a uniting theme.

631
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,400
Times of Day.

632
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,080
You just, just don't talk about it.

633
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:14,480
No.

634
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,440
Talk about other things.

635
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,200
Tuesdays, Tuesdays with Morrie.

636
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,000
That's, that's not-

637
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,480
What?

638
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:18,960
That's a day.

639
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,080
Talk about Tuesdays with Morrie.

640
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:20,800
It's a day of the week.

641
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,680
I read the best book.

642
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,520
Have you heard of this book?

643
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,800
Didn't they make a movie?

644
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,120
Yeah.

645
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,960
With Owen Wilson and a dog.

646
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,600
Yeah.

647
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,200
Jack Lemmon was in it.

648
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:31,840
Okay.

649
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:35,520
In his final performance as an old man that's dying, which like, I get it, but-

650
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,520
It was a little on the nose.

651
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,640
Little on the nose, Jack.

652
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,880
It was Jack Lemmon, wasn't it?

653
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,560
It was either him or Matthau.

654
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,040
They're really interchangeable, aren't they?

655
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,040
Yeah, at this point.

656
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,360
Yeah.

657
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,280
I bet the two of them are getting into some hijinks up there.

658
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,320
Oh, man.

659
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,440
Do you think they live together?

660
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,440
I would, I would say that, to, you know, get back to X'd out in England-

661
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:55,760
All right.

662
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,840
We're doing an advice show.

663
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,760
Oh yeah, that's right.

664
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:05,360
I, I, you know, if it comes up naturally, I don't think you need to be afraid to drop it.

665
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,640
But if you're feeling uncomfortable doing it, then I don't think you feel the need,

666
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,640
you need to feel the need to bring it up.

667
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,560
You know, make new memories.

668
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,920
Don't feel like you're being disingenuous.

669
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:19,520
Just because it, I do think that like, no matter, no matter how secure somebody is,

670
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,280
they don't want to hear you talk.

671
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,520
They want to think about the fact that you used to be with somebody else,

672
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,480
and they start, they don't want to hear you talking about it enough that

673
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,440
they start to assume that you pine for that life still.

674
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,760
And that may not be, I mean, that's not the most like,

675
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,440
sort of mature reaction to somebody talking about their ex, but it's what we all do.

676
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,800
I mean, it's, it's a very human, human reaction to it, I think.

677
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:39,840
Yeah.

678
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,440
This year is my first post-college Thanksgiving.

679
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,320
Now that I'm in my own household, I'd like to bring a dish to the meal.

680
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,960
However, all the traditional Thanksgiving sides and dessert are already taken.

681
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,000
I don't drink wine, and there's already going to be a few bottles,

682
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,040
so that's not a great option either.

683
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,800
What should I bring to Thanksgiving dinner, stumped over stuffing?

684
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,720
Your own, your smile.

685
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,680
Bring your smile.

686
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,080
I don't think that all the traditional things are taken.

687
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,120
I think, I mean, they may be, the traditional things may be taken,

688
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,080
but that doesn't mean you can't still knock it out of the park

689
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:22,000
with a great dessert that people are just going to love.

690
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,240
And I'm also going to point out, I've never made an entire traditional Thanksgiving meal,

691
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,280
but I'm willing to bet that if you called the host or hostess and said,

692
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,480
hey, I'd like to make something, they're more than happy.

693
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,280
Oh sure, yeah.

694
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,320
Shovel something off onto you.

695
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,600
You know what I'm saying.

696
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,440
Do you know my, do you know my power play?

697
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:38,720
What's your power play?

698
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,440
Bring a turkey.

699
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,920
Small turkey?

700
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,880
No, fuck that, a bigger turkey, a big buttery.

701
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,920
Bring some turducken.

702
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,560
Kill it.

703
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,640
Kill their turkey with your turkey.

704
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,800
Get a Texas-sized raptor turkey.

705
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,640
They will never know it hit them because they will be lacerated by its claws and gobbler.

706
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,960
So just bring a live turkey.

707
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,800
I have two classic dessert options that I tend to go towards.

708
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,720
Ritz torte.

709
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,200
Nice.

710
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,000
Bring a Ritz torte and people are just going to lose their minds over that.

711
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,520
Or make chess bars, holiday favorite chess bars.

712
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,640
Go get, our friends Dave and Alexander have a show called the DNA Foodcast and they did

713
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,120
our mom's recipe for chess bars last week, I think.

714
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:26,160
And that's like a, you bring that and it's just going to be the talk of the party.

715
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,000
You know what's always a fan favorite?

716
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,280
What's that?

717
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:29,840
Cheesecake.

718
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,480
It's not hard to make.

719
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,040
It's a little.

720
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:38,080
And there's a rocking like pumpkin cheesecake that you can make.

721
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,280
It's absolutely delicious.

722
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,520
Can you bring a novelty erotic cake?

723
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,280
Yeah.

724
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:43,840
Thanksgiving.

725
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,960
Yeah, I think so.

726
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,960
Oh, like, so like a turkey with a big boner.

727
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,720
Big old boner turkey.

728
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,760
It's like how kids used to make like the hand print turkeys only with a boner.

729
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,400
And if you can somehow make this turkey speak and by which I mean, I don't mean a smaller

730
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,120
speech bubble cake, but a literal, like some sort of voice recording, like they put in

731
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,480
those gift cards where he's saying like, gobble, gobble.

732
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,600
And he's like pointing to.

733
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,240
Gobble it up.

734
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,800
He's like pointing to his turkey boner and he's like pointing to it and saying that gobble.

735
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,720
Like, have it.

736
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,840
I guarantee you don't have to worry about anybody else having already made.

737
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,760
Yeah, because they will have left the party.

738
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,960
We had we had someone ask us on Twitter a couple of weeks ago, one of our dear, dear

739
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:30,080
listeners saying, can you guys just for one episode cheese it with the dick talk so I

740
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,840
can play this show for my family?

741
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,000
And and the answer is no.

742
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,120
The answer is no.

743
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,240
It's definitive.

744
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,960
No fish got to swim and birds got to fly.

745
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,560
And we got to talk about those birds have big old boners because that boat is going

746
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,280
to weigh it down.

747
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,880
Yeah.

748
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,200
Hey, hey, here's here's why don't you bring an empty stomach and a big and a big.

749
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,120
Oh, bring your own Tupperware.

750
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,400
I love it left over.

751
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,000
I'm going to help you dispose of all this extra food.

752
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,800
But you know what?

753
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,280
Speaking as somebody who's been in that situation before, I would appreciate some wouldn't you

754
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,600
Tupperware that way you don't have to worry about losing your Tupperware and you avoid

755
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,040
the like, make sure I get this back, you know, kind of moment.

756
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,080
It's like, oh, thanks.

757
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,680
Now, don't just bring like a plastic grocery bag and scoop it in.

758
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,720
I'll take three spoonfuls of everything.

759
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,360
Hey, check this out.

760
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,240
What do you guys think of this?

761
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,040
This this move?

762
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,240
Well, buy some cigars for the boys.

763
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:29,600
Yeah.

764
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,240
Hey, hey, the boys.

765
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,720
I brought some cigars.

766
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,520
Let's real nice.

767
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,000
Let's go watch and some weed for the ladies.

768
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,120
Ladies, we're going to watch.

769
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,560
Ladies, I got you some weed.

770
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:46,080
We're going to watch a football contest and smoke these stogies.

771
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,920
You guys bake and bake.

772
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,000
That turkey is going to taste especially awesome.

773
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,200
This is the most awesome Thanksgiving ever.

774
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,040
Why don't you go get there really early and tell him you brought your kitchen wisdom and

775
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,960
then just say a bunch of folksy things as they're cooking to try them into doing a better job.

776
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,600
I brought a stern hand and a judging eye.

777
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,240
I brought an egg timer to make sure you don't mess anything up.

778
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,200
Just bring a vacuum and an apron and be like, I'm here to clean up afterwards.

779
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,000
I brought Sally Fields from fried green tomatoes.

780
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,320
She is here to dispense all of her kitchen wisdom to you.

781
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,960
I brought my own pillows for when I take a nap on your carpet.

782
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,840
This is my Nana.

783
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,240
I made her come to cook for you.

784
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,080
She's got so much weed on her.

785
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,840
Shake my Nana and the weed falls out.

786
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,120
Nana baked face we call her.

787
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:49,280
Hey, you know, if you're going to cook a turkey this year, let me tell you what you do.

788
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:58,160
You make bacon the morning before and then you take the grease after you cook the bacon

789
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,240
and then you pour it into a cup and you put the cup in the fridge.

790
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,840
And then when you go to cook the turkey, you drink that.

791
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:11,360
You cut slivers of the solidified bacon fat off and put it underneath the skin

792
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,080
and then just throw some in the middle there.

793
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:18,000
I know that's great because then the next day when you have leftover sandwiches,

794
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,120
you just keep putting slivers of bacon grease on them until you die.

795
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,360
Travis, do you just have a constantly regenerating supply of bacon grease?

796
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:34,560
Yes, I have nine mason jars full of bacon grease and they're labeled Monday, Wednesday, Friday,

797
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:39,680
special occasions, birthday, and then one that's kind of really old that just says the end.

798
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,840
Do you realize that the way you talk on this show makes you sound like the fat Unabomber, right?

799
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,680
Some of the things you say makes you sound like the fat Unabomber.

800
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,120
I'm actually very in shape, very healthy.

801
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:55,520
I'm saying you're trim but your mouth words make you sound like the fat Unabomber.

802
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:05,040
I live my life like a Roman and that's my goal is to one day have a functioning vomitorium

803
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,480
but for the time being, yes, don't eat bacon grease.

804
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,320
If you eat bacon grease, then your whole house is a vomitorium.

805
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:20,480
Is it sad that the other day I just bought myself a happy birthday ice cream cake for no reason?

806
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,920
You bet. You bet it is.

807
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,720
You got it right.

808
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,280
Okay, that's a problem.

809
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,120
Hey, Grif, do you have a Yahoo to cheer me up?

810
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:25,620
Sure.

811
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,640
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

812
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,880
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Way, who asks,

813
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:37,600
why are you girls so damn mean when it comes to size and don't give me that love crap?

814
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:40,880
Okay, this-

815
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,360
What?

816
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:46,480
Okay, this girl told me that if a guy doesn't at least have a six inch penis erected,

817
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,320
sorry about the dick talk, dad,

818
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,480
then he better not have sex or show a girl his penis or they will laugh at him.

819
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,360
I'm an 18 year old guy, fully through puberty,

820
00:53:55,360 --> 00:54:01,440
and I have a 5.1 to 5.5 inch ranging on good and bad days, but that's-

821
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,400
Depending on the weather.

822
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,800
That's usually where I am, so I'm really nervous.

823
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,840
Also, it's not just this one girl, it's a lot of girls who say this.

824
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,440
Well, step one, stop asking girls if they like your dick.

825
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,520
Here's the thing.

826
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:15,520
What?

827
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:20,080
Isn't that- the human race has been propagating itself that way for thousands of years.

828
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,560
Don't look. Just don't look.

829
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,560
Also, you did not hear the latest census data.

830
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:31,280
The average has actually gone down a little bit to 5.8 inches, so-

831
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:31,840
Yeah.

832
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,320
You're-

833
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,360
Slightly below average.

834
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,520
You're a little bit closer on your good days.

835
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,600
You're heavier than I am.

836
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,400
You're heavy flow days.

837
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,120
Hey, how's your day?

838
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:41,920
Go on.

839
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,480
Not great.

840
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,000
How good hanging?

841
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,000
About 0.4 inches.

842
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,720
Fully erect.

843
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,320
Fully erected.

844
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,680
That is a lot of-

845
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,240
Variation.

846
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,360
That's a very specific measurement.

847
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,840
On the good day, he still had the tip.

848
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,800
On the bad day.

849
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:07,280
I get myself a circumcision using alcohol and scissors, so now all my days are bad.

850
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,520
But that one particular day was the worst.

851
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,280
They haven't gotten much better.

852
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,120
Ladies, don't give me that love crap.

853
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,360
Wait, why is there-

854
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:21,920
Why are you all such size queens?

855
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,360
I don't know why that's a test.

856
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:23,840
We just-

857
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,320
Can we just be cool for a second about dick sizes?

858
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,080
Can we just chill out about it?

859
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:36,640
Like, if one guy's arms are shorter than another guy's arms,

860
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,800
you don't go, hey pussy.

861
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,320
I don't see why a dick has to be any different.

862
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,440
To be fair though, I do judge a girl on the size of her vagina.

863
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,240
God.

864
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:48,800
Come on.

865
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,080
Come on.

866
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,280
Wait.

867
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:54,960
Width or depth?

868
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:56,560
Come on.

869
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,040
Come on.

870
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,760
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

871
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,400
First, few little housekeeping notes.

872
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:10,960
We have a new t-shirt at maxfundstore.com, so you can go pick that up and still get the

873
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,000
blue MBMBAM adventure shirt.

874
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:22,720
Got a Twitter feed, it's at MBMBAM.

875
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:27,120
Follow that to find out when the show is out.

876
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:31,680
It's your- we post there just as soon as it goes live.

877
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,560
Thank you to people who are tweeting about the show.

878
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:45,360
Scratty Bones, Dan UNG, Alex Sphere, HooliganD89, Rilla Wida, Seekil Gore, Gaddy James, Jack

879
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,880
Diggy, Synergy.

880
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,560
A lot of people were a little upset that Griffin was so mean about metal music.

881
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,320
I apologize.

882
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,520
Some people really turned me on to some good stuff.

883
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,080
Like-

884
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:58,640
Really?

885
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,760
Yeah, like Hate Blood.

886
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,160
Pretty good.

887
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,240
Devil Puke.

888
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,520
Devil Puke is really is great.

889
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,720
And of course, Rose Zephyr.

890
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,200
Lots of fun people are out there talking about the show.

891
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,960
Use MBMBAM hashtag to talk about it.

892
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,280
And happy birthday, anniversary, and Thanksgiving to Lindsay from Davin.

893
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,640
Yeah.

894
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,280
What?

895
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:27,920
I want-

896
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,720
Yeah, cut that out.

897
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:29,920
Yeah, cut that out.

898
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,720
What are you doing?

899
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,440
I don't know.

900
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:39,520
I want to thank Genesis Today for endorsing our program after I in turn endorsed their

901
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:46,000
delicious and nutritious immunity boosting super fruit gummies available in your Walgreens.

902
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,360
You get, guys, you get 50 for $10.49. How's your health?

903
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,320
It's pretty good.

904
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,640
$200 will get you on the Jumbotron.

905
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,720
Full disclosure, we are getting a whole suite of Genesis Today products for that.

906
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,400
I said, they said, do you want this?

907
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,400
And I said, for Christ's sake, yes, yes, I need to keep Travis alive.

908
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,680
He needs to live.

909
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,320
We have, okay, real quick stuff.

910
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,880
We will not be doing a show next week.

911
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,440
We're going to spend some time with our families and we're all going to be traveling and Thanksgiving,

912
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,360
and you don't really need us anyway.

913
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,160
You should enjoy the love and bosom of your family.

914
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,440
Get your shopping started.

915
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:37,360
If you want to get a personal ad, like Davin was kind of up to do for Lindsay, go to maximumfun.org

916
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,560
forward slash Jumbotron.

917
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:42,240
While you're there, why not check out all of the great MaxFun products.

918
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,080
All of the great MaxFun programming.

919
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,120
Stop podcasting yourself.

920
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,320
Judge John Hodgman, Sonny Young America, Jordan, Jesse go.

921
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,120
So much good stuff.

922
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,320
Two things.

923
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,200
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Windage for the use of their song.

924
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,720
It's a departure off the album.

925
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:00,080
Putting the days to bed, uh, as, as the theme song, it's our theme song, right?

926
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:00,880
The beginning of the show.

927
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,800
And it's so great and buy their albums.

928
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,440
And thank you.

929
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,120
Second thing we have a location for our live show in Austin, Texas, and tickets are going

930
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:14,080
to go on sale, um, sometime this week, um, probably near the middle of the week.

931
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:14,880
So keep an eye out.

932
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,920
We'll announce it on Twitter.

933
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,000
Um, uh, so it's not a huge venue.

934
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,520
So those tickets are going to go fast.

935
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,480
The blue theater.

936
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,480
If you live in Austin, that's where it is.

937
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:29,440
Uh, we'll probably go someplace after the show and get drinks and, uh, yeah, come on

938
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:29,600
out.

939
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,400
Cause it's going to be, it's going to be a real fun time.

940
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,520
Um, but keep an eye on that.

941
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,720
Where is that again, Griffin?

942
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,240
So people can start making plans.

943
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:42,880
It's on East Austin, right off airport Google map at Google map at you.

944
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:43,600
Lazy fucks.

945
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,000
What day are we planning on Sunday?

946
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,640
December the 11th is the day of the show.

947
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,920
We're going to put tickets on sale.

948
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,120
We have to do that.

949
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:54,480
We'll simultaneously put the link up on Twitter and our Facebook.

950
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,640
So, and on the, but it is a, it is not a big venue.

951
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:05,680
So, uh, uh, you want to act fast to get those tickets and, uh, God, I'm so fucking excited.

952
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,800
I can't wait to see everyone.

953
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,360
Uh, yeah, that's all.

954
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,480
That's all on my end.

955
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,920
Oh, it's also Movember.

956
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,880
I, uh, we would appreciate your Movember donations.

957
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:20,480
You can just go to us.movember.com and search for either Justin or I, uh, we're both participating.

958
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,600
I'm growing a mustache.

959
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,600
Mine looks pretty fucking dope.

960
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,040
Yeah.

961
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:31,360
Except for the part where you look like you are, are you about to talk smack about my mustache

962
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:38,320
because I still haven't seen yours while I'm saving it up in a jar in the jar.

963
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:43,680
We keep our mustaches until the live show and then I will shave to a mustache for the

964
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,160
live show.

965
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,200
Keep my mustache for live show.

966
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,960
Justin need a firm commitment.

967
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,360
I will be divorced.

968
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,840
I will be a single man with a mustache.

969
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:55,760
I keep it one moment longer than 1201 December 1st.

970
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,080

Uh, you can track down Dan Savage, but let's be honest.
