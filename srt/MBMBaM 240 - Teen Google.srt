1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,080
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,680
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,960
I'm your babiest brother, Griffin McElroy. Whoa, seven hours now. Seven hours straight

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:08,240
with nine quick time windows going simultaneously. It's Oscar watch 2015.

9
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,880
All movie watch is what it is.

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,960
We realized that it was time for Oscar watch, but we realized that we haven't watched

11
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,000
any of the Oscar contenders, so I'm simultaneously watching all of them.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,840
I have duct taped together 45 mini televisions. I'm watching them all at the same time,

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,280
but it's starting to bleed together. JK Simmons just showed up in Selma.

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,000
Stephen Hawking and Alan Turing are fighting it out. I'm losing my mind.

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,640
Here's what worries me. I want to watch Eddie Redmayne's performance. I want to watch that

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,840
man do his acting and do it right. I want to watch Bimba Ditch Cumberbatch. I want to watch

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,000
Bimba Ditch Cumberbatch do his acting on the screen. Here's the problem. I can't look away

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,720
from Gone Girl because if I look away from Gone Girl, I might not see Ben Affleck's penis tip

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,560
side, the side of his penis tip. You got that going for you. That was my longest run on sentence

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,960
in my Bim Bam history, and I've had some goddamn long ones. You just got the Oscar.

21
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,000
It just happened. I fucking stopped for like a second to record the intro to this podcast,

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,240
and I missed the goddamn side of his penis tip. It's like that flower in the Dennis the Menace

23
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:23,600
movie. Remember? Yeah. It's just like Ben Affleck's penis. You remember when Mr. Wilson was waiting

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,000
to see the flower? Remember? Yeah. Well, I've got that one queued up, but the window's a little

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,360
bit smaller because I had to prioritize my movie windows, and Gone Girl got, let's call it, the

26
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,840
star treatment. I think this year they're giving the lifetime achievement award to the Dennis the

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:47,440
Menace movie. Yeah. Movies. There's several. The film series. Yeah. I feel like we're crazy behind

28
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,360
on all of our Oscar contenders. Well, yeah. The only one that I really saw was Selma,

29
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,760
and then they just went ahead and just didn't nominate that for a goddamn thing.

30
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,600
Yeah. And you thought you were getting out in front of it, right? I thought I was getting out.

31
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,040
Everybody was like, yeah, I see that movie. It'll wreck your shit, and it's going to win

32
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,160
all the Oscars. You're going to be like, told you so at the parties, because that's the only reason

33
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,040
anybody goes to these fucking things. That's the only reason people see movies. Right. I would

34
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,360
rather go out, and I'd rather watch a Nicholas Cage film, for instance. You know that's not

35
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,760
going to get nominated, but you got to watch a Nicholas Cage film every month just to get your

36
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,200
mind right. I would much rather be doing that. Instead, I got to go watch the goddamn imitation

37
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,960
games. But I do love, thank you, Oscars, for throwing in random curveballs like, oh yeah,

38
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,440
you can watch Selma, you can watch Theory of Everything. Also, X-Men Days of Future

39
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,480
Passes up in there. And you're like, what? Oh, you're so cool, Oscars. I thought it was nice

40
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,720
that they gave a future Oscar to Paul Blart, too. Yeah. Just Oscar for next year, Paul Blart.

41
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,880
Next year Oscar, they have a most promising category. It's made out of just popsicle

42
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,160
sticks and paste, and it just says, you wanted the best Oscars. It's most improved.

43
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:09,200
Most improved Blart. Blartiest Picture 2015. Best Blart sequel.

44
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,640
Best Blart editing. I thought it was a little contentious when they gave that award to Hitch

45
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:25,200
in 2008. That was Best Blart prequel. Welcome to the Osc Blarts, where we honor achievements

46
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:33,920
in Blart-related filmmaking. The Oscar for Blart design went to someone in an earlier procedure.

47
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,160
I looked into the soul of Blart, and I thought, how can I perfect him?

48
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,600
I just want to thank my Blart and my two Blarts. I couldn't have done this without my Blart. You

49
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,200
know who you are. The original costume design for Blart included long pants,

50
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,200
and I said it would be funnier if they were shorts. I'm Werner Herzog.

51
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:05,280
Right. Yeah. Again, he got shafted. Did you notice that Paul Blart didn't get any

52
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,200
Oscar nominations again this year? Not even Best Sound Editing.

53
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,840
They couldn't not give one to the dude who played Martin Luther King in Selma. Hi,

54
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,760
the hardest film role in the history of celluloid. Couldn't not nominate him, but also

55
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,800
nominate Kevin James. They can't do that because we would burn the whole world down if that happened.

56
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,000
He was out to play Martin Luther King and lost it at the last second.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Because he couldn't get out of the Blart 2 contract.

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,800
This is my brother and my brother May. As we said, it's an advice show.

59
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:47,920
We take your questions, turn them alchemy-like into wisdom. We are not experts per se,

60
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,360
but you know, we do our best and we try to have a little fun along the way.

61
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:59,360
I recently started working in a movie theater. How many is too many cardboard standees to take

62
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,320
home and display in my house? Now, this is a fun question because think about it.

63
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:14,320
There is, if you have one, that's funny. That's unique. Where did you get this standup of the

64
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:22,480
rock from the rundown? Well, I used to work in a movie theater. Cool. If you have 1,000 in your

65
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,000
home and people walk in, it looks like a shitty Madame Tussauds.

66
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,440
And it looks like that scene in Home Alone, where Kevin McAllister is trying to make the

67
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,720
Wet Bandits think that there's a huge party going on.

68
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,160
Except you glued the face of your ex-girlfriend onto all of them.

69
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,520
Onto all of them. Onto Rock's beautiful body. There's definitely a problem there if you have

70
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,320
1,000. So somewhere between a 1 and a 1,000, there's a number. I think it's 2.

71
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,440
If you have 2, you may as well have 1,000.

72
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,760
But if you have 1, aren't you afraid of it looking like you're just a bit,

73
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:07,600
like you got to be really picky about that one or else it looks like you're like a huge fan of

74
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,560
fill-in-the-blank shitty movie, you know what I mean?

75
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,680
Where it's like, oh, you took home a standup from Journey to the Center of the Earth to

76
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,320
the Fantastical Island or whatever it's called. It's like, oh, did you like that movie?

77
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,840
And it's like, no, it was just funny because it was just the last one I grabbed.

78
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,680
I do like Brendan Fraser.

79
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,320
He's not in that movie, sadly.

80
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,640
The Rock, Dwayne Johnson replaces Brendan Fraser, bringing that Dwayne Johnson heat.

81
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,120
Man, The Rock really stepped in for Brendan Fraser in quite a few films, huh?

82
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,280
Now that I think about it, between Journey 2 and The Scorpion King.

83
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,480
For a while, Brendan Fraser was his stunt double and then they switched and they just take turns.

84
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:58,240
They look so similar. They both clap and laugh like children seeing a rainbow.

85
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,280
For the first time.

86
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,520
I would argue that if you had a thousand, it's almost okay if you do it like this is my collect-

87
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,440
like this, you know, some people have like matchbooks from places they've been.

88
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,960
Some people have shot glasses. I collect weird cardboard standups.

89
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,080
My family. Let's just call it what it is, my family.

90
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,440
This is my cardboard family.

91
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,200
I remember at the movie theater that I worked at and Travis worked at for a while,

92
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,040
our manager who took no guff. I will say that about her.

93
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,600
If you had any guff, she would not receive it.

94
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,680
She would not sign for it.

95
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,040
She would not allow it.

96
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,000
She wouldn't let people take those standees home because there were so many people working there.

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,920
Everyone wanted that Journey 2 standee.

98
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,080
So she would just destroy them.

99
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,040
And it was very, it was very, very King Solomon.

100
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,960
It was a very wisdom of Solomon decision.

101
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,400
Like nobody can have The Rock.

102
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,520
You must destroy The Rock.

103
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,960
And it's like, I don't want to destroy The Rock.

104
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,280
And then she'd be like, then you get to keep them.

105
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,520
Then she wouldn't say that you stare her in the eye the entire time

106
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,520
that she was burning them to the ground.

107
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,920
Sometimes if you go to the movies late, you see people leaving with a giant bag of popcorn.

108
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,040
Oh, that was my jam.

109
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,000
I lived around the corner in the West Virginia building.

110
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,720
I lived around the corner from the movie theater I worked at.

111
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,200
And I would take home a giant garbage bag.

112
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,920
Let's call it what it is.

113
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,320
Cause it was a garbage bag that we'd fill with all the popcorn.

114
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,920
I feel like I've talked about this on this show before.

115
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,760
It's very contextual, isn't it?

116
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,400
Like if you take that bag, does it choose your adventure?

117
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,160
If you take that bag to the trash, it was a trash bag the whole time.

118
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,000
You were throwing away all popcorn.

119
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,160
If you take that to your apartment, you're suddenly a popcorn Santa Claus.

120
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,400
Right.

121
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,360
And I very much was.

122
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,760
Yeah, it was a conveyance.

123
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,720
It was not a trash bag.

124
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,320
We would find fun ways to elevate the flavor of our garbage corn.

125
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,760
Like splooching out an entire bottle of Nutella in there, shaking it all up.

126
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,520
And all of a sudden you've got a fun cocoa mess.

127
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,200
Oh, by the way, we were also a super duper, super duper, duper, triple mega, super duper high.

128
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,480
It's also great because it doubles as a snack bag and also a bean bag.

129
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,520
A bean bag.

130
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,800
You eat your chocolate mess out from under between your legs.

131
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,720
But it's not an issue.

132
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,520
You're on the ground.

133
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,720
You ate too much.

134
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,840
Why are you so high?

135
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,560
Holy shit.

136
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,440
You're failing college.

137
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,360
You lost two scholarships, Griffin.

138
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,880
Past Griffin.

139
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,760
Two of them.

140
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,360
You don't need either of those scholarships, huh?

141
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,920
Okay.

142
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,720
Enjoy yourself.

143
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,800
When you worked at Blockbuster, you would get to like take home posters, right?

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,920
I mean, I wouldn't, but I could.

145
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,280
Among other things.

146
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,680
Yeah, among other items.

147
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,320
At all.

148
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,760
How many posters would you say it's okay?

149
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,360
Because I think they take up less room.

150
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,040
You could hypothetically put them on walls.

151
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,400
Like, are posters a better alternative to cardboard standups?

152
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,640
I mean, spatially speaking, in the spatial like material.

153
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,960
Yeah, that's like in the third dimension.

154
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,240
That's like how space works.

155
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,400
Yeah, I think that they're there.

156
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,960
But then it's like that whole thing.

157
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,640
No one's ever, the problem with posters is no one's ever actually hung up a poster.

158
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,520
Every poster in the world is just rolled up with a rubber band around it, leaning against a wall.

159
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,120
With a poster that says to do.

160
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,480
To do.

161
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,760
To hang this up.

162
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,440
And you look at it every day for years, in my case, for some posters.

163
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,520
I'm gonna put that up as a pet detective.

164
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,000
Someday.

165
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,480
Someday.

166
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,560
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

167
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,600
Of course.

168
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,120
This Yahoo was sent in by Andrea Ortu.

169
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,760
Thank you.

170
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,400
Ooh.

171
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,960
No, it's just one in, it's O-R-T-U is the last name.

172
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,600
I realized saying that out loud, phonetically.

173
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
One or two Andreas sent this in.

174
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,360
Thank you, Andrea.

175
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,440
It's the suspended user.

176
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,040
They don't exist anymore.

177
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,600
They died.

178
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,200
Oh no.

179
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,360
This dead person asked, should they include animals in the Academy Awards?

180
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:47,680
Ooh.

181
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,160
Why aren't they nominating dogs, cats, birds, or horses actors that have been in movies?

182
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,880
I think they should add animals in the Academy Award.

183
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,600
I know some that act better than some of these so-called human actors.

184
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:10,800
So wait, by so-called human actors, is the shitty quotation marks there going,

185
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,200
is the sark mark going on actors or human?

186
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,520
Human.

187
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,280
This supposedly human Bradley Cooper.

188
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,480
Ugh, Salarian.

189
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,840
Can I tell you, Griffin?

190
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,400
Yep.

191
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,320
I kinda see where they're coming from.

192
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,960
Yeah, for sure.

193
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,160
Okay.

194
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,800
I wasn't sure where we were all gonna land on that.

195
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,400
No, I think absolutely.

196
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,000
The best performance I saw in 1993 wasn't Shawshank, wasn't Shawshank.

197
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,240
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,760
There are a lot of good performances in there.

199
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,920
Nothing quite as great as Dunstan.

200
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,440
Well, I'm sorry.

201
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,480
We give them to animated and they're not even real.

202
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,760
And they're not even real.

203
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah.

204
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,880
And a lot of those animated feature films feature exclusively animals.

205
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,120
Yeah.

206
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,920
Like Cat Story.

207
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,120
The Chihuahua from Beverly Hills Chihuahua died to bring you that movie.

208
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,200
Separate Chihuahuas.

209
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,280
They sneak that in in the closing credits very quickly where it's like,

210
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,120
oh, like three or four Chihuahuas died making this.

211
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,440
Sorry.

212
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,280
George Lopez has to strangle a Chihuahua just to get it going in the morning.

213
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,680
Really looking forward to getting that Oscar to make it all worth it.

214
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,000
Right.

215
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,480
What's that?

216
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,200
The In Memoriam section, if they allowed animals in,

217
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,840
the In Memoriam section of the Oscars,

218
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,080
any year that a Beverly Hills Chihuahua movie came out,

219
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,560
would be extremely, extremely long.

220
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,680
It would be Mr.

221
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,040
Snuggleworth died, of course, at the hands of George Lopez.

222
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,360
This is really Chihuahua heavy again.

223
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,760
Yeah.

224
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,680
Well, we got-

225
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
After a while, they don't even give them names.

226
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:39,920
No.

227
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,640
It's just like CH1734.

228
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,840
This Chihuahua is bred specifically to be killed.

229
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,960
Go to YGeorgeY.

230
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,760
Until the Chihuahua like Messiah appears and he's finally able to

231
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,800
stop George Lopez.

232
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,480
George Lopez, let my people go from the net.

233
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,520
Because you're choking them.

234
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,360
You're choking them to death.

235
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,320
George G.

236
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,160
Lo, stop it.

237
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,800
I'm just saying, I think it was, yeah, in Cincinnati,

238
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,960
the local theater awards started giving out awards for best

239
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,480
animal performance in a year.

240
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,560
And it was a hotly contested category.

241
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,800
I'm saying there was a lot of heat being brought to it.

242
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,560
My boy Mignon at Cincinnati Shakespeare Company took it and

243
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,360
he deserved it.

244
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,800
And I don't care what the haters say.

245
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,160
What type of animal is that?

246
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,720
He was a little poodle and he was adorable.

247
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,200
Okay.

248
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,000
He was a solid actor with really great comic timing.

249
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,400
Let's talk about the issues though that are going to pop up

250
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,080
from Animal Academy Awards.

251
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,400
Any year with a Dunstan in it or a monkey trouble or any which

252
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,080
way but loose, I think a monkey is going to just like fucking

253
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,120
run the table.

254
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,160
A monkey is the biopic of animals.

255
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,800
Where it's like, oh, it's going to be so much easier to vote

256
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,160
for that because it's a real person.

257
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,240
Just like it's so much easier to vote for a monkey because

258
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,760
I'm saying, right.

259
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,960
They make a heart rending biopic of like, right?

260
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,320
And it's incredible.

261
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:04,880
It's really good.

262
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Bimba to Cumberbatch will probably be up in that one too.

263
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,600
But then they make Dunstan checks in again.

264
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,880
And I think Dunstan continues to check in.

265
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,040
Right.

266
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,400
I'm saying any time there's a monkey in the mix.

267
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,280
Duncan has a credit card trouble and has to check in again.

268
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,680
Right.

269
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,120
It's going to be Air Bud 19.

270
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,360
Okay.

271
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,400
Yeah, it would have been a serious contender if it hadn't

272
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,440
been for Dunstan won't stop checking into this goddamn

273
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:27,840
hotel.

274
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,480
Please ask Dunstan to start checking in.

275
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,040
Starring a bedraggled Jason Alexander.

276
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,560
He's honestly just glad for the work.

277
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:36,880
Right.

278
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,520
Now, what if he can say he wants something he can put on his

279
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,600
CV where he says he was in an Oscar award winning film.

280
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,320
Thanks, Dunstan.

281
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,600
Now, what if you did like an all puppy godfather?

282
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,440
Is that too pandering?

283
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,240
It would be great.

284
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,120
Except the lawyer or whatever is going to be played by a

285
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,760
monkey, of course.

286
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,600
And he's going to steal the spotlight.

287
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,120
I'm saying it's going to be unfair.

288
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,720
We would almost need a best monkey acting category and then

289
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,240
best all other animals.

290
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,600
I will say if there could be a scene of a monkey lawyer giving

291
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,560
advice to a puppy mobster, they might as well just have all

292
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,280
the Oscars.

293
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,360
Yeah, just take them all.

294
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,800
Have all the Oscars.

295
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,200
His George Clooney's Lifetime Achievement Award, whatever.

296
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,840
Sandwich between two monkey awards.

297
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,640
Yeah, that's the Oscar sandwich.

298
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,880
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

299
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,200
Yes.

300
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,840
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

301
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,560
Are you Ira Ray?

302
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,440
Who wants to know?

303
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,800
Thank you, Ira Ray.

304
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,240
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

305
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,280
They were suspended too.

306
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,840
Jesus Christ.

307
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,960
There was a great culling of the Yahoo Answers user base.

308
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,480
Is Nickelodeon named after Nick Cannon?

309
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,520
Settling a bet here.

310
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,560
That's a cool bet.

311
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,120
Just a question to settle a bet between an idiot and an

312
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,080
intelligent person.

313
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,760
Which one are you?

314
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,400
Before I collect my cash, I just wanted to post this question

315
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,880
so the loser realizes how idiotic he looks.

316
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,200
Thanks.

317
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,640
And first round's on me.

318
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,120
Update.

319
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,480
Easiest money ever made.

320
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,360
So I guess they're saying they were on the non Nick Cannon

321
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,640
creationist belief set.

322
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,600
Now hold on.

323
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,080
I think we've all been in a position where we've drank a

324
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,280
little bit too much.

325
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,480
We said a thing and then someone called us on it and we

326
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,640
just instead of going, oh yeah, you're right.

327
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,520
I'm an idiot.

328
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,320
We just like dug our teeth in and we're like, no, you know

329
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:30,880
what?

330
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,440
This is the battleground I choose for the evening.

331
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,600
So I think this is actually going to make this question in

332
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,080
the discussion around a lot more interesting is not a lot

333
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,720
of people know this.

334
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,040
Nick Cannon is not his actual name because that's like a

335
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,920
crazy name.

336
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,720
His real actual Christian name is Nick Cannon Lodeon.

337
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,680
I'm not even sure that's true.

338
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,840
It's I'm looking at his IMDB page right now and it's Nick

339
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,640
Cannon Lodeon.

340
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,280
And when him and Mariah Carey together, it was Mariah Carey

341
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,000
Cannon Lodeon.

342
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,480
So Nickelodeon was founded.

343
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:02,800
What?

344
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,440
And like 1983.

345
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,480
Did you just look that up?

346
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,680
No, I would say maybe late eighties.

347
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,040
Okay.

348
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,000
That's incorrect.

349
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,120
Can I say you guys, if before you guys said 83, I would have

350
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,560
guessed so much earlier.

351
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,600
Just not thinking about it.

352
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,160
Just thinking like TV stations have been around for a while.

353
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,960
I don't know.

354
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,040
71, 62.

355
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,640
You could have told me any of these and I would have

356
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,200
believed it.

357
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,240
Okay.

358
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,720
79.

359
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,600
Jesus Christ.

360
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,400
Really?

361
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,520
As Nickelodeon.

362
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,880
And originally the network was called Pinwheel and it launched

363
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,520
in 77.

364
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,240
And then Nick Cannon Lodeon came around and they're like, hey,

365
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,280
that's a cool name.

366
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,120
Let's call our station Nick Cannon Lodeon.

367
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,560
And somebody was like, you know what that sounds like?

368
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,040
Doesn't sound like anything.

369
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,880
It's a crazy, crazy name.

370
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:55,760
Is it possible that they foresaw the coming of the once in

371
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,600
future King Nick Cannon Lodeon?

372
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,440
There will be born unto us.

373
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,840
There will be much wilden out.

374
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,280
What would you do when Nick Cannon Lodeon comes?

375
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,720
I have glanced into the obsidian sphere and a vision has

376
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,200
come to me of so much wilden.

377
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,880
The anti Nick Cannon Lodeon will say you can't do that on

378
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,520
television.

379
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,680
You must not wild.

380
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,640
Wilding is prohibited.

381
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:24,960
Sorry.

382
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,520
Wilden.

383
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,440
And we will welcome all the wild crazy kids to our bosom.

384
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,560
Holy shit.

385
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,160
It goes so deep.

386
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,720
Brothers and sisters climb that radical rock.

387
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,400
Guided by the Cannon Lodeon and his brilliance.

388
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,560
Wait at the pearly gates as Moe checks the leaderboard.

389
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,200
I can't.

390
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,000
Do not believe in false Moes.

391
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,400
I never even considered wild and crazy kids as the goddamn

392
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,640
natural predecessor to wilden out.

393
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,080
The kids are grown up.

394
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,080
And now we turn to the chapter of Clarissa so that she might

395
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,960
explain it all.

396
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,200
Clarissa was a prophet.

397
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,640
And I will send her before me and her friend Sam with his

398
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,360
latter.

399
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,080
Cast out the Ferguson's from our flock.

400
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,840
You shall you shall know them from their crimson mane and

401
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,280
many freckles.

402
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,600
Take the most precious of your flock and make a sacrifice of

403
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,480
them at the shrine of the silver monkey.

404
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,240
Oh, man.

405
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,480
Oh, Jesus.

406
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,440
Nope.

407
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,480
Not him.

408
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:44,960
Nope.

409
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,080
Sorry wrong guy.

410
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,960
Nick Cannon Lodeon.

411
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,560
There is no Jesus.

412
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,760
There's only the tomorrow people.

413
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,720
There are Lord and saviors.

414
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,080
Well, that's enough.

415
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,440
It probably Michael Malley, right?

416
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,760
That's yeah.

417
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,160
Who would be the head of the Nick Cannon Lodeon?

418
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,960
So Nick Cannon Lodeon, Nick Cannon Lodeon would be the

419
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,920
deity, right?

420
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,320
Well, Mark Summers, I think probably lost his way a little

421
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,040
bit.

422
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh, I think he's probably been excommunicated.

423
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,640
And that's why he's now now he lives on the Food Network

424
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,720
trying to raise basically what is a cult.

425
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,200
I was once in a pub for a meetup and I ordered a

426
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,240
cheeseburger.

427
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,960
The server brought me a salmon burger instead and I just ate

428
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,760
it instead of protesting as I felt too awkward in the moment.

429
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,640
I actually thought I might have just forgot what I ordered

430
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,520
about 20 minutes later.

431
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,680
I see the same server walking around the room with a

432
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,640
cheeseburger looking confused later that evening.

433
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,720
They must have figured out the screw up and approached me

434
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,120
demanding that I pay for both meals.

435
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,440
I ordered one meal and I ate one meal.

436
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,160
Sir refused to pay for both and was told to leave.

437
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,120
What the fuck?

438
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,360
Was I in the right or at least less in the wrong than the

439
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,760
pub?

440
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,840
And do you think it is safe to go back now?

441
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,880
That's from Gmail.

442
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,120
I would never go back again.

443
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,200
No, it sounds like a terrible place.

444
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,480
It sounds like it's crazy.

445
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,120
Come on down to Toby's double burger.

446
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,320
We're going to fuck up.

447
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,800
But you've got to pay for both because that's how we do now.

448
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:12,960
Okay, before we get too into it, I will say to not to put you

449
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,240
completely in the right.

450
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,880
You probably should have said something when your burger came

451
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,080
from not only a different animal, but a completely different

452
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,480
like that a version to confrontation is pathological

453
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,080
enough that they probably suspected something nefarious

454
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,240
was great in addition to that.

455
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,720
Wait a minute.

456
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,840
So he just did it.

457
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,800
He just ate it.

458
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,840
That doesn't make any sense.

459
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,520
He didn't say anything.

460
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,680
He literally you literally ate the opposite me.

461
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,240
It's the opposite me.

462
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,360
Here's the spectrum of meat and beef is on one end and

463
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,720
salmon's on the other.

464
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,320
There's no how goddamn delicious must that salmon burger

465
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,920
have been that it completely removed you from your senses.

466
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,000
Also question asker in the future.

467
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,880
Don't convince yourself that maybe this is what I ordered.

468
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,000
That's very sad to me.

469
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,760
The scam they're running.

470
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,360
That's a psychic scam.

471
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,880
They're running on themselves.

472
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,160
They took one bite of that.

473
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,720
The first thought was this isn't what I ordered.

474
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,640
And then it was so succulent.

475
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,000
They thought, well, I'm salmon.

476
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,320
Maybe I did the beef of the sea.

477
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,600
Knowing me, I always pick the best thing at a restaurant.

478
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
I'm sure I've ordered this.

479
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,440
Okay.

480
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,080
Now to jump back to the restaurant being the worst,

481
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,080
the sheer balls of the restaurant to say like,

482
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,200
hey, we brought you the wrong thing, but fuck you.

483
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,880
But you shouldn't.

484
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,360
Okay.

485
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,800
I got to say my position's changing a little bit because

486
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,960
you should not have eaten that burger, sir.

487
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,160
Yeah.

488
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,520
But he didn't walk up to the counter and grab it and say,

489
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,120
this is probably mine.

490
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,800
It was handed to him.

491
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,680
But okay.

492
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,080
But to Griffin's point, he should think about the onion a little bit.

493
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,360
He got the wrong thing, ate it, and then carried his trash around

494
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,560
the restaurant and didn't even give her a flag down.

495
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,440
I think that maybe as a result of his carelessness,

496
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,800
they did waste a meal.

497
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,640
Okay, Toby's Double Burger is not made of burgers.

498
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,320
They serve them, but the building itself needs money

499
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,200
and concrete, but to put it in a different context, right?

500
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,280
Say he orders a cheeseburger, right?

501
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,200
They bring out a burger, no cheese.

502
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,000
Hey Travis, that is the biggest false equivalent.

503
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
We've had some doozers in the false equivalence category on this show.

504
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,120
That's the biggest one.

505
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,360
Yeah.

506
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,680
It's like a cheeseburger, but without cheese or meat.

507
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,360
And also fish is in it.

508
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,840
No, I'm just saying that like the idea of like,

509
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,640
where does it end?

510
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,440
Cause they bring out that burger and then they bring out another burger

511
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,040
and it's like, oh, that one was supposed to be mine,

512
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,000
but they brought me this one.

513
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,080
They're not going to ask for your money in that way.

514
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,800
Is it just because it was the complete wrong protein

515
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,400
that it's like, oh, you fucked up so bad?

516
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,320
If these motherfuckers brought him a basket of boneless chicken wings

517
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,800
instead of his burger and he eats all the chicken wings and said,

518
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,000
oops, didn't even realize it's a whole different food kingdom,

519
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,760
but those are free now because they're in me.

520
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,480
That's kind of busted, I think.

521
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,400
All you had to say is, what chicken wings?

522
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,800
And a perfect crime.

523
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,080
Prove it.

524
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,360
Well, you're a sloppy boy.

525
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,040
You're a sloppy boy.

526
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,480
You got burn mouth.

527
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,680
What face?

528
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,880
Yep, sorry.

529
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,360
Sorry guys.

530
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,400
I'm about as consumer friendly as a fellow gets.

531
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,640
I'm a pretty big consumer advocate.

532
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,560
Don't eat the whole goddamn wrong burger

533
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,080
cause that was somebody else's burger.

534
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,520
You did the savory is what you did.

535
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,840
Yeah, it should have been at most one bite.

536
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,760
Were you like, pardon?

537
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,240
Or no bites because nobody's going to eat.

538
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,280
They're going to throw that burger away if you take a bite out of it.

539
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,240
That's straight up what it is.

540
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,400
You can't take that off your table and give it to somebody else.

541
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,600
That's no.

542
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,800
That's how trash people live.

543
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,480
The real villain in this situation is whoever you are with.

544
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,440
Salmon.

545
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,240
Salmon.

546
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,360
But it's whoever you are with because it's their job to say,

547
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,600
excuse me, my friend ordered a cheeseburger.

548
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,000
Cause they have to know that you were like so averse to confrontation

549
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,520
that you would eat wrong food.

550
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,000
It's like, hey, I need you to say something because I cannot.

551
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh my God, wait, wait.

552
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,520
Did this person just follow our advice from like,

553
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,600
it was either last episode or a couple episodes ago

554
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,120
where we said, if they bring you the wrong food,

555
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,880
you should just eat it because you want to avoid the discomfort.

556
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,440
Wait a minute.

557
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,600
Going back on something we said, cause it was wrong.

558
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,880
That doesn't sound like us.

559
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,800
I didn't even consider the possibility that maybe

560
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,120
it's somebody else's food and you just stole it from them.

561
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,000
I want to double, triple, double back on this again

562
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,880
and say that I've switched culpability in my mind

563
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,600
from this person to the restaurant

564
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,480
for offering something called a salmon burger.

565
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,920
No, it's not.

566
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,520
It's salmon on bread.

567
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,560
Fuck you.

568
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,000
A burger has beef and maybe ground turkey.

569
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,680
I would hit you up there.

570
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,640
A salmon burger is not a thing.

571
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,400
That's like a wish broom.

572
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,760
Like it doesn't make any sense.

573
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,560
What?

574
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,720
You know, like a wish broom.

575
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,080
Like, okay, for what?

576
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,600
Those two things don't go together.

577
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,440
For sleeping out the old wishes.

578
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,080
It's a dog.

579
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,280
It's a dog tank.

580
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,680
It's a tank that your dog lives in.

581
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,760
These are, they're banana glasses.

582
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,960
Glasses for a banana.

583
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,440
Why would you even give a banana glass?

584
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,720
That doesn't make any sense.

585
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
That's about as stupid as a salmon burger.

586
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:14,960
Yeah.

587
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,080
Ugh.

588
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,320
Yeah.

589
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,880
Makes you mad.

590
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,920
Anyway, let's get the money soon.

591
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,960
This week, sponsored by salmon burgers.

592
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,320
Have you always wanted to build an iPhone app?

593
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,560
Yes.

594
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
Is your idea the next Instagram or Snapchat?

595
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,160
I like to think so.

596
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,480
Yes.

597
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,720
Do you want to learn Swift by Apple?

598
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:40,960
Yes.

599
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,520
One month iOS is an easy way to learn iOS development using Swift.

600
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,160
Now let's say that maybe a listener doesn't know what any of that means.

601
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,480
And you are going to explain to them.

602
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,320
Not you.

603
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,360
No, definitely not me.

604
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm a well-versed adult who definitely knows what Swift is.

605
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,200
Yes.

606
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,800
Swift is how you make apps.

607
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,600
Okay.

608
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,000
And one month is a, it's a new way of learning actual practical computer skills

609
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,120
like programming in Swift.

610
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,720
They also have one month HTML, one month rails, one month growth hacking.

611
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,200
Now, surely this is going to take like just like a year, right?

612
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,920
Like you go to college to learn a thing.

613
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,400
What's wrong?

614
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,160
It's literally called one month.

615
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,360
I thought that was a clever name.

616
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,840
30, 30 days, 30 days, 30 minutes per day, sometimes less.

617
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,560
And you could just become fluid in an actual life skill.

618
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,080
I did the one month HTML class and it was great.

619
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,600
I made a great website.

620
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,320
Is it justinmaccroy.net?

621
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,520
You could just Google.

622
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,800
Justin made Google.

623
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,000
Google Junior for kids.

624
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,600
They don't sell hover chairs like I'm sitting into just anybody,

625
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,200
except I'm the founder of Google.

626
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,080
Except if you are the founder of teen Google,

627
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,920
you can sit in whatever kind of chair you want.

628
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,920
Hey teens, good news.

629
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,680
There's finally a Google for you.

630
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,800
It's all boobs, not Justin.

631
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,000
Travis, it would be, it would just be page after page explaining how to smoke.

632
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,960
Now Justin, say I'm interested in joining,

633
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,200
but I'm a little hesitant about paying full price the first time out.

634
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,560
Is there anything you can do for me?

635
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,280
Uh, yes, Travis, if you use our special coupon code,

636
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,720
which is my brother.

637
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,240
Not so much a coupon code.

638
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,880
It's not a coupon code so much as I was trying to see if teengoogle.com is available.

639
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,840
Go to onemonth.com slash my brother.

640
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,840
Onemonth.com slash my brother,

641
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,840
and you're going to get 25% off for getting up in it.

642
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,600
It's a one-time discount.

643
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,000
You can get it at onemonth.com slash my brother.

644
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,320
That's a, please just go get a life skill.

645
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,840
It's a great website, great service, Justin.

646
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,760
I do need to know if Teen Google is taken,

647
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,440
and if you're going to buy it, and if it's going to read it.

648
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,200
And if it's a weird porn site.

649
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,560
Excuse me, time out.

650
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,800
I just bought Teen Google.

651
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,800
It's the best one yet.

652
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,600
It's the best day of my life.

653
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,400
We're going to be rich.

654
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,880
I can't believe this.

655
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,640
Oh man, we are going to make that,

656
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,360
we are going to make that redirect to the Moo Boom Bam website for a long time

657
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,000
until Google buys it from you for $55 million.

658
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,280
We'll be rich.

659
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,640
Oh my god, it's so worth it.

660
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,800
How much was it?

661
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,640
Cancel the show.

662
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,360
I can't, I can't even deal with this show anymore.

663
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,000
No, we're the owners of Teen Google, we're rich.

664
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,760
How's the owner of Teen Google

665
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,000
supposed to, supposed to worry about making a comedy podcast?

666
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,520
We have another sponsor this week,

667
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,200
and maybe you'll recognize the name,

668
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,120
and maybe you'll respect the game of Nature Box.

669
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,560
NatureBox.com, where you can get delicious and healthy snack options.

670
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,040
They have over 100 nutritionist approved snacks.

671
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,160
They got something for everyone, all with zero artificial flavors,

672
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,800
colors, sweeteners, zero grams trans fats,

673
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,720
and no high fructose corn syrup.

674
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:07,920
Here's the thing.

675
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,080
Sometimes you eat healthy snacks and you're like,

676
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,200
oh, yeah, it's healthy.

677
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,720
I'm going to power my way through it, I guess,

678
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,400
because it's better than nothing.

679
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,000
Nah, dude, nah.

680
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,960
Nah, dude.

681
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,400
Nah, nah, dude.

682
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,400
You're listening to a Teen Google version of my bim bam.

683
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,160
Extreme Teen Google.

684
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,320
Justin, quick.

685
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,440
Have you tried Teen Google?

686
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,680
Well, it's time for Extreme Teen Google.

687
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,640
I feel like in another browser window,

688
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,920
I'm winning the lot, like I'm in the process of winning the lottery.

689
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,160
I can't even focus on this show right now.

690
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm the owner of Teen Google.

691
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,480
I'm doing jokes about ghosts and boners and shit

692
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,600
when I'm the web domain raster of Teen Google.

693
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,000
I can do anything with that URL.

694
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,240
That's where the fucking music is,

695
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,560
and you are all here for it to witness it.

696
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,800
Do we need to pause the podcast so you can call Sydney

697
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,400
and tell her about the amazing reversal of fortune you've experienced?

698
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,600
I was sobbing, like, you'll never guess.

699
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,800
It's all happened.

700
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,320
You'll never guess, in six months,

701
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,280
we're going to be in a protracted legal battle with Google.

702
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,160
It's all we ever dreamed.

703
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,320
It's everything we ever wanted.

704
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,200
We're gonna get taken to the cleaners by Google.

705
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,000
Oh, Christ.

706
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,560
Okay, so it's time for you to try NatureBox for free.

707
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,480
For free.

708
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,080
Maybe you don't own Teen Google.

709
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,880
Maybe you can't afford a free box this time.

710
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,600
We get it.

711
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,080
Not everyone's the owner of Teen Google.

712
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,360
Just go to naturebox.com slash my brother,

713
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,200
and even non-Teen Google owners like you can try free snacks.

714
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,640
Normies is what we call them.

715
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,480
Just go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

716
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,280
Now, peasant.

717
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,520
Brothers, please go to teengoogle.com.

718
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,960
Oh, Christ, it looks good.

719
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,160
Yeah, and there it is.

720
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,800
It looks good in the search bar.

721
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,280
That's a good looking URL.

722
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:09,920
It looks exactly like what it is.

723
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,640
What I need to do is I need, the problem is,

724
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,840
I need to, I need to turn on masking.

725
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,200
I need stealth redirection.

726
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

727
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,840
Okay, well, what's the list so far?

728
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,880
We got My Smooth Face, Teen Google, of course.

729
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,120
I feel like you bought one very recently.

730
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,360
Let me see what I have.

731
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,600
It's bad that you, I think you have a compulsion

732
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,640
because you own too many.

733
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,400
I have booboo nanny.com.

734
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,200
Booboo nanny.com.

735
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,640
These all, these largely go to my brother, my brother and me.

736
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,440
Booboo nanny.com, fartpatrol.com,

737
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,880
griffinspacejam.com is a different website

738
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,080
that we also own, but griffinspacejam.com,

739
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:59,680
mysmoothface.com, and now welcome to the family.

740
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,680
To the my brother, my brother and me family of products.

741
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,040
If anybody ever says the words mbmbam.com to me again,

742
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,280
I will spit in their face.

743
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,040
It's not a website.

744
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,960
That website does not even exist anymore.

745
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,600
There is only teengoogle.com.

746
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,520
We have a sponsor right here and it is Talking to Ghosts,

747
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,640
which is a podcast done by Wesley Mueller and Michael Kurt,

748
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,480
which is quote,

749
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,920
the manifestation of their fascination with the dark arts,

750
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,360
which makes it sound like a podcast for necromancers exclusively,

751
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,240
but really it gets into the creative minds of artists, musicians,

752
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,160
and other dark souls, my favorite gaming franchise,

753
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,160
to see how they work and share fun stories about the oddities of life.

754
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,920
It's a podcast that comes out on Mondays.

755
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,280
You can find it on iTunes.

756
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,400
If you go to talkingtoghosts.com slash mbmbam,

757
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:58,320
you will find a landing page specifically tailored for my bim bam fans,

758
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,400
and it includes a lovely graphic of a horse flying around in space.

759
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,080
You can also just type talkingtoghosts.com into teengoogle

760
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,040
and it'll take you there.

761
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,920
It'll take you there.

762
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,240
It'll be a more rad, more extreme version of Talking to Ghosts.

763
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,440
So yeah, go check out their podcast, go to their website.

764
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,240
They have a bi-weekly feature in which the host of the show

765
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,880
talk about sweet music that they like listening to.

766
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,520
Sweet music that they like listening to.

767
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,760
So yeah, it covers all your bases.

768
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,840
If you like music, if you like art, if you like podcasts,

769
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,760
or if you like the Dark Souls video games.

770
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,520
It's got everything.

771
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,040
It's got just about everything.

772
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,160
Got a message for Lindsay and Tom from Jace.

773
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,160
Says, hey, you two.

774
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,000
This may or may not reach you before your ceremony,

775
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,040
but I miss you guys.

776
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,480
And I miss Luigi and his horrible dog toots.

777
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,280
I wish I could be there.

778
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,680
He is Lindsay's little brother.

779
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,520
I wish I could be there for your second special day,

780
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,480
but since I can't drive safe, don't forget to berg it up.

781
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,280
All my love from the frozen north, Jace.

782
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,560
I just have to say ceremony is a very nonspecific,

783
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,200
a very nonspecific thing to congratulate a person on.

784
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,960
Wish I could be there before your sacrificial murder of Lindsay.

785
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,240
But at the shrine of the silver monkey.

786
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:29,280
Congratulations, Lindsay and Tom, for becoming fucking pagan elders or something.

787
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,040
Whatever it is, I'm sure you worked hard to accomplish it.

788
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,520
And Jace certainly recognizes that effort.

789
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,000
And just a great job all around.

790
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,280
Just make sure you wear the appropriate garb for whatever this-

791
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,160
Which is cargo shorts, khaki cargo shorts.

792
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,440
Under a robe.

793
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,440
And make sure you got those-

794
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,240
Make sure that says something funny that you ripped the robe open at the end.

795
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,840
You're just like, I'm out, teach.

796
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,600
Make sure you get the skateboard out of there.

797
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,080
It's a picture of Spud McKenzie.

798
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,040
Make sure you have at least two medallions of power,

799
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,600
or else those goddamn temple guards are gonna fuck you right up.

800
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,600
And don't forget to validate your parking.

801
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,560
Yeah, it's super important.

802
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,160
Do you think it's okay to finish someone else's food?

803
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,280
Do you have a fight with your friend over whether or not

804
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,360
he should wear his Philly's garb to a Colorado Rockies game?

805
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,440
Does your wife want to keep a chamber pot in her art studio?

806
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,880
If so, please do not write in to Judge John Hodgman.

807
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,400
I heard all those cases already.

808
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,000
Judge John Hodgman is the show where I, John Hodgman,

809
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,480
adjudicate disputes between real people calling in over the internet

810
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,320
and I tell them who is right and who is wrong over such important issues

811
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,800
as is a machine gun a robot?

812
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,120
And is it okay to go through the garbage at the Canadian House of Pizza and Garbage?

813
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,680
Bailiff Jesse Thorne rounds out the cast for a fun-filled podcast

814
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,960
of judgment and justice.

815
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,040
Kind of two of the same thing, actually.

816
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,480
Judge John Hodgman, take a listen if you do not mind.

817
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,600
I order it.

818
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,720
Come visit the courtroom.

819
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,040
It is open to all and located at MaximumFun.org.

820
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:14,640
Farm wisdom.

821
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,600
Farm wisdom.

822
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,080
Put your scarecrow in a barrel.

823
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,960
Farm wisdom.

824
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,160
To scare away the barrel crows.

825
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,680
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

826
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,120
Do you want me to read the farm wisdom?

827
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,160
Yes, please.

828
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,360
Okay, because the last one I did like hurt me.

829
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,480
No, this one will make you feel good about life.

830
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
Okay, farm wisdom.

831
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,240
Donkeys definitely hate dogs, but thoroughbreds, racehorses, love goats.

832
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,440
Another false equivalency here on my brother, my brother, me.

833
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,240
It is common practice to pair a goat with a skittish racehorse.

834
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,640
It calms them down and they usually form lifelong friendships.

835
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,760
And that's from Jesse.

836
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,080
Here's the thing, you're gonna have-

837
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,760
Jesse Disney.

838
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,440
How is this not every Disney movie ever made?

839
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,240
Well, how is this not every anime-

840
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,440
Like Milo and Otis, I should say those two words

841
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,120
and I should not have a cat and a pug enter my brain.

842
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,680
It should definitely, definitely be a goat and a skittish racehorse.

843
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,880
Well, goats are hard to market.

844
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,000
Name me one film that prominently features a goat as the star of it.

845
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,720
Adam Sandler record had a pretty great bit

846
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,680
where this funny goat, remember what they superimposed?

847
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,080
They have the funny goat bit from Adam Sandler's

848
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,480
What the Hell Happened to Me comedy CD and album.

849
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,440
NLP.

850
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,560
Classic Disney movie.

851
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,120
No, it's not Disney movie.

852
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,560
Yeah, goats just aren't very sexy guys, sorry.

853
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,120
They're like little horned horses with beards.

854
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,080
I guess that's probably what makes the horse chill out

855
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,440
is just by comparison, by comparing themselves to this little mutant.

856
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,040
Okay, let me pitch this to you.

857
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,760
You ready?

858
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,040
Close your eyes.

859
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,920
No, I need to look.

860
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,920
It's the day of the big race, right?

861
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,120
Oh, there's the shot.

862
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,320
The horses go.

863
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,520
Okay, but our hero horse, he's losing.

864
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,880
He's way behind.

865
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,040
It's like he's getting really downhearted, right?

866
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,880
But then he looks over and there at the fence is his goat buddy

867
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,600
who just nods to him and starts running along beside him.

868
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,800
And then they start picking up speed and then the horse goes and he wins.

869
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,520
And then he's getting like his ring of like flowers.

870
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,840
And he's like, I couldn't have done it without my goat buddy.

871
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,400
But goat buddy died like two weeks earlier and he was watching a ghost.

872
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,400
A goatst.

873
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,040
A goatst.

874
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,680
That's bad.

875
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,400
It's not good.

876
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,440
Well, I mean, we'd have to punch it up with some dialogue

877
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,040
and maybe like Jeff Bridges.

878
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:43,840
Yeah.

879
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,200
Can we get that?

880
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,960
Who's the guy who played goat man on Saturday Night Live?

881
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,480
James Brewer.

882
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,120
Was it James Brewer or Jay Brewer?

883
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,880
I believe it was Sir James Brewer.

884
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,380
Sir.

885
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,600
Night of the realm, James Brewer.

886
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,960
Do you think we could get him on the horn?

887
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,080
He's pretty busy defending England, but we could probably get him for the project.

888
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,280
He was the probably the best knight in Half Baked.

889
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,000
Uh huh.

890
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,720
If you think about it.

891
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,400
Wait, what?

892
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,080
He was probably the best knight in Half Baked.

893
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,960
Were there multiple?

894
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,280
Other than Sir James Brewer, defender of the realm?

895
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,480
Probably not.

896
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,880
How many of you needed Half Baked, Griffin?

897
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,520
Jesus.

898
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:27,760
Yeah.

899
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,480
How many knights do you think they needed to make Half Baked?

900
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,480
And then the call went out across the land.

901
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,520
Knights return to defend your mother country.

902
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,880
Do you guys want a yahoo?

903
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,440
Yes.

904
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,000
You know it.

905
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,640
This yahoo was sent in by, oh, oh, oops.

906
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,160
Game recognized game, Rachel Sperling.

907
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,280
Thank you, Rachel Sperling.

908
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,720
Almost forgot to recognize that game.

909
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,200
Take a moment.

910
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,320
Yeah, I almost breezed right by it.

911
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,120
That would have been a crime.

912
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,160
It's by yahoo answers user, Brooklyn, who asks,

913
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,760
what to do with old best friend necklaces.

914
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:02,400
So I'm 15 now, and my ex best friend and I haven't been talking for about a year and a half now, I guess.

915
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,720
I was going through some stuff and found all these old BFF necklaces.

916
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,480
I want to get rid of them.

917
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,400
We cannot be best friends again, so I will not wear them again.

918
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,840
That's not even an option.

919
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,040
It just kind of seems like a waste to get rid of them.

920
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,400
Surely I can use at least the chains for something.

921
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,880
Any ideas? Should I just throw them away in this economy?

922
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,680
Cash for gold.

923
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,880
Cash for gold.

924
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,920
Probably not gold.

925
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,920
These are probably $14 necklaces they got at Spencer's gifts.

926
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,480
So you're saying like the purest silver?

927
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,160
Uh, no, probably like the purest tin.

928
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,680
Okay.

929
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,960
Maybe you could try selling them at teengoogle.com.

930
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,920
That's a market place.

931
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,680
Is there a shopping page?

932
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,640
Is there a shopping hub?

933
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,080
Google has everything.

934
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:48,640
Okay.

935
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,200
If you click on it, there's definitely a place that says shopping.

936
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,280
If you click on it, it's just a picture of a guy in a hard hat, like, oh, boss, come back later.

937
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,040
I think they're going to have some really nice shopping options.

938
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,600
Yeah, Justin's got a fleet of developers quickly coding using their one month by Swift skills.

939
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,440
To make a lot of shopping options.

940
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,240
Did Swift?

941
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,040
Just shoptions.

942
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,920
Shoptions at teengoogle.com.

943
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,560
Um, can you sell them to lonely people who then when they put it on,

944
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:23,440
who then when they put it on contractually will become best friends with the other person.

945
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,920
Oh, so like a best friend transfer.

946
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,000
Yeah, that's yeah, exactly.

947
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,280
I actually have on the back of my driver's license that when I die, I want to be a best friend donor.

948
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,440
Yeah, all of your best friend necklaces will be taken and distributed.

949
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,760
That is that is no light promise that I have at this point in my 31 years.

950
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,320
I have 163 best friend necklaces.

951
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,520
I wear all of them.

952
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,480
Holy shit.

953
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,240
How did you accrue so many biffs?

954
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,840
Well, Griffin, I listen.

955
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,640
I listen and I care.

956
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,240
That's categorically untrue.

957
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:56,960
I listen.

958
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,680
I care.

959
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,240
I don't.

960
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,520
I don't talk over people.

961
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:00,960
No, no, no.

962
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,480
I remember the caring things.

963
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,360
I'll give you caring.

964
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,080
I'll seed caring to you.

965
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:14,720
I give the best necklaces to a bunch of strangers and then ask your friend to give her necklaces

966
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,000
to a bunch of lonely strangers.

967
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,560
Match.com.

968
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,120
And then match.com, lo-fi match.com, the hunt is on.

969
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,200
You got to find your match.

970
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:23,760
Oh, my God.

971
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,400
And it's like the fucking it's the fucking missing piece.

972
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,880
Somebody walks up, see somebody with half a heart on their chest.

973
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,240
Like, let's put them together.

974
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,920
Bet Fritz.

975
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,920
No, not quite.

976
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,200
But I don't I don't want to be.

977
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,560
How many necklaces this person had they say they had?

978
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,640
It just says all those.

979
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,840
So more than one.

980
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,040
That's like that's got to be a weird dynamic, right?

981
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,320
Guess what I got.

982
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,040
Yeah, I know.

983
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,720
I know what you got, Darlene.

984
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,280
Let me guess.

985
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,640
Is it a best friend?

986
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,400
It's a best friend necklace.

987
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,120
All right, Darlene.

988
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,840
That's why they stop being best friends.

989
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,880
Yeah, you can't.

990
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,880
I'm sick of all this necklace pressure.

991
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,000
Quit asking me for money to pay for my half of the necklace.

992
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,600
I think it's I think it's kind of bullshit to just throw them away because then your

993
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,560
ex best friend is going to be best friends with garbage.

994
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,160
Yeah, and maybe that's actually a statement that you want to send.

995
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,880
Like, man, Darla, Darla, you seem like you've been down in the dumps today.

996
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,320
Yeah, I just feel like I'm best friends with garbage now.

997
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,280
Hold on.

998
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,840
Never mind.

999
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,200
That's a sweet necklace.

1000
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,840
What sort of special somebody has the other half of that?

1001
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,120
Let me see garbage.

1002
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:31,920
Let me rub it.

1003
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,200
Garbage has me rub it.

1004
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:33,680
Kiss it.

1005
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,880
Hold it to my third eye.

1006
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,840
Let's say garbage.

1007
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,160
Is there a market?

1008
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,920
Is there a product we could create that's like a casual acquaintance necklace where

1009
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,440
instead of like a broken heart, it's just like a circle that's split straight down the

1010
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,480
center, no jagged edge and just says, Kaz, you will acquaintance.

1011
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
And yeah, you just give it to everybody.

1012
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,760
I feel like you're going to get it's a way bigger market because more people will be

1013
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,600
like, oh, I feel that way about a lot of people.

1014
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,960
Yeah, I'll take like 30 of them.

1015
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,960
Just hand them out, hand them out with your best friends, forever necklace people.

1016
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,160
They weren't looking for the ups.

1017
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,400
Yeah, here's a business card and here's a necklace that says Kaz, I can't.

1018
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:14,160
It's a really great necklace.

1019
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,520
If you hold it to your third eye, we can speak to each other.

1020
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,200
It's basically the goddamn Palantir.

1021
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,240
So I think you're really going to like it.

1022
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,400
Oh, and my business card, did you get that?

1023
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,680
It's got my email address on it.

1024
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,880
I don't take a lot of emails or texts or calls.

1025
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,360
Mostly just Palantir, like direct third eye communication.

1026
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,400
And please don't lose that business card.

1027
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:34,960
Those are expensive.

1028
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,920
Those are expensive.

1029
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,560
And the Palantir.

1030
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,200
Those don't come free.

1031
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,160
And the Palantir contains a fraction of the devil's souls.

1032
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,200
Don't lose that one either.

1033
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,440
Yeah, that's a cost to me, too.

1034
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,200
How about one more question?

1035
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,200
Yeah, I got one more question.

1036
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,120
Let me just check it real quick.

1037
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,480
This question comes to us.

1038
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,880
Oh, God damn it.

1039
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,020
Oh, no.

1040
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,360
Oh, no.

1041
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,480
Breaking this just it.

1042
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,040
Hold on.

1043
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,480
Can we have farm wisdom and haunted doll watch in the same?

1044
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,440
Haunted farm watch.

1045
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,960
This one costs $300.

1046
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,080
Christ on a bike.

1047
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,600
If you want to buy it now, $300 if you want to buy it now.

1048
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,480
No bids as of yet on this one.

1049
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,840
Re-list authentic haunted doll.

1050
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,880
Ruth, healing spirit, and then in quotes,

1051
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,280
antique collection.

1052
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,800
Well, all of them are right.

1053
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,800
I don't imagine anybody went to the Build-A-Bear factory

1054
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,840
and got one on Tuesday and it was already haunted by Thursday.

1055
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,000
I imagine most of these are aged.

1056
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,080
Now, I try not to poke holes in these,

1057
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,000
but it strikes me as a little bit fishy.

1058
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,160
If this is a healing, you shouldn't go holes in them

1059
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,240
because they're trapping a demon spirit.

1060
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,920
So they probably want to keep those enclosed.

1061
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,200
If it's a healing spirit, why would you be trying to get rid of it?

1062
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:55,680
Yeah.

1063
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,600
Well, let me hip you to this story.

1064
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:03,040
This doll houses an old soul and is a special and unique offering.

1065
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,560
This doll is antique and was given to Michelle

1066
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,320
by her mother many years ago.

1067
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:15,280
Michelle's mother, 14th birthday present.

1068
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,360
Michelle's mother was a gifted medium

1069
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,680
who possessed similar talents to Michelle.

1070
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,880
Who's Michelle, you may ask?

1071
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,880
I don't know.

1072
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,920
Michelle Tanner.

1073
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,520
Ruth has lived inside this doll for well over 100 years.

1074
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,160
She passed away in the early 1900s.

1075
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,680
She froze to death after becoming lost on her travels.

1076
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,520
Ruth was 17 and about to marry, it says here.

1077
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,800
So I don't know.

1078
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,160
How do you know so much?

1079
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,000
Doll is fucking 100 years old, at least.

1080
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,840
That's worth more than $300 right there.

1081
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,440
Ruth is a very active and present spirit.

1082
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,880
That's, you know, that's so important.

1083
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,680
You got to lean in.

1084
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,920
Yeah, she gets out there, she meets people.

1085
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,440
Hey, I want to party tonight.

1086
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,880
Ruth, I can't, I'm 14.

1087
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,080
You're made of alabaster.

1088
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,520
Get me out there.

1089
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,040
I want to meet people.

1090
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:07,840
Oh, Jesus.

1091
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,340
She manip-

1092
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,880
Ruth is very active and present spirit.

1093
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,120
She manipulates her doll very well.

1094
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:17,040
Her eyes have rapidly twitched and switched direction.

1095
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,800
She appears cross-eyed at times.

1096
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,840
Her mouth seems to change shape, which is alarming.

1097
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,720
Well, wait, hold on.

1098
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,320
I had a Teddy Ruxpin that did that.

1099
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,120
All Teddy Ruxpins were haunted dolls.

1100
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:27,620
Okay.

1101
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:32,420
Ruth does move her vessel from one location to another.

1102
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:36,420
I have found her on the couch once upon coming downstairs and then-

1103
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,460
Watching Cops.

1104
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:42,660
Watching Cops and eating pizza-blasted Cheetos.

1105
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,580
Some of the greatest-

1106
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,500
Okay, I-

1107
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,580
Listen, I feel like I-

1108
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:53,460
These fucking posts make me feel like I'm coming into a movie with 20 minutes left.

1109
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:58,020
Some of the greatest orb activity I have ever seen has been a result of-

1110
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,060
What is that?

1111
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:04,340
The orbs are bright and have traveled directly from her vessel to the hallway and back into her vessel.

1112
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:07,460
She has astounding control over both her energies and spirit.

1113
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,260
And her vessel.

1114
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,180
Spirits, vessels, energies, orbs.

1115
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,340
Ruth has got it going on.

1116
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,260
Parties, Saturday night, club banging.

1117
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:26,260
Ruth is very curious when it comes to electronic devices as these devices were not invented

1118
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,540
in her time while living.

1119
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:29,540
What do you got there?

1120
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,620
Looks like some sort of magic book.

1121
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,060
It's an iPhone, Ruth.

1122
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,380
We've been over this every fucking day.

1123
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,420
This is a magical-

1124
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,980
Ruth, are you ordering pizza on my Pizza Hut app again?

1125
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:44,740
No, just exploring this magical piece of wood.

1126
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:45,860
Ruth, no pizza.

1127
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,540
I'm very active and hungry.

1128
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,180
I'm reading your-

1129
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:52,820
Looks like you got some little people stuck in your magic book.

1130
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,820
It's the Avengers 2 trailer, Ruth.

1131
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,660
I watched it yesterday with you.

1132
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,300
You were the one who told me to watch it on YouTube, Ruth.

1133
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,340
Tell me, can your illuminated Bible do this?

1134
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:02,900
Orbs.

1135
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,380
That's the sound she makes when she shoots orbs into the hallway.

1136
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:09,780
Sucks them back.

1137
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,020
Extremely taxing.

1138
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:17,060
$300, I think you're getting a lot of bang for your buck with this one.

1139
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,060
With Ruth?

1140
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:19,380
Yeah.

1141
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,060
It sounds like she does a lot of shit.

1142
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:25,380
So the reason to get rid of a spirit that could heal you is she's just too active to

1143
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:25,780
keep up with that lifetime.

1144
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,100
I'm sick of all these goddamn orbs.

1145
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:33,700
She has caused moderate headaches and pressure-related symptoms.

1146
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:37,300
Pretty shitty healing doll, I would say.

1147
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:37,940
Interesting.

1148
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,940
This whole paragraph's bold, guys, so it's important.

1149
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,820
And true.

1150
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,980
Oh, goddammit.

1151
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,300
I just looked at that picture.

1152
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,340
Yeah, sorry.

1153
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:52,340
She has caused moderate headaches and pressure-related symptoms during communications and psychic

1154
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:52,660
work.

1155
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,700
Interestingly, she has assisted with healing.

1156
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,020
She has abilities to drain, as with many spirits.

1157
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,460
Most will drain your energy.

1158
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:03,380
Ruth drains pain, physical and emotional.

1159
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,180
Oh, Jesus.

1160
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,220
I can't look at that.

1161
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,140
Why did you send me this, Justin?

1162
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:10,900
Yeah, I don't know what this doll's healing, but it's certainly not my goddamn state of

1163
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,300
mind.

1164
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,420
Oh, god, bless.

1165
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,660
Fucking haunted physician, heal thyself.

1166
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,500
Your goddamn eyes are all marble-y.

1167
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,860
Got the cataracts, Ruth.

1168
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,260
So that's gonna do it for us.

1169
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,980
Thank you for listening to my brother, my brother, and me again.

1170
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:33,860
We sure appreciate it, and we hope you've had some fun.

1171
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:35,940
Right?

1172
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,180
Yeah, I did, until I looked at that fucking picture.

1173
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:41,540
Yeah, and it's seared into my brain.

1174
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,220
I want to throw back real quick.

1175
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:47,780
Thanks again to naturebox.com, where you can get your free sampler box of great-tasting,

1176
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,940
wholesome snacks like barbecue kettle kernels.

1177
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:54,740
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother, and we're gonna get you those free fucking snacks.

1178
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,100
You should already be doing it as we speak.

1179
00:52:59,220 --> 00:52:59,460
Yep.

1180
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:03,940
This is our 240th episode, I guess.

1181
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,060
Almost 420, isn't it?

1182
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:05,780
Almost 420.

1183
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,820
Almost 420.

1184
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:11,620
There's 239 more of these at teengoogle.com.

1185
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:17,540
So go there, and while you're there, check out some other Maximum Fun shows, like Jordan

1186
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:22,900
and Jesse Go, or The Goose Down, or One Bad Mother, or Baby Geniuses.

1187
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,860
Travis produces that.

1188
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:24,580
You should listen to that.

1189
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,340
Listen to whatever you want.

1190
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,940
Sawbones, that's a show I do with my wife about medicine.

1191
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:31,460
Thanks.

1192
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:32,660
You should check out Bunker Buddies.

1193
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:39,140
It's a show I do with Andy, where we talk about apocalypses from a comedic bent.

1194
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:44,420
Or check out Adventure Zone, which I hope we'll be able to get up this week.

1195
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,660
Here's the situation, Adventure Zone fans.

1196
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,860
Dad lives 45 minutes away from Justin.

1197
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:54,180
30 to 45, depending on the traffic.

1198
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:00,580
And right now, there's the goddamn ice wall from Game of Thrones in between the two of

1199
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:05,060
them, so if Dad can find a way to scale that, then we'll have an episode this week.

1200
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:08,500
If not, we may have to drop back and punt.

1201
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,100
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

1202
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,220
Something.

1203
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:11,940
We'll figure out something.

1204
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,340
Did you thank John Rodgers with the long winners for the use of the theme song?

1205
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:18,180
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed?

1206
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:18,980
No, didn't do that.

1207
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,620
But you just did, because I mentalist-ed you.

1208
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:25,300
There are still a few tickets available for the Chicago and Milwaukee shows.

1209
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,380
Not very many for that Milwaukee one, last time I checked.

1210
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,180
Yeah.

1211
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,380
So get on that.

1212
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:36,340
It's bit.ly forward slash mbnbamchicago and bit.ly.

1213
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,420
Bit.johnlway.

1214
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,180
Bit.johnlway.

1215
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:46,100
Bit.ly forward slash, I think it's mbnbamil.

1216
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:52,500
Those URLs are so confusing, you can just pop those into Team Google and it'll auto-populate

1217
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:52,900
the rest.

1218
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,580
If you want to have a message on My Brother, My Brother, and Me, or the Adventure Zone

1219
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,380
now, we also started doing Jumbotrons for that.

1220
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:03,460
Go to maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron.

1221
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:08,660
It's a great way to wish someone happy birthday, or happy wedding, or happy non-specific ceremony.

1222
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:10,100
It's terrific.

1223
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:15,620
Or we can pimp your product and push your podcast, or talk about your website, or whatever

1224
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,340
you want.

1225
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,140
We'll dance for you.

1226
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:18,100
Yeah.

1227
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,260
We will be your haunted dolls.

1228
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,180
You got a last question, Griffin?

1229
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:29,780
This final Yahoo Answer was sent in by Level 9000 Yajushaman Drew Davenport.

1230
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:30,580
Shoot, that was close.

1231
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,540
I was about to say.

1232
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,900
We almost went a whole episode.

1233
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:33,300
I know.

1234
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,580
Drew Davenport, thank you so much.

1235
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:41,940
It's by Yahoo Answers user Tracer, who asks, what does Ja Rule think about all this?

1236
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,220
I'm Justin McElroy.

1237
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,980
I'm Travis McElroy.

1238
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,260
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1239
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,780
This has been My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1240
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,380
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

1241
00:55:53,380 --> 00:56:02,820
See you Google.

1242
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,980
Maximumfun.org.

1243
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,020
Comedy and culture.

1244
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,140
Artist owned.

1245
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,420
Listener supported.

1246
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:18,980
Hey, everyone.

1247
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:23,780
We're The Flophouse, one of the newest additions to the Maximum Fun Podcasting Network.

1248
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,060
I'm Dan McCoy.

1249
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,260
I'm Stuart Wellington.

1250
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,780
And I'm Elliot Kalin.

1251
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,500
What is The Flophouse, you may very well ask?

1252
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,740
We watch a bad movie, and then we talk about it.

1253
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,020
A bad movie podcast?

1254
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,580
Isn't that like every fifth podcast on the internet?

1255
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:40,420
I'd answer that by saying, one, we've been doing this show for over seven years, long

1256
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,380
before the entire premise of our show was a cliche.

1257
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,900
And two, shut up.

1258
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,020
Sick bird.

1259
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,820
I'd say that our show is more of a comedy podcast.

1260
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:51,220
A podcast about words that sound like other words.

1261
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:55,860
A podcast about me singing long irritating songs like this one.

1262
00:56:55,860 --> 00:57:01,060
A podcast about pitches for a Ziggy comic book movie or discussions about sex tarps.

1263
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:05,860
Yeah, I mean, mostly it's a show about three friends just hanging out and talking about

1264
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:06,660
ding dongs.

1265
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:07,700
That's mostly used to.

1266
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,580
Wait, what?

1267
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:15,380
