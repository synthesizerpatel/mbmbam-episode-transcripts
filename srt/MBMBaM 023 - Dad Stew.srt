1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If you're all alone, with a pretty person, honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you got no place to go, with a pretty person, honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
True. Or just Ja!

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We be jammin'!

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
No, I don't think that.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
No, you don't.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Maybe in jam making.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Speaking of which, we've gotten way too many jam making questions lately.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Guys, do we look like we know about preservatives and shit?

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That is so, so not our area of expertise.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah. We don't know anything about marmalade. You want to bring that marmalade heat, you're gonna find some willing participants right here.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But as far as just straight preserves.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Fruit preserves.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Pickling, brining.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Griffin German.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Apple butter? What's up?

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is an advice show.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
As you've probably already deduced, this is an advice show for the modern era.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So we're just going to, oh, my name's Justin McElroy, by the way.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm Travis McElroy, BT dubs.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's what? It's just even shorter than BT dubs.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's new school.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You guys ready for a question?

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You guys ready to help some people out?

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Can we talk about something real quick?

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Please do.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't know why, I just wanted to wrap.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I feel like there are events that are happening regarding the show that we should discuss.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, oh, oh.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, I was going to wait until the end to talk about that, but we were...

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I mean, let's just thank everyone up front.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah, well, thank you.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's been so cool.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
For us in a, I think it's votejet.com or something.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah, prestigious.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
They're basically like the Oscars.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's like a Gallup poll.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Very official.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Gallagher.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Like a Gallagher poll.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's basically like a Gallagher poll.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Like a Sledge-O-Matic.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Anyway, they're doing this contest for the top comedy podcast,

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and we're currently in third place because people have been voting for us off the chains.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Thank you so much for doing that.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We're in third, eleventh, and fourteenth, I believe.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah, we're in a lot of places because their polling system needs some work.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It does need some work.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They need to put all our votes together.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But we certainly appreciate your efforts there and your support.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
As always, it means a lot to us.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You have no idea how good it does our heart.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We want to help you, though, by making you smarter and probably safer with our advice.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So here we go.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Say you're walking and you see an attractive lady as Swarmspring.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is a sexy hypothetical so far.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Good start.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Sexy start.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You want to appreciate her attractive features,

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
but you also don't want to come across like some creepy construction worker.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What's etiquette?

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
If you see her while making eye contact as you pass, help.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Swarmspring.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You have to make some audible noise.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Some audible noise has to come into the equation.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't know if it has to be a fully formed sentence or what,

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
but you do have to.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
She's not going to get it just with a sideways glance.

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You've got to give her like that.

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh, but she's going to get it.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You know what's up.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hey, and joking aside, don't do anything.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's the 21st century.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Are you kidding me?

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's a bow.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Mouth siren.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're a human being.

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You're a human male.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You take a look at her as she's approaching you.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You decide instantly whether or not she would be a suitable sexual partner,

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and then you keep that decision to yourself.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You walk home and you watch some TV.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's your day.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's your afternoon.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's not going to be like, hey, lady, I like your gams.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Getaway sticks.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Nice pins, lady.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Nice pins, babe.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You, Lou, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Give her a good work there.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Nice work you've done there.

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Just look at her and just say, nice.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's a handsome package you've put together there.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I like what you've done with all this.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't do any of that.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Shake what your mama gave you, but say it as you're walking away and go to full spread.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Just look at her and say, I'm sorry.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You don't realize what an inconvenience that is for that woman that you've called out on the street.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Even if you did this with the most chaste intentions, it's probably going to be creepy for that woman.

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Unless you are immensely attractive.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If you're immensely attractive, you say whatever you want, okay?

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You can do whatever you want if you're immensely attractive.

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Physically attractive.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You can lean out of your Mustang and say, I'll never appreciate you, and she'll hop on in.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yep.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sort of like your dad.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's go.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll ignore you most of the time.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay, I would suggest a warm smile.

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If you give someone a warm smile, if they are creeped out by a warm smile, they're the creep.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Because you were just smiling.

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But it also says, hi, we made eye contact.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Warm smile.

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And maybe you'll see something in there.

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Some sort of like that spark.

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If she's the one, she'll know it.

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's the sound my sparks make, too.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Like you're a transformer.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But you've got to practice that warm smile.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Practice it.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
If you give her a creepy Cheshire Cat snagglepuss smile.

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If you look in the mirror right now, you're probably working with something positively reptilian.

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
If you can't pull it off, try doffing your cap and saying, ma'am.

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
If you love press.

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I like it.

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't do that.

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Why not?

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I can't get behind the...

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What if you do it in a fun accent?

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
There's no way to not do that.

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Excuse me, madam.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You can't do it without a fun accent.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I fucking hate those dudes.

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Who try to pick up the accent as far as by...

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Fancy a shag.

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Some sort of creepy affectation.

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh, man.

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And then you've got to scuttle off.

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Boop boop boo.

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You're gone.

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I do not believe that there is a good way to pick up someone as you're walking in the opposite direction from them.

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Hang a U-turn and just follow them.

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah, exactly.

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Give them a flat tire.

153
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Step on their heel.

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And make their shoe come off.

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And be like, oh, how awkward.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Stay about three feet behind them and say things like, where you headed?

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Where you going?

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm right here.

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll just be with you for a while.

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm with the FBI.

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So I feel like we've helped him enough.

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Is it ever acceptable to go to a bar alone?

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't have a lot of friends who are over 21 and I really can't have them over at my apartment for parties.

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is the guy from last week who just wanted to go to bars and he lost all his friends.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Now he wants to know if he can go to a bar by himself.

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I would say that it is a...

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Unless you are, again, just really overwhelmingly physically attractive and can almost be guaranteed to go home with a sexual partner that evening.

168
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Or at least get a phone number or something.

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Or make a new friend.

170
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah, that's the thing.

171
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
There are more reasons to go to a bar than to...

172
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Here's the thing.

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I've thought about this question a lot.

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And the answer is yes, it is acceptable to go to a bar alone.

175
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It depends on what kind of bar you're going to.

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If you're going to a sports bar and you're going to be hanging out with a bunch of people that you can have discussions with about what's going on in the game or whatever.

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And form new friendships and talk to people.

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah, it's a great place to meet new people and make friends.

179
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If you're going to a bar to sit in a table in the corner by yourself and drink 20 beers, no, that's not okay.

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I actually went to a bar alone last night.

181
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Just because I didn't really do much of anything this week as far as leaving the house.

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And I work from home, so sometimes I have to make myself go out.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I don't think I've ever met anyone at a bar, really.

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But it's nice to just get out of the house and be surrounded by other people and have a drink and watch the wrap up of the day's baseball contests.

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The good thing about going to a bar alone is that you can really feel free, especially if you're looking to mix up your situation, i.e. meeting new people, trying new things, whatever.

186
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If you don't go with anybody you know, there's no real expectation to quote unquote be yourself.

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You can sort of try different things and be whatever kind of person you want to and no one's going to call you out on it.

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Like speak with a foppish British affectation.

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Don't do that.

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
In my circle of friends, I'm that guy who knows nothing about sports.

191
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But I could go to a sports bar and be that guy who's really into football and no one around me is going to go, you don't know anything about football.

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But when you start shouting, asking when the Orioles are playing, you're probably going to get some.

193
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I think the best thing to do if you're going to a bar by yourself is to think of it as becoming a regular in a bar.

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
There's a bar in Huntington called Hanks, which is a great place to do that.

195
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Like the same 20 people are there every day.

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And it's a place where, you know, the few times I've gone there, I know the people there now.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So a bar like that, great.

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't go to like a club by yourself because then you're creepy.

199
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But, you know, go into like a hangout.

200
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No, I think it's OK to go to a club, especially if it's like a dance zone.

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You want to be able to like get out there and just shake it.

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Like you want to be able to, with every song that comes on, no matter how bad it is, be able to throw your hands up with wild abandon and say, that's my jam.

203
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You're saying like go to a bar alone, leave the bar alone.

204
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Sam, feel the rain on your skin and just for once just get out there, you know?

205
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is where your book begins.

206
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This is still unwritten.

207
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
In fact, if you're wondering about your book and where to kick it off, it's here.

208
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Feel the rain on your skin.

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This is the answer to our second question.

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Setting a good pace for this one.

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Good pace.

212
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yahoo Answers.

213
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This Yahoo Answer was sent in by Wax Catharsis.

214
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Thank you, Wax Catharsis.

215
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
He's becoming a platinum submitter of funny Yahoo questions.

216
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He gets access to the lounge.

217
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's from Yahoo Answers user know-it-all who asks, who sings better, Justin Bieber or Cisco?

218
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The thong song.

219
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What?

220
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's all part of the question.

221
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Why wouldn't he hook us up with a Bieber title?

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He goes on to explain the thong song was the biggest single since Billie Jean, Michael Jackson.

223
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Do you think that Justin can top that?

224
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
He's coming from the Cisco side.

225
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
He's defending Cisco here.

226
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
He has got that full-on Cisco heat.

227
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Cisco is the greatest artist that has lived since Michael Jackson.

228
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm pretty sure he had the number one single.

229
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
One of his friends said, Bieber is the greatest musical artist of our generation.

230
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
He said, excuse me, what about Cisco?

231
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
He was laughed down.

232
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
He turned to his only friend, the internet, to prove him right.

233
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yahoo Answers is always there for you.

234
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That Cisco knowledge.

235
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Where do you guys stand?

236
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Do you view Bieber or Cisco?

237
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Bieber has so much to go through in his life that Cisco has already gone through.

238
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So you're saying Cisco's got the experience?

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Or do you say Bieber still has so much in front of him that he can be shaped and formed by his experiences to a sum that is greater than Cisco?

240
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I think that what needs to happen is a musical apprenticeship of Justin Bieber to Cisco.

241
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh my god, reformed Drew Hill with Cisco, Justin Bieber, Ellen DeGeneres.

242
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And that kid from Hanson.

243
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The little one.

244
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The kid from Hanson.

245
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The littlest one.

246
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The baby.

247
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The one that's like three or four.

248
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Still.

249
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Forever.

250
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The forever baby.

251
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Super group.

252
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Forever baby is another good name for our band.

253
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Call them the traveling Wilburys too.

254
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
They'll just go around.

255
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Here's the thing though.

256
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
They would never collaborate on a single musical project.

257
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
They would only do versions of their own composite songs.

258
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Like they would sing thong songs.

259
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
They would sing Baby.

260
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Listening to one of their CDs would be tantamount to listening to it now.

261
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's what I call music in 1994.

262
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's the experience.

263
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
How many of those did you guys own?

264
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Be honest.

265
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Zero.

266
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Zero.

267
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I owned three.

268
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What?

269
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah, I owned three of them.

270
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The third one was an ironic present from Justin Minsker.

271
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And how many times did you listen to that ironic present?

272
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh, a lot of times.

273
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
A lot of times.

274
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
There's a really good fastball cut on that one.

275
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
A really deep cut.

276
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
A deep cut?

277
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They got it out to the bernyard fastball track.

278
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Was it um, was it perchance the way?

279
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Hey my bim bam.

280
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I recently started dating this guy and he's really awesome and everything.

281
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But I don't think he changes his sheets often.

282
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
How can I encourage him to tidy things up a bit?

283
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Ooh, this is a great question because this is one of those weird like um,

284
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I find that a lot of people have made that jump from childhood to adulthood

285
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
and not picked up on the fact that you got to change your sheets.

286
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I had no idea.

287
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Travis had no clue.

288
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm not going to say how often I change my sheets, but how often is regular?

289
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You're supposed to do it twice a month.

290
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Twice a month, realistically, people are doing it once a month.

291
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Let's be honest.

292
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
What if you don't sleep on your sheets?

293
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What if you sleep on top of a comforter?

294
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Then you're some kind of caveman.

295
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You're a caveman.

296
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You're sleeping on bearskin rugs.

297
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What if you don't want to bother with changing your sheets?

298
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So you sleep on top of a comforter and then use a quilt.

299
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What if you sleep hanging upside down in your closet?

300
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And you use a quilt for a blanket.

301
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Do I have to change my comforter?

302
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Is it whatever layer you sleep on top of?

303
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's whatever you put your dirty skin on you dirty fuck.

304
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This is why you have bed bugs.

305
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This is why America has bed bugs.

306
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Bed bugs don't just come from your body.

307
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Your body isn't dirty and then bed bugs come out of it.

308
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Bed bugs live in your eyes.

309
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Everybody knows that.

310
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Hey, don't joke around about that because then I'm going to have thoughts.

311
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Justin once convinced me that there were tiny spiders that lived in my eyes.

312
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And that's what made the sleep crust when you wake up.

313
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh god damn it.

314
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Awesome.

315
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And you love spiders too, which is the best thing.

316
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Okay, so here's the way to do it, okay?

317
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You've got to just change those sheets.

318
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You've got to change your sheets.

320
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But it's not her choice.

321
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's her boyfriend.

322
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Think about what a nice thing that'll seem like.

323
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Hey, I just noticed your sheets were looking a little ratty.

324
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Like maybe it had been a few weeks since you changed them.

325
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And then in his head he'll think, oh shit, it's been a few months.

326
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And he'll be thankful to you for not rubbing it in his face.

327
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But like pretty much every other option you have is going to be super passive aggressive.

328
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What you're going to have to think about is maybe he doesn't have another set of sheets.

329
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Does he?

330
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Buy him new sheets.

331
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Buy him new sheets.

332
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Be like, hey, I was at Walmart and I thought these sheets really matched your curtains or something.

333
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And here you go.

334
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And then give him the option.

335
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Hey, I got a suggestion for reform spring.

336
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
How about you just started dating this guy and you're already intimately familiar with his sheets.

337
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Maybe you need to figure out what you can get right with Jesus.

338
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Think about that.

339
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Maybe.

340
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Think about it.

341
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Nobody's going to milk the cow they buy at the store for free.

342
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Think about it.

343
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That's what my granny always says.

344
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But granny said to me at least.

345
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
She was she was really bad at idioms.

346
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
She was really bad at idioms.

347
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
They used to they used to call her the idiom dummy, which to me was a missed opportunity.

348
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But somebody laughed at that out there.

349
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Trust me.

350
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I have a situation that is.

351
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Oh, that has been long been debated amongst my friends.

352
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Is it wrong to take Nick?

353
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Can we go wrong?

354
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
OK.

355
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Is it wrong to take a naked jacuzzi with your dad and other men in a men's locker room after a hard workout?

356
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
No one.

357
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
No one checks.

358
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
There's there.

359
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
There is.

360
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
OK, before you start leaping to conclusions, no one checks anyone out.

361
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But it seems silly to me to dirty a new swimsuit after working out, especially since it's a five minute jacuzzi before a sauna.

362
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I mean, even if I wore a swimsuit, you are naked under anyway.

363
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
No, no, no.

364
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
OK, let me beat that.

365
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Jeff, let me be devil's advocate for Jeff real quick.

366
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
If you do not wear a swimsuit, you get in a jacuzzi naked with your dad and other friends.

367
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The components of that stew that you're you're you're broiling there is dicks and water.

368
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
OK, can we agree that is a dick, a hot dick and water stew that you are brewing up.

369
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If you wear swimming trunks, then the components to that stew are swimming trunks, water and dicks still.

370
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So if no one's checking anyone out, you're just adding some some cloth and some mesh to to the dick jambalaya that you're you're creating there.

371
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:10,000
OK, but let me counterpoint that by saying that same logic can be applied to any situation in which clothes are worn.

372
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You know, like if we're naked under our clothes anyways, why don't we all just go to school naked?

373
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah, that's not a good that's not a good excuse.

374
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But it's different because we wear clothes in normal life so that nobody can can see our dicks when you're in a jacuzzi.

375
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's not about the site. It's about the knowledge.

376
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's about no, it's about it's about the water convection.

377
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Right. It's all about convection science.

378
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Explain to me this, Jeff. Now, I'm I'm not you, Jeff.

379
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I've not walked a mile in your shoes, but maybe you can explain this to me.

380
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:50,000
If I'm walking through my gymnasium and I'm walking to the sauna and along the path to said sauna,

381
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I see my dad and a bunch of old men naked in a tub and my dad's like, hey, Jeff, do you want to get in this tub with all of us?

382
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
We're naked and our balls are out and everything. Do you want to do you want to get into this?

383
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Jeff, our Jeff, our balls and everything.

384
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Don't even kid yourself. Everything's Jeff.

385
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I have changed my answer. Any scenario that you can enter into that may possibly,

386
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:30,000
even if it's like a zero point zero zero one percent chance of touching dicks with your dad is a scenario that's worth avoiding.

387
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What if there's an earthquake? Oh, no. Get out. No, I'm coming. Oh, no.

388
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I got to get I got to go to the bullet store and kill myself. Jeff, you can't take what?

389
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
OK, why did we even entertain this possibility? Jeff, you can't take naked baths with your dad.

390
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And you get a cell phone call. And someone's like, what are you doing, Jeff?

391
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You're like, I'm just taking a naked bath. My daddy and some old friends and their balls are out.

392
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That's great. Let me give you a formula. All right.

393
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You plus naked dad taking naked bath. Not OK.

394
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Why does adding like eight other naked dudes make it better? That does not make the situation better.

395
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Is my parka too much? No, it's not enough. Jeff, it's never enough.

396
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You're taking a naked bath with your dad's and all his old friends.

397
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm going to go out on a limb and say if you were in eight separate Jacuzzis,

398
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
but only naked and looking at each other, it's not any better.

399
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah, it's not any better. It may be worse.

400
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What's the maximum distance that you have to keep your naked genitalia away from from your dad?

401
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Three states or one layer of cloth.

402
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Unless that cloth is trunks. Now, one addendum.

403
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I think this scenario is OK if you're Greek, if you're like super Greek and not like you have a little bit of Greek in you.

404
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But I'm talking like heavy Greek. No, heavy Greek.

405
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Then it's complete. If you're going heavy Greek, you're OK to take a naked bath with your dad.

406
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's the science. I've started dating an awesome girl.

407
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Oh, rub it in, guy. Yeah, real nice guy who didn't think to sign his email.

408
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Oh, no, no, no. It's two lines. Thanks, Jeff. No problem.

409
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I've started dating an awesome girl. I found out she likes to watch hilariously bad movies.

410
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This is one of my favorite pastimes, so I'm pretty excited.

411
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What terrible films would you recommend for a fun date?

412
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Can anything be both horrible and romantic? OJ.

413
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
OJ. OK, Griffin is going to suggest a film to you that I am going to immediately poo-poo and I will tell you why.

414
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Griffin, go ahead. It's The Room.

415
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
OK, but it's not The Room. Think about this for a second, OK?

416
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You just started dating a girl. You're like, hey, I have this hilariously bad movie.

417
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And at first it will go great. It will go really great.

418
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
For like the first 15 seconds? No, for the first 15.

419
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Well, yeah, yeah, basically for like the first three minutes. There's like a lot of sex scenes and like really gross sex scenes.

420
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And like uncomfortable, non-sexy sex scenes. Like the grossest.

421
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's really gross. I think he's got to get to know her a little better.

422
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I disagree. I mean, I think it depends on what age you are.

423
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I think if Jay's in high school, then maybe not, because that's something that high schoolers aren't ready to see.

424
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Tommy Wiseau's horrible, glistening like swamp thing body thrusting up and down on top of Lisa or whatever that actress's name is.

425
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That is a nightmare. But I think once you're old enough, you can see the humor.

426
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm going to throw a Kung Pow into the fist.

427
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
See, but that's not a terrible movie. But you like that movie.

428
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. But it's like, I mean, it's it's funny, but like it's it's pretty bad.

429
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You feel bad for liking it. Yeah.

430
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'd like to recommend two films that you should check out after last season.

431
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Oh, man. It is really brutal and Birdemic.

432
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
If you can find Birdemic. See on the Birdemic front, get on that Netflix instant queue and just start searching for sci-fi original movies.

433
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's a killer mega shark versus giant octopus. Yeah, that's a good one.

434
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That one's good. How about how about Mega Fault, which was Brittany Murphy's last cinematic onus?

435
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Oh, my God. Not only does she look like she's already dead in that movie, it is.

436
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Oh, come on. It's it's about a giant earthquake that can kill people, even if they're in helicopters in the sky.

437
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
OK, it's a turn. It's apparently. Yeah. So it's a good choice in there, Jay. Jay, I say wait a couple months on the room.

438
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But Justin, what is it that Dwight always makes people watch on Bad Movie Night?

439
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
What is that movie with John Ritter? Oh, no, no. Real Men. That's a fine film.

440
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
No, watch that. It's awesome. Yeah, it's a really good movie.

441
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But God, it's just rub it in Griffin's face day. I'm in a seven year strong relationship with the one.

442
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
What are some good romantic ideas for showing her how much I appreciate her?

443
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
The standby is a nice home cooked meal with candles. Anything that comes to mind?

444
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Forbespring, if you're making your wife a candle at dinner, you are ahead of the curve.

445
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And can I just say, he doesn't say wife. So if that's not the case, how about putting a ring on it?

446
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah, that would be a pretty nice. I think that's why that ring on that was invented.

447
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Yeah. You know what you could do? Get the ring and then keep focusing on the dinner thing.

448
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So that way, if you ever burn dinner, you have a backup plan.

449
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Sorry about the roast, but do you want to spend the rest of your life with me?

450
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Do I have to eat your gross burnt roast? If so, no. Nope.

451
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Eat as much roast as you want. That's what marriage is. Eating as much roast as you want.

452
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I think you got to just surprise her. I think that is the best way.

453
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Surprise. Thoughtful surprise. Skywriting. Skywriting.

454
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Guywriting is good. Have a guy have naked men spill it out in your lawn.

455
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Guywriting is great. In a jacuzzi. Freshly jacuzzi.

456
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Hey, by the way, retroactively, Jeff, jacuzzi is not a verb. Stop it.

457
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
We took a jacuzzi together.

458
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
We took a jacuzzi. No, you didn't. No, you didn't.

459
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You took a dick bath together.

460
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I jacuzzi you of taking a naked bath with your dad.

461
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I feel like we've already ruined his chance at romance for his whole life with this episode.

462
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
He'll be lucky if he can feel anything ever again.

463
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Here's a romantic idea. Don't let her listen to this episode.

464
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah, that's it. Baby, I was going to make you listen to this podcast I like, but then I decided not to.

465
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You're welcome. Surprise.

466
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yeah, she'll know.

467
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Griffin, you got a Yahoo? I do, actually. I was just about to bust it out.

468
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Break it off. This one was sent in by Mike Susek. Thank you, Mike Susek.

469
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It comes to us from Yahoo! Insta's user InJordan72.

470
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Hmm. He asks, is it possible to be addicted to Tabasco sauce?

471
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I put Tabasco on everything. I think it may be unhealthy, but I just can't stop.

472
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I went to my local community center, but they said they didn't have any programs for my type of addiction.

473
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I don't know where to turn it. My mouth is on fire. Help.

474
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Hey, I got, you know, a small suggestion that you may find helpful.

475
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Stop eating so much fucking Tabasco sauce.

476
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Yeah. Why don't you try just if you're about to put it on there.

477
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
If you see yourself opening the cap of a large bottle of Tabasco,

478
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
then don't do that and go do something else instead.

479
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I am going to throw out, though. Here's my thought.

480
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
If all he's been doing is putting Tabasco sauce on everything and like burning his mouth,

481
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
everything is going to taste like cardboard now, like wet nothing cardboard.

482
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Oh, he's killed. Mix it up. Get the planet's finest condiment, Sriracha, and start putting it on stuff.

483
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Mix it up. I guess I got some garlic in there. Got some Thai chilies. Delicious.

484
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
There's this show that I've started watching recently.

485
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's called Freaky Eaters, and it's about people addicted to weird things.

486
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And I watched this episode the other day where a girl drank 30 cans of soda a day.

487
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
That's not OK.

488
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Maybe don't cure your addiction. Get on TV.

489
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
That's what I'm saying. Hook that shit up.

490
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Get that money.

491
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You guys remember when I used to put Tabasco on everything?

492
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And then your stomach revolted.

493
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yeah, my stomach died. So that's a very serious side effect.

494
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
What most people don't know is Griffin has a monkey stomach.

495
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I do have a monkey stomach.

496
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You know what Griffin's favorite fruit is now?

497
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Nanners?

498
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Pears. Actually, weird. That's weird. It seems like a missed opportunity.

499
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Tabasco pears. Griffin loves them. Can't get enough.

500
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Is it OK to request an attractive girl in my class after talking with her and sharing a bunch of laughs today in class,

501
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
even if I'm not sure she even knows my name?

502
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I should have said friend request.

503
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I just said request.

504
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I request that woman, please.

505
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Would you like to?

506
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I've had a couple classes with her in college the past year,

507
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and I would like to get to know her and ask her out eventually,

508
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
but this is the first where we've actually talked to each other.

509
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Appreciate the advice. Sincerely, Facebooked. Gmail.

510
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I love it. I love it.

511
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I feel like we have made it as an advice organization because of these pseudonyms.

512
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah.

513
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
This is our second question about this whole adding a friend thing.

514
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I think this is a new wrinkle in the Facebook era,

515
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
where it bothers me, but at the same time it's so convenient.

516
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It makes stopping so easy.

517
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Yeah, I feel like though you're going to miss out on –

518
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I feel like if you Facebook friend request a girl that you don't know that well,

519
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
you're going to miss out on a lot of the stuff, the good stuff that comes with getting to know somebody.

520
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
There's so much you could dig up there in a creepy way, not in a good way.

521
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Part of this problem is that a lot of us put too much on the internet for people to look at.

522
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I get that.

523
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Here's the thing.

524
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Socializing over the internet, it's convenient,

525
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
and it may allow you to interact with people that you normally wouldn't,

526
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
but ultimately on the grand scale of social interaction,

527
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
it's kind of like eating corn chips in that you can eat a whole bunch of corn chips

528
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and never really get full.

529
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's empty calories as far as socializing goes.

530
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
If I could translate that into human language.

531
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I would rather have one really good long conversation with a person than a hundred Facebook chats,

532
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
because ultimately I don't think those add up to anything.

533
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I got that, but it takes little to no effort to accept your friend request on Facebook,

534
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
so it means nothing.

535
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And you're going to get the wrong idea.

536
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Yeah, and she says yes, and you're like, yeah, she added me as a friend.

537
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
She probably doesn't even know who you are,

538
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
but it's so easy to just click yes rather than try to figure out who that person is.

539
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I'm officially on the side of I don't think it's a good idea to use Facebook to get a relationship going.

540
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Use the old-fashioned way. I think you'll be better off in the long run.

541
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I think that it can work, but it's probably not going to.

542
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
There's no added benefit to using Facebook.

543
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It just seems like a way to hide behind Facebook.

544
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Just go talk to her.

545
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
If you had a good conversation with her, play off of that.

546
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Yeah, keep talking to her.

547
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You know what I'd like to see?

548
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
It meets space.

549
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'd like to see an entire relationship that lasts an entire lifetime that just only takes place on Facebook.

550
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:05,000
The two people never have any real-life physical interaction, just pokes and chats and wall posts.

551
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And they create a baby.

552
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
They create a poke baby.

553
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Poke baby.

554
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I have created several poke babies with our listeners.

555
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Man, the pokes are blowing up, guys.

556
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
They are blowing up.

557
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Every time I log on, it's like 30 to 40 pokes.

558
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Then I have to take five minutes to respond to all of them, but it's worth it.

559
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It's totally worth it.

560
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Keep those pokes going, folks.

561
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Keep going, pokes.

562
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It's how you show you care.

563
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I met the most amazing girl a few weeks ago.

564
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Jesus Christ.

565
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Wow.

566
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Ouch.

567
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
She's intelligent, classy, beautiful, loves wine and art.

568
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Sounds too good for you.

569
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Yep.

570
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Anyway, I'm not liking the way this is going, but let her go.

571
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Keep at it.

572
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Anyways, I manned up, got her number, and asked her out on a date a week after I met her.

573
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You ask her out in real life.

574
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
That already puts you ahead of the curve.

575
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
We went out, and it was absolutely amazing.

576
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
One of the best dates I've ever been on.

577
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
We went out to a nice dinner, raking up a bill close to $80.

578
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Well, I've got a fairly good job.

579
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It was still a bit expensive for my taste.

580
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Problem is that if we're going on a second date soon, which will include dinner, and I'm not sure if I should take her to a similar place or if things will go fine if we go somewhere cheaper.

581
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It's only been one date, but I'm afraid I've set a standard for outings hereafter.

582
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
What are your thoughts on the amount you spent on dates in San Francisco?

583
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I have the best answer for this, like legitimately good answer.

584
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
For what?

585
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You need to trade the cost of that dinner for the amount of thought you put into the date.

586
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So, a picnic doesn't cost you a lot of money, but if you set it up really nice, it's more impressive than an $80 dinner.

587
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So true.

588
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
That is such a good point.

589
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Yes.

590
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Unless she a gold digger.

591
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
She a gold digger?

592
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Which is a great time to find that out on the second date.

593
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Yeah, good point.

594
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It's either going to like separate the wheat from the chaff or it's going to save you a few bucks.

595
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It is a win either way.

596
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But guys, she is intelligent, classy, beautiful, loves wine and art.

597
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
You can't take a fine, fine woman like that to Benagans.

598
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But you don't.

599
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm not saying go to Benagans.

600
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Griffin, you're not paying attention.

601
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
You're not thinking.

602
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Take her to a museum where there is no admission but suggested donations.

603
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
She loves art.

604
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And then suggest that if she wants to donate, she do it from her own purse.

605
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Yep.

606
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Buy a $15 bottle of wine from Kroger.

607
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Fuck that.

608
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Three buck chuck.

609
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And go on a cheese and crackers picnic.

610
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You're in San Francisco.

611
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
You have great parks there.

612
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Right?

613
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I see it in Full House every Thursday.

614
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I know.

615
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It's hard to have a picnic in those parks though because I mean if you have any round

616
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
fruits, they'll just like roll right down the blanket.

617
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And the tanners are always raising a ruckus.

618
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You know them.

619
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Get out of here Comet.

620
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Get out of my potato salad.

621
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Get out of my potato salad Comet.

622
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I have a crush on a guy.

623
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I've worked with him for a while.

624
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
He is the reason I got into my boom-bam.

625
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Oh, I like him already.

626
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I know I am hot enough to go.

627
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Nice.

628
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I love it.

629
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I love it.

630
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's awesome.

631
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Do I A. bed him and lose my best friend I work with or B. not bed him.

632
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
How do I not sleep with someone I have a crush on?

633
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
P.S. would keep it in my pants for Griffin McElroy.

634
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Tasha.

635
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Thank you.

636
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
What does that mean?

637
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I have one question here.

638
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
What kind of praying mantis are you that if you sleep with him you lose him and kill him?

639
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Where does he go?

640
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I think Tasha, I think honestly that you, it is more fun to have someone at work that

641
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
you flirt with and have the possibility of doing it than to do it and it's like weird

642
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
forever.

643
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Yeah.

644
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You know?

645
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I don't know.

646
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
What do you guys think?

647
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Well it depends.

648
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Do you have a crush on him and you want to do him or do you like him?

649
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Or do you want to have sex with him and then eat him apparently?

650
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And then eat his head and lay eggs in his throat.

651
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Did you lay?

652
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Listen I had a great time last night.

653
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Me too.

654
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Did you lay eggs in my thorax?

655
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
That's really weird.

656
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I've got to say I feel a gurgling down in my midsection.

657
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It's very odd.

658
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I think Tasha if we're voting I say don't have sex with him and kill him but maybe

659
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
and also Tasha you're hot enough to bet him he should be advancing on you.

660
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Let him set the pace of this.

661
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
He should come to you.

662
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
He should come to you.

663
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I think you need to start making jokes about doing him but never actually doing it but

664
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
always have that possibility hanging in the air.

665
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Wait a minute.

666
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Wait a minute.

667
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Wait a minute.

668
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
This guy listens to the show.

669
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
We're officially advising this girl to give him a cold shirt.

670
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Listen.

671
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Okay listen.

672
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Dude we're doing it for your own good.

673
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
She wants to eat you.

674
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
She's going to lay eggs in your thorax.

675
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
She's going to eat your face and lay eggs in your face.

676
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Have you ever seen Species?

677
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
We have a unique opportunity right now because this is the first time that we've gotten

678
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
a question like this where both parties we know are listening to the show.

679
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Whoa.

680
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I think instead of advising them to do one or the other we should just say you two kids

681
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
just swap tartar sauce like the next time you see each other but Tasha don't eat it.

682
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
They need to make out in the supply closet toot sweet.

683
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
What is it?

684
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Toot sweet.

685
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Today is Monday.

686
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
They're probably not listening to the show before work.

687
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
We'll say after work so Tuesday morning.

688
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Tuesday morning.

689
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
No discussion.

690
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I will say 10 o'clock supply closet Tasha and Doug or whatever your name is.

691
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Wednesday morning I will keep an eye out for all of the newspaper reports about people

692
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
over the country named Tasha and blank filing sexual harassment suits.

693
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Or getting murdered and getting eggs laid in their abdomen.

694
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
One of those two.

695
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
One of those two.

696
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I want to hear Griffin's last question but I feel like there's a few housekeeping things

697
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
we need to take care of.

698
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
First off NBNBAM.com is our website.

699
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You can go there to ask us questions, to find links, to buy t-shirts which I would suggest

700
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
you do because supplies are running low.

701
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So if you'd like a t-shirt you want to stock up for the holiday season.

702
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
We want to issue some new items but we're kind of holding off on that until we sell

703
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
through on this stuff.

704
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So if you want something go get it.

705
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And if you want something new, if there's an item you think you'd like to see on there

706
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
please let us know.

707
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Drop us a line.

708
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
We can make original artwork.

709
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
If there's a phrase that a lot of people would like on a t-shirt.

710
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I know we've had some requests for pack your bags and move away on a t-shirt.

711
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And really the holiday rush has begun.

712
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I don't know if you guys knew that but it's in full swing.

713
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So I think the best present for your Christmas or your Hanukkah or your Ramadan or your Kwanzaa

714
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
is a BIMBAM shirt.

715
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yep.

716
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Forever.

717
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Every holiday.

718
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Shirts will last you forever.

719
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
They're the gift that keeps on giving warmth.

720
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Fashion.

721
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Protection.

722
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Protection from spears and arrows and things.

723
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
No it doesn't do that.

724
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And also jibes.

725
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Jibes.

726
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
No one's going to take a shot at you without shirt on.

727
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And if you get a second and you want to review our podcast on iTunes that's great because

728
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
it helps to turn people onto it.

729
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And subscribe.

730
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Please subscribe and download.

731
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
We have had a couple listening parties.

732
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
We recorded invitations to them this week.

733
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
If you're getting a few friends together to listen to BIMBAM.

734
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Introduce some new people to the show.

735
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Let's shout them out.

736
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Jeff Monloch.

737
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Jeff Monloch.

738
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And John Nugent.

739
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
John Nugent.

740
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Both having parties.

741
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Turning them out.

742
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
If you want to be in that.

743
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,000
John Nugent is in BIMBAM Fan Club 2.

744
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Beta.

745
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Beta.

746
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Beta.

747
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Beta.

748
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Okay.

749
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Beta.

750
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And Monloch is Fan Club Prime.

751
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So if you want to be on that exclusive list of cool fan clubs that have BIMBAM parties.

752
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Please email us.

753
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Let us know.

754
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You know.

755
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Tell us about your party.

756
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Who's coming.

757
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Whatever.

758
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
We'll record something for you.

759
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Special.

760
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Just to keep you sort of in close to our bosom.

761
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Don't fake us out though.

762
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Don't fake us out.

763
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You got to send pictures or it didn't happen.

764
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Pics or it didn't happen.

765
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And thank you so, so much for listening.

766
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I haven't checked the download count in a while but I'm sure it's over a million.

767
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
This week it was seven.

768
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Seven people got it.

769
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
But those seven people really liked it.

770
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Yeah.

771
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Oh.

772
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Oh.

773
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
We have a voicemail too.

774
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Which.

775
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:53,000
The number for which is 203 MBMBAM1.

776
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Okay.

777
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So give us a call on that and just talk.

778
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
We got a few calls this week and I love listening to them.

779
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You listen to all of them, right?

780
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I listen to every single one.

781
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I just like hearing their voices.

782
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
You know.

783
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Yeah.

784
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Right.

785
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Especially if they sound real serious because you can tell they're nervous and I like that.

786
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
That's a turn on for me.

787
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I can taste their fear.

788
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Last question.

789
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Hit me.

790
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Hit me.

791
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Break me off a slice.

792
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I'm debating between two.

793
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
All right.

794
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Choose wisely.

795
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,000
This one was also sent in by Mike Susek.

796
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It's from.

797
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Oh God.

798
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I don't even know how to pronounce this name.

799
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
It's from Yahoo Answers user Binguenide Street.

800
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
God damn it guys.

801
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Who asks, how can I grow a Tom Selleck like mustache like Magnum P.I.?

802
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
How am I supposed to break to this?

803
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm Justin McElroy.

804
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm Travis McElroy.

805
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

806
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And this has been my brother, my brother, me.

807
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

808
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You will never know me.

809
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Unless you're in a dick soup together.

810
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Then don't.

811
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I'm Justin McElroy.
