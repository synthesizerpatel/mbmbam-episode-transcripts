1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,960
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260

28
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:47,500
String a baseball card like strength style more Pokemon like strength stat how much energy it costs for me to do my like flexing powers

29
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
That makes all right like fall down

30
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,340
Now I've done one here and that one that one's that one's like nine books

31
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,460
I've done one here where what I've done it so you guys know the Mona Lisa, right? Yes

32
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,540
So yes, I took a picture of that when I was at the Louvre. Yeah, and then I

33
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,780
photoshopped in

34
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,940
An engorged penis instead of the face. Oh

35
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,340
Call it boner Lisa and before you ask for hey, we're not in work of art

36
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,340
We're not I understand I understand into it, but it is kind of a tribute to yeah

37
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,820
Thank you. Yes a little bit still kept the enigmatic smile. This is a boner with a secret and

38
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:35,440
That one the bidding actually started at $50,000, but it's already been more or less purchased. We're in final talks

39
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,340
Tom Hanks wants to buy it and option it and write a script about it

40
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:46,180
Yeah, kind of I think it's like a da Vinci code spin-off or something. Yeah, so that's more or less spoken for at this point

41
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,820
So these are really exciting and we're using

42
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,420

43
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,420

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,860
This episode every word I'm saying right now. It's just like money money when I'm saying the words money money money money money

56
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,540

through

62
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,900
Check this out

63
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,220
Bazinga

64
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:14,260
So I'm gonna NFT that that just that one sort of one and a half second sound bite. Sorry. Wait. Oh

65
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,340
Oh

66
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,980
They got another press conference starting here. Oh, so we got a ring. Thank you. Yeah

67
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,620
Thank you so much for coming and we'll turn everything right now

68
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,220
Hello everybody, thank you for thank you for coming today

69
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
Gosh where to begin? Yeah

70
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:40,940
Mistakes were made we are but first let me begin with an apology. Yeah, we did not consider

71
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,820
our

72
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,660
NFT program

73
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:52,340
Before we announced it. Yeah to you the the listening public and for that we are I mean so sorry

74
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,060
Really really so and I know what you're thinking. But then how did you schedule this press conference?

75
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,820
This was going to be a bit of a victory lap press conference because we thought we had done

76
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,160
We thought we've figured out you know, he's and we're gonna brag about how good we did

77
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,280
um, but you know, uh, you know, yeah, you make a plan and God laughs

78
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,360
Some of the things we've heard one if I could just run down

79
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,480
One

80
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Stupid yeah, like that's

81
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
That was a big one

82
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:34,240
Number two killing the planet. Yeah, there are apparently these things they're not so nifty for old Mother Earth

83
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,140
Yeah, which is weird. It's just me saying Bazinga and then a thousand trees die

84
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,960
Now to be fair

85
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,320
Boner Lisa is a lot of giggle bites. It's

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,120
It's it's about a hundred GBS. It's uncompressed all the way

87
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,600
Yeah, if you tweeted when you were listening to the first part of this

88
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,540
About how mad you were. Yeah, we hope you will now

89
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:05,620
We did see that we heard you and if you could issue a retraction like thank goodness

90
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:12,180
They're doing the right thing. Yeah, boy. These guys always they say the McElroy's they usually get it right in the end

91
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,060
Right. This is probably our quickest turnaround

92
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,140
Yeah, I think from three guys that announced the slay the live shows and cancel them the next day

93
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,780
So like this is actually a new land speed a new land shame record for us, which is here

94
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:31,020
And I do want to Tom Hanks if you're listening, I will not be returning the down payment on Boner Lisa. That is already spent

95
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:39,060
You know what? It's a real fucking crypto geek. Yeah, well, he loves it cuz he first got into it cuz he was like Crips

96
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,740
I love exploring those things and then I explained to him but he's had already invested millions of dollars, right?

97
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,460
And I did want to say to Elon Musk. I think you stink, but thank you

98
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,780
Thank you for the seven and a half million dollars for Bazinga

99
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,620
I notice you've been putting it in all your tweets

100
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,500
You've been embedding the Bazinga soundbite in all your tweets, which I did not know was possible

101
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,660
and it's it is fit is funny and

102
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,580
I

103
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:11,260
Guess I guess that's all I did again personally on like a personal moral level. I I do think that you are

104
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:19,020
Shit head belongs in the garbage, but I do I I'm gonna do so much good with that eight and a half million

105
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,180
I forget what I said is a lot of money though

106
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,180
So thank you, and we're sorry

107
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,900
Well, not that Tom Hanks

108
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,660
I'm sorry to Tom Hanks about what that's just cuz I haven't watched it yet

109
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,980
Yeah, oh yeah, I got I keep getting those texts like what do you think and I'm like, it's next

110
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,780
Next on this buddy promise. I've been saying that for a while and then Witcher came out and I was like, oh man

111
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,020
I gotta watch Witcher first and he's like I get it. I get it

112
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,580
I love Geralt and all of his wacky shenanigans, but then you'll watch fence, right?

113
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,660
And I was like, well, it's not really I don't know if it's a holiday appropriate and he was like, oh, yeah

114
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,180
I get that but like January 2nd, and I was like you got it buddy, and I know I'm not going to

115
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:03,860
Like a cowboy bebop rewatch. Well, it's more like a rework. They should have a name for a rewatch that you do the first time

116
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,740
Yeah

117
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,700
But it's it's like that from my desk at work a note from Justin McElroy

118
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,300
Re the NFT

119
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,700
From the desk of Justin, well

120
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,980
Team McElroy, we let you down again and gosh gosh. It's a tough one

121
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,620
I have a door that opens into a common hallway

122
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,860
Door

123
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,940
Everyone who goes past can see me and I can overhear any conversations in the hall. I can show it all

124
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,620
I'm just watching the game controlling. I

125
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:47,100
I just heard another co-worker telling someone that there was birthday cake downstairs and that they should go as a group to get some

126
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:54,580
However, I don't know whose birthday it is and that co-worker didn't explicitly invite me even though she could see me at my desk

127
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,580
I really want free cake

128
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:03,180
But I'm afraid it's gonna be awkward if I go down to this party alone and I'm invited brothers

129
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,820
How can I invite myself down for some cake? That's from cake conundrum in California

130
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,380
I

131
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:15,780
Listen, it's go please. Yeah, I feel like this is a non-problem, right if there's they're all non-problems

132
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,860
Travis we got a podcast. Yeah, we don't put we don't include actual problems

133
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,900
If the statement is made there is birthday cake downstairs now what I am assuming here

134
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,660
Because there's no other details given that even though it is a separate floor

135
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,260
It is the same business that this is not like a different business that you would be

136
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:40,500
Oh interesting. That's a different thing. But as long as this is like the same business and just a different floor of the office

137
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,940
The cakes there for everybody whether you know who that person is or not, right? Like yeah

138
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:52,500
There has never been an office birthday cake in which you had to pass a test of like answering

139
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,640
Personal questions about the person and chances are there are names on the ding-dang thing

140
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,260
It's but no

141
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,900
I don't think I don't think this is as risk-free as you're making it out to be because there's gonna be a lot of people

142
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,100
down there and if you're not the type of person that usually

143
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,900
Socializes and you grab yourself a big honking piece of cake that had the one that actually has

144
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,620
Deremey's face on it

145
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,860
Then they're not gonna they're not gonna just let that slide

146
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,220
Can can I I don't want to be a real fud fuddy-duddy and I know that's a real fud rucker

147
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,740
I occupy the fud rucker sector on this show more times than I prefer but

148
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,020
most

149
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,660
birthday cake specifically store-bought birthday cake is not like

150
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,900
very good

151
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,740
or at least not as not so good that it merits this kind of like

152
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,540
What I would call bold sort of social interaction. Oh

153
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:54,860
No, no, it's like somebody has been living away from Kroger for too long

154
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:01,380
It has you've forgotten the face of your whippy because Kroger Kroger whippy is worth it

155
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,340
Sure, Kroger with hey folks. Have you never had a cake Kroger whip?

156
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,300
It's a bad get yourself and do a Kroger right away and get you some whipping

157
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,300
Not only that Griffin, but I know you I've known you for a long time

158
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,820
You've never had a traditional office job. So you do not know the joy to try data

159
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,900
I guess that's true for one. I don't know you at all. You're a complete stranger to me

160
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,180
but maybe you've just forgotten in the intervening years the joy of

161
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,500
Having any kind of blip of difference in the day

162
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,300
We're like you go into work and you're like, this is a normal day, right?

163
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:38,020
Yeah, and then all it takes is like you could have a surprise piece of cake no matter what the quality

164
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:44,740
Well, that's different right that feeling of it's not about if the cake is good or not. It's that it's

165
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,140
Different than not cake. That's fair, but I

166
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:56,500
It's I've had so many crumbly ass birthday cakes. Hey, can I just a quick aside? I did tell Henry

167
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,420
Like early this year about how Tommy Smurl fired me

168
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,060
a very good job during my summer working at tri-data and

169
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,140
to this day he still

170
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,020
leverages that in any sort of example where he needs to

171
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,260
Take me down a peg or two

172
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,780
Wow, just a lot of like you better come to the blue room and play with me or else

173
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,980
I'm gonna call Tommy to have him fire you again. Oh, yeah

174
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,060
Or is this true? It is a hundred percent true

175
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,660
The first time he did it was kind of sweet because he was like when we go to when we go home for Christmas

176
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:40,140
I'm not I'm gonna yell at Tommy because he fired you and I was like damn that would be one fucking hysterical

177
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:45,020
Yeah, it's too really sweet. But now he's decided like it's good that Tommy fired me

178
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:51,140
You know, I've been I've been reviewing the logs you were behind on your quotas. Yeah, fucking of course

179
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,140
I was dog. You went to Bonnaroo. I know

180
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,780
No, I mean even when I was at that job, I was still I was buddy the elf making etch-a-sketches. I was a fucking idiot

181
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,120
anyway

182
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,120
Can we talk to the wizard for a sec?

183
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,580
Yeah, let's approach him

184
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,540
The Wizards got a really wild one for us a real wild ride for us and I would say thank you to the wizard and also

185
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,540
Thank you to drew for sending this in

186
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
How to stop a wedding? Oh

187
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:22,340
We've all seen the movies where a person halts a wedding and progress in order to get the one they truly love in reality

188
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,380
Stopping a wedding is a much more serious undertaking. It involves

189
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,380
It involves a lot of thought and planning and taking an honest look at your motives and intentions if you truly believe the couple

190
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,820
Shouldn't be together and if you believe you're justified in doing so

191
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,680
We have some suggestions for going about stopping a wedding with logic and legal action

192
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,680
Now just real quick check in between me and my brothers here

193
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:50,500
when you got how old were you guys before you had the realization that the

194
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:57,660
If anybody doesn't want them to get married speak now wasn't actually like a normal part of a wedding

195
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,860
Like I that's it doesn't pop up as much when I was a kid

196
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:08,140
I thought that there was a tense moment and every wedding was just like a quick audience poll anybody and if you like well

197
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,740
Only two people raised their hands. So we're gonna keep going with it. I think everybody cool

198
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,660
I mean I get though if I ever heard anybody do it. It's been in like everybody's

199
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,180
There's there's a human in there

200
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:26,860
Let's be honest. It's usually like a friend of the groom who set has a big problem like with silences

201
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,920
You know what? I mean? Just like it starts to like get too real and he's like, yeah, Rick sucks

202
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,380
Okay

203
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,700
I know Rick's my best friend, but I just really shit

204
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,340
We didn't do this at mine and Rachel's wedding

205
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,980
But I kind of wish we did because there's something about like

206
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:55,340
Putting your love through that crucible like making it vulnerable for a second because you do you expose you lift up the armor

207
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,840
To show your soft underbelly because you're like if you really do

208
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,880
Want to step to this and tear apart this infinite love this here's your chance. Oh, see I I wish I'd done it

209
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,200
Just for entrapment just like somebody's like, yeah, you know what and I'm like hot trick question

210
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,680
We're not gonna not get married. But now you get the fuck out of here

211
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,500
You don't get any cake later or they speak their mind and then the efficient is like, okay noted

212
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,840
No one gives a shit

213
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,440
That was rude sit down

214
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:31,880
I don't make this about you Derek. Let's get into it man. Part one approaching the couple consider your motivations

215
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
Why do you want to stop the wedding?

216
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,600
It doesn't say because you're in love with the other person, but maybe we'll get to that point

217
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,440
Don't bait don't base halting a wedding purely on emotions like jealousy or hatred those can be worked through with communication and therapy

218
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,160
Okay, but it's not a bad place to start. Yeah

219
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,240
Talk to the family members or other people involved in the wedding to find out if someone else feels similarly

220
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,080
Psst, hey grandma. Hey butch's grandma. Hey

221
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,840
This feels off, right?

222
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,600
Where you at? Just hot or cold? Yeah

223
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
Hey, hey Stacy's dad

224
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:13,520
Sucks, right my writer. All right. Also, uh, when are you gonna divorce your wife so I can date her? Yeah

225
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,040
Cuz it's Stacy's mom

226
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,320
Let's meet with the bride and groom privately to talk

227
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,520
It's a fun conversation. That's gonna go great. Hey guys, what's up?

228
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:29,920
We got beer in the fridge and I don't think you should be in I don't think you should be in love forever

229
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,160
And then here's a PowerPoint presentation. I and I really want you to pay attention

230
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,200
I worked really hard on this PowerPoint of why can you not actually embrace right now?

231
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,080
I need you guys to sit sort of farther apart from one another

232
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,840
In fact, I have two separate presentations. Yours is going to be over there in

233
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,960
My kid's room. I've set it up and yours is gonna be in here

234
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,240
So if you guys could take breaks about 45 minutes, so like go to the bathroom first, right?

235
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,560
Cuz I don't want to I don't want to pause them. They're kind of synchronized. And so I don't want it to get off

236
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,080
This is a long article address your concerns one-on-one

237
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,100
This may be a good time to ask questions about how they're feeling about the wedding and what their future looks like in their eyes

238
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,760
Why they believe their significant other is the one for them, etc

239
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,920
That kind of discussion could bring up on certainly uncertainty that they may have about getting married and you can use it to enable

240
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,440
Them to think a little more and possibly call off the wedding

241
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
wowsers Bowser's that is

242
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,200
That's pretty I would say toxic behavior from you the friend who was concerned about both of them

243
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Oh, what's that they snore, huh?

244
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Something to think about

245
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,040
You know, they're gonna store all the all the time forever

246
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,680
Mmm, have you smelled this guy's football farts?

247
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,120
I thought it was like after they played football or anything play football

248
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,600
They come back to the locker room and really stink up the joint

249
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,360
Convinced the couple to wait a year. Come on guys

250
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,920
Come on guys. Listen to my points. It just take a year like it's irresponsible to rush into this that you've been dating for 12 years

251
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,480
Oh

252
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,160
You've waited this long to have sex just one more year a little bit more

253
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Another she used to hold off until another year would be family events coming up such as grandpa's 80th or the birth of a new baby

254
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,560
You could see if you could maybe double up grandpa's 80th with the wedding. So that way people don't have to travel as much

255
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,200
Yeah, let's gather everyone around grandpa

256
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:35,640
Right now presently everyone surround and press your bodies against let's lay hands on grandpa. Let's lay breath on grandpa

257
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,000
Everybody just give the breath of life to grandpa

258
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,120
Touch this man's touch this old man's face

259
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,280
We're gonna hold his eye open so you can just touch his eyeball

260
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,000
How could you even think about getting married in the same year as grandpa's final birthday?

261
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,640
Hold on why are we calling it that?

262
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,520
This let me just say that the wikiHow art it's always good so far

263
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,120
it's just been a couple listening to their friend who looks more and more frantic and

264
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,080
The couple's faces look more and more like what the fuck are you talking about?

265
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:18,840
and this in this one the the woman in this couple is just piercing daggers right at the man as he

266
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,120
Step five suggest a fake wedding

267
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,920
Discuss holding a wedding celebration, but without the minister and paperwork

268
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,560
No one else has to know it's not legally binding and everyone can still enjoy themselves

269
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,320
What would be the context for that? How is how would that sales pitch?

270
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,120
Hey guys guys guys guys have I got an idea for you?

271
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:44,720
Yes, imagine if you will the cost and inconvenience of a wedding, but without any of the permanent effects

272
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,680
And that way you guys can just bail whenever you want

273
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,480
Right, isn't that no that's the opposite wait. Oh, you're telling me. Okay. That's the opposite

274
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,920
Okay, it gets wilder part two taking other action one call out the lies if you know the way if you know

275
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,920
The wedding is a fraud

276
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,680
What if you succeeded in the in the prior step and convincing them to have a proof that this is a

277
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,560
Phony baloney tech rehearsal wedding or if there are legal reasons the wedding should not go through as planned

278
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,960
You have at least 28 days to take legal action

279
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:22,200
Hey, what's up? I'm here to legally stop a wedding. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that sir. Well, what when was it scheduled for?

280
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Oh, I don't know. Let me call an S

281
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:33,040
I was actually uninvited. Let me call and double-check. I love hey wiki how just throwing out that there's a

282
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:40,760
Legal reason that the wedding should not happen and throwing that in there with I don't know if you two are gonna get along forever

283
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:46,760
That feels like that should be a separate article, right? Like it's all right. I have

284
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,320
I'm thinking about something as we talk about this, you know a wedding

285
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,560
Obviously weddings are kind of out of vogue with a lot of people in which I completely get everybody should do their own thing

286
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:02,080
But we did the wedding thing all three of us here not together. No, no, no, that would have been that would have been weird

287
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,600
We did the wedding separately thing and um, the you know

288
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,680
The stress of a wedding is like it feels like, you know, this is your you know, this is your shot to get it

289
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,160
right, you're just gonna get married one time and

290
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,000
It's a lot of expense and like you have to come up with opinions about stuff

291
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,760
Yeah, you may not necessarily care about and if it doesn't go well, then it's like

292
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
Devastating right, but what if

293
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,840
Every wedding had like a villain, right?

294
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,960
I feel like maybe if you have the Phantom of the Wedding. Yeah, where it's like

295
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,040
your choices then don't just become a reflection of

296
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
your

297
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,960
Personalities and your love. Yeah, but more like a defensive sort of like

298
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:55,560
Preparing for in defiance. Yeah, the different ways that the Phantom of the Wedding will like try to thwart you

299
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,160
That's good and your actions

300
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:03,840
So like it gives it a slightly more competitive element where it's like if it goes 80% good

301
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Yeah, that's awesome, right?

302
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Because you've like thwarted

303
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,840
The Phantom at a lot of different turns with a lot of their different machinations

304
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,440
Yeah, you try to keep your your marriage from culminating

305
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,240
Well, cuz that's the thing to keep in mind is you and your your partner, right?

306
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,000
You've got a lot on your mind that has to go, right all the Phantom has to do is make things go wrong

307
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,440
And that's a lot easier. So if you get 80% it's a huge victory now

308
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,240
I will also add to this plane just and another reason I like the introduction of the Phantom

309
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,680
Is you can then also create whatever the opposite of a safe word is with the Phantom

310
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:42,320
Well, if too much is going badly you say that word and the Phantom ends the wedding. Yeah, you're fault

311
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,720
It's a fantasy. He won the Phantom one and you get a redo you get to do the wedding again

312
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,880
You should be able to pick your villain too. Like oh

313
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:58,040
Yeah, like I'm dead by dawn or dead by daylight. Here comes. Dr. Bones the skeleton that always comes to try and stop our wedding

314
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,720
Here's the problem. Yes. Yes. Is that you there's no problem. Dr. Bones. Oh, no

315
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,720
It's the praying mantis that's been hunting me ever since I was a child

316
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Dr. Bones is a

317
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:16,840
Contractor who you are going to have to seek out and hire so it's like I in in hiring. Dr. Bones. You are

318
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,040
Participating in the process that dr. Bones is sworn to disrupt. This is the best

319
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:27,720
Man thing you the best man hires. Yes, you actually don't know who it is. Can you imagine how much we're thrilling?

320
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,280
It would be to plan a wedding if when you're talking to DJ you're like and you promise you're not gonna play our Kelly songs

321
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,280
Like oh, yeah. Yeah, and you're not

322
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:42,000
Really really really you understand. It's like oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I'm a friendly skeleton. My name is dr. Toons

323
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,720
I play the tunes you see I'm dr. Craigslist. Mm-hmm. No, I'm Frankenstein sponsor, but I'm not here for that

324
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:56,640
I'm in my off time. I'm a DJ. I promise you I know why you would assume that I'm working for the phantoms

325
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:03,920
And that's like completely fair. No, no, I'm the DJing mantis. I promise you I'm going to bite the head off of boredom

326
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,840
That's drama. I mean that's drama. That's what you want from from the show. That's what you want from the show

327
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,120
That's drama. I mean that's drama. That's what you want from from any event

328
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:19,520
I mean, I'm maybe this is good for birthday parties do yeah, it's like you have someone working against you. Yeah when you're planning a party

329
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,080
How was the bridal shower? Oh, I was great. It was a really good crudite and we defeated that evil Sasquatch

330
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,960
Not the stinky Sasquatch, yeah, he showed up

331
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,440
He tried to take the cake literally would be so fucking rad

332
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:41,400
If you're like trying to do a wedding and you think that you've gotten away with it, and you've defeated the phantom and then a werewolf

333
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,480
Like oh fuck now we got to deal with this

334
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,080
What's that all the phantom arrived? He's gonna help you fight the werewolf. Oh

335
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:56,360
Enemies to friends everybody loves that. Let's keep rockin step to involve others. That's great

336
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,680
Like get their best friends all in a big group

337
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,160
to really really

338
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,800
Forever scar these people sort of emotionally

339
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,680
It does say use this as a last resort because it could be pretty traumatic

340
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,960
So at least they are sort of looking out and then step three is totally normal. Follow the money

341
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:20,160
Whoa, if the couple are relying on one or both of their parents to support the wedding

342
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,640
You may want to try and stop the money source. So the wedding will be called off to kill their parents

343
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,100
I don't think that's what it's such. Oh, yeah, you're right Griffin because then they would still inherit it

344
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:36,920
They would inherit. Yeah, so seduce the parents and yeah, you're going to marry them and then kill them

345
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,160
All right, you inherit the money. You didn't have dr. Bones identity steal

346
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,320
There's the same time

347
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,320
I feel like getting to jump back a second group of friends to convince them out of it bad

348
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,840
Group of enemies to just go on and on about what a good idea they think it is

349
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,100
That's the way to go right now

350
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:00,280
We're cooking with gas because a group of friends could go badly right because then it's like well

351
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,480
We're still getting married and now we also hate all of you, right?

352
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,600
But if they're like, oh, I hate Debbie from work and Debbie's like, I love that you guys are getting married

353
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,080
That's so great. Like now it's like well fuck if Debbie thinks is a good idea

354
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,600
The last section real quick waiting it out step one void the marriage after the wedding

355
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,180
You can use an annulment to legally cancel out the marriages if it never happened

356
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,500
Not second hand though as a third party

357
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,580
Hey Pope, it's me Bob and now it they didn't fuck

358
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,920
Let me see your rings

359
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,220
You're not married no more

360
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,900
You just got annulled if you press the annulment button and eat the rings

361
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,380
It's done

362
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,200
Step to wait for the marriage to fail down the road

363
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,920
If the couple are fairly young and it's their first marriage, there's a 40% chance the marriage will end up for in divorce

364
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:00,180
I'll those like wait for what to what end to wait for them to split up naturally

365
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:07,080
Yeah, but then so but the reason to stop the marriage would be to stop something bad from happening and then you're like hey

366
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,440
Well, that's right. Just wait for something wait for something bad to happen. There's no step here

367
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,860
That's like rob it in their fucking faces do it

368
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:21,180
But as they walk out of the the town hall where they and not sign the annulment papers

369
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:27,980
You be there outside doing a quarterback dance just sort of yelling about how how you called it

370
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:33,140
Step three and now you're mad cuz you ain't a couple but we're just here to do the Super Bowl shovel

371
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:40,860
Perfect last step is move on but if you can't you won't

372
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,340
That should honestly be number one in every wiki house should be just don't

373
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,780
I said I think in the light during the live show

374
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,140
Yes

375
00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:01,540
Keep your grades up and move on should be that should be step one move on step to keep your grades up step three

376
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:06,300
All right, fine. Here you go more more. I tell you I've read like a lot of

377
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,320
You know different how to's in my life for different hobbies or whatever

378
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:16,540
So few of them in with like no window packing. Yeah, like, you know when you're like, maybe it's not for you

379
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:21,820
I don't know. Hey look over look over his job. How's he doing on his? Oh, it's way better than yours

380
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,620
Oh, you guys been doing it for the same amount of time, huh? Maybe you just don't have for you

381
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:32,520
There's no one to quit on org. Uh, is it anything else Griffin? I mean, there's some questions from some people

382
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,540
And a lot of people asking very inappropriate questions

383
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:40,620
I would say someone asked is there a good way to stop my own wedding without making this things awkward and I would say

384
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:46,740
It would be it would be a lot easier. Yeah, I think hiring a doctor bones or just asking one of your friends to start this

385
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,620
This mission this quest to tear the two of you apart can't be one of your friends just side note

386
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:57,060
You're going to have to plan ahead six months before the wedding hire like find

387
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:03,420
Somebody right is a plant friend and you're going to do a lot to talk about how close you've grown together and how important they

388
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:09,260
Are and then they're going to ruin it and then if that doesn't work you have to be ready to jettison that person

389
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,700
Right. So I think you can't just pick your best friend to do it

390
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:17,780
Especially if your parents are they're gonna be like hey your best friend kind of fucked this all up for you

391
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:22,340
You got to be like, yeah, I don't talk to him anymore. Yeah, and it's because you like paid him

392
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,340
That's full proof on him out

393
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,740
Plus they are jobs creator

394
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,900
Absolutely, that's the best part in this economy in this economy to keep this going

395
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:38,380
No labor shortage. So when I don't need more jobs, we need better jobs better pay better fans. I'm great

396
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,260
What's up guys I know we fucked up but

397
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,500
Check our jobs out. What's that? They're pretty bad

398
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,340
fuck

399
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,320
$14 is a lot of money. What the fuck's wrong with you $14 is good

400
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:03,160
We need to figure out a way to pronounce Papa John's with an audibly remove the apostrophe by the way

401
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:08,540
How do you pronounce it different out loud? So if you're only hearing it audibly, you know, which one we're talking about

402
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:14,860
Well, I mean you turn to John John's the Martian Manhunter right Papa John's there you go

403
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:21,740
One option or maybe just Papa Shax I Papa Shax is much better Shack is much closer to the brand now I think it should

404
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,740
Actually, just mean pizza shack, by the way

405
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,300
Pizza shack is really good. I know. Thank you very much

406
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,660
Well, it'll be pizza shacks

407
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:36,960
Where do you want to order from pizza shacks? Well, which one you gonna then it maybe it could be pizzas shacks

408
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:44,880
No, it wouldn't be pizza shacks. That's it. That is a wild Yoda esque way. Oh

409
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
The pizza of shack

410
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,040
Like Shaq is Shaq is like huh? Yeah, you understand

411
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,960
Griffin do you not get it? Like Shaq's like huh? Just call it the pizza of Shaq. I don't understand

412
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:05,120
I'm saying pizzas a possessive Shaq. This is the Shaq that pizza owns right at this point

413
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,120
It is not Shaq's pizza, right?

414
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:14,120
That means that he has control of this at this point. The pizza has such control over Shaq that this is pizza Shaq

415
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,680
How about we do you get a questions work

416
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,600
Pizza

417
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,120
So I thought it was asking Shaq if he wanted pizza pizza

418
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,640
And then it was Shaq's catchphrase runs back. Yeah, sure

419
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,960
Sounds great

420
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,520
Sure, I'll have some peace. I'd love to I'm

421
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:44,080
We're gonna take a quick break from some corporate sponsors and then we're gonna go with you to the rest of the show

436
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:04,180
I know a lot of percent so much percent and you know, it's wild they could have just made it 75

437
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,400
But no, they had to push far

Oh my style it came out of oh my style

444
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:39,260
Were you at you? I was gone there for a bit. I assumed you guys were talking about my new style and

445
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,340
How awesome it makes me look and young

446
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,700
Yeah, in a way

447
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,940
You could phrase it that way well, it's because the shirt I asked for it to like

448
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,500
Like I'll come up just above my belly button

449
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,980
a

450
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,060
Giant shorts. Yeah, and I what I asked for the most diaper like

451
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:09,860
Shorts and then on my and then on the shorts, it says Biscetti on it. Yeah, I didn't notice that

452
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,100
Yeah, it's fucking cool. And it came from stitch tiny shoes

453
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,140
Listen style isn't one-size-fits-all

454
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,660
Sometimes the shirts too small and the diapers too big and the shoes are too small

455
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:26,900
But it's about what suits your body and right now this is what I need and I want you guys to fucking respect it

456
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:32,940

00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,060
No

479
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:27,460
We're definitely not gonna hear anything about how we made it sound like stitch fix dressed our little brother in a big diaper and tiny

480
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,460
Shirt and tiny. That was a joke

481
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,940
fix golly

482
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:36,500
Oh, we need a way. We should just say up front. This is what my daughter does

483
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,900
BB will say like I'm gonna tell you something funny and then she'll tell a joke

484
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,780
As a way to like prep me to make sure I know that I'm supposed to laugh when she's done talking

485
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,860
We should do that more on the show be like, hey this thing I'm about to say it's not real

486
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,940
This is a joke and then tell it because it can get confusing to me or set up

487
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,740
I don't even know

488
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:02,000
This is not a joke. Okay. Thank you. Dun, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

489
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,220
I want a much

490
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:16,100
I want to munch on it feels like you don't need us for this. If you know, yeah

491
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,180
I kind of replace you guys with bells and I'm really sorry. That's okay. I get it

492
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,900
Yes, let's talk about Mariah Carey. Yeah

493
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,940
Uh, well good news guys

494
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,980
is because Mariah is taking the holidays up an octave

495
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,940
with the 12 days of McDonald's deals.

496
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,960
Huh, cool.

497
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,780
Each day from December 13th to December 24th.

498
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:40,700
So we got, you know, got a little bit left.

499
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,100
All this McDonald's wants this holiday season is for you

500
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,140
to join Mariah Carey for 12 days of deals.

501
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,640
Wow, that's a sweaty one, isn't it?

502
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,580
Because when, yeah, it's super sweaty.

503
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,900
All I want for Christmas is you.

504
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,740
Oh yeah, I get it.

505
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,660
We'll change half those words.

506
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,900
And then insert a preposition

507
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,620
because we don't have the guts to just abandon it.

508
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,600
Because when an iconic holiday superstar

509
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,060
is a fan of the golden arches,

510
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,580
it's only right to begin the season by gifting customers

511
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,580
an entire menu full of free, asterisk, goodies

512
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,740
from Mariah's own favorite.

513
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,100
Anyone?

514
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,500
Like her favorite thing.

515
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,500
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say a McFlurry.

516
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,340
Okay, Griffin?

517
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,660
Just the hash browns.

518
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,500
Classic cheeseburger.

519
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,380
Oh no, there's no fucking way.

520
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,340
I'm sorry Travis, that's what she told McDonald's

521
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,180
to soft bake chocolate.

522
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,140
Don't call Mariah a liar.

523
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,820
I'm actually, you know what?

524
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,940
She's not Malia Carey.

525
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,780
She's Mariah Carey.

526
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,300
I'm calling McDonald's a liar.

527
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,820
I don't think they spoke to Mariah Carey

528
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,500
before they started this whole thing.

529
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,420
The Mariah menu will make its debut in the U.S.

530
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,460
on December 13th, featuring a different free item,

531
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,100
double asterisk.

532
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,100
With a $1 minimum purchase on the McDonald's app.

533
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,540
Some of my favorite memories with my kids

534
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,540
are our family trips to McDonald's.

535
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,380
Sure.

536
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,340
So I'm Mariah Carey and I take my kids

537
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,260
to McDonald's all the time and bada bada bada.

538
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,060
Just me and my kids to McDonald's.

539
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,540
We go to McDonald's and I always get a classic cheeseburger.

540
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,740
This is definitely me, Mariah Carey.

541
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,580
This is Marie Mariah Carey.

542
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:21,020
Carey, I can only use the bathroom at McDonald's.

543
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:25,020
The only face I've ever felt truly like a success,

544
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,940
slash alive is McDonald's

545
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,340
when I'm eating a classic cheeseburger.

546
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,900
Each of us has our go-to order.

547
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,860
Mine is the cheeseburger.

548
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,420
And I get it with extra pickles.

549
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,220
I'm Mariah Carey, I love extra pickles

550
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,980
because damn it, I'm worth it.

551
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,500
I know it costs a little bit extra,

552
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,540
but fuck it, I'm Mariah Carey and I love pickles.

553
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,700
Imagine a fucking reality in which

554
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,300
someone's in the register at McDonald's

555
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,540
and the person in front of me is like,

556
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,660
hello, I'm Mariah Carey.

557
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,660
I would like one cheeseburger.

558
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,780
No drink for me today, thanks.

559
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,780
I'd like a single cheeseburger with extra pickles.

560
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,620
I'll wait, just put it in my hands.

561
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,460
I don't need a wrapper.

562
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,340
Would you like a combo meal with fries in it?

563
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,580
No, what a fucking idiot question.

564
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,100
No.

565
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,420
Mariah goes with the holidays like ketchup and fries.

566
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,220
So we couldn't think of a better partner

567
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,940
to help us celebrate the upcoming season,

568
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,500
said someone at McDonald's.

569
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,140
Just like McDonald's brings people around the table

570
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,900
with their favorite orders,

571
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,340
Mariah's music connects us all during this time of year.

572
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,740
So we're excited to team up

573
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,020
to bring even more holiday cheer to our fans.

574
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,140
And hey, I'm gonna float something to you guys

575
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,340
because this just occurred to me.

576
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:40,100
Listen, we have lots of wonderful fans and they're great,

577
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,500
but I don't think we're big enough.

578
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,620
I think that we could say we've partnered with Mariah Carey

579
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,940
and like in each episode,

580
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,180
she's gonna bring you one segment

581
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,580
that Mariah Carey picked.

582
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,620
And I don't think we're big enough

583
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,020
that it would ever actually get back to Mariah Carey.

584
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,380
I think we could totally do it and just get away with it.

585
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,660
Can I make this sort of like vision board announcement?

586
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,900
If you are a restaurant, a real restaurant, right?

587
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,260
And you wanna get at us with multiple locations.

588
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,460
It has to be more than one location.

589
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,140
It can be a two restaurant chain

590
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,460
and you wanna do a McElroy family meal, please get at us.

591
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,620
It's gonna be buck wild.

592
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,660
It'll be weird.

593
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,900
Because I tell you this, if I get my chance,

594
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,100
it ain't gonna be a classic cheeseburger.

595
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,740
It's gonna be like a McFlurry dumped over fries

596
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,940
with chopped up pickles on it.

597
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,780
It's gonna be like you really eat it

598
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,660
and I'm gonna be like, yeah, dance, eat it, eat it now.

599
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,540
High school lunchroom dare bullshit.

600
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,380
It's gonna get weird.

601
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,540
It's gonna be all school pizza.

602
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,980
The Mariah menu items

603
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,580
will be served in fun festive packaging.

604
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,380
If McDonald's wants to reach out,

605
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,060
we're bringing back the McPizza and you can't stop us.

606
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,300
Yeah, we worked with Mariah to create a design.

607
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,580
We know the Lamborghini and McDonald's fans will love.

608
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,140
You'll know the bags when you see them.

609
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,060
Just like, you know, her famed holiday jingle

610
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,500
from the song's first notes.

611
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,620
Hey, I want you guys to just picture it for a second.

612
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:04,620
Mariah Carey, like sitting over like an artist easel

613
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:07,260
and like just trying to design this bag

614
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,540
and she just can't get it right.

615
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,100
Cause that's definitely what it might've also been

616
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,780
like a big fancy iPad with like a thing,

617
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,740
but definitely this is something Mariah Carey

618
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,980
definitely directly worked on.

619
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,980
But using the wifi at McDonald's.

620
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,260
Using the wifi at McDonald's.

621
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,580
Hey, good news guys.

622
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,820
I wanna talk about Mariah Carey.

623
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,980
Mariah Carey has released the holiday hits cookie trio.

624
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,100
Wait.

625
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,620
Just in time for the holidays, Mariah's cookies,

626
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,780
a virtual bakery by iconic superstar, Mariah Carey.

627
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,940
They're virtual cookies?

628
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,020
No, they're real.

629
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,180
Yes, they're virtual cookies.

630
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,460
You get them from any website installed on your computer.

631
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,660
Mariah's got these cookies?

632
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,500
That sounds delicious.

633
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,220
Holiday hits cookies?

634
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,340
Holiday hits cookie trio available

635
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,860
for the most wonderful time of the year.

636
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,380
Because she wrote holiday hits?

637
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,460
Yeah, so she's got a,

638
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:58,100
from her virtual bakery at Mariah's Cookies,

639
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,460
you could get this virtual.

640
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,180
Now they say that this deal is for the holidays.

641
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,220
I have to imagine Mariah's Cookies is for the holidays,

642
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,060
right?

643
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,380
You're not in July like,

644
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,660
God damn, I should go for some of Mariah's Cookies right now.

645
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,700
If they're that good, this is what's called a soft roll.

646
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,940
I can't get over that they're just called holiday hits.

647
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:17,780
It would be like-

648
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,100
They're the holiday hits cookie trio.

649
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,940
It would be like if,

650
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:24,820
these are Pete Townshend's sick riffs, McFlurries.

651
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,740
This is-

652
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,460
I don't think this is still a McDonald's, right?

653
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,380
This is not a McDonald's anymore.

654
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,820
No, this is a different, no, this is at Mariah's Cookies,

655
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,700
a real restaurant that is not real.

656
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,540
Okay.

657
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,380
We-

658
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,380
Something that exists only in Tron.

659
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,780
Yeah, this year's release of holiday flavors

660
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,580
are the ideal treat to share and enjoy

661
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,540
while snuggled up with your loved ones.

662
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,500
Watch your favorite holiday specials and movies.

663
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,980
Enjoy this classic cheeseburger flavored cookie.

664
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,700
We forgot to leave, this is a quote,

665
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,700
we forgot to leave cookies out for Santa last year.

666
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,780
Fuck!

667
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,860
And we're terrified we'd wind up on the naughty list,

668
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,980
says Mariah Carey.

669
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,220
Wow.

670
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,620
To no one in particular.

671
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,020
Mariah, you just lived with this shame and guilt for a year?

672
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,140
So, this is where it really goes.

673
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,220
So we FaceTimed him over the summer

674
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,580
to ensure we got his top three flavors.

675
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:12,020
Santa, please, please, you gotta forgive us.

676
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:15,580
In case you were wondering, here they are.

677
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,860
The Holiday Hits Cookie Trio, 2021,

678
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,780
available for a limited time only.

679
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,380
No shit.

680
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,740
Cause it is called the Holiday Hits Trio.

681
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,020
Well, that could be anything, Justin.

682
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,900
It includes three special edition flavors,

683
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,540
gingerbread, cinnamon sugar,

684
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,500
and chocolate raspberry-

685
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,420
Special edition.

686
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:36,100
You'll never find gingerbread anywhere else.

687
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,300
It's got a festive box, too.

688
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,340
So, I'm sorry.

689
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,100
It was gingerbread, cinnamon sugar,

690
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,500
and what was the third one?

691
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,740
Yeah, chocolate raspberry truffle.

692
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,140
That's actually pretty wild.

693
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,380
I like that one.

694
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,260
Hey, it's just Santa's favorite.

695
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,420
There's no way that you asked Santa his favorite cookie

696
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,820
and he's like, fucking gingerbread, my dude.

697
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,660
I love it.

698
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,340
I can't get enough of that wonderful stuff.

699
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,900
So yeah, these are Mariah's cookies and-

700
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,460
Do you think she makes each one?

701
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,460
I don't know if you can get Mariah's cookies.

702
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,340
Okay, I can't get them.

703
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,340
Can I?

704
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,700
Yeah, looks like you could.

705
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,260
If you got on a delivery app,

706
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,460
you could probably get some of Mariah's cookies.

707
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,100
I live in the big city.

708
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,700
Yeah, if you wouldn't mind ordering those, Trav,

709
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,820
and just let me know how it goes.

710
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,260
They taste exactly like gingerbread cookies, Justin.

711
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,620
And I want you to really order them, Trav,

712
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:22,460
for me for the holidays.

713
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,300
Thank you.

714
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,420
Through any delivery service, you say?

715
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,620
Grubhub, DoorDash, Postmates, Ubreats, and Seamless.

716
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,500
Okay, I'll order one from each of those.

717
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,580
So I don't shut down-

718
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,580
Okay.

719
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,700
Do you guys mind, real quick,

720
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,620
if I mention a quick Mariah Carey story?

721
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,460
Yeah.

722
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,940
She just launched her first holiday collection today,

723
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,540
announcing the news with a commercial share

724
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,380
across all Carey's social accounts.

725
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,060
It's available at Target and Walmart,

726
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,820
and it's inspired by, you'll never guess this,

727
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,780
her record-breaking classic, All I Want for Christmas Is You.

728
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,980
It's got animated versions of Mariah

729
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:55,700
and her beloved dog, Cha Cha, incorporated throughout.

730
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,700
The collection is personal to Carey, you see.

731
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,620
She has designed products that she and her family

732
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,140
love to use and enjoy during the holidays.

733
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:07,140
This is a special jewel-encrusted purse

734
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,260
I use to carry my cheeseburger with me.

735
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,100
I love it.

736
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:12,860
It's my favorite.

737
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,340
This is a cheeseburger sleeve,

738
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,500
so I don't have to touch it with my hands.

739
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,980
I'm not sure if you're aware, but this is a quote.

740
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,100
I'm not sure if you're aware,

741
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,780
but Christmas is kind of my thing.

742
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,620
What?

743
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,460
Ha ha!

744
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,420
Putting together this line was so much fun,

745
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,460
because I added my own festive spin

746
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,980
to traditional holiday merchandise.

747
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,620
I worked on it all year long.

748
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,140
Now it's finally time to share my holiday collection

749
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,020
with you, all Merry Christmas.

750
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,180
Now, hey, listen, Mariah,

751
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,700
I know you didn't work on it all year long,

752
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,860
or else you didn't work very hard

753
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,740
on your cookies and hamburgers.

754
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,700
Well, she don't have to work on the hamburger, Justin.

755
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,620
That's her reward.

756
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,580
That's her treat herself for a great day

757
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,100
of making goods at Walmart.

758
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,620
That's her thing just for her.

759
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,100
She needs that cheeseburger energy to make cool bags.

760
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,540
The holiday collection of Christmas collectibles ranges,

761
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,020
that's the sentence they went with.

762
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,860
The holiday collection of Christmas collectibles

763
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:06,820
ranges from cozy, including blankets, throw pillows,

764
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,700
socks, and slippers, to festive,

765
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,180
with adorable pet outfits, stockings.

766
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,420
Oh, this?

767
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,820
It's by Mariah.

768
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,260
This Chihuahua outfit?

769
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,180
Oh, this Chihuahua outfit?

770
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,700
They got a plush Mariah and Cha-Cha.

771
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,420
Sure to delight any child on your Christmas list.

772
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,940
It's all available for you at Target or Walmart.

773
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:27,860
You can pre-order now.

774
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,980
Justin, I ordered the cookies.

775
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,340
And I look forward to having them

776
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,020
as a special treat just for me.

777
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,460
And I bought the dog shirt.

778
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,780
I bought her dog.

779
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,500
Real quick, okay, before we wrap up,

780
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,340
can I do one more quick story?

781
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,860
Is it about Mariah Carey?

782
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:44,700
It is.

783
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,580
Mariah Carey has launched her own Irish cream brand,

784
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:48,420
Black Iris.

785
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:49,260
What, yes?

786
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,940
And just so you know I'm not cherry picking, guys,

787
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:58,940
this is all, I mean, these are this year.

788
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,380
This all happened this year.

789
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,220
Yeah, she's hustling.

790
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,180
She is not fucking around.

791
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:07,500
She has to earn money to buy more classic cheeseburgers.

792
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,380
She can't sit back and let those cheeseburgers

793
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,300
just sit there lonely at the McDonald's.

794
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,420
She has to eat them.

795
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,780
Celebrity owned, this is not a press release.

796
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,620
This is a story from Food and Wine,

797
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,580
but celebrity owned spirit brands.

798
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,420
This is not a press release.

799
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,620
This was a direct email Justin received from Mariah Carey.

800
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,340
In 2018, George Clooney was named

801
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,580
Forbes highest paid actor, not due to any onscreen roles,

802
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:35,860
but instead, thanks to the near billion dollar sale

803
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:38,340
of his tequila brand, Casamigos.

804
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,180
That shouldn't count.

805
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,020
Just in case anyone's wondering,

806
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,300
that shouldn't count towards that total.

807
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,820
That doesn't seem fair.

808
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:49,820
Ryan Reynolds Aviation, it sold for about 610 million.

809
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,140
And now Mariah Carey is there.

810
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,420
Yesterday, she turned to Twitter to make a big announcement

811
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,460
with limited details, introducing Black Irish.

812
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,580
She tweeted, two years in the making

813
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,900
truly calls for celebration.

814
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,300
The picture is just Mariah on a beach

815
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,140
with a bottle of her Black Irish.

816
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:08,100
Because where else, where do you want

817
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,340
a cream liqueur more than the beach beach liqueur?

818
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:17,340
A nice cool glass of Irish cream liqueur.

819
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,260
It comes in original white chocolate and salted caramel,

820
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,100
all of which are 17% ABV.

821
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,180
The brand states that these Irish creams

822
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,780
are crafted and produced in Ireland

823
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,700
in a certified sustainable facility

824
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,980
with 50% renewable energy.

825
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,100
Now y'all, the other 50% though,

826
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,020
is the dirtiest energy.

827
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,460
They are rolling coal with this Irish cream.

828
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,900
It's still whole dinosaur bones

829
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,820
just going right in and burning.

830
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:46,180
It celebrates exceptional quality

831
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,700
with a blend of aged Irish whiskey

832
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:52,220
and superior deli, dairy, deli.

833
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:56,460
Why does deli need some fucking corned beef in there?

834
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:01,020
No, the superior dairy sourced from Irish farms.

835
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,460
Black Irish white chocolate

836
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,100
uses the finest Belgian chocolate

837
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,460
for a rich and smooth taste.

838
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,060
The name Carrie chose Black Irish

839
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:12,220
as a playful nod to her Black and Irish heritage.

840
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,740
Her father was of Black and Venezuelan descent

841
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:17,020
and her mother has an Irish background.

842
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,540
The fact that the liqueur itself, an Irish cream,

843
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,580
feels a bit like a chicken or the egg situation

844
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:24,700
as far as which came first, the name or the product.

845
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,820
But the brand states that Carrie is quote,

846
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:31,460
is quote, a fan of Irish creams.

847
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,300
Love that stuff.

848
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,140
And points to how well Irish cream

849
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,140
pairs with her huge holiday hit,

850
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,940
All I Want For Christmas Is You.

851
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,140
Yes, yes, yes.

852
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,740
I just wanna say, by the way,

853
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:44,700
a story that the phrase has an Irish background

854
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,860
sounds like something you would put on a resume

855
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,420
about like, oh, actually,

856
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,180
I know you're looking for someone Irish.

857
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,980
I have an Irish background.

858
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,740
I've worked in Irish before.

859
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,660
Thank you for asking.

860
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,740
I have quote, here's a quote,

861
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,260
because you knew it was coming.

862
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,900
I have been putting my heart into this project

863
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,740
for almost two years.

864
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:03,580
Hey, can I just say,

865
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:06,380
that's the first one of those of these four that I believe.

866
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,660
Now, but yeah, but we also,

867
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,540
I mean, Mariah, which is it, bud?

868
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:13,700
Because either you've been really focused on your creams

869
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,900
or really focused on your dog shirts, ladies.

870
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,740
It can't be both.

871
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,980
Anyway, I've been putting my heart into this project

872
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,340
for almost two years.

873
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,700
And I am so excited to finally share this news with you all.

874
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,060
I wanted to create something that embodies the holidays

875
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,500
and gives everyone a reason to celebrate year round.

876
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,060
And I really think that we have done that with Black Irish.

877
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,420
Why are you celebrating today, Justin?

878
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,060
Well, I'm celebrating because Mariah Carey

879
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,300
has her own Irish cream bread.

880
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,140
And she deserves it.

881
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,300
That's my reason to celebrate.

882
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,540
Hey, Mariah, do these pair well with your cookies?

883
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,620
With my what?

884
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,460
Wait, what's that?

885
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,580
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cookies.

886
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,500
The cookies that they pay me in cheeseburgers for.

887
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,340
Yes.

888
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,660
My favorite meal to sit down to

889
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,500
is a big glass of Irish cream.

890
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,500
Served out of a purse.

891
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,340
With a cheeseburger with extra pickles

892
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,900
and a big stack of cookies.

893
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,060
And I, in all Santa's favorite flavors.

894
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,660
I slosh it around in my big purse.

895
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,500
I bet it's good.

896
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,340
And then I eat it all.

897
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:07,020
I bet all of this is very good.

898
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,660
Mariah Carey is like, you gotta respect her so much.

899
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:12,900
I do.

900
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,740
If we had one song that was one 10th,

901
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,140
you would never hear the end.

902
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:19,980
No.

903
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:20,820
We would do this with everybody.

904
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:23,940
If we had a novelty hit, like the fucking Chipmunks,

905
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,300
you wouldn't be able to talk to me in public.

906
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,020
Yeah, sure.

907
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:28,860
Yeah.

908
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,180
What do we have time for?

909
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,020
We gonna time to have another question?

910
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,260
I think we have time to read a hit holiday song, Justin.

911
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:36,100
Okay.

912
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,460
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

913
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,300
All I want.

914
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,140
Nope.

915
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:39,980
Wait.

916
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:40,980
They already did that one.

917
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,060
Is.

918
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:42,900
Cheese.

919
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:43,740
Cheese.

920
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:44,580
Cheese.

921
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,540
Take me up to Santa's house.

922
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,380
Here we go.

923
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,540
I think it should be like an old-timey.

924
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,380
Let's do it.

925
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,220
We gonna bring out a quick.

926
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:53,100
Let's go back to like old-timey ones

927
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,180
where it's like, hey, it's snowing outside.

928
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,700
Here's a whole fucking song about it.

929
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,540
We'll start.

930
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,380
Just start that.

931
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,940
I won't interrupt, but like start it there.

932
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,420
We'll just get a little riff.

933
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,260
Yeah.

934
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,940
I'm putting on my Christmas boots to step.

935
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,140
No, that's not how you started just now.

936
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:08,980
It's like.

937
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:12,420
Let's go on up to Santa's house.

938
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,260
It's snowing in the neighborhood.

939
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,300
You've jumped to the chorus.

940
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,140
Yeah, you gotta start with it.

941
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:16,980
I like the spoken part.

942
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,820
You gotta start with.

943
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,660
Let me start.

944
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,500
God damn it.

945
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,340
A little boozy.

946
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,180
A little boozy.

947
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,020
The kids are asleep.

948
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:22,860
You know what I mean?

949
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,220
Oh, it's snowing outside and.

950
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,060
No, it's talking.

951
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:25,900
It's spoken word.

952
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,060
Just say, well, it's snowing outside.

953
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:27,900
Well, it looks like.

954
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,420
Yeah, just like you did it the first time.

955
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,860
Well, it looks like a snowy day outside.

956
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:34,020
Sloshy, sloppy, and wet.

957
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,300
And today, it's Christmas Eve.

958
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,100
And it's special.

959
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,820
Isn't that right, Jacob?

960
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,260
Yeah.

961
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,100
That's my friend, Jacob.

962
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,980
Going up to Santa's house.

963
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,700
Santa's house.

964
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:55,100
Driving up in my Chevrolet.

965
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,740
I got snow chains on my tires.

966
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:02,180
And I think that that's okay.

967
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:05,060
I found the perfect gift for Saint Nick.

968
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:08,260
It's a real nice fitting pair of slacks

969
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:11,340
and a briefcase so he can go to a job

970
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:14,660
that's a different job from the one he has.

971
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,020
And I'm Jacob.

972
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,420
And now the wrap.

973
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,180
I love Christmas and I'm here to say

974
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,020
I love giving presents in a major way.

975
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:23,500
I unwrap them, I open them, and I eat some food.

976
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,420
And everything here is really good.

977
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,340
Fresh stuff, Jacob.

978
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:35,540
Thanks, I've been trading for months.

979
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,780
Oh no, here come the turbo bots.

980
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:41,620
They hate Santa Claus and hate us too.

981
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,860
They hate our freedom.

982
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,460
Jacob, take this gun.

983
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:48,820
There's bullets in the red, in the box.

984
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:51,940
And I think Jacob knows what to do.

985
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:55,620
Hey everybody, it's me, Mariah Carey.

986
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:58,420
These are the bots that I created.

987
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:01,100
I'm so proud of my killer robots.

988
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,500
They're gonna destroy every living thing.

989
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,260
So if I go down, I want you to find my wife

990
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,620
and tell her where the money's buried.

991
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:10,300
You promise me, Jacob, you promise me.

992
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,860
Okay, let's get out there.

993
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:15,020
Damn, this snow is really fucking slushy.

994
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,900
Driving all around and whipping all around.

995
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,620
We are the turbo bots.

996
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,380
We hate Santa Claus.

997
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,220
That's all I got.

998
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,020
The turbo bots have got some slushy snow

999
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,620
trapped inside their gears.

1000
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,660
Looks like we are safe at home.

1001
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:35,140
Cozy for another year.

1002
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,500
But stay wary, cause the bots will return, everybody.

1003
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,500
They will come back.

1004
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,740
They'll come back worse than ever.

1005
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,260
And that's good.

1006
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,100
It's good.

1007
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,620
Hey, thanks for listening to our podcast,

1008
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,620
my brother, my brother, and me.

1009
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:48,740
And happy holidays, candle lights, to you and yours.

1010
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,420
We hope you're having a pleasant holiday season.

1011
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,980
Hey, speaking of which,

1012
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,140
the video on demand is still up of our candle lights.

1013
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,180
Show.

1014
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,420
Yes, please.

1015
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,340
If you didn't get it, it's so fun.

1016
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:01,380
It's over two hours of great festive holiday entertainment.

1017
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,380
It will be live for another,

1018
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,460
it's hard for me to do the math.

1019
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,900
It's like a week and a half or so

1020
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,220
as you're listening to this, I think.

1021
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:10,980
So please just go pony up some money for it and help.

1022
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,220
It's a great cause, Harmony House.

1023
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,220
They do so much for people

1024
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,860
who are currently unsheltered in our community

1025
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,580
and it's a wonderful cause.

1026
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,580
And if you would just go to bit.ly forward slash

1027
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,100
candle lights 2021, everybody who watched it,

1028
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,220
I can say to a person had a wonderful time

1029
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,580
and now you could count yourself amongst their number

1030
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,820
if you will go and get that and watch it.

1031
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:33,660
We really appreciate you.

1032
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:34,700
Speaking of shows,

1033
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,260
we're doing a virtual live stream for Wonderful,

1034
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:39,940
the show me and Rachel do on January 7th

1035
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:43,140
at 9.30 PM Eastern time.

1036
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:45,340
Same thing as candle lights,

1037
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,700
tickets are five bucks with an option to give more.

1038
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:51,540
It's bit.ly slash wonderful ABC 2021.

1039
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:54,380
And ticket sales for that go to benefit Austin Batcave,

1040
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,620
which is a nonprofit here in town

1041
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,700
that offers writing programs for young authors,

1042
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,660
aged six to 18.

1043
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,460
It's a really, really cool program

1044
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:04,100
and we're happy to be supporting them with a show.

1045
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,020
So buy tickets so the money can go to them.

1046
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:07,860
Thanks.

1047
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:10,260
Also just a heads up to let everybody know,

1048
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:13,660
we will be taking next week off for the holidays.

1049
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:17,100
So we will be back in the new year with new episodes.

1050
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:19,900
So we got a name 2022, don't we?

1051
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:20,900
Yeah, we'll figure that out,

1052
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,500
but there will be no new episodes next week.

1053
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,220
But before the month runs out,

1054
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,100
make sure you go over to mackerelmunch.com,

1055
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,140
get that pin of the month,

1056
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,820
which is Steely Van from the Adventure Zone,

1057
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:34,980
benefits the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

1058
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,900
We have the my brother, my brother

1059
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,340
and the man who ruined my for you page sticker.

1060
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,300
And we've got the Zona Adventure enamel pin.

1061
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,140
So go check those out.

1062
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,700
We got a bunch of other stuff over there too.

1063
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,340
Mackerelmunch.com.

1064
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:49,780
Oh, and thank you.

1065
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,380
And just an enormous thank you to Montaigne.

1066
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:54,940
I don't know what just happened to me just there.

1067
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,140
That was kind of strange.

1068
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,060
You were awash with emotion.

1069
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:58,900
I guess so.

1070
00:58:58,900 --> 00:58:59,980
It's an amazing song.

1071
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,020
We appreciate it so much.

1072
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:07,020
And this final Yahoo was sent in by Terrence Howard.

1073
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:10,100
Whoa.

1074
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:10,940
Wow.

1075
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:11,780
Huge gift.

1076
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:13,660
Yeah, we're getting the same, the one from movies.

1077
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,700
Like the original War Machine.

1078
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,140
Yeah, Terrence Howard sent this one.

1079
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:18,980
And thank you, Terrence.

1080
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:23,980
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user, Frederick Circus.

1081
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:30,940
Frederick Circus asks, will you marry me, Sheila?

1082
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:33,460
That's it?

1083
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,540
That's all it says, yeah.

1084
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,060
No details given?

1085
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,140
It's a Yahoo Answers proposal.

1086
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:37,980
I guess it's not that funny.

1087
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:38,980
Are there any answers?

1088
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,220
Sheila did respond.

1089
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,460
She said, not yet.

1090
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,300
Oh.

1091
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,140
Oh, it's spicy.

1092
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:47,980
I can't wait to see it.

1093
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,380
Oh, I like that.

1094
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,300
We'll circle back next week to figure out

1095
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,340
how this all plays out.

1096
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:53,180
Yeah.

1097
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,020
I can't believe, can I just say real quick

1098
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:55,900
before we say our names,

1099
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,620
I can't believe there's a Matrix movie coming out.

1100
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,660
I'm so fucking stoked.

1101
00:59:58,660 --> 00:59:59,500
Get out of here.

1102
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:03,220
Are we gonna, we're not doing an episode that week.

1103
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:04,060
I'm so mad.

1104
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:04,900
Anyway.

1105
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:05,940
I mean, we could still talk about it,

1106
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:06,900
just the three of us.

1107
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,140
Yeah, gross.

1108
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:08,980
My name's Justin McElroy.

1109
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,340
I'm your realest brother, Travis McElroy.

1110
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,180
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1111
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,540
It's been my brother, my brother, me, Kiss Your Dad,

1112
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:13,540
Square on the Lips.

1113
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:42,540
It's better with you.

1114
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:44,460
It's better with you.

And I'm Christian Weatherford.

1121
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:57,260
And we've got big feelings about animals

1122
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,260
that we just gotta share.

1123
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:00,220
On Just the Zoo of Us,

1125
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,860
We're here to critically evaluate

1126
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:06,780
how each animal excels and how it doesn't.

1127
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:08,980
Rating them out of 10 on their effectiveness,

1128

studying and working with very cool animals

01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:20,660
like sharks, cheetahs, and sea turtles.

1133
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,020
It's a field trip to the zoo for your ears.

1134
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:25,100
So if you or your kids have ever wondered

1135
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,660
if a pigeon can count,

1136
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:28,260
why sloths move so slow,

1137
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,020
or how a spider sees the world,

1138
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,820
find out with us every Wednesday on Just the Zoo of Us,

1139
