1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,200
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother and my brother me an advice show from the modern era.

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,960
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,600
And I'm your baby brother Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,440
Hi Griffin, you sound great.

9
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,160
Thanks!

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,840
You sound like you're in Japan.

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,640
I'm a muppet.

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,800
Well, Griffin, uh, uh, why don't you keep it down? Let your brother and I, uh, talk.

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,400
Just pipe down there, buddy.

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,900
Okay!

15
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,800
Griffin's in Japan, so he's not here, but we do have a fresh-

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,840
we didn't want to leave you hanging, so we got a fresh episode of Old Things for you.

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,520
It's fresh in sequence, I guess, so it's got that going for it.

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,800
This is our spooktacular best of Halloween episode.

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,880
It's terrifying how little effort they put into it.

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,320
No, it's actually terrifying the old bits we used to do.

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,520
It's the- it is actually horrifying how much work-

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,760
how much more work it takes to put together, uh, one of these episodes

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,600
versus just blathering on for an hour.

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,040
And I had to listen to all the old monthly observances.

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,800
Real quick before we get into it, though, we got some fun news for you.

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,720
We're going to be doing a- we've got six live shows booked before April-

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,880
or the end of April 2015.

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
There's a lot coming.

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,840
We got our first one, though, to announce to you, our beloved listeners,

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,400
is My Brother, My Brother, Me, Home for the Candle Nights, a holiday spectacular,

31
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,960
live from Huntington, West Virginia, our hometown.

32
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:20,880
Travis.

33
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,560
West Virginia, here's the thing.

34
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,800
West Virginia, it's closer than you think.

35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,200
That's actually the state motto.

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,080
Closer than you think.

37
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,800
West Virginia.

38
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,000
We have been talking about doing a show like this for a long time.

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,000
We have no idea if anyone from Huntington will come.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,960
We think they will.

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,040
Well, some of them, but we're counting on you folks to come in and hang out with us.

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,440
We're doing the show on December 21st at 7 p.m. at City Hall.

43
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,400
Tickets will go on sale Monday.

44
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,120
That's today at noon at MBMBAMCandleNights.BrownPaperTickets.com.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,240
So if you want to get tickets for that-

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,680
They're only $15.

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,840
Yeah, they're 15 bucks.

48
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,960
It's going to be, we're going to avoid cursing, because it's a Candle Nights episode,

49
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,360
shooting for like PG-13.

50
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,080
You know, like we're going to try to avoid like the super bad words.

51
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,880
But hopefully it's something that the whole family can enjoy.

52
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,760
We have actually talked about-

53
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,160
Actually, I came up with this idea last night and I haven't asked you, Travis,

54
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,960
but I think we should have, my brother and me, family breakfast the day after

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,440
at Flapjack's to Napa, Huntington's finest combination breakfast and Mexican restaurant.

56
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,120
Well, how does one say no to that?

57
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, you can't.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,360
You can't say no to it.

59
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,560
It'll be fun.

60
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,360
Sawbones, the medical history podcast I do with my wife, Sydney,

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,080
will be opening for my brother and me.

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,920
So you're going to get a Sawbone show.

63
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,000
Our dad will be there.

64
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,480
I really think this is going to be like a one of a kind Huntington experience.

65
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,880
If you've ever been to Huntington, this is going to be your best.

66
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,800
This is going to be your best.

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,320
And it is not a rural town.

68
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,680
It is a suburban area.

69
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,640
There are many hotels for you to choose from.

70
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,240
There are many fine restaurants, which we will be happy to make recommendations for.

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,720
You should visit Pullman Square.

72
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,840
Pullman Square.

73
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,880
You can do some shopping.

74
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,240
There's lots to do in Huntington, but the main thing you're going to want to do

75
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,880
is you're going to want to visit us for our holiday.

76
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,600
Spectacular.

77
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,200
Family friendly.

78
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,000
But not like little kids.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,720
They won't like it probably, but it's family friendly, I guess.

80
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,640
Let's hear like PG, PG-13.

81
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,440
PG-13.

82
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,520
But NBNBAMCandleLights.BrownPaperTickets.com is going to be the show at Huntington City Hall.

83
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,200
7 p.m. Tickets are 15 bucks.

84
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
It's going to be a hoot.

85
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,080
A hoot nanny.

86
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,280
I think it'll be a hoot.

87
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,320
So make the trip.

88
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,600
Come on down.

89
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,080
Visit us.

90
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,480
Hang out.

91
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,080
It's going to be, you know, it's going to be nice because we're going to be on our home turf

92
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,600
and you'll get to meet a lot of people that we know and hang out.

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,160
It'll be fun.

94
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
Okay, so with that being said, hit.

95
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,080
Welcome, my brother, my brother and me, where Travis has suggested we lead off the show

96
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,560
by mentioning the release of Thor.

97
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,200
That's his high energy opening.

98
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,240
Did you guys see Thor?

99
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,000
Hey, did you guys hear about Thor?

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,280
He's got this hammer thing.

101
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,920
A hammer?

102
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,200
Did you guys see Thor?

103
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,400
Yeah, he's like the Prince of Asgard or something.

104
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,360
Thor watch.

105
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,240
What's your cinch?

106
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,920
Thor watch 2011, Griffin.

107
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,880
How many...

108
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,760
The countdown is over.

109
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,280
The countdown is over.

110
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,400
I saw Thor.

111
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,560
There's a Thor signing up my Trader Joe's.

112
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,320
He's picking up some soft pretzel bread for Loki.

113
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,560
Thor watch 2011 is an advice show for the modern era.

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,280
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

115
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,920
I'm Travis McElroy.

116
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,520
I'm Griffin McElroy.

117
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,640
This is not a gag.

118
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,480
I said, what should we lead the show off with?

119
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,520
And Travis says, Thor came out.

120
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,000
All right.

121
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
What else happened this week that's worth noting?

122
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,600
Thor.

123
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,100
Yep.

124
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,640
So as I mentioned, this is an advice show for the modern era and a Thor watch.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,200
It's not a play a thing.

126
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,440
It's nautically themed.

127
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,520
Justin, can I tell you as somebody who on a weekly basis scours Yahoo!

128
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,440
Answers for things that are funny, there is every kind of play that you can imagine.

129
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,200
There's just no kind of play that is out of that.

130
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,960
I've been trying to find a way to talk about it on the show.

131
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,320
You guys know about age play?

132
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,080
Excuse me?

133
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,680
It's called age play.

134
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,920
I couldn't find a funny Yahoo!

135
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,560
Answer about it because they're all just so crushing.

136
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,880
But it's where one person pretends to be a baby.

137
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,720
Oh, look at him.

138
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,360
Okay, but now they pretend to be like a senior citizen at a nursing home.

139
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,920
You can.

140
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,000
You can do that.

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,160
The world is your oyster in the world of age play.

142
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,280
Fuck, you just got into the movies for $5.50.

143
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,000
That's so hot.

144
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,800
Tell me about that early bird special.

145
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,640
We're eating dinner at 4 p.m.

146
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,360
God, I'm a wreck.

147
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,480
Do you think that there are people that are like hardcore like goth enthusiasts or steam

148
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,120
punks or something and their idea of this kind of sex play is like you put on a suit

149
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,640
and you carry a briefcase and like you talk about spreadsheets?

150
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,240
They call it they call it norming it up.

151
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,440
It's norm.

152
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,320
Norm play.

153
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,200
I'm going to norm you tonight.

154
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,120
Tonight, let's just listen.

155
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,320
We're having casserole.

156
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,640
I want to plan the perfect evening.

157
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,680
Ah, we're gonna drink bed wine.

158
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,560
First, I want to light some candles.

159
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,840
We bought it back from Body Works.

160
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,080
And then I want to put on-

161
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,200
What's that on the TV?

162
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,960
Oh my God, it's a Becker marathon.

163
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,920
I want to put on that Mad Men soundtrack we bought at Target.

164
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,080
Just go crazy.

165
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, go restrained on you.

166
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And when that's done, I got Colby Callie lined up.

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,360
It's next on iTunes.

168
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,680
I'll open your delicate mouth and feed you some Oreos.

169
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,480
Can you imagine?

170
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,840
Goth people can't eat Oreos?

171
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,240
Goth people can't eat Oreos.

172
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,480
Why not?

173
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,840
They only like blood cookies.

174
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,760
That's true.

175
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,360
From Toll House.

176
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,720
Those are delicious though.

177
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,120
Mm-hmm, those Keebler elf commercials are fucked up though.

178
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,800
Keebler elf, come into the tree.

179
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,120
And I'll survive it.

180
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,840
Put a baby in.

181
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,840
Elk and blood cookies.

182
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,320
Introduce fat blood cookies.

183
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,880
Don't ask.

184
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Hey, let's get into the questions.

185
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,480
My girlfriend and I have been dating for seven months now.

186
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,880
And we enjoy going out to eat every once in a while.

187
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,640
The thing is, when we order the food,

188
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,160
she takes it upon herself to order both her food and my food.

189
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,160
At first it was kind of cute, but now it's really starting to bother me.

190
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,840
Should I say something to her about it?

191
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,240
Or is this one of those things I need to let go?

192
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,000
Flustered in Florida.

193
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,400
Wow, that's so weird.

194
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:04,560
Yeah.

195
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,440
I've never heard of that.

196
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,480
That's not a thing that people actually do, unless they're in like a movie.

197
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:16,640
Well, what if when she ordered your food, you just screamed, wrong, close, but not right.

198
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,720
Let's go with a steak.

199
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,880
We were looking for steak.

200
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,360
Maybe she really knows him really well.

201
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
I would actually be a big fan of this.

202
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,960
I hate deciding what to eat at a restaurant because I don't understand the big words.

203
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,160
Like, what's a gru year?

204
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,000
What's a gru year?

205
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,320
I think he probably like picks the food.

206
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,720
I just think that like when the lady comes around, that she says like, he told me earlier

207
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,720
that he wanted to have the steak and gru year, so I'm going to order that for him.

208
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,280
Maybe or maybe like really mean and she thinks like he's overweight and doesn't want to say

209
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,920
anything about it.

210
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,120
So she's like really passive aggressive, like he'll have a salad.

211
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,320
Yeah, I'll have the chicken corn on blue and Tubby Tubbs over there is going to have a

212
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,040
shot of wheat grass and some disapproving looks.

213
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,080
Somebody skipped his morning jog so he gets a mixed green.

214
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:16,080
I think that you should probably ask out of curiosity, like very non-aggressive.

215
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,960
Hey, why do you do that?

216
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,800
Why does that happen every time?

217
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,560
Maybe there's a good loving reason for it.

218
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,800
What could the loving reason be?

219
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,560
Maybe you're really bad at like human interaction and she's saving you from having to make a

220
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,080
fool of yourself in front of the waiter.

221
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,400
Like she knows you're going to make terrible jokes about how you want your steak done or

222
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,880
whatever.

223
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,160
Like how do you want your steak cooked?

224
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,880
On the grill.

225
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, she's trying to prevent that from happening.

226
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,480
My name is Fred and I'll be your customer this evening.

227
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,640
Could you steak me?

228
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,960
The first time you guys went out, did you embarrassingly order things like, I'll have

229
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,760
the hamburger because you hold the mustard and put the mayonnaise in a cup next to it

230
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,720
and stuff like that?

231
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,880
Maybe she just doesn't want to deal with your whininess.

232
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,320
Bring me the mayonnaise in a stein if you could, please.

233
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,280
I need a thimble full of vinaigrette.

234
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,640
If I see a pickle, I'm going to burn this restaurant down.

235
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,440
Sorry, Darlene.

236
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,480
I think you should ask to find out what the reason is.

237
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,560
If it's a good reason, it's not worth it.

238
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,240
Does it really bother you?

239
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,280
What you should do is just completely embrace this.

240
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,840
And when your lady orders for you, make eye contact with the waiter and just give a real

241
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,880
slow nod.

242
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,640
Yeah, like you're inviting him into your-

243
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,400
It feels like you're inviting him into your relationship.

244
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,920
That's another story I'll have.

245
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,440
She was correct.

246
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,440
Why don't you turn it into a contest where you tell her, listen, baby, I don't mind if

247
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,480
you keep ordering for me, but I'm going to order for you.

248
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,680
If I get to the waiter first, I'm ordering for you.

249
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,080
Yeah, well, it doesn't even have to be like that.

250
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,400
You can be like, who knows the other person better?

251
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,480
So like, she'll order something for you and she'll be like, I think he would like the

252
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,160
barbecue bacon onion burger from TGI Fridays.

253
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,280
And then you'll be like, she'll have cookies.

254
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,000
Sir, it's seven o'clock.

255
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,680
I know for a fact she hasn't eaten dinner yet because she's at a TGI Fridays.

256
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,480
I know what I said.

257
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,040
She'll have the cookies, please.

258
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
She'll have the cookies, please.

259
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,400
And a bowl of croutons.

260
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,000
I get a bowl of croutons, some of those cocktail swords.

261
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,080
There's one thing about my- I know about my girl and that she's got a big race coming

262
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,600
up and she's gotta carb.

263
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,560
Gotta carb up.

264
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,600
Croutons, please.

265
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,520
Just carb her.

266
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,920
Do you guys know what day it is?

267
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,960
Ah, God damn it.

268
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,200
Yep.

269
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,120
Oh, fuck.

270
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,240
It is May now.

271
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,400
I gotta go down the list though because I didn't pick it.

272
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,240
Oh, good, good.

273
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,640
Teen CEO month.

274
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,640
Oh, God.

275
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,360
Like Bieber, right?

276
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,000
Huh?

277
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,040
Like Bieber?

278
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,680
Like Bieber's the CEO of Bieber Industries?

279
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:13,920
Yeah.

280
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,840
Where did this company go wrong?

281
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,160
Maybe it was the milkshake machine.

282
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,600
This is mysterious.

283
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,560
React month.

284
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,720
Bang.

285
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,280
What was that?

286
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,360
I don't know.

287
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,080
I'll tell you in May.

288
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,160
National hamburger month, national barbecue month, a lot of food.

289
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,600
I don't know.

290
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,080
I don't know.

291
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,520
I need a whole month for hamburgers.

292
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,560
Like I'm pretty much up on those on the reg.

293
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,200
I made a hamburger last week on a grill.

294
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,040
I'm celebrating national hamburger year.

295
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,480
I'm celebrating national hamburger life.

296
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,240
What about eco driving month?

297
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,960
There's gotta be some tips, gotta be some tips and tricks.

298
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,200
Guys, you might have to dip into the weekly observances.

299
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,440
Please don't, Christ.

300
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,960
Teen CEO month.

301
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,720
Let's do it.

302
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,880
Let's help spread awareness.

303
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,920
Did you know that May 8th through 14th is national-

304
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,200
uh, salute to moms 35 plus week?

305
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,800
What?

306
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,640
Did you know that May 9th through the 13th is national etiquette week?

307
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,680
I don't-

308
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,960
I can't do these weeks with you.

309
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,240
I'm going to be straight with you guys.

310
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,960
This entire time as you've been talking about the weeks and everything,

311
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,320
I have in fact been picturing teen CEOs

312
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,480
and like Mr. Brad rolling in to the boardroom on a skateboard and saying like,

313
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,080
now there's a skateboard room.

314
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,880
Let's do teen-

315
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,760
Teen CEO month.

316
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,520
Mr. Brad?

317
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,400
Mr. Brad? Yeah, because that's what he has everyone call him.

318
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,320
He's like, Mr. Johnson's my father.

319
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,360
Call me Mr. Brad.

320
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,680
Let's start.

321
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,560
Let's start.

322
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,280
Okay.

323
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,080
I already started.

324
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,640
Okay, but in the form of a PSA, please.

325
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,240
Okay.

326
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,640
Hey, hey, teen CEOs.

327
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,360
They're just like regular CEOs, only shorter.

328
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,280
My brother, my brother.

329
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,280
Teen CEOs.

330
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,520
Teen CEOs.

331
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
They'll get dumped and lay off the whole mailroom.

332
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,240
Teen CEOs.

333
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,880
As long as your CFOs are grown up, this should be okay.

334
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,760
Teen CEOs.

335
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,480
Because an adult would want to run everything his way.

336
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,360
My brother, my brother.

337
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,600
That one is specific to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, by the way.

338
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,880
Teen CEOs.

339
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:40,080
Good luck sleeping your way to the top, felon.

340
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,680
Can I just talk more about Mr. Brad?

341
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Tired of Shaggy songs not being pumped into your office 24 hours a day?

342
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,720
Try a teen CEO.

343
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,480
He loves that shorty one.

344
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,480
I wish I had more modern references to dip into.

345
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,720
Shaggy is the most modern you can go?

346
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,360
Shaggy is about as modern as I could go in terms of music.

347
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,840
If you want to hear more Limp Bizkit, try a teen CEO.

348
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,080
Is there one called Disco Panic?

349
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,280
Is that an outfit that the kids are listening to?

350
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,960
Yeah, that is a pop punk outfit.

351
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,800
All right, so you want to hear more Disco Panic pumped into your office 24 hours a day?

352
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,040
If you want to hear more brown-eyed peas, try a teen CEO.

353
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,360
Maybe they'll get Fergie to come do some motivational work.

354
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,040
That would be inspiring, I think.

355
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,160
How about Will.i.am come and help everybody get their group back?

356
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,720
How about this?

357
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,520
Teen CEO, profits are down 15%, but angst is up by 20.

358
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,000
I cut expenses just to feel.

359
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,920
Oh, shit.

360
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,560
Try again.

361
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,160
Try to save the last minute.

362
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,200
Make this bit worth it.

363
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,880
We're not too not familiar.

364
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,920
I have a jingle that goes just like this.

365
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,960
Gotta mash them up.

366
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,240
This is a mashup.

367
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,520
I'm trying to lead you in here.

368
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,080
I want to give you one more time.

369
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,040
Here's a mashup.

370
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,400
Girl talk.

371
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,100
Shit.

372
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:31,140
The lion in Tweed is a friend indeed, and he's also a podcast too.

373
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,020
Shit, no, fuck.

374
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,500
Lost it.

375
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,100
All right, that's a good start.

376
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,820
Here we go.

377
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:47,140
The lion in Tweed is a friend indeed, and he's also a podcast too.

378
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:56,020
And a lion in time is a fine feline, but don't let him devour you.

379
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,900
I gotta do something on Media Lab.

380
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:14,500
I made a Photoshop with me and my best friend Michael Jordan.

381
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:24,580
Actually, it was me and Michael Jordan and the cast of Space Jam.

382
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,700
It was called Me and Space Jam.

383
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,380
I gotta do another verse.

384
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,180
Second verse, we actually talked about the shit.

385
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,780
Didn't even mention a thing.

386
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,500
All right, here we go.

387
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:51,780
I took me and Space Jam and I turned it into a website using Media Lab's site grinder technology.

388
00:18:51,780 --> 00:19:06,180
You can visit it, visit it, visit it, at griffinspacejam.com.

389
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,180
That was the worst.

390
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,180
For fear of dwelling too long in the buddy zone.

391
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,540
I have done so many-

392
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:21,140
Griffin, what exactly is the website for?

393
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:26,420
What are you doing there at Space Jam website?

394
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,900
Oh, is it just for your Space Jam fan fiction?

395
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,340
There's a story about me and Michael Jordan.

396
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,540
Listen, I got on a hot streak.

397
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,820
I was trying to find the exit off of that musical highway and I missed it.

398
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,260
And then I just had to keep going on the Michael Jordan Express.

399
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,500
You had no other choice.

400
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,540
What could you do?

401
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,380
Jesus, oh man, I'm going there right now, griffinspacejam.com.

402
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,260
Where can I hire an elf impersonator for my b-day party?

403
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:10,180
I am going all out this year and throwing myself a b-day party.

404
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,300
I'm an elf fanatic.

405
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,580
I think we could have assumed.

406
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,220
Yeah, I'm cool on elf.

407
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,660
I'm a minor elf enthusiast.

408
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,260
I bought my three friends three gifts to give me.

409
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:30,260
An elf lunchbox, an elf alarm clock, and an elf rock star action figure with guitar

410
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,380
and posable arms.

411
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,140
Let it sink in, okay?

412
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,060
Let it sink in.

413
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,140
All I need is an elf impersonator.

414
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,100
Where can I find this?

415
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,660
I would say, first and foremost, you need a few more things than just an elf impersonator.

416
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,300
I can think of 25 things off the top of my head that you need before you need an elf

417
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,020
impersonator.

418
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,940
I'm going to throw out this person has three friends.

419
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,700
Who apparently does not understand her penchant for elf.

420
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,860
They couldn't think, what's Carly all about?

421
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,020
Alf, I think.

422
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,220
That's maybe what you should do.

423
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,940
I'm going to throw out this person who has three friends.

424
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,620
Alf, I think, that's maybe what you should base your gifts on.

425
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,260
So tell me about this birthday party you're taking me to, Danny.

426
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,540
Yeah, it's going to be cool.

427
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,900
The guy's really nice.

428
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,460
There's this one thing.

429
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,660
Just a heads up.

430
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,940
Just a heads up.

431
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,140
If someone brings up Gordon Shumway, just roll with it.

432
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,420
He's a fan.

433
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,100
Welcome to Melmac.

434
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,980
We are not being particularly helpful.

435
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,180
You're right.

436
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,860
Where can they find an elf impersonator?

437
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,060
What's the number one?

438
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,860
Is there an accepted answer from the answer service?

439
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,740
Well, I'm reading up.

440
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,540
I don't know if you can see this.

441
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,740
I'm reading off a piece of paper.

442
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,180
Yeah, I don't have that.

443
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,180
I remember it because I looked it up.

444
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:46,900
Number one answer.

445
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,620
The midget store.

446
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:51,860
No, that's it.

447
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,500
No, you guys laugh.

448
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,140
But that's an excellent point because if you get an elf that

449
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,140
is like you get eye to eye with an elf, like he's the height of

450
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,380
a full grown man, like you will.

451
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,100
That's a I can't imagine anything scarier than that in my

452
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,340
mind than a six foot tall out.

453
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,980
You don't think like the whole situation is just terrifying.

454
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,420
I think the whole situation is terrifying in general.

455
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,220
But now you see, I thought this too.

456
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,060
Alf expanded to six feet tall horrifying, but not as horrifying

457
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,700
as that moment when you reach for the punch and you're like,

458
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,500
oh, oh, right there.

459
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,180
There's a whole emporium of oddly sized like 80s sitcom star

460
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,140
impersonators.

461
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:38,500
Could we make this like a giant Webster, like horrifyingly

462
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:44,740
gigantic wonders with killing power.

463
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,300
She's a robot, but with killing power.

464
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,180
Yeah, she's basically still cute as a button, but she's nine

465
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:50,740
feet tall.

466
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,220
She's sweet as pie.

467
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,540
Her arm does spin around to become a machine gun.

468
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,660
She's a darling that she's hooked up to Skynet, but

469
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,180
otherwise a real sweetheart.

470
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:08,100
I think that like if you are if you are a midget who a little

471
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,020
person who will go to who does birthday parties, if you are

472
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,860
an alpha impersonator, you don't care.

473
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,140
You've got the suit, right?

474
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,140
Like you've got the suit in your house.

475
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,140
There can't be enough of those just rolling around that call

476
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,780
me what you will.

477
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,140
I need the money real bad.

478
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,980
Is this guy going to be able to handle meeting alpha in person?

479
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,780
Is this guy going to be able to handle the pressure like I

480
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,580
could I could I am starstruck.

481
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,260
Let me pause it.

482
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,060
Another question.

483
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,260
Can we just get the real out?

484
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:42,900
What's he up to?

485
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,020
What is out been in since out?

486
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,020
Oh, fucking stupid off.

487
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,100
He's got to be doing something right somewhere.

488
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,660
There's a clock.

489
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,980
There's a room you could walk into and there would be elves

490
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,020
hanging from the ceiling.

491
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,940
Do you with that reality?

492
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,500
Let's just like dead eyed looking right at you.

493
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,420
We were talking about this.

494
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,060
We were talking about this backstage actually just rapping

495
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,620
about off.

496
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,220
How fucked up is it that Al's real name is Gordon Shumway, but

497
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,940
people still call him out like he told them his real his real

498
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,900
ass name, right?

499
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,580
Like, hi, I'm Gordon Shumway.

500
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,220
That's just that's shorthand bigotry is what that yeah.

501
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,500
Alphys is slave name.

502
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,900
That's what you're saying to me.

503
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,620
I'll edit that out later.

504
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,620
Fuck.

505
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,260
You know, a lot of people don't know this.

506
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,220
LeVar Burton played elf.

507
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,580
That's true.

508
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,380
That's true.

509
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,100
That's true.

510
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,580
You laugh.

511
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,460
It's true.

512
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,660
He's multifaceted.

513
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,220
Not just a blind man, also an extraterrestrial with a real

514
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,340
taste in the world.

515
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,380
Extraterrestrial with a real taste for kitties.

516
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,020
Ladies are like, like mad sexy.

517
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,780
They're like super sexy.

518
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,260
All of them.

519
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,700
A hundred percent guys.

520
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,020
We don't have like, unless I blast my core, like Bradley

521
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,780
Cooper style, unless me and Coop hit up the gym and do some

522
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,300
yoga lattes and blast our pecs and cores, just whale on them.

523
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,420
Or even Bradley Whitford style.

524
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,940
See, that's my jam.

525
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,780
I would take a Bradley Whitford core at this point.

526
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,900
Forever a Whitford.

527
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,740
Maria Cooper.

528
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,180
This one was sent in by Cameron Daigle.

529
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,100
I'm sorry I said his name like that.

530
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,460
Thank you, Cameron Daigle.

531
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,140
It's by Yahoo Answers user Monkey Pot Tree Nut who asks

532
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,700
Pregnant with twins.

533
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,660
Are these good names?

534
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,860
I was thinking of cute.

535
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,580
Wait, can I, can I, can I prognosticate an answer?

536
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,140
Sure.

537
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,700
They are not.

538
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,100
I was thinking, I was thinking of fun and cute names for my

539
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,540
twins, boy and girl.

540
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,340
Heart.

541
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,660
I'm also inspired by a lot of celebrities.

542
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,500
Their children have such unique names.

543
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,780
Anyway, here it goes.

544
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,020
Starting with a girl's name and then a boy's name.

545
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:15,780
Jam and Ham Smith.

546
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,260
Nice.

547
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,940
Lola and Boba Smith.

548
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,200
Boba?

549
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,900
Sammy and Sammy Smith.

550
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,180
Now hold up.

551
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,300
Sammy S-A-M-I and Sammy S-A-M-M-Y.

552
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,900
Oh, Jesus.

553
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,620
Law and Lee Smith.

554
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,940
That would make, that would make Sophie's Choice really tough,

555
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,580
wouldn't it?

556
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,460
Take Sammy.

557
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,340
You guys work it out.

558
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,740
Can you say Law and Lee?

559
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,020
Law and Lee Smith.

560
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,420
Sugar and Spice Smith.

561
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,620
Oh, God.

562
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,260
That's got my-

563
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,820
Wait, is the boy Sugar and the girl Spice and the boy Spice?

564
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,140
Nope.

565
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,780
You had it right.

566
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,340
Oh, God.

567
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,580
Sylvia-

568
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,620
You know what that boy is?

569
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,660
A teen runaway.

570
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,340
Sylvia and Silvio Smith.

571
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,620
Because they're living in a Shakespeare comedy.

572
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,380
Apple and Pear Smith.

573
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,740
Oh, God.

574
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,860
Which pear is your favorite?

575
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,260
Thanks.

576
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,740
I like apple and pear.

577
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:25,380
Just like fucking turn your whole family into some big, awful fruit salad.

578
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,540
Big stupid-

579
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,380
Just a big dumb compote.

580
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,700
Did my boys in the Yahoo Answers crew, did they have any votes?

581
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,380
Yahoo Answers user, you know you love me, said,

582
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,340
great for dogs.

583
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,420
How's your burn?

584
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,300
Hey, check your face.

585
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,180
It's on the ground.

586
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,380
I just rammed your face to the deep fat fryer because it burned so bad.

587
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,420
I burned you so hard.

588
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,860
Pretty good one.

589
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,460
Pretty good zinger.

590
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,340
Okay, someone said jam is an adorable name for a little girl.

591
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,700
No, it's not.

592
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,340
Nope.

593
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,580
Hey, I take you as my bride, jam.

594
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,260
Excuse me?

595
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,380
Hi, I'm jam.

596
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:08,820
Hi.

597
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,820
That is a fucking power play.

598
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,420
Oh, jam.

599
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,220
What does that mean?

600
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,500
It means that before I was even born, my parents decided they hate me.

601
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,700
They hated me already.

602
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,900
You got legitimate grounds, like mom, dad, you hate me.

603
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,060
Like they, yeah, it seems like it.

604
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,740
Can we come up with some other rhyming couplets for this later?

605
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,020
Sure, sure.

606
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,140
Food based, maybe, since most of these are.

607
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,020
So like, these are my kids, hot and pocket.

608
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,660
What rhymes with would be better off adopted?

609
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:40,980
Mark.

610
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,940
Mark, that's not quite it.

611
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,860
But what about Julie and Julia?

612
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,060
These are my kids, Susan and Schmoozin.

613
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,420
This is my son, Schmoozin.

614
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,780
I'm very proud of him.

615
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,740
I love him dearly.

616
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,140
What about, can we call him Pepsi and Coke?

617
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,220
Pepsi and Coke.

618
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:03,700
Pepsi.

619
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,340
Can you choose between my kids in a blind taste test?

620
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,460
What is that, uncle Kevin?

621
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,020
No, thank you.

622
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,700
Can you call one Mountain Dew and one Dr. Pepper?

623
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:16,900
I'm Dr.

624
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,300
This is their younger sister, Mr. Pim.

625
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,340
I am Dr. Dr. Pepper Smith.

626
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,780
This is my brother, Jam.

627
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,380
This is our poor, this is our poor cousin, Dr.

628
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:27,860
Thunder.

629
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,500
Just keep having twins until you can fucking

630
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,020
stock a refrigerator with your children.

631
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,060
But don't do that.

632
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,980
I can't, I can't state this strongly enough.

633
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,740
Sweetheart, we ran out of Miracle Whip.

634
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,940
We gotta have a, we gotta have a kid, I guess.

635
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,660
And name him that.

636
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,420
How does this work again?

637
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,060
I don't, I don't understand.

638
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,820
Let's go, let's go, I'm confused.

639
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,500
You name the kid the food, but it's, I'm still hungry after it.

640
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,620
Oh, these, the poor hell, the poor hell that these kids are being born into.

641
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,940
Okay, here's what you need to do.

642
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,180
Whenever you think about what you're going to name your kids,

643
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,900
just set up some practice sentences in your head.

644
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,820
Like, yeah, like, hello, my name is Jam.

645
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,260
Like that, oops.

646
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,860
I would love to work here.

647
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,620
I want to be a doctor.

648
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,060
I'm your Dr. Jam Smith.

649
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,260
I'm Dr. Jam.

650
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,940
This is my partner.

651
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,820
No, I take it back.

652
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:31,140
Dr. Jam is perfect because you're setting him up to be a professional sports person.

653
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,020
Dr. Jam.

654
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,820
And this, this is my boombox.

655
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,860
He's my resident.

656
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,940
I'm going to cut into you and fix you.

657
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,260
Yeah.

658
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,060
Now, this is my resident boombox and I'm Dr. Jam.

659
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,420
What's wrong?

660
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,940
What, how can I help you today?

661
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:50,020
I'm in a private practice with Dr. Kreigenstein.

662
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,580
Take it back.

663
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,700
These are awesome names.

664
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,740
Who is that in the corner?

665
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,300
It's Ham.

666
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,340
It's my brother Ham.

667
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,380
He's on the ones and twos.

668
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,060
He's going to mix while I cut in.

669
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,820
Yeah, so I think they're all pretty good.

670
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,740
Griffin, let's do this thing.

671
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,780
What are they short for?

672
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,980
Hamilton and Jamilton.

673
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:15,940
And our country's 53rd president was, of course, Jamilton P. Smith.

674
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,460
How about a Yahoo?

675
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,260
Because I've got a lot of them.

676
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,140
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

677
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,980
Oh, this will be good.

678
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,340
This one was sent in by Jacob Blocker, who's just the best guy.

679
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,580
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ice Cream Eater, who asks,

680
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:39,860
should I build a disco playhouse for kids in my backyard?

681
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:41,860
Yes.

682
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,180
Let me explain.

683
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:49,700
I had this idea in the back of my head for a while, and I liked a little advice.

684
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,580
And that's what we do here.

685
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,220
I myself was a 70s kid and disco fever never died in my heart.

686
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,860
What if I built a mini studio 54 in my backyard?

687
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,620
What?

688
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,620
I could get a disco ball, a stereo for my old record player,

689
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,780
and a Pixy Stix vending machine.

690
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:13,700
I'd love to dress my kids up like 70s celebrities like John Travolta,

691
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,580
Barbra Streisand, Mick Jagger, and such, and make them dance and have fun.

692
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,660
Should I go through with the idea?

693
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,180
Hey, you fucking kids.

694
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,980
Hey, you fucking kids.

695
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,580
You don't look like you're having fun.

696
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,420
We're gonna make you have fun, Babs.

697
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,820
I'm gonna make you have fun.

698
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,660
Little Babs, dance with little John.

699
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,060
Have fun.

700
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,220
Do your best, Jagger, because you're Mick Jagger.

701
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:33,780
Do it.

702
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,300
Snort this Pixy Stix.

703
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,100
Snort it.

704
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,220
That's what he means, right?

705
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,020
My Pixy Stix?

706
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,900
Oh, Christ, yes.

707
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,660
What colors should the inside of the disco playhouse be painted?

708
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,060
Should the disco playhouse have windows or no windows so it's dark inside?

709
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,820
Yeah, I think the color of massive amounts of psychological suffering.

710
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,340
That's really gonna-

711
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:52,820
Puse?

712
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,100
What color would you paint the inside of the disco playhouse door?

713
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,340
If the disco lights, disco ball is turned on, and me and the kids are dancing,

714
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,380
would it be better to have curtains at the entrance of the disco playhouse

715
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,580
to block out any outside light or no curtains and close the door?

716
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,700
I think-

717
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,940
Holy fucking shit!

718
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,380
Jesus Christ!

719
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,780
Which is the one that keeps Jesus out?

720
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,140
Is that curtains or is that a door?

721
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,820
Cause if he could see, he's gonna kill you instantly and take you to hell.

722
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,380
Himself.

723
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,820
And he doesn't like to go down there.

724
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,600
Wow!

725
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,200
So-

726
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,380
Dog.

727
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:25,700
You-

728
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,260
Dog!

729
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,940
No, no windows.

730
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,860
No, you owe it to your brood.

731
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:37,700
Your ruined brood to make sure that their fucking friends, their cohorts,

732
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,860
in elementary school aren't gonna see them dressed up in polyester jumpsuits

733
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,180
and snorting pixie sticks with their dad!

734
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:44,820
It's too late!

735
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,540
Their dad-

736
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,340
Their dad inside!

737
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,380
You killed him already!

738
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,060
They're dead inside and outside if you let them snort pixie sticks

739
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,940
in a tiny studio 54 you built in your backyard!

740
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,420
Hey, I know I only get you kids on the weekends, but listen.

741
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,700
Listen, look what I've been working on all week.

742
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,940
I've been working on a discotheque for you and your little-

743
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,140
Do your friends want to come?

744
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,700
You want to have your little friends come?

745
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,900
Dad, we're 26.

746
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,660
We're 26 years old, dad.

747
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,340
You know, you know, I heard your friends talking about how much you love the Gap Band

748
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,580
and I was just, oh, that's a conversation that never happened, nor will it ever?

749
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,020
God, I miss the 70s.

750
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,460
Yeah, I miss the 70s too.

751
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,220
Hey, do you guys want to make a wild cherry reunion group?

752
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,660
Like we'll get a little wild cherries is what we'll call it.

753
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,180
Motherfucker.

754
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:32,740
How?

755
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:38,020
Okay, no windows, no doors, no walls.

756
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,660
Don't do it.

757
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,140
No problem.

758
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,260
No problem.

759
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,620
You never had-

760
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,820
Listen, I've had some fucking stupid ideas too, okay?

761
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,860
I'm there with you.

762
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:52,020
Like I've had some ill-advised notions that my wife has had to dispel me of.

763
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,500
I tried to order my own dinner once.

764
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,100
That did not go well, for example.

765
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,100
This, or is it great?

766
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:05,700
Like I want it to be going on in the world that I live in.

767
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,340
I just don't like the idea of it happening to real people.

768
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,220
Yeah, I don't like the idea of a dad like consulting with his children.

769
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,980
Like, should there be a fuck room?

770
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,460
Like dad, daddy.

771
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:21,540
Should we just have like a champagne, like a champagne tent maybe?

772
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,180
This is the, this is the stupid slide.

773
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,300
It's cutted in vodka.

774
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,900
Crazy.

775
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,700
Tonight.

776
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:35,140
I think that you're never too young to indulge in all of your mind and heart's bacchanalian desires.

777
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,500
Unless the only party guests have the same last name as you.

778
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,380
In which case, you're always too young.

779
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,860
It's just gonna be me and the kids partying like it's 1973.

780
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,580
The kids.

781
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:48,980
No.

782
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,540
The kids punked out at like 10 30.

783
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,860
They went inside and watched Babar.

784
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,700
But I stayed there just twirling.

785
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,020
Just wildly twirling to the sound of Donna Summer.

786
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:02,420
Hoping that if I spin fast enough, I'll reverse the rotation of the earth

787
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:06,420
and travel back in time to grown-up Studio 54.

788
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,860
To adult Studio 54.

789
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,780
The one good thing about this is you're really gonna prepare your kids

790
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,060
because for the rest of their life, they can always say,

791
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,420
no matter how sad or weird things get for them,

792
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,500
they can always say it's neither the saddest nor weirdest thing they've ever been a party to.

793
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,860
And when your kid becomes the Bay Harbor Butcher

794
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,660
and they're constantly trying to peel people's faces off,

795
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,620
they have a pretty justifiable reason for why they are that way.

796
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,300
Hey, I just want to say, I don't want to creep you out, but I think you're beautiful.

797
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,900
Can I teach you how to roller skate?

798
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:42,660
Will you come to Lil 54 with me and let me teach you?

799
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,940
We're going to Lil 54.

800
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,820
I hear Lil Elton John is there playing Lil Crocodile Rock.

801
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,620
The kids love it.

802
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,620
What if it turns out to be really fucking fresh, though?

803
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,380
What if it's dope and every kid wants to get in?

804
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,180
What if it's dope and everyone wants to be your kid's friends because of it?

805
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,180
They have to stand behind a tiny velvet rope

806
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,500
and have sex with the tiny doorman to get in.

807
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,300
Stop it.

808
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,180
That's not good.

809
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,980
You're weirding me out.

810
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,460
That is what will happen.

811
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,860
I haven't seen the movie in there, a movie called Just 54, and it's just like-

812
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:15,140
Just Mike Myers and Ryan Phillippe.

813
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,100
And they're just fucking in big pits of bubbles all the time,

814
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,460
when the bubbles are made of LSD.

815
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,820
And then three flamingos are there.

816
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,140
What if the dad is the only one that gets coked out

817
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,060
and he just rolls around the dance floor welcoming kids to his party?

818
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,420
Welcome to my party.

819
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,560
Welcome.

820
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,200
Welcome to Little 54.

821
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,160
Michael's over there in the corner if you want to go play with him.

822
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,240
What do you mean I can't get in, Little Bouncer?

823
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,600
I made this place.

824
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,360
I built this out of my own two hands.

825
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,360
I am Little Studio 54.

826
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,680
You can't cut me out, David.

827
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,840
We built this together one weekend, if you remember.

828
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,880
Hey, if this happens, can everybody-

829
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,400
Can we crowdsource this and just say, everybody, go outside,

830
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,040
look in your backyard, look in your neighbor's backyards,

831
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,080
and if you see this, if you see this, can you just call me?

832
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,120
I'll give you my number.

833
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,920
I need to know.

834
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,560
It's been a really rough month, and I could really use this in my life right now.

835
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:29,240
Can you believe us?

836
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,160
So far, so good.

837
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,600
So far, so great.

838
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,280
Were we ever so young?

839
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,240
A lot of classic bits there for your enjoyment.

840
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,840
We want to take just a second to visit the Money Zone with you

841
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,880
and tell you about Prosper.

842
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,680
Actually, Travis, you tell me about Prosper.

843
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,920
Well, Justin, have you ever tried walking to a bank

844
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,280
and asking for a personal loan to pay off something like credit cards

845
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,520
or home improvement or maybe just start a home business?

846
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,040
I tried to take out a loan for a funny business, I told them.

847
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,000
I got some- And what did they say?

848
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,480
Believe it or not, no.

849
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,120
They said no, those assholes.

850
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,840
Well, there's a better way to borrow money, and it's called Prosper.com.

851
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,400
Basically, think about it like this.

852
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,200
If you have something that maybe is in a regular loan

853
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,480
or even something you would get from a bank, a car loan

854
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,880
or something along those lines, Prosper.com makes it simpler.

855
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,160
You don't have to go to a bank.

856
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,600
They can take care of it for you.

857
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,320
They can also do things like if you have expensive dental work

858
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,840
or a move across the country.

859
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,960
Teresa and I just did that, and Prosper would have helped out a lot

860
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,760
if I had thought about it, but I didn't because I'm a stupid head.

861
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,000
And they can help because basically what it is is a peer-to-peer lending site.

862
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,560
So there are people out there with money to invest,

863
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,960
and there are people out there that need that money.

864
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,560
So this works for both parties.

865
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,080
You can borrow up to $35,000 at a low fixed rate

866
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,920
without ever setting foot in a bank.

867
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,680
And the thing is, you can also borrow smaller amounts anywhere.

868
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:57,000
I want to say it's from $2,500 to $35,000 depending on your needs.

869
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,680
So if you're sitting out there and you're thinking,

870
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,640
oh, I've got all these student loans and I want to consolidate them.

871
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,280
Okay, great.

872
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,000
Get a loan for that, and then you got one loan payment to make.

873
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,080
If you're sitting there saying, oh, I have to replace the furnace in my house

874
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,240
and it's going to cost $3,000 I don't have.

875
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,400
Maybe you have a medical bill that you can't pay off

876
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,640
and they're not giving you any kind of payment plan.

877
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,920
Go check out prosper.com and I think that they might be able to help you.

878
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,560

by going to prosper.com slash my brother.

880
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,280
Maybe you don't know your credit score.

881
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,720
Maybe you've been afraid to go into a bank

882
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,400
because you think that your credit score is too bad.

883
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,360
Go find out.

884
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,440

00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,240

See site for programming visa prepaid card details.

896
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,800

Web Bank, a Utah Chartered Industrial Bank member FDIC equal opportunity lender.

899
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,280
Now, Justin, what voice would you say that that was?

900
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,960
That was just like business guy voice.

901
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:14,840
Now here's my-

902
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,920
I thought it was lazy Patrick Warburton.

903
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,280
Now here's my web guy voice.

904
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,920
My brother, my brother, me is supported by Squarespace

905
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,960
and all on one platform that makes it fast and easy

906
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,760
to create your own professional website or online portfolio.

907
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,640
You don't have to sound like me to create websites.

908
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,520
I understand why you would assume that, but it's not just limited to folks like myself.

909
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:36,840
Even-

910
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,520
There don't have to be bodybuilders out there that sound like that too, right?

911
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:46,520
Even you plebeians out there can create a website with Squarespace.

912
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,640
There's support team available 24 seven if you get lost.

913
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,960
It's got responsive design.

914
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,120
So whatever website you make, it's going to look great on your computer,

915
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:03,080
but also on your phone or on your tablet or whatever on your Google Glass.

916
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,440
Maybe not Google Glass.

917
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,360
I don't actually know about Google Glass, but for just eight bucks a month.

918
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:17,320
If you've been your second net, if you've been looking for the time to get into web design,

919
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,320
there's never been a better time than this because Squarespace is going to make it easy on you.

920
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,640
So here's what you're going to do.

921
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,080
You need no credit card.

922
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,520
You're just going to start a trial and start building the website

923
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,600
because you're going to go to squarespace.com and you're going to use the offer code,

924
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,480
my brother.

925
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,800
That's all one word, my brother and get this.

926
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,680
You're going to get 10% off your first purchase.

927
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,640
Squarespace.

928
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,520
A better web starts with your website.

929
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,720
Go check it out you dummy.

930
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,520
Trav, I got a message for you.

931
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,120
For me?

932
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,520
Yeah.

933
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:54,760
It's well, no, it's from, it's for Adam Calfee and it's from Guy and Gordon.

934
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,320
Okay.

935
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:55,560
Okay.

936
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,120
And it says to read in a spooky voice.

937
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,640
So I'm going to give it my best shot.

938
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,000
Adam Calfree.

939
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,360
Wait, no, I'm going to stop you right there.

940
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,120
Would you do it in the pallbearer voice?

941
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,360
Okay.

942
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,160
Adam Calfree.

943
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,520
That's right.

944
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,080
We said Adam Calfree.

945
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,880
I actually have to, you can't see this.

946
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,120
I'm actually stroking an invisible urn.

947
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,400
I can't do this.

948
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,720
Does the pallbearer voice, is there some kind of weird stutter that makes you put an R in his name?

949
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,400
No, Calfee.

950
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:25,640
Okay.

951
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,440
Let me try again.

952
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,200
Adam Calfee.

953
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,080
That's right.

954
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,840
We said Adam Calfee.

955
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,160
This is a birthday wish from Gus and Jordan.

956
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:43,560
We hope all the spooks, ghouls, and ghosts come out for your big spooky 30th birthday.

957
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,920
It's pretty fucking spooky.

958
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:53,640
I also like that the message is from Guy and Gordon, but it's also from Gus and Jordan, apparently.

959
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,760
Do you have any other messages?

960
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,240
Yes, we do.

961
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,760
We have a message for Alicia.

962
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,480
This message is from Dan, and Dan says, Hey, Alicia, hope you're having a great day.

963
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,440
See you later.

964
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,000
Love, Dan.

965
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,000
Very cool, Dan.

966
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,520
Very good use of your money, Dan.

967
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,320
Nailed it.

968
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,200
Nailed it, Dan.

969
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,680
Alicia is very, very impressed that you have such disposable income.

970
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:14,920
Yeah.

971
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:23,160
Yeah, I don't know if Alicia is your sister, your wife, your imaginary friend, your business

972
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,440
partner, whatever.

973
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,880
Your second life wife.

974
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,600
I think she is going to be won over by that hit message.

975
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:35,880
So anyway, with that housekeeping business being done, let's get back to the show.

976
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,720
And don't forget, if you want a message on the Jumbotron, just go to MaximumFun.org

977
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,920
forward slash Jumbotron and you too could hear your weird, simple message on our Money Zone.

978
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,200
I said back to the show.

979
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,120
Hey, I like this girl, but I'm afraid to ask her out because we haven't spent a lot of

980
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:56,600
time together.

981
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,400
However, I'm sure if I wait too long, the whole thing might peter out.

982
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,360
What should I do?

983
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,560
Form spring.

984
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,440
Does he know a guy named Peter that's going to soup his lady?

985
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,280
I don't know.

986
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:15,480
So 58 episodes in and that's the final answer.

987
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:21,320
This is where I finally admit that like, I don't get these people that like, sometimes

988
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,560
we get these questions and the answer is so obvious that I think they're fucking with

989
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:25,880
me.

990
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:31,240
Like, hey, hey, just ask her, dummy.

991
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,320
Like, just, just, you can't.

992
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,320
If you don't ask her to spend time with you, you can't spend time.

993
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,280
How do you think that happens?

994
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,560
Like, you're not filling up like a giant novelty like thermometer on a donation board.

995
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,480
You don't have to spend X amount of time before you ask her out.

996
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,360
You just like hoping you get stuck in an elevator.

997
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,480
Just ask her to go fucking.

998
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,640
You want to go ice fishing with me?

999
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,280
Hey, I hear there's going to be a tornado warning on Thursday.

1000
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,920
Do you want to come to my basement and like, it'll be hilarious.

1001
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,160
Do you want to get accidentally stuck in a freezer with me?

1002
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,720
So we can recap all the great times we've had together.

1003
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,080
Like in that one episode of Perfect Strangers, because then I can ask you out.

1004
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,840
Cute meets.

1005
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,600
They don't happen in real life.

1006
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,720
No, they don't.

1007
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,240
They do not happen like that.

1008
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,000
Do you know how you spend more time with someone?

1009
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,880
You ask them out.

1010
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,880
Yeah, just ask them out.

1011
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,000
You're ready.

1012
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,880
Peter, which I'm assuming is your name.

1013
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,360
Oh God, I hope so.

1014
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,240
And he uses the phrase Peter out to mean something awesome.

1015
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,280
Yeah, he says whenever he leaves the room.

1016
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,120
Peter out?

1017
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,520
Check this out.

1018
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,480
Check this out, Peter.

1019
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,160
You wait too long and you die.

1020
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:44,600
Oops.

1021
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,160
I could have loved her forever.

1022
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,680
Now I can't.

1023
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,120
You got any big plans this weekend?

1024
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:50,520
Yeah, man.

1025
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,760
I'm going to go to Zaxby's and totally Peter out.

1026
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,480
Those people aren't going to know what they saw.

1027
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,320
It's going to be heinous in there.

1028
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,280
I'm just going to let loose and Peter out.

1029
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,160
I'm just going to Peter out.

1030
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:01,720
I've earned it.

1031
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,240
I've earned one fucking weekend of petering out.

1032
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,800
I think I've sold.

1033
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,560
I sold all the shoes at Foot Locker.

1034
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,800
I think I can have one weekend of petering out.

1035
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,240
I think I think I've earned that.

1036
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,400
They can't take that from me.

1037
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,360
Hey, hey, hey, you can take as much alimony from me as you want.

1038
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:25,080
You'll never like my my ability to Peter out was not part of the settlement.

1039
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,160
Depra.

1040
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:32,360
Can I say something about Tim Allen?

1041
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,200
I don't care for the man's comedy.

1042
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,160
All right, let's just hold on.

1043
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:37,640
Let's stop.

1044
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,960
Let's just do home improvement time.

1045
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,000
OK, OK, I want to say something about Tim Allen.

1046
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,520
This is a public service message from your friends and my brother and brother me.

1047
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:46,760
OK.

1048
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,880
I don't enjoy the man's comedy myself.

1049
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,280
But do you realize what kind of a salesman you have to be

1050
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:59,240
to walk in his studio exec's office and say, I'm going to make a show about.

1051
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,040
I would make a show about a guy who hosts a home improvement show

1052
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,240
and he has a fat bearded friend and a man that lives in a fence.

1053
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,600
Could I have a million dollars?

1054
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,360
Let's run this for 12 seasons.

1055
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,720
I want to run this for it's going to run for 12 years.

1056
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,280
It's about a man in a fence and a dwarf.

1057
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,200
When you say a dwarf, when you say man in a fence,

1058
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,960
he sounds like some sort of fable.

1059
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,680
Hi, my name is Wilson.

1060
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,480
I'm a fable.

1061
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,000
I'm your neighbor.

1062
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,800
Here's some wisdom.

1063
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,680
He did grant wishes.

1064
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,040
Do you guys?

1065
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:36,520
Everybody on that show, they I think they all like sort of simultaneously realized

1066
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,600
they weren't going to do any better work and then just kind of just kind of fell off.

1067
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:40,840
Right.

1068
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,040
Do you know how many executive producers that show had?

1069
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,760
I bet you're going to tell me.

1070
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,360
I bet you're going to tell me nine.

1071
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,280
That just seems to here's the public service message.

1072
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,480
OK, OK, I feel like your life is directionless.

1073
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,240
They probably need someone to executive produce some improvement.

1074
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,880
When I go over there, put in an app.

1075
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,200
There's my brother, right?

1076
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,280
That shows been off the air like 13 whole years, but they're still making.

1077
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,000
What do these guys do?

1078
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,520
I mean, they're still making it.

1079
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,240
It's just not being.

1080
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,240
We still make home improvement.

1081
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,360
You might not see it.

1082
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,200
Yeah, it was part of that.

1083
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,280
You know how we have a strategic oil reserve?

1084
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,520
We have strategic reserve home improvement episodes.

1085
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,360
The price of home improvement is so high.

1086
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,960
We have got to bring it down.

1087
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,560
Somebody send out some VHS is.

1088
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,320
Well, ever since the war in Libya started and Muammar Gaddafi started like hoarding

1089
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:37,960
his home improvement, like we've had to start slowly releasing our home improvement

1090
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,920
to keep the costs down.

1091
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,680
Hey, we don't guess what, Mr.

1092
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:47,960
President, we don't approve of trading young soldiers blood for episodes of home improvement.

1093
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,600
Yeah, that is not acceptable.

1094
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,240
Do you know how we're going to fix that situation in Libya, though, for real?

1095
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,800
Do you know how we're going to how we're going to fix it?

1096
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,080
How we're going to air it out?

1097
00:49:59,080 --> 00:49:59,720
How Griffin?

1098
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,800
Wait, I have a guess.

1099
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,300
How?

1100
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,040
More power.

1101
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:04,540
Yes.

1102
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,080
Here's here.

1103
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,360
Let's do some actual PSA.

1104
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:10,860
Yes.

1105
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,760
Hey, hey, well, that's not PSA.

1106
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,840
Don't start with a third of really that conversation.

1107
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,480
We'll do it anyway.

1108
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:23,160
Hey, if you see Zachary Ty Bryan on the street, why don't you give him a buck or two?

1109
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,480
He could really use the help.

1110
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,200
My brother, my brother.

1111
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:32,440
I know it seems like a good idea at the time, but don't put a V8 engine in a dishwasher.

1112
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,640
It only leads to pain.

1113
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,320
My brother, my brother and me.

1114
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,520
Oh, my brother, my brother.

1115
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,880
Richard Karn is swag as fuck.

1116
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,120
My brother, my brother and me.

1117
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,040
Dude, don't let Richard Karn turn into the next Ray Combs.

1118
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,040
Tell him how much you appreciate him today.

1119
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,240
My brother, my brother.

1120
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,840
Have you hugged a Richard Karn today?

1121
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,480
We can't find your keys.

1122
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,840
Check Richard Karn's beard.

1123
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,640
My brother, my brother.

1124
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,000
Did you put my keys up there again?

1125
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,200
Dick Karn.

1126
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:12,520
I put my keys in Dick Karn's beard in 1994 and they were never seen again.

1127
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,600
That's where we keep the reserves.

1128
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,320
Hey, do you want a Yahoo?

1129
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,280
Yeah, redeem yourself.

1130
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,400
This one was sent in by Andrew Binder.

1131
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,280
Thank you, Andrew.

1132
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user LOL, who asks,

1133
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,840
is it normal to be sexually attracted to...

1134
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,600
Anybody want to guess?

1135
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,760
Yes, I want to guess my answer, no.

1136
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,000
Numbers.

1137
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,520
Numbers.

1138
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,080
Is it okay to be sexually attracted to numbers?

1139
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,480
He adds, I admit I am gay.

1140
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:46,760
Well, okay.

1141
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,960
But there are some nights where I take the algebra book back into my room

1142
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,320
and jack off to the numbers.

1143
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,960
Number three is my favorite because it's so sexy.

1144
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,360
Well, yeah.

1145
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,720
It looks like a sideways butt.

1146
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:02,520
Yeah.

1147
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,320
That makes sense.

1148
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,360
It adds up or maybe ups like sideways balls.

1149
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,040
There's a lot of things that that three could be.

1150
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,240
And sideways boobs.

1151
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,360
It's not okay.

1152
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,240
Three is pretty hot.

1153
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,880
Let's break this question down.

1154
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,600
The first, my biggest problem with it is that he says,

1155
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:23,320
I admit that I am gay as if that has any bearing on the situation whatsoever.

1156
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,520
If you're straight in the numbers, then that's cool.

1157
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,240
Yeah.

1158
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,120
Or like, is he saying that that's like a side effect?

1159
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:34,680
It's like one out of every 100 people who like people of their same gender

1160
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,360
also would like to fuck a number.

1161
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,400
What's the sexiest number, everybody?

1162
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,920
See this, listen, we're not ready to have that conversation yet.

1163
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,960
We'll get to that.

1164
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,600
But I think we need to come up with some rules first.

1165
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,080
Okay.

1166
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,360
Are we talking about fucking the idea of a number?

1167
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:54,600
Are we talking about, I have the important thing is not to fuck anything under 16.

1168
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:00,680
Well, we're not going to think of anything funnier than that.

1169
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,160
God damn it.

1170
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:06,280
Are we, but I mean, are we talking about like fucking an actual,

1171
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,480
like if we could manifest this number into an actual shape,

1172
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,760
which shape would be like the most pleasurable to like rub up against?

1173
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,440
Do you have to pick a numeral?

1174
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,480
A numeral or cause like there's so many combinations beyond that.

1175
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,080
I'm saying what is the hottest numeral.

1176
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,680
We have to set a limit.

1177
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:26,200
Cause I could just say like 16,783,492.

1178
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,480
And then that's a fucking orgy.

1179
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,600
Once you get that number,

1180
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,920
let's say between zero and a hundred.

1181
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:36,120
No numeral, a numeral between one zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine.

1182
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,560
Oh, I see what you're saying.

1183
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:37,800
Yes.

1184
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,000
It's zero.

1185
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:39,960
Nope.

1186
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,160
Nope.

1187
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:41,560
You're off.

1188
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,840
Zero is mysterious.

1189
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,280
Travis, you're a fool.

1190
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,480
Justin, do you want to guess?

1191
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,200
Well, zero is not bad.

1192
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,360
I think seven is the sexiest number.

1193
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,600
Travis second guess eight.

1194
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,120
Yup.

1195
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,640
What's up two holes.

1196
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,360
How did you get there?

1197
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:56,920
Two holes.

1198
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,840
Which one is down?

1199
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,800
Do you want the top?

1200
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,080
Do you want that solid, that solid hefty bottom?

1201
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,560
Or do you want the narrow, the slightly narrower top?

1202
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:13,720
And also it recalls, it recalls snowmen, which everybody would all agree.

1203
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,800
Always hot.

1204
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,920
I shouldn't impress my, my feelings on people.

1205
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:23,000
Here's if I were to defend eight, I were to say it's obviously not three.

1206
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,200
Right.

1207
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,680
Because the three is just half an eight.

1208
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,840
You cut it sideways right down the front already.

1209
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,400
Sure.

1210
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,600
Why have a, why have, you could have two threes already.

1211
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,400
It's called an eight.

1212
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,200
A number one.

1213
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,360
How are you supposed to fuck that?

1214
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,240
Really?

1215
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:37,480
Yeah.

1216
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:38,840
Zero.

1217
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,000
That cavity is gigantic.

1218
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,240
No.

1219
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:41,480
Yeah.

1220
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,560
That's just a, you're just begging to feel inadequate.

1221
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:43,960
Two.

1222
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:50,280
I think you could make a case for it's, it's got a nice curvature, which you guys know.

1223
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,400
I'm a fan of.

1224
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:51,640
Yeah.

1225
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,920
You do like curvatures.

1226
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:58,840
The problem with two and five and seven.

1227
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:00,280
Yeah.

1228
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:00,840
And that's it.

1229
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,800
Where, where do you put it?

1230
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:02,920
Yeah.

1231
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,880
I see what you're saying.

1232
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,040
Where do you have to have intercourse with the numeral?

1233
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,000
And that is what we're saying.

1234
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,120
Right.

1235
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:12,520
Then a three would be tricky, but I think you could, you could do it.

1236
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:13,320
Yeah.

1237
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,040
I think so too.

1238
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:20,520
I would like to know when this person discovered this problem because it,

1239
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,440
it could have made for like the most awkward math class ever when he's sitting there and

1240
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:29,080
the teacher's like, say I have 12 apples and I take five away.

1241
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,120
What do you have?

1242
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,320
And the answer is boner.

1243
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,440
Hey, Hey Griff, are there any answers?

1244
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,880
Do you want to help him out at all?

1245
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:42,440
Uh, Diana Quimby says, I like 69.

1246
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,160
Oh, that's cool.

1247
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,440
Nice try, Diana.

1248
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,520
Um, so many, so many.

1249
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,120
Um, okay.

1250
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,240
Says yes.

1251
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,200
Completely normal.

1252
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:54,840
Have fun.

1253
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,280
You're not hurting anyone.

1254
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,000
I disagree.

1255
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,320
Now I agree with the second half of that sentence, but let's not throw around

1256
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,320
terms like completely completely normal.

1257
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,080
Um, you robbed the words of their power.

1258
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:12,280
Yeah, I'm a Gleek says everyone has their quirks, I guess.

1259
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:18,120
So neon Nathan, guess what number Nathan, a number Nathan.

1260
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,240
What's up with number Nathan?

1261
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,520
He's over there.

1262
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,560
He's playing math blaster and he's fucking jerking it.

1263
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,960
So right to math blaster number, nookie, Nathan, number, nookie.

1264
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,680
Nathan jerks it to math blaster.

1265
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,800
I heard on the end, I heard he is the math blaster.

1266
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,480
Math blaster is what he announces.

1267
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,760
He announces it loudly.

1268
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,800
This one was sent in by Metal Gear Jim, which wasn't his Twitter name.

1269
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,800
That was his actual name on like on the email.

1270
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:54,840
So maybe it's about Yahoo Answers user, John, who asks, could I take Tyra Banks?

1271
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,840
John is five foot five, 130 pounds.

1272
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,200
And I don't work out.

1273
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,480
My GF just said that I wouldn't have a chance against Tyra.

1274
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,800
What's the scrappiness?

1275
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,320
Like is his scrappiness?

1276
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:16,840
It doesn't include his power rating or anything like his special abilities or anything like

1277
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,000
that.

1278
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,760
But I got to say, even if you were about six inches taller and like 20 pounds beefier

1279
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:27,240
and you did work out, have you seen how fierce Tyra Banks is?

1280
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,360
And look in her eyes.

1281
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:35,960
Plus, there's just her large like collection of knives that she carries on her person at

1282
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,440
all times.

1283
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,720
Well, yeah, but we're talking about model.

1284
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,480
You're just like hand to hand like.

1285
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:41,880
Yeah.

1286
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,120
Yeah.

1287
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,320
We're talking about a backstreet brawl.

1288
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,440
No chains, no pipes.

1289
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:53,320
Just the fists of a man named John and the fists of a supermodel, Tyra Banks.

1290
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,680
Are there any holds barred?

1291
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,000
Uh, let me check.

1292
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,600
There is one hold barred.

1293
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:00,840
Okay.

1294
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:06,440
You can't say anything mean about her eyelashes because she's actually that's her weak point.

1295
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,480
She's really sensitive.

1296
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:12,600
You also can't bring up the time she spent in Paris modeling with her mama going from

1297
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,680
agency to agency trying to find someone who will take her under her wing because she gets

1298
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,400
very emotional.

1299
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:24,440
She she went through some shit in gay Paris and I think that that hardened her to like

1300
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,720
people tell her people tell her she will never Mattel.

1301
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,400
I've heard her say that just like that.

1302
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,320
Can you translate?

1303
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,080
Can you just click Google translation?

1304
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:37,000
I use Google translation said you can't do this.

1305
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:37,880
We don't believe in you.

1306
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,880
You have bad eyebrows.

1307
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,760
Was that the word?

1308
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,160
That's how they say it in Paris.

1309
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,960
The eyebrows is about your ease.

1310
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:53,960
Um, listen, John banks will come at you like a fucking Wolverine, not like Wolverine from

1311
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:59,560
X-Men, like a rabid Wolverine and also kind of like Wolverine from X-Men, like both Wolverine

1312
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:03,880
from X-Men and like a rabid fan of Michigan.

1313
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:07,160
But on the bright side, like the next day when you see your friends and they're like,

1314
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,680
Oh my God, what happened to you?

1315
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,480
You be like, Oh dude, Tyra Banks fucked me up.

1316
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,600
She's got reach.

1317
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,600
First of all, she's got reach on you because she's a she's a she's a she's a she's a

1318
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,160
reach on you because she's a she's a tall, beautiful lady.

1319
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,040
Her being beautiful has nothing to do with her reach.

1320
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:26,920
I just wanted to go ahead and put out the opinion that she is, in fact, an attractive

1321
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:27,240
woman.

1322
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,360
She's got nails, probably, right?

1323
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:35,240
That's safe to assume they're probably sharp and just fierceness.

1324
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,400
We can't stress the fierceness enough.

1325
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,080
Yeah, once you're down, once you're down on the ground, bleeding like a bloody heap, she's

1326
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:41,880
not going to stop.

1327
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,400
She will literally kill you.

1328
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,920
Do you think that he could take Tyra Banks if she were in her fat suit?

1329
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,320
Oh, no way.

1330
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,280
Are you kidding me?

1331
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,880
You could kick her down a flight of stairs.

1332
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:52,760
She wouldn't even notice.

1333
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,120
Could you take her in her hobo suit?

1334
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,040
Yeah, her hobo suit.

1335
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:56,600
Yes.

1336
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:01,240
Tyra also should be noted has a weave, which is basically bionics, right?

1337
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,680
Unfair made integration.

1338
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,040
Good news, John.

1339
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:04,440
You won.

1340
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,560
She got disqualified.

1341
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,800
She got disqualified for the use of bionics.

1342
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,600
How about a Yahoo answer?

1343
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,080
Yeah, how about this?

1344
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,080
This one was sent in by Gali Ayali.

1345
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,040
Thank you, Gali Ayali.

1346
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:21,160
It's by Yahoo Answers user Yeti Education Committee.

1347
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,840
Do you want to go ahead and imagine what the tone of this question is going to be?

1348
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:30,040
Somebody finally stepped up and started educating these Yetis.

1349
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,280
You dumb fucks.

1350
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:39,640
Yahoo Answers user Yeti Education Committee asks, do you think it is possible for Yeti

1351
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:43,800
to accept Jesus Christ as their savior, or does God not want Yeti in heaven?

1352
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,760
Assume the Yeti speaks English, the language of Jesus.

1353
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,720
Fuck me.

1354
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,080
Fuck.

1355
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,640
Okay, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1356
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,400
This question supposes so many things.

1357
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:02,040
First of all, do people who not speak English, are they just automatically,

1358
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,480
they just don't get to go to heaven?

1359
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:03,960
Uh-huh.

1360
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,600
Okay.

1361
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,640
That shouldn't be my main problem with this question, but nope.

1362
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,880
It's the first thing that gets sprung to mind.

1363
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:15,640
Yetis have souls, I think, but they're like pet souls.

1364
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:19,240
Every rock and tree and creature has a soul.

1365
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:23,560
Rocks I'm going to quibble with you on, and probably trees.

1366
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,320
All right, well, trees grow.

1367
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,520
What kind of trees?

1368
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,400
Not fir trees.

1369
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,560
No, fuck fir trees.

1370
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,920
Deciduous trees.

1371
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,440
Deciduous trees have souls.

1372
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,480
Coniferous?

1373
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,200
No.

1374
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,880
Are you saying you don't want trees in heaven?

1375
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:38,360
That's what this has to boil down to.

1376
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,040
I don't want deciduous trees in heaven.

1377
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,120
God may or may not want Yeti in heaven.

1378
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,560
I certainly don't.

1379
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,400
What if, like, maybe he lets him into heaven, maybe he doesn't,

1380
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,520
but he starts spreading a rumor that there's some Yetis up there?

1381
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,000
Wouldn't that be a bummer if you got to heaven,

1382
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,720
and again, the existence of the Yeti was not confirmed?

1383
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:01,400
It was rumored, like, can you leave giant paw prints in clouds?

1384
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:07,800
All right, if my choices are to be ever tortured by the possibility of Sasquatches,

1385
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:15,560
or to be literally tortured by having my arms torn off by Sasquatches,

1386
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,080
which is their favorite activity,

1387
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,640
I would go with the former every time, because I love my arms.

1388
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,080
I hug with them.

1389
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,880
If you're Kevin's friend, of course, that wouldn't matter so much.

1390
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:34,200
It wouldn't be quite so big of a deal, but I'm not acquainted with Kevin.

1391
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,080
I like my hugs.

1392
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:41,320
The Sasquatch is a mythical creature,

1393
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:45,640
which means that he comes down from heaven whenever he's on earth.

1394
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,000
Like, if you see him on earth, that means he's vacationing, basically.

1395
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,360
The Yeti is an angel?

1396
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:54,280
Yeah, he's down there spreading the word of God in English,

1397
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,600
Jesus' language, to the penguins.

1398
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:00,360
Do you guys know my favorite episode of Touched by an Angel?

1399
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,640
It's the one where the Yeti came down

1400
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,720
and fucking hung out with that Scottish chick.

1401
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:06,760
Touched by a Yeti.

1402
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:07,720
I like the one where Roba Downey-

1403
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,680
Crushed by a Yeti.

1404
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,120
I like the one where Roba Downey ripped that dude's arms off.

1405
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,680
I'm a Yeti sent by-

1406
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,440
Grrrr!

1407
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:16,840
Ramp.

1408
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:17,960
Give me that arm.

1409
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,480
Arms ripped off by an angel.

1410
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:26,040
I think the big surprise for this guy is gonna be when he gets to heaven

1411
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,160
and Jesus is a Yeti.

1412
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,520
This whole time.

1413
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,400
I know you guys were like arguing-

1414
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,680
He speaks Arabic.

1415
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,520
You guys were arguing like, is he white?

1416
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,000
Is he Arabic?

1417
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,400
What's this?

1418
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,760
Nope, you missed it.

1419
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,040
Not even human.

1420
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,080
I'm a Yeti.

1421
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:39,480
Yeti.

1422
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:40,840
Guess what?

1423
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,320
The big man, big God, he's a Yeti too.

1424
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,320
I'm cutting his image.

1425
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:47,880
Pretty much everybody.

1426
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,240
Loki, he was a Yeti.

1427
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:49,880
He's a Yeti.

1428
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,040
He's up here making tricks and jokes.

1429
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,840
Thor is half Yeti.

1430
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,440
Thor is half Yeti.

1431
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,640
Jim Morrison was a Yeti.

1432
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:58,840
This whole time he's a Yeti.

1433
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,600
Jim Morrison won't be in heaven.

1434
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,560
Don't be ridiculous.

1435
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,440
Jim Belushi, complete Yeti.

1436
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,040
Shaved Yeti.

1437
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,680
Getty Lee, his actual name is Yeti Lee.

1438
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,320
He's not dead yet, but he is a Yeti.

1439
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:17,240
Yeah, that's where he gets all his bass groups from, from his Yeti powers.

1440
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,360
Bootsy Collins, most basses and bands are Yetis.

1441
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:25,960
Most people you see on the streets are Yetis, I would say.

1442
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,760
Guys, I have something to tell you.

1443
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,320
Yeah, tell me.

1444
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,840
I'm a Yeti.

1445
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:41,480
That's why I didn't get into heaven, because I'm already like a resident.

1446
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:45,320
We've been saving it for the season finale, and this is the twist.

1447
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:48,680
Shocking reveal of my true nature.

1448
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:53,880
I've got Yeti DNA and skin and like Yeti skin and fur and teeth and stuff.

1449
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:58,600
That person you had at the live show didn't look like a Yeti.

1450
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,480
It's because it wasn't me.

1451
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:01,240
What?

1452
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,600
It was an actor?

1453
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,640
It was my familiar.

1454
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,080
Every Yeti gets a familiar.

1455
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,440
One human familiar.

1456
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:07,960
So that was mine.

1457
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,400
His name is Mike.

1458
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,280
He's pretty cool, I guess.

1459
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:17,240
Yeah, that's just something I hope that you will still let me do the show.

1460
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:22,840
Honestly, Griffin, I don't know that I'm comfortable.

1461
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:26,760
I think after the summer, we'll leave this as like a cliffhanger.

1462
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:32,600
To recap, Griffin told us a Yeti, and we may not let him stay on the show,

1463
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:36,920
and Bernard, our lovable lab tech, was shot in a hold up, and he's in the alley.

1464
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,280
We don't know if he's going to live or die.

1465
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:43,880
He has no arms, but I had nothing to do with that.

1466
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,720
Stop trying to pin this on me.

1467
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,720
Especially you without arms.

1468
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:48,760
That's impossible.

1469
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,480
Could be in so Yetiest, Yeti-phobe.

1470
01:05:54,920 --> 01:06:01,160
It's by Yahoo Answers user Sarah, only it's spelled with like weird characters.

1471
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:02,760
I'm not going to get into it.

1472
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:12,520
Sarah asks, is my we didn't start the fire continuation decent?

1473
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:14,840
What?

1474
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,520
Okay, like it says, decent.

1475
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:21,000
I know it's not good, and some parts don't flow well, but that's okay.

1476
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,680
It's supposed to be 1990 through 2009.

1477
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,280
I don't know a lot about the 1990s, so there's a little lack of that.

1478
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,720
Hold on, what universe is this?

1479
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,280
Are you ready?

1480
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,480
Wait, Griffin, you've got to do it to music.

1481
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,160
You can't not do this to music.

1482
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,200
I can do it acapella.

1483
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:39,880
Okay, okay.

1484
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:43,160
Then I want you to go back and find the music and play it underneath it for me.

1485
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:43,720
Okay.

1486
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,440
I don't know.

1487
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,320
Okay, I'll try.

1488
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:45,560
Okay.

1489
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:53,720
Middle East, CSI, Twin Towers, Wi-Fi, eBay, Dan Brown, Sarah Palin,

1490
01:06:54,600 --> 01:07:02,120
global warming, Madonna, internet, marijuana, Obama, Titanic, Harry Potter, organic steroids,

1491
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:07,560
animation, cell phones, immigration, Facebook, Walmart, Google, modern art,

1492
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:13,720
E. coli, bird flu, Michael Jackson, Peter New, Hans Zimmer, Green Day, Guantanamo Bay.

1493
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:15,720
Oh, God.

1494
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1495
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:19,640
Hold on.

1496
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:20,920
Did you say Louis Gossett?

1497
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,080
I don't think I said that.

1498
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,320
Did I hear E. coli bird poop in there?

1499
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,360
E. coli bird flu.

1500
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,200
Bird flu.

1501
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:28,600
Bird flu, okay.

1502
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:32,040
What was, no, did they say Louis Gossett?

1503
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,120
I don't think they said Louis Gossett.

1504
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:37,320
Can you, can you elucidate the last stanza for me?

1505
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,120
Again?

1506
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:43,720
E. coli bird flu, Michael Jackson, who knew, Hans Zimmer, Green Day, Guantanamo Bay.

1507
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,120
What?

1508
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,320
Okay, all right, hold on, hold on.

1509
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,440
Wait, who knew what?

1510
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:47,160
Who knew what?

1511
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,120
I, I guess that Michael Jackson was gonna die.

1512
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,040
And if that is the case, then everybody.

1513
01:07:54,040 --> 01:08:00,360
Okay, I wouldn't, my bigger problem with this is not about the flow of her lyrics,

1514
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:05,160
but more, do we live in a world where this gets updated like the encyclopedia?

1515
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:09,800
Like at the end of a decade, it's like, well, we need to go back and add a couple of stanzas.

1516
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,800
By the end of time, we didn't start the fire.

1517
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,240
It's gonna be eight hours long.

1518
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:17,400
Yeah, it's gonna be an epic poem written by poet laureate, Billy Joel.

1519
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:21,560
I'm glad, I'm glad somebody's stepping up here because like, I don't want our school

1520
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:26,360
kids to be like, and then in the year was 1990 and after that there is no more history.

1521
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,600
I mean, Sarah touches on some good points here.

1522
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:34,280
I mean, definitely, definitely CSI and Twin Towers and Wi-Fi should all be

1523
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,640
sandwiched together like that.

1524
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:39,640
Pretty much, they're pretty much like the same level of stuff, right?

1525
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:43,080
Right, Dan Brown definitely deserves to be remembered forever for his work.

1526
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,560
And Hans Zimmer, who knew?

1527
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,560
Wait, Hans Zimmer?

1528
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,520
Yeah, you know.

1529
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,480
And Harry Potter's in there?

1530
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,360
Harry Potter's in there.

1531
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:50,840
He's up in the mix?

1532
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,160
I'm down with that, that's a revolution.

1533
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,800
That's great, Hans Zimmer?

1534
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:04,120
Like, what contribution of Hans Zimmer's are you honoring here?

1535
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:08,520
Like, did you feel, is it, oh, excuse me.

1536
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,200
He did the motion picture soundtrack for Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger Tides.

1537
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,760
So that makes perfect sense.

1538
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,640
He did that OST, so of course you're gonna, yeah.

1539
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,800
I mean, what are we forgetting here?

1540
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,280
There's gotta be some other important events.

1541
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:26,360
Like, Iraq, Afghanistan, something like that.

1542
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,080
Or you said Middle East.

1543
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,840
Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger's Tides.

1544
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:34,120
Iraq, Afghanistan, Pirates of the Caribbean.

1545
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:38,680
How about Robert Downey Jr.'s return to the screen?

1546
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,720
That's a pretty big deal.

1547
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,520
Robert Downey Jr.'s return to the screen.

1548
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,720
Like, I don't think so.

1549
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:46,920
Now, what about Grey's Anatomy and then the spin-off Private Practice?

1550
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,320
Here's what's, I'm looking through this, and I think my problem isn't,

1551
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,800
my problem is what didn't make the cut.

1552
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:01,640
Yeah, so like, oh, Dan Brown made it, but not Hurricane Katrina.

1553
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:07,240
Like, so Sarah Palin is up in the mix.

1554
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,320
Not 9-11, though, so.

1555
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:13,960
No, well, she said Twin Towers in that sort of shorthand for 9-11.

1556
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,040
Never forget Twin Towers.

1557
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:19,880
It could be, see, it could be referring to the second Lord of the Rings movie.

1558
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,320
It could not.

1559
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,520
No, it could not.

1560
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:29,000
Grey's Anatomy is made for you, Kung Fu Panda 1 and 2.

1561
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,800
There, I think that's better because it gets some like super important cultural stuff.

1562
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:39,560
I think that it would be better if it was all just not like what happened in the world,

1563
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:43,960
but like a personal recount of your 1990 to 2009.

1564
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:48,120
So it's like, met a guy, we broke up, went to dinner, met some people,

1565
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,760
then I went to college, and it was pretty cool.

1566
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,800
And it was just like a personal telling of stuff that happened in your life.

1567
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:57,480
Can you explain to me the sort of sliding scale that puts going to dinner with some people

1568
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,560
and graduating college on the same import?

1569
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:00,680
Like, it was a good dinner.

1570
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,440
It wasn't, it wasn't a very good college.

1571
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,760
It wasn't a very good verse.

1572
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,440
It was mostly a party school.

1573
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:13,000
I graduate and still a fool, and I went and got on Yahoo Answers with this song.

1574
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:19,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Rebecca Rose, who asks,

1575
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,360
what would you consider to be personality traits of an ideal stallion?

1576
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:29,800
Uh-huh.

1577
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,680
Uh-huh, go on.

1578
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,560
No, I won't go on because that's all that this question is.

1579
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,760
Like, literal stallion.

1580
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:39,480
Yeah, like a, like a, like a horse, like a proud.

1581
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,640
Well, I think we can all agree, unbroken spirit.

1582
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,320
Unbroken spirit.

1583
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,320
Unbroken legs also is important.

1584
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,640
Less of a personality.

1585
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:48,680
I think discreet.

1586
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,680
Able to keep a secret.

1587
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,040
What is the application of that?

1588
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:55,880
Why do we need a discreet?

1589
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:59,240
Well, Griffin, if I knew the application, I wouldn't, I wouldn't tell you.

1590
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:01,240
I mean, I'm trying to be like a stallion here.

1591
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:05,000
It defeats the point of discretion if you just go and your wiener pics everywhere.

1592
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:11,400
Hey, hey horse, why did you tweet this picture of my wiener?

1593
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,400
Hey horse, I didn't give you my phone.

1594
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,400
That was between us.

1595
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,400
That was between us, horse.

1596
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,600
What if I came to you in confidence?

1597
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:24,120
What kind of smartphone could a horse possibly operate?

1598
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,200
This question is ridiculous.

1599
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,880
So there's another good personality trait.

1600
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:28,680
Dexterity.

1601
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,160
Dexterity, like, yeah, manual dexterity.

1602
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:35,960
Um, tail, a smooth tail, a proud tail.

1603
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,440
That's important in races.

1604
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,880
And also not a racist.

1605
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:42,840
I don't like a horse.

1606
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,840
I want them to love all horses and humans equally.

1607
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:47,640
Open-minded.

1608
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:48,520
Yeah.

1609
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:51,880
It's okay if they're biasing against fat people because that's like a health issue.

1610
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,800
Yeah, they'll snap right in half.

1611
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:59,080
Um, I think, I think you gotta, it's gotta have some wisdom in its eyes.

1612
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,280
Mmm, that's good.

1613
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:04,520
I think when you look deep in that horse's eyes, you've gotta know that there's, there's,

1614
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:07,320
there's feelings stirring around in there, you know?

1615
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,000
And no bugs.

1616
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,480
No bugs.

1617
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:13,800
I hate it when a horse has bugs in there and it won't even use its comically long tongue

1618
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:14,840
to lick them off.

1619
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:19,400
Or sweep the way with its mane with a flourish of its proud long head.

1620
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,240
Um, have you mentioned-

1621
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,920
I just love horses so much.

1622
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,680
I love horses too.

1623
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:28,920
I love their thick trunks and I think that I need a proud horse.

1624
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:32,600
I think I need a proud, um, gelding.

1625
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,280
I want a, I want a horse that's gonna be more like a best friend.

1626
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1627
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:37,720
Right, right.

1628
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:42,360
And maybe we go on adventures together and like, my cowboy hat falls off and he picks

1629
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,000
it up for me and nudges me forward and drives me on.

1630
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,880
That's so great.

1631
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:51,080
I just, I want a horse I can hang out with in every possible definition of the term.

1632
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,920
Yeah, just a horse who's fucking cool.

1633
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,400
You know, not uppity like some of those other horses.

1634
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,080
I just want to hang out.

1635
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:03,160
I want a horse that if I joke like, maybe today you can ride me, he'll laugh, but he

1636
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,000
won't take the joke too far.

1637
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,520
Yeah, very painful.

1638
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,400
They're very heavy.

1639
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:12,360
I've, I've ridden a lot of pintos that will just like take the goof and run with it.

1640
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,640
And it's like, now it's weird pinto and I have to put you down.

1641
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,080
Now I have to destroy you.

1642
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,440
Because I know you're not discreet.

1643
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:19,640
I was trying to forgive that.

1644
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:25,080
But now I want a horse that knows that when I have to destroy him, I have to do it.

1645
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:25,400
Sure.

1646
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:30,520
Like he's, he's, he feels bad for you because of the position that he is putting you in

1647
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,040
with his broke ass legs.

1648
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:35,160
He knows it's going to hurt me more than it's going to hurt him.

1649
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:35,400
Yeah.

1650
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,360
I want, yeah.

1651
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:42,120
And I want him to make it easier on me by hurling some really hateful shit.

1652
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,440
Like hateful shit about my parents and loved ones.

1653
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,040
Oh, like I bet you won't do it.

1654
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:46,840
You coward.

1655
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:47,480
You coward.

1656
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:51,320
Well, that's it, we are, we're putting the horse before the cart.

1657
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:55,880
You've got to, you've got to, you're supposed to put the horse before the cart.

1658
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,320
Shut your fucking mouth.

1659
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,400
You've got to have, see that's the kind of talk that'll get a horse shot.

1660
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,960
He has got to be able to talk.

1661
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:04,840
He has to possess.

1662
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:07,320
Yeah.

1663
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:09,800
Which is, what's the point?

1664
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:10,600
Which is rare.

1665
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:12,360
I think.

1666
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:12,920
Mare.

1667
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,000
But worth, worth a couple extra bucks.

1668
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:15,880
Yeah.

1669
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,200
Yeah.

1670
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:16,440
Yeah.

1671
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,720
I'll drop an extra.

1672
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,120
Oh, that's a big, he has to be cheap.

1673
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,800
He has to not cost a lot of money.

1674
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:26,600
So we need a cheap talking horse that's able to use a smartphone and will pick up my cowboy

1675
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:27,560
hat with tenderness.

1676
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,920
Just discretion for miles.

1677
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:30,520
That should be his name.

1678
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,640
Discretion for miles.

1679
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:32,680
Discretion for miles.

1680
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,720
I want one that doesn't make you kill it to get the glue out of him.

1681
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:37,960
Yeah.

1682
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,240
Just show me where your glue is.

1683
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,320
Give him your glue, you stingy bastard.

1684
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,520
He's got some glue.

1685
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,520
You want to be able to lactate his glue gland.

1686
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,960
Mm hmm.

1687
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:46,680
Exactly.

1688
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,040
For a quick patch job.

1689
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,440
I think that.

1690
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,680
Your horse feet.

1691
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:55,000
Is it too much to ask for a winning smile?

1692
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:56,600
No.

1693
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,640
A winning smile?

1694
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,480
I couldn't, I couldn't understand you.

1695
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,960
I would like my horse to enjoy eating apples.

1696
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,240
Can we make that happen?

1697
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:06,520
And oats.

1698
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:06,840
Yes.

1699
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:10,360
Don't mistake my fingers for carrots.

1700
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,720
I'm just giving you this carrot.

1701
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:12,440
Silly doof.

1702
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:17,160
Can we give an apologetic horse for when he does nibble your fingers?

1703
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,080
Rainbows behind him leaves rainbows.

1704
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,760
Can we get a rainbow horse?

1705
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,200
I want a horse with a horn.

1706
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:23,240
Okay.

1707
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:23,480
Okay.

1708
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,000
That is a unicorn, but.

1709
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,680
No, because it doesn't have to be on his head.

1710
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,000
It could also be a deer.

1711
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,000
Like a buck.

1712
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,080
A buck is basically a horse with a horn.

1713
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:40,360
What about a horse with like mini horns that makes it like a spiny exoskeleton?

1714
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,920
Ah, and maybe fire shoots out of his nose.

1715
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:43,160
Yeah.

1716
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:43,560
Okay.

1717
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:44,200
Yeah, yeah.

1718
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,800
Can I, and he can fly.

1719
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:46,840
Yeah.

1720
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:50,600
And also he's got a big saddle on it and you can ride on him.

1721
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,280
And he's got like a tank gun.

1722
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,360
Yeah, he's got a tank gun for a mouth.

1723
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,080
He's got like howitzer treads on his legs.

1724
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:57,800
Fuck yeah.

1725
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,040
And he can fucking like fly through space and shit.

1726
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:01,160
Yeah.

1727
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:05,560
And he's, he can shoot, he can shoot blood out of him.

1728
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,000
So fucking discreet.

1729
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,280
Just discreet as shit.

1730
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:10,360
He will never tell anyone about any of this.

1731
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:12,680
I want to ride.

1732
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:16,600
Oh, maybe he looks like a regular horse by day and then an awesome space tank spiny horse.

1733
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,400
Holy fuck.

1734
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:17,640
Like a he-man.

1735
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,760
Transformer horse.

1736
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:19,560
Yes.

1737
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:19,880
Yes.

1738
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,040
I'm a tank.

1739
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:25,400
I'm a horse.

1740
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:28,360
Come here Shia.

1741
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,200
Shia, come here.

1742
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,080
Grab my mane.

1743
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,040
Feed me oats.

1744
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:32,840
I'm gonna shoot blood out of my face.

1745
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,360
I'm eight feet tall.

1746
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:35,640
I'm a big robot horse.

1747
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,040
Does it look like a robot horse?

1748
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:42,840
Or does it look like a regular horse that transforms flawlessly into sort of a fleshy,

1749
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,520
mane-y.

1750
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,600
And sprays blood everywhere in the process.

1751
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,440
And it's killed.

1752
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,480
That's so important.

1753
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:52,840
Shia, you're probably gonna want to step back a little bit further.

1754
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,320
Here's your Gallagher, your Gallagher poncho.

1755
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,200
Just tuck into that real quick.

1756
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,680
Transform from a horse into a horse tank.

1757
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,520
You may get soaked, you will get wet.

1758
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,600
With horse blood.

1759
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,120
With horse blood.

1760
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:09,080
That horse is not going to survive the transformation process.

1761
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,120
I'm sorry.

1762
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:11,480
I'll never tell anyone.

1763
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,800
You are rending parts of that horse that you will not be able to reattach.

1764
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,160
No, no.

1765
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:22,920
How come every time we talk about fucking horses on this show, we always talk about just mutilating?

1766
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:23,400
How does that keep happening?

1767
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,600
Because there's something about destroying one of God's most beautiful creatures.

1768
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:29,400
We basically-

1769
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,920
So powerful and majestic.

1770
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:31,800
I just want to kill it.

1771
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:35,720
We've been going on this show for about 15 minutes now, designing the perfect horse,

1772
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:42,040
and we reached a point where we reached perfect horse that like nobody's ever been able to

1773
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,040
conceive of before, and then we ruined it.

1774
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:46,680
Well, yes.

1775
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:53,160
We as human beings often are jealous of the power and majesty of a horse,

1776
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,520
and then it's time to destroy it.

1777
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,480
We reached the index of horse possibilities.

1778
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,120
I think that the most important thing about a horse,

1779
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,800
the most important personality-

1780
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,720
Let's get back to personality for a second.

1781
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:06,360
Okay.

1782
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:10,360
I think the most important personality of a horse is that it not be too beautiful,

1783
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:11,640
because then you want to destroy it.

1784
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:15,480
Like if you got like some Jared Leto looking motherfucking horse,

1785
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:18,600
you're going to want to take a ball-peen hammer to its temple instantly.

1786
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,560
It's too beautiful.

1787
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,560
It's just like Fight Club.

1788
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,960
You just want to destroy something beautiful, you know?

1789
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:24,200
Yeah.

1790
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:27,080
Just smash its face in with another horse.

1791
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:32,040
Slash, glass menagerie, glass horse with a horn on it somewhere,

1792
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,800
and you just want to destroy it.

1793
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,720
I just want to slam two horses together.

1794
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:37,960
Find the god particle.

1795
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:41,960
Oh, shit.

1796
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,720
Live from the spot, rough and raw, at our daddy's house.

1797
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,080
We're at our daddy's house.

1798
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:51,960
Let me check the date.

1799
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,400
I just opened up the calendar.

1800
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,640
It's pasta party 2011.

1801
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,280
Good.

1802
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,960
Welcome to our daddy's house.

1803
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,640
We're live from our daddy's couch.

1804
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:00,360
Let me check this.

1805
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:04,520
Let me check the spaghettometer, because it looks like we're going full-blown pasta.

1806
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:05,480
Spaghett-it on.

1807
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:09,240
Let's spaghett-a-ghett-in 2011.

1808
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:12,600
As you well know, as you've probably guessed, we had a-

1809
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:16,200
We carbo-loaded pre-show here in Ironton.

1810
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,280
Our stepmom Carol fed us a bunch of spaghetti.

1811
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:22,120
We're fucking primed for carbo-

1812
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:23,400
Who fed us spaghetti?

1813
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,520
Who fed us spaghetti?

1814
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,560
Yes, I will.

1815
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,760
She's looked down at us and said,

1816
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:27,960
you're not fucking funny enough.

1817
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,000
Eat some more spaghetti.

1818
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:33,960
She shoved spaghett-fistful after fistful of sweet spaghett into my mouth.

1819
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,200
I am ready to blow.

1820
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,720
Noodle up, you unfunny fucks.

1821
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:40,200
It's time to get spaghett.

1822
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,480
You got spaghett.

1823
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:44,520
Okay.

1824
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,120
I'm a lesbian, and I, uh, okay.

1825
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:51,160
That was British, okay.

1826
01:20:51,160 --> 01:21:00,120
I'm a lesbian, and I recently cut my hair, but now I'm having second thoughts.

1827
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,960
Before, it was all the way down to my waist, and now it's more a men's style cut,

1828
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,400
although still long enough to show my loverly curls.

1829
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,000
I think it looks cute.

1830
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,760
It's very low maintenance, and it seems to be net positive with the ladies.

1831
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,720
But I've noticed that strangers are ruder to me.

1832
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:18,440
Should I stick it out and get used to being perceived differently by people,

1833
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:19,960
or grow my hair long and lovely?

1834
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:23,320
Or grow my hair long and lovely again, so as to fly to the gay-dar,

1835
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:26,760
and avoid the occasional embarrassing mistake about my gender?

1836
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,320
Fan from the post-lesbian apocalypse.

1837
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:33,000
Is she asking us if she should be proud of her lesbianity?

1838
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:33,960
Her lesbianics?

1839
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:36,520
She wants to be a lesbian.

1840
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,040
She doesn't want to be mistaken for a dude.

1841
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:42,040
But I do have to tell you though,

1842
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:47,800
this decision is largely out of your hands for the next month or so.

1843
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:52,520
So here's my advice, try it for a month and see what you think.

1844
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:55,320
If you still don't like it, grow it long then.

1845
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:59,080
There are worse things that you could be mistaken for than a dude.

1846
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:00,440
Do you know what I'm saying?

1847
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:01,320
Liam Gallagher.

1848
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:01,880
Liam Gallagher.

1849
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,720
No, fucking Bieber.

1850
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:04,520
Bieber.

1851
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,560
You can look, you can get a Bieber, a sweet Bieber bowl,

1852
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,320
and then you are in a lot of trouble.

1853
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,120
Unless your name is Justin, and your last name is Bieber.

1854
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,840
And your middle name is whatever Justin Bieber's name is.

1855
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:15,640
Saul.

1856
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:16,440
Saul.

1857
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:16,940
Justin.

1858
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:19,100
Justin Saul Bieber.

1859
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:22,060
Justin Shmuel Bieber.

1860
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:23,260
No, here's all that coming.

1861
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:28,300
You know what, it actually is Justin Osama Bieber.

1862
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:31,420
A lot of people don't know that.

1863
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:34,140
Usain Bieber.

1864
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:36,060
Justin Hannah Montana Bieber.

1865
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:41,740
You know what, if you like it, if you like your haircut, it's yours.

1866
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:43,420
It's your haircut, own it.

1867
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:44,300
Yeah, fuck people.

1868
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:46,540
Listen, if they're gonna think you're a dude,

1869
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:48,220
they're obviously somebody you don't know very well.

1870
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:52,140
That's a pretty good litmus test as to whether or not they're useless.

1871
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:52,940
Hey, are you a dude?

1872
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:54,220
No, like fuck you.

1873
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:54,860
Get out of here.

1874
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:56,700
I don't, like I obviously don't want to chill with you.

1875
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:57,740
Look at my shapeliness.

1876
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,980
Look at my shapely curvaceousness.

1877
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:01,660
Look at this womb-basting body.

1878
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,020
Excuse me?

1879
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:08,460
Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot and slightly androgynous like me?

1880
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,340
Is my favorite pussycat doll song.

1881
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:13,820
There are so many though, it's hard to choose.

1882
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:14,620
Yeah, there are so many.

1883
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:15,580
Buttons is good too.

1884
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:16,140
Buttons is good.

1885
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:17,500
Pushing up my buttons, I like that.

1886
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:19,500
Mr. Boombastic.

1887
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:20,620
Mr. Boombastic.

1888
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:20,940
Mr. Boombastic.

1889
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:21,980
Oh holy night.

1890
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:22,940
Don't make me sweat.

1891
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:25,420
That's another one.

1892
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:27,100
Duel of the fates.

1893
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:34,300
Pussycat dolls are the most flexible artists of our times.

1894
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:36,700
Femme from my closet.

1895
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:42,140
They are unstoppable.

1896
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:43,820
The Declaration of Independence.

1897
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:45,740
Yeah, that hit song.

1898
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:47,980
Declaration of Independence.

1899
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:48,380
What?

1900
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:50,060
Now you're just giving me documents.

1901
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,100
The Rosetta Stone.

1902
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:53,740
The Sphinx.

1903
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:55,900
The Empire State Building.

1904
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:56,860
What are we doing?

1905
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:01,180
We are fucked up our pasta.

1906
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:03,900
Oh shit.

1907
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:04,540
Oh my god.

1908
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,660
Holy shit.

1909
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:06,140
Jesus.

1910
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:09,340
Oh my god.

1911
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:13,500
Oh god.

1912
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,420
You can just call me a self spaghetti.

1913
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:18,060
I'm feeling this pasta vibe.

1914
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:22,220
How about one final Yali?

1915
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:23,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1916
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:24,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1917
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,460
This one was sent in by Galiayali.

1918
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,820
Thank you, Galiayali.

1919
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:29,820
It's by Yali Lancer's user.

1920
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:31,020
Oh no.

1921
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:33,020
The picture itself is pretty wonderful.

1922
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:35,020
The real Marty Janetti.

1923
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,380
Except no substitutes.

1924
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:39,580
Are you guys soaking in that image?

1925
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:41,340
That tiny thumbnail?

1926
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:43,420
Yeah, it's a wrestler and he's holding a belt.

1927
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:46,620
Usually if I don't know a celebrity, they're a wrestler.

1928
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:50,140
TheRealSomethingSomething asks,

1929
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:55,660
how can I convince my girlfriend to dress up like Violet Beauregard from Willy Wonka?

1930
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:58,620
I am in love with two ladies.

1931
01:24:58,620 --> 01:24:59,180
Okay.

1932
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:04,460
My sweet little blueberry, aka my G friend, and Violet Beauregard from Willy Wonka.

1933
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:09,820
I think it's so sexy the when Violet inflates into a sphere

1934
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:12,300
and would love to see my lady do the same.

1935
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:17,180
How can I convince her that this would be both fun and sexy?

1936
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:19,820
She doesn't realize it yet,

1937
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:22,700
but her nickname comes from my number one screen crush.

1938
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:28,780
I bought the costume last week and I'm fighting up the courage to ask her.

1939
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:30,220
Please, any suggestions?

1940
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:34,780
P.S. Not like in the new crappy Johnny Depp Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

1941
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:36,860
That CGI looked horrible.

1942
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:38,220
Only Mel Stuart's version.

1943
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:43,340
I can't, I can't finish unless it's the Mel Stuart's version.

1944
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:46,780
You look, right now, Rashonda, you look beautiful,

1945
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:52,460
but you look like that shitty Johnny Depp version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

1946
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:55,020
Honey, I got you this outfit and this bicycle pump.

1947
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:56,140
Let's go to town.

1948
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:59,820
Yeah, we are going to give you some artificial juice filled dumps.

1949
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:03,100
You ever hear that thing where it's like,

1950
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:05,580
if you press this button, you'll get a million dollars,

1951
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:07,340
but someone in the world will die.

1952
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:07,660
Yeah.

1953
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:08,620
Do you press the button?

1954
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:10,540
If I can guarantee it's this guy,

1955
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:12,060
I'm just going to start hammering on it.

1956
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:18,220
Oh man, how stealth do you have to be about your number one screen crush

1957
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:21,100
that you have given this girl a nickname,

1958
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:24,780
which is my little blueberry and she doesn't know what it's referring to.

1959
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:27,660
You have to watch this movie like on the reg, right?

1960
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:30,460
Like, and you could tell he's got like a half motor,

1961
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:31,820
like when she walks in the room.

1962
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:33,500
She swells, he swells, baby.

1963
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,780
That's how I do.

1964
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:35,820
That's gross.

1965
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:38,860
That is so unpleasant that you would like that so much.

1966
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:43,580
If you're going to get, if you're going to jerk it to anything in that movie,

1967
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:47,340
why not a Goose's Gloop getting sucked up in that chocolate pond,

1968
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:48,620
that chocolate tube?

1969
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:52,540
I feel like, I feel like we've just found a really great psychological test.

1970
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:55,740
There's like, if you had to jerk it to one scene in Willy Wonka

1971
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:58,700
and your answer means something.

1972
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:00,860
How about if you jerk to any second about that movie,

1973
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:06,060
which is primarily about, primarily about murdering kids.

1974
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:07,180
Boy, there is, you know what?

1975
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,620
As angry as I was about this guy,

1976
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:10,780
there is a much more unpleasant gentleman

1977
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:13,660
whose fetish is a little boy stuck in a chocolate tube.

1978
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:15,900
Yeah, there's that.

1979
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:17,900
You don't have to lay it.

1980
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:21,420
The parts of your brain of fear and arousal are right next to each other

1981
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:23,180
is anything scarier than that,

1982
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:26,380
the look on that fucking kid's face when he's surrounded

1983
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:29,820
by plastic and tiny orange men and sweet chocolate.

1984
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,500
It's like, it's heaven and hell, baby.

1985
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:33,980
He knows death is around the corner.

1986
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:36,220
What about the girl that gets thrown in the incinerator?

1987
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:36,780
Yeah.

1988
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:38,380
That movie is terrifying.

1989
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:40,700
Why, why am I so erect then?

1990
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:42,940
Oh, that was a bad-

1991
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:46,300
There is no earthly way of knowing why I have this huge boner.

1992
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:47,100
That was a bad anarchy.

1993
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:48,060
Well, no, no, no.

1994
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:51,100
There is no earthly way of knowing why my boner is still growing.

1995
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:56,700
But the bulge is surely showing.

1996
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:57,500
Is it shrinking?

1997
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,300
Is it blowing?

1998
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:01,100
And the semen now is flowing.

1999
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:18,220
I had a lot of fun here today, Trev.

2000
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:19,580
Goose and goose and goose.

2001
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:20,700
Goose and goose.

2002
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:22,540
But I think we also learned something.

2003
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:23,340
I know I did.

2004
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:27,980
I did, I learned that I miss Griffin and I hope he's back from Japan soon.

2005
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:29,500
I miss Griffin too.

2006
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:34,620
Got some reminder here for you.

2007
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:42,140
MBMBAMCandleNights.BrownPaperTickets.com is where you can go to go buy your tickets for

2008
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:45,340
My Brother, My Brother, Me, Home for the Candle Nights, Holiday Spectacular,

2009
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:49,500
featuring Sawbones, 7 PM, December 21st at Huntington City Hall.

2010
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:52,620
Huntington City Hall has a beautiful theater in it.

2011
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:54,620
It's replete with history.

2012
01:28:56,300 --> 01:29:00,860
We are going to be able to hang out all weekend and chill with you and have fun.

2013
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:02,780
And it's going to be great.

2014
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:06,940
It also is really going to be like a homecoming for us because we all three grew up doing

2015
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:10,300
theater in that auditorium in that theater.

2016
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:12,540
So it's going to be literally like our home turf.

2017
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:14,780
We have the most experience being on that stage.

2018
01:29:14,780 --> 01:29:18,060
It's going to be a really great show and you will not want to miss it.

2019
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,420
I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

2020
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:20,460
So make sure you get tickets.

2021
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,660
They're 15 bucks.

2022
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:24,620
You know, buy them for an early Christmas gift.

2023
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:25,740
What a surprise.

2024
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:27,180
Thank you so much for this.

2025
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:28,700
Speaking of Christmas gifts.

2026
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:29,260
Yep.

2027
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:32,460
We also launched all that new merch we've been talking about.

2028
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:33,500
Finally.

2029
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:39,020
It's up on MaxFunStore.com and we have so we've had a poster that's only been available

2030
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:40,060
at live shows.

2031
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:44,140
That poster is still only available at live shows, but you can get the red version on

2032
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:44,780
the store.

2033
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:49,900
We have our sticker packages, our button packets, the coolest patch you'll ever see in your

2034
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:50,940
entire life.

2035
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:51,900
Guaranteed.

2036
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:53,820
Our pack your bags and move away tote bag.

2037
01:29:54,620 --> 01:30:03,020
We've got two prints up that are the NBNBAM 2013 and the NBNBAM 2012 year in review.

2038
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:05,740
And of course, our T-shirts are up there.

2039
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:08,620
The P1's nasty gum and our question mark T-shirt.

2040
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:13,500
And the quicker this stuff sells out, the faster it moves, the more likely it is that

2041
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,820
we'll keep putting more and more new stuff up there.

2042
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:17,180
So get it for yourself.

2043
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:18,620
Get it for a loved one.

2044
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:21,580
Buy it now before it sells out because it's been going fast.

2045
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:26,140
Everyone's been talking about it on Twitter and I guarantee we're going to sell out of

2046
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:26,460
this stuff.

2047
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:28,060
It's all at MaxFunStore.com.

2048
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:28,780
Go get it.

2049
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:31,980
While you're on the internet, go to YouTube.

2050
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:39,820
Go to YouTube.com slash NBNBAM and you are going to find a bevy of hit clips to enjoy.

2051
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:43,580
We broke 4,000 subscribers, which is great and we really appreciate it.

2052
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:46,620
And the more subscribers we get, the more stuff we'll do.

2053
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:51,420
If we hit 10,000 subscribers, I get to use the YouTube studios to do whatever I want

2054
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:53,740
and probably just film myself eating sandwiches.

2055
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:55,500
And who doesn't want to see that?

2056
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:56,380
It's a sight to see.

2057
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:57,260
It's like a freak show.

2058
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:00,220
And I'm going to-

2059
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:04,060
You won't believe how many toppings the geek puts on his sandwich.

2060
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:05,660
He eats it all in one bite.

2061
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,460
And I'm going to keep putting up new videos.

2062
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:10,060
I'm going to try to do like two or three a week.

2063
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:14,940
If you haven't gone, go check out the amazing animated videos that Tyler Crowley did for us.

2064
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:18,940
There's a new one of Pizza Clone that is just incredible.

2065
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:20,940
It's like NBNBAM 2.0.

2066
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:22,380
You're going to absolutely dig it.

2067
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:24,140
So go check those out.

2068
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:24,940
Tell your friends.

2069
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:26,860
Share those videos all over the place.

2070
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:30,060
It's why we're making them so people will listen to them who don't normally listen to

2071
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:30,460
the show.

2072
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:32,540
So make sure you share that.

2073
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:34,540
And while you're at it, just share the show.

2074
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:35,260
Tell a friend.

2075
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:40,860
We haven't brought that up in a while, but the best advertisement we have is you.

2076
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:45,020
So if you're in a car with someone who's never listened to the show before, maybe pop it

2077
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:45,520
on.

2078
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:47,420
Maybe send someone a link.

2079
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:49,900
Maybe make them watch a clip of the show.

2080
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:50,400
Something.

2081
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:52,060
And let's get the word out there.

2082
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:54,540
We're on Twitter at NBNBAM.

2083
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,380
We're on the Maximum Fund Network.

2084
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:58,940
There are a ton of other shows there.

2085
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:02,940
Throwing Shade, Stop Podcasting Yourself, Judge John Hodgman, Jordan Jessico, Bullseye,

2086
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:10,140
The Goose Down, Lady the Lady, One Bad Mother, Destination DIY, Baby Geniuses, The Fop House.

2087
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:11,100
I could go on forever.

2088
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:14,940
I would like to spotlight Baby Geniuses because I am now their producer and I am working on

2089
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:18,940
putting up their episode, which should be up a couple hours after this one.

2090
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:20,060
And you should go check it out.

2091
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:22,860
It is a really good episode, you guys.

2092
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:25,900
And then go listen back to all their other episodes if you haven't already.

2093
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:26,780
Who's the guest?

2094
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:27,340
Who's the guest?

2095
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:28,460
Let's see.

2096
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:31,420
Emily Gordon is one of them from the Inside Kids.

2097
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:32,140
Is that right?

2098
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:32,860
Indoor Kids.

2099
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:33,900
From the Indoor Kids.

2100
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:35,500
From the Inside Kids.

2101
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:38,140
No, that's a joke from Kurt Braunholt.

2102
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:39,980
What is this globe in the sky?

2103
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:44,060
Kurt Braunholt called them the Inside Children and now I can't get that out of my head.

2104
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:45,820
But go check out the show.

2105
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:47,500
You're going to love it.

2106
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:50,460
Just go ahead and subscribe and download all the episodes when they come out.

2107
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:56,460
They're one of the new shows we added to our lineup for Max Fun Week along with

2108
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:58,700
Fop House and Destination DIY.

2109
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:01,020
And trust me, all three are incredible.

2110
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:04,060
Do not miss out.

2111
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:05,500
So that's going to do it for-

2112
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:10,940
Oh, we also want to say thanks to John Roderick of The Long Winters for allowing us to use

2113
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:14,140
the theme song It's a Departure off of the album Putting the Days to Bed.

2114
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:15,500
Go buy it if you haven't already.

2115
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:19,260
I assume everyone's listened to it and everyone's bought it eight times already.

2116
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,100
But if you haven't, go buy it.

2117
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:25,900
Maybe buy it on vinyl if it's available and give it to someone for Christmas, for Candle

2118
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:26,540
Night.

2119
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:28,700
It makes a beautiful, beautiful-

2120
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:29,340
What's the other one?

2121
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:32,220
What's the one that he and Jonathan Colton did for Christmas?

2122
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:34,780
Oh, crap.

2123
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:35,740
The title escapes me.

2124
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:36,780
Okay.

2125
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:37,500
Well, go check out-

2126
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:38,540
One Christmas at a time?

2127
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:39,500
Yes.

2128
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:39,980
I think.

2129
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:40,220
Yes.

2130
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:43,660
Go check out John Roderick and Jonathan Colton's Christmas album.

2131
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:46,220
It's going to make your Candle Nights.

2132
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:50,220
Maybe you haven't had any friends or family ever, or maybe your friends and family don't

2133
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:50,780
love each other.

2134
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:51,660
Well, here's the thing.

2135
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:54,700
You put on this Candle Nights album, it's going to fix all that.

2136
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:57,020
Okay.

2137
01:33:57,020 --> 01:33:58,860
Now, that is actually going to do it for us.

2138
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:00,060
Remember to go get your tickets.

2139
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:03,900
We have sold out every show we've ever done, usually in less than an hour.

2140
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:10,540
We have a lot more tickets than that for this show, and it is not in a large city, so we

2141
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:12,540
think that you will have a better shot, but-

2142
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:13,660
But don't wait.

2143
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:14,220
Don't wait.

2144
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:15,020
Don't sleep on it.

2145
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:24,140
15 bucks gets you in, and the web address, again, is nbnbamcandlenights at brownpapertickets.com.

2146
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:25,740
If you got questions, just ask us.

2147
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:28,140
And that's going to do it for us.

2148
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:30,060
Thank you so much for joining us.

2149
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:32,460
We don't have a last Yahoo this week.

2150
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:35,260
So, Travis, what should, like, how do we end?

2151
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:37,340
I'll make a big fart sound.

2152
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:37,900
Okay, cool.

2153
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:42,140
You got to say, oh, yeah, I go and do that now.

2154
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:45,820
Pretty funny.

2155
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:47,180
That's solid.

2156
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:48,220
Huh?

2157
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:50,380
You're not going to get goofed like that on any other network.

2158
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:51,100
You're still talking.

2159
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:51,980
That was supposed to be the end.

2160
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:52,540
I'm sorry.

2161
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:53,100
Try to go.

2162
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:55,900
You got to say your name.

2163
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:57,020
I'm Justin McElroy.

2164
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:58,140
I'm Travis McElroy.

2165
01:34:58,140 --> 01:34:59,900
I'm Griffin McElroy.

2166
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:01,260
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

2167
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:03,260
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

2168
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:19,100
