1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You've done it, you've succeeded, you've engaged in the right series of clicks and types and taps that make the

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My Brother, My Brother and Me Advice Show for the Modern Era come out of your speakers or headphones or cans with string

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I am, of course, Justin McElroy, I am the oldest McElroy brother

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I am Travis McElroy and I am the middle-est McElroy brother

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You can't get more middle than Travis

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm Griffin McElroy and I'm the adopted McElroy brother

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I was gonna bring it up this episode if you didn't

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, real brother, thank you for joining me again

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No problem

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Adopted brother, you didn't have much of a choice

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Right, you'd put me back in the cellar

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Back to the cellar with you, dum-dum

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Words hurt, words hurt

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Words do hurt

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Our first question comes to us from FormSpring

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If you need advice, you can find out how to get it at the end of the program

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Dear MBMBAM, have you ever fallen in love with a girl for her taste in music?

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
A girl started making me mix CDs that were surprising and addictingly good

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And now I am in love, but maybe just because of the mix

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I ask, is there anything wrong with this?

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
There ain't nothing wrong with a music girlfriend

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Not in the short term, my man

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, that ain't gonna last long, but you can get some sweet burn CDs from them

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Most of my collegiate musical taste came from a girlfriend that I had my freshman year of college

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That burned me like four MP3 CDs, not even audio CDs

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We're talking like Googles and Googles of music that I still listen to to this day

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Wait, Googles?

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Google Bits

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not gonna last long unless the song that unites the two of you is Crazy Game of Poker

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Because man, that song never ends

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Once again, this is one of those questions where if you're in high school, yeah, no, that's perfectly fine

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If you're 45, it's time to get your ass together, man

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't think there's anything wrong with judging a person based on their musical taste

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I think that says a lot about a person

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think everybody has that quality

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
For me, it's TV shows and movies, and I think for other people it's like video games and music and books and magazines

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There's always gonna be that one thing that sparks our interest

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Just build off of that

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
For me, it's Pogs

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I find a lady with a fine collection of Pogs and maybe some really heavy alloy Slammers

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Just some really nice Slammers

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Look at the Slammers on her

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Wow, look at her Slammers

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Is that a Digimon on there? Nice

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So in closing, it's a fine reason to start a relationship and a terrible reason to continue one

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There it is

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's great

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Another one from FormSpring

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If you work someplace that lets you interact with many different people, customers, and you're immediately attracted to one of them, is it cool to tell him or her you think they're attractive?

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What's up with those Slammers, girl?

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I like those Slammers I see across the register

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm gonna have to go with Travis on this one, no

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
There's no way to avoid being that dude

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Even if you're the nicest guy in the world, there's no way when you're wearing khakis and your work shirt to not sound creepy

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Are you gonna say you're attractive? Because that's probably creepy

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But if you're saying it with body language and stuff

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You just need this, Alpo? Do you want me to put it in your bag?

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're attractive

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're attractive

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I like your face

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm attracted to you

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm attracted to you

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Your body, your face is setting off chemical reactions inside of my body that find you very desirable

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
My aesthetic sense is inflamed

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's one of those things where if you're just paying a compliment, great, it ain't going anywhere

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But you might make them feel better

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Maybe you can use that to get ahead in your business, right?

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Like if you're a real estate agent, maybe show a little bit of the cleave and then what's up?

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, what's up?

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay, confession time

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I once asked a girl out when I was working a waiter job and I asked her out via Facebook

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We went out once and it was awful

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It was quite terrible

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Sounds bad

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah, so I personally don't recommend it

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Also, I felt like the creepiest creepo ever

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You should have

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah, and I did, even as I did it, I was trying to justify it and you can't

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm surprised the girl showed up and didn't just call Chris Hansen because it's creepy time

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Because she was 12 years old

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
She was also 12

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This is also like so much of our advice

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's highly contextual dependent upon whether or not you yourself are very physically attractive

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh yeah, no, if you're banging, forget it

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah, if you're super attractive, super handsome dude or a super bodacious lady with just real nice slammers

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You are always going to be on the right path by telling people that you find them attractive

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's always acceptable if you're very, very physically attractive

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Sweet, sweet slammers

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Just the sweetest

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hi brothers

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Hi

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hi, I have a problem

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I can't start studying for a test until the day before

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What should I do to start earlier?

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You've come to the wrong place, my friend

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
How about this, hey bitch, just start earlier

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Just do the thing

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Do the thing you asked how to do

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's do that

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You understand the concept of earlier, so pick a time before the time you normally do it and do it then

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't do it now, do it yesterday

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If you do it now, it's too late, do it before

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Now that being said, I do the same thing or I did the same thing because I retained the knowledge better in a block before the test rather than trying to study all week

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Bullshit

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I couldn't hold it in my head that long

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Bullshit

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No, I sort of got it

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The only thing I think you can do which proved to be kind of useful for me was to get like a, I don't want to say study group

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Because that's not the right vernacular, but like a shared pain group who will guilt you if you don't study

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah, the hardest class I had growing up was theater history and I actually had a study group for that one

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And I felt like pretty lame about it

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's why I should have a study group, what is it, 1930?

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But that worked out well for me

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So if you get somebody who will say, like if you make a study appointment with somebody like a few days before, say hey we're going to study on Tuesday, let's just study

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Then you will keep that appointment

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Sure

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
In theory

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Got to get accountability is what that's called

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Got to be accountable

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Got to get that

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yahoo Answers user Rock just says

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Hey Rock

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's spelled R-A-Q by the way

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Whoa

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm figuring that's how it prefers to be pronounced

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Hey, need a film, not anything like The Lake House or that sort

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Desperate for something to watch, anything for a 15 year old girl?

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But not in the wheelhouse of The Lake House

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So the only parameters set on this choice

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Might I suggest The Lake House?

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No, wait, fuck, shit

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You choked, you choked McElroy, you choked

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Not The Lake House, anything but The Lake House

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Maybe something that, maybe Walk in the Clouds?

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Maybe

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's got Keanu

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm thinking of, I'm trying to think of other Keanu Reeves time travel based rom coms

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, Bill and Ted's Excellent Love Affair

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Bill and Ted's most tender engagement

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Travel through time, kissing George Carlin

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
This question is troubling to me because of the addendum

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm desperate for something different to watch

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Which makes me think, this is a 15 year old girl who her entire life

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The only film she's ever watched is The Lake House

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm ready for something new

153
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I would say the Jurassic Park films, that would probably be a good place to start

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Have you tried Titanic?

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You've never seen any movies, I don't know where to start with you

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Have you tried anything else?

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Not that she hasn't seen any movies

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
She done seen The Lake House

159
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't even try to quote Lake House to her

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
She knows all the lines, all the classic, classic lines

161
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Like, I've got a time traveling mailbox

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I live in a house by the lake

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That really is the worst movie ever

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You've watched it?

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah, I watched it

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh, that's good

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm sorry

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I hate you

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Another one from FormSpring

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I fall in love with every girl that pays attention to me, is this normal?

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If you're fat

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Fair

173
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I mean, right?

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't know, I get it

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:57,000
If you've been single for long enough, I don't think that's such a ridiculous feature

176
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It was actually something I just learned in the last year

177
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
To not view every female that I meet as a potential love interest

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Right now?

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah, just like a year ago

180
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Sometimes you can just meet and be friends with a girl

181
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And you don't have to be romantically involved

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's really freeing

183
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, you can't do that

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But I see what you're getting at

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Maybe you've never seen a film called When Harry Met Sally

186
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Or The Lake House

187
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's all I've seen

188
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That might be a good one

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Go see When Harry Met Sally

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Billy Crystals

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You say Billy Crystals?

192
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't think you should

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't think you should fall in love with every girl that pays attention to you anymore

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's my advice

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Because it's not healthy

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No, it's not healthy

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's a losers game

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You're a worthwhile person

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You have great taste in podcasts

200
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You don't need to fall in love with every girl that pays attention to you

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And also look at it this way

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If you fall in love with every girl that pays attention to you

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You will be less desirable to women

204
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Because they don't want that dude

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
They want someone who is funny and aloof

206
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And not desperately trying to get the attention of every woman that pays attention to him

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So, you know, play it cool, hotshot

208
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Play it cool

209
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I've got a bad problem of falling in love with every girl that's pretty on my TV box

210
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Every girl I see on my TV box that I think is pretty

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Just instant infatuation

212
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Like Lauren Bacall

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Flo, Flo from the Instagram

214
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Don't get me started

215
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Flo, those progressive commercials

216
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
She's my favorite

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
She is a cutie

218
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And you know she's got the N for insurance

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
She can hook you up

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I mean, C.E. Wilson

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I mean, I guess he's a good enough looking man

222
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But I would hop onto the Flo wagon

223
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You would with very little hesitation be a Flo rider

224
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Wow, from downtown

226
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
My wife and I are expecting first child in a month

227
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
She wants some songs that would be good to listen to in the delivery room

228
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Can you give me some great tracks for this special occasion?

229
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's from Thomas via Gmail

230
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No, I think we could come up with something, Thomas

231
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh man, Zees

232
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I actually, I read this question earlier

233
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And I came up with a really great solution

234
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And I think for the longer portion

235
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The more drawn out portion

236
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Like from when she actually gets posted up in the room

237
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And starts squishing out the baby

238
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You put on something soothing

239
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Something mellow

240
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Something like Iron and Wine's double sided LP around the well

241
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Just something to bring the mood down

242
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And then

243
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And then

244
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Right when she starts crowning

245
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Thunderstruck by ACDC

246
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Wow

247
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
See, I was going along the same idea

248
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
India, Nazareth, Hair of the Dog

249
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Now you're messing with a son of a bitch

250
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I think that's the best way for a baby to enter the world

251
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
How did that go again?

252
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't want to do that again

253
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't think he can do better than Thunderstruck

254
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Like if you guys want to try and come at me with something else

255
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But Thunderstruck would be the most trial

256
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
How about with Arms Wide Open by Creed?

257
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Fuck you with that

258
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's about bringing a baby into the world, it's perfect

259
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Get out of here with that, get off the show

260
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Fuck you with that

261
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The obvious answer by the way

262
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
For the special moment of childbirth

263
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Is Black Hole Sun

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Oh man

265
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What about

266
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What kid wouldn't want to make a triumphant entrance

267
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
To Hurricane 2000

268
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Obviously

269
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Hurricane 2000 is the way to go

270
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Is that the

271
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What am I thinking

272
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I was thinking of the orchestral version

273
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Of Rock You Like a Hurricane

274
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That is in fact Hurricane 2000

275
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's what you're talking about?

276
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That would be pretty good I guess

277
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It would be perfect

278
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Shake it at the knees

279
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And then she would really be shaking at the knees

280
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And a baby would come out

281
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Thomas whatever you pick

282
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Make sure you sing it to her

283
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
She'll really appreciate it

284
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
She'll really love it

285
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Make sure it's with Arms Wide Open too

286
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
She'll dig it

287
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Formspring asks, my girlfriend gets a little upset

288
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That I don't tend to hug her at night

289
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
In bed, I explained I just need

290
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
My own space to get to sleep but I don't think it

291
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Made her feel better, how can I keep my

292
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Own bed space and avoid hurting her feelings

293
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Um

294
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I

295
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I think that

296
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You should go

297
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
With the, it depends on how quickly

298
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
She falls asleep, if she falls asleep really

299
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
See my wife likes to cuddle in bed

300
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But I don't like to touch anything

301
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm sleeping, so I'll like

302
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Justin has a hover chamber

303
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
He just gets in and he just shuts down

304
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
For the night

305
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I snuggle her until she falls asleep

306
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And then I dog pound her out of that side of the bed

307
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Check out my other side of the bed

308
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And if I'm lucky

309
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'll have hit a real cool spot on the pillow

310
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Got a real cool spot going

311
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Cause I've been relocated for so long

312
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What I like to do is just straight up

313
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Cuddle, cuddle, cuddle and then say

314
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Hey I'm going to sleep now, and then roll over

315
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So she gets the cuddles and then

316
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's your turn, and it's your time

317
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
For sleeping

318
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I've never been married so I don't know what it's like to sleep

319
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
In the same bed as a woman

320
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's my good boy

321
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Onward Christian soldiers, onward

322
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Um

323
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Christian, what?

324
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yahoo

325
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yahoo answers user Mousseau

326
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Which may be

327
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The evil twin brother of Justin Rousseau

328
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah, or

329
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The children's singer Mitchell Mousseau from the hit show

330
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Hannah Montana

331
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You know they're the same person, right?

332
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yeah, who? Hannah Montana and

333
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Miley Cyrus or Justin Rousseau and Mousseau?

334
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Mousseau Rousseau

335
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I think it's Justin Rousseau and Hannah Montana

336
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah, well

337
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay, go ahead

338
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Which is a better name for a character?

339
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Here's another fun little naming game

340
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm torn between

341
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Jaden and Jacob

342
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Either way, his name is shortened

343
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
To J. My character

344
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Is 15 years old and is growing up

345
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
In England. He comes from a

346
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Middle class background yet smokes weed

347
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Is a teenage Casanova

348
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And basically a rebel without a cause

349
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Get out of here

350
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Which name would suit him better and why?

351
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The only reason I didn't go for Jacob, which was

352
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
My first choice, was because of the

353
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Werewolf character from the Twilight series

354
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But my book is nothing like Twilight

355
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Nothing

356
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh

357
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Basically

358
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This guy's a rebel without a cause

359
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
More or less

360
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Basically, more or less

361
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Just don't get in his way

362
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Mister, because you don't like Jason Jaden

363
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
When he's angry

364
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Boy, golly

365
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I like any character that's defined as

366
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
He's from a middle class background

367
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But he smokes weed every day

368
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
As though those two things are mutually exclusive

369
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah, he's middle class

370
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But you know, he'll still smoke some weed

371
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He's the narcotic of the proletarians

372
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What do you want him to smoke in middle class?

373
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Is a middle class white guy

374
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Who will

375
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Wear some khakis, whatever

376
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Not a big deal

377
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
He's a free thinker

378
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I think your book sounds shitty

379
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I wouldn't

380
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I wouldn't read it, I don't see what the concern

381
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Is with what the character's name is

382
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But, to answer your question, Jaden

383
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But, Jaden, obviously Jaden

384
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The world has too many

385
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Jasons already

386
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Jacobes

387
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Jason

388
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Jadakiss

389
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Jadakiss

390
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Desiree

391
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Gotta be bad, gotta be bold

392
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Who's that one guy

393
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Who sang with his shirt off

394
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
In a black and white video

395
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
R&B

396
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Right side Fred? What are you talking about?

397
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You know

398
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You know

399
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Not Seal

400
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
He had his shirt off in the Desiree video?

401
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
No, he's like

402
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
He's sort of like Desiree

403
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You gotta give me a song or I can't sing

404
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Kinda like Jadakiss

405
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You gotta give me a song or I can't sing

406
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
He's an R&B singer

407
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Okay, that's a genre

408
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
DeCantrus, maybe

409
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It'll come to me

410
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I wanna say something like a pony

411
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Is his name

412
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Jadakiss, Ludacris

413
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Something like that

414
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Ludacris is a thing, he's a guy

415
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
DeAngelo

416
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Got it

417
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
How is that like a pony?

418
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Like Capote

419
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Like Capote

420
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
DeAngelo Capote

421
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Popular district attorney in Boston

422
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Can we keep going?

423
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
My wife and I, this comes to us from Christian

424
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That's the only way I can think to pronounce that

425
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
For a man

426
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Christian from Gmail

427
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
My wife and I are going to New York

428
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
For a week in June, would like some advice on

429
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What should we do or not do

430
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What was

431
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Keep going

432
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I can do it

433
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I keep waiting for it to arrive

434
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What should we

435
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Should we not do, what must we do

436
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
See, eat, buy while we are there

437
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Keep in mind, it's our first trip

438
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
To the US, so everything is

439
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Brand spanking new to us

440
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Can't imagine

441
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I mean if it's

442
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I think if it's

443
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Your first trip to the US

444
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
There are more staple US activities

445
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That you need to partake in before like New York

446
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Activities, right?

447
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
First things first, buy shoes

448
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We got them here

449
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Lousy with them

450
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Also throw some money in the garbage

451
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's what we do, we don't care

452
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Get real fat

453
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Buy a new like

454
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Very consumptive

455
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Automobile

456
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And like just drive it into a building

457
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Get one of those

458
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Room scoot 2011's

459
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
They are really fast and they will just burn

460
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That oil, if you want a place to go

461
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
To eat, try

462
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Max Brenner chocolate by the bald

463
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Man, there they have

464
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's not only delicious and New Yorky

465
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But they have

466
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
A chocolate marshmallow pizza that really

467
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Sums up a lot of American values

468
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Welcome to America

469
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Here's your complimentary diabetes

470
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yeah, I got

471
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
This lousy t-shirt and diabetes

472
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I would say just go to the nearest

473
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Walmart or Sam's Club

474
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And buy a big box

475
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Of Jimmy Dean's breakfast

476
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Corn dogs

477
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And then just eat those the entire time you're

478
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Within the borders of our nation

479
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Sorry, no Walmart New York

480
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What?

481
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
No Walmart in New York

482
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
In all of the city there's not a single

483
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Walmart

484
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
They would have to leave the city, they would have to take a taxi cab

485
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Well maybe you could like

486
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Maybe you could get one like under the counter at a Whole Foods

487
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Probably yeah

488
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
They deal in like shady

489
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Like so non Whole Foods

490
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
There, you gotta pay a premium

491
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Talk to Jerry, the guy that sweeps up

492
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
He answers to the name

493
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Sweepin' Jerry

494
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
He's got a beat on a breakfast corn dog

495
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Travis, what show

496
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Do they see a show?

497
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
God, I wish I knew any

498
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Shows on Broadway right now

499
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What show gets the T-Sax seal of approval?

500
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What about The Addams Family?

501
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That name's always a delight

502
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Is Cats still on Broadway?

503
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It is, but now they changed

504
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
They changed the name to Miss Saigon

505
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Oh, okay, but still there's

506
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Cats in it, right?

507
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I feel like there is something on Broadway

508
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Right now that I heard about

509
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And was like, oh that sounds so dope

510
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But I can't

511
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Like it's like a show about like a musician

512
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Or something

513
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Oh yeah, um, D'Angelo

514
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That was it

515
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Wicked

516
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The Addams Family

517
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The Addams Family

518
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You're Googling, you make me sick

519
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You know what, actually go see Blue Man Group, it's awesome

520
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What?

521
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That shit's incredible

522
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What if they're shirtless and it's black and white

523
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And they're singing R&B songs, maybe

524
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And also, it's called D'Angelo the Musical

525
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Um

526
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So

527
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Max writes to us from

528
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Gmail, he's kind of a wordy

529
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
chap, he says

530
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I've taken a real shine to a girl

531
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Every 20 year old who writes our program

532
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Is a 70 year old man

533
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I just wanted to get that out

534
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I've taken a real shine to a girl

535
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I fancy a young lady

536
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I fancy a young lady

537
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I like the

538
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Nevermind, her bustle

539
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
A delight

540
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
She has the best Lindy Hop in the Tri-County area

541
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Um

542
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So anyway, I've taken a real shine to a girl I know

543
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And after thinking about whether I have a chance or not

544
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm feeling inspired by your advice on the show

545
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Have decided to give it a go

546
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Oh, there's your first mistake

547
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
After some friendly banter, she asked if I was doing anything later

548
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yes, and we soon arranged

549
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
To meet later in the evening

550
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah

551
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You're welcome

552
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Tell your kids about us

553
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I wish more people would write and let us know or name them after us

554
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
More accurately

555
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Thing is, I'm not 100% certain this is a date

556
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Don't get me wrong, by all accounts

557
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This seems like one when you read it

558
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Read it back, indeed

559
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But this is one of those girls who has a naturally

560
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
flirtatious demeanor

561
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Meaning it could just be a friendly meetup

562
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Here comes the real problem

563
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm going to try to keep this meeting on the down low

564
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So I can ascertain the truth of the matter

565
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And not have it announced to our social circle

566
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
That I'm trying to court this girl

567
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Well, Max, I know your fucking first problem, buddy

568
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Maybe

569
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Does your social circle listen to our podcast?

570
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Because this is a bad start

571
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Probably not, let's be realistic

572
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah

573
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
If not, then you've got an even bigger problem

574
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And that's that you haven't

575
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Shared this with your loved ones

576
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I think

577
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And maybe this is just me

578
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I don't know how the young people are today

579
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I don't know the

580
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Their various social

581
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Codes, signals

582
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
They send to each other

583
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's all online now

584
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Is it all?

585
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
See, I was afraid of that

586
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I think that if you

587
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Make an appointment to do something

588
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's a date

589
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
With a lady and a guy

590
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Just by themselves, it's a date

591
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Like, if you

592
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
If she invites along other friends

593
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Or suggests that you invite

594
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Along other people, it's not a date

595
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But if she's saying, let's just do this, you and me

596
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You gotta assume it's a date

597
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's on her if it's not a date

598
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Do not spend the entire date trying to figure out if it's a date or not

599
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Or you will fuck it up

600
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You will fuck it up, bro

601
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You will probably be better off

602
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
If you act like it's not a date

603
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Because that will

604
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
That will keep the confidence high

605
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I don't feel like pressure like

606
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Should I hold her hand? Should I kiss her?

607
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Should I hold her kiss?

608
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Jayda Kiss

609
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Jayda Kiss, D'Angelo

610
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
All the questions that seep into a young man's mind

611
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Should I take her to see the lake house?

612
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Should I take her to see the lake house again?

613
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That's the only movie she's ever seen

614
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
What other movies are there?

615
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I take a much more backwards

616
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Approach to my social engagements

617
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Where at the end of any social

618
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Engagement I partake in

619
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I try and kiss the other party

620
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And if they take it

621
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Then I will know in retrospect that it was a date

622
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And if they fight me off

623
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Then I know

624
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The truth

625
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It was really awkward when Griffin got his taxes done

626
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Well, I don't know because my H&R Block

627
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Representative

628
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
She was fantastic

629
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
The weirdest was when he was baptized

630
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And he's had them all over the world

631
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
As far as your

632
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Friends finding out

633
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You know, don't worry about it

634
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
They'll all grow up and if they're

635
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Dicks, don't worry about it

636
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It'll be cool

637
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Just don't adhere to any labels, man

638
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You know what I'm saying?

639
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It doesn't matter if it's a quote-unquote

640
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Date or not, or if it's just a friendly

641
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Hangout, if it turns into love

642
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Yeah, it's by less pressure if you don't

643
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
If it's not a date, then you can

644
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Just hang out, and you know what?

645
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Dude, seriously, if you don't

646
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Hang out with her, treat it like it's a friendship

647
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And if you don't like spending time

648
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
With her in that context, then you

649
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Probably don't want to do it again anyway

650
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And honestly, if you like spending time with her

651
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
If you don't act like it's a date

652
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
You can probably preserve the friendship easier

653
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
If it doesn't work out

654
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Actually, that's a great point, because we get asked a lot about

655
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Friendzone, and I was friend

656
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
No one that actually likes you

657
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Romantically puts you in the friendzone

658
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So there's no concern of like

659
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I became too good of friends with this person

660
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And now they don't want to date me

661
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
They didn't want to date you before

662
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And they just wanted to be friends with you

663
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And hey, this goes for him

664
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And Max, and everybody

665
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Let us know how this stuff works out

666
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
If you follow our advice

667
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Not that we recommend you do that

668
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Or anything else we've ever told you to do

669
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Anything else we've ever told you to do

670
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yahoo questions user

671
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Simmons, aka

672
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
That Guy

673
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Asks, in all caps

674
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Help my little baby sister

675
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
She drank beer

676
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Hi, one of my little baby sisters

677
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Who is 11 months old just drank some beer

678
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
She didn't drink a lot, and she doesn't seem affected by it

679
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
But my mom is freaking out and yelling at all of us

680
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But I think she is fine, and my mom doesn't think so

681
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Can anyone help? And no bullshit

682
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Serious answers only

683
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Take her keys away

684
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
First and foremost

685
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Don't let her drive

686
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
This is another

687
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
One of those times where we have to remind you

688
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Of the right time

689
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
To call poison control

690
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And the right time to ask Yahoo answers

691
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
What you should do about your situation

692
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Because it's not now

693
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Babies think they can party

694
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Babies don't got shit

695
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
These babies come up here

696
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
They think that they can roll with the big dogs

697
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Trying to stab

698
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I don't think humans get livers

699
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Until they're like 3

700
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You gotta earn that shit

701
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Where's that beer going?

702
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I think we're missing some important

703
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
What beer?

704
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Oh that's another

705
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That's a big beer

706
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
What did you let her have first?

707
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Did you let her have some highlife?

708
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
If it's like a heady dogfish stout

709
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Then that baby's donezo

710
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
That baby's out

711
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
My baby sister just slammed a Rasputin

712
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Oh no

713
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
What if she had a PBR?

714
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
You got a hipster baby on your hands now

715
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Hope you can find really small

716
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Horn rimmed glasses

717
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Plaid shirts

718
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Tiny fixy tricycle

719
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
These jeans don't come any smaller

720
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm sorry

721
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You'll have to go to the My Buddy aisle

722
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
To find smaller jeans

723
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
For tight tight hipster babies

724
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Tight tight hipster jeans

725
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
At the Gymboree

726
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But seriously

727
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Go to a hospital I think

728
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Have her drink a glass of water

729
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And an ibuprofen

730
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And a glass of water in the morning

731
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And she'll be fine

732
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Also film that shit and put it on YouTube

733
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Did you guys hear about

734
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Josh

735
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
His problem

736
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
He wrote to us gmail

737
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Our answer

738
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Just found out

739
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
My ex cheated on me with her current boyfriend

740
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
When we were still together

741
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
What's the best way to set a person aflame?

742
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I think you gotta play in one of the hits

743
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Of D'Angelo

744
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And just watch their heart light up

745
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Right? Does that mean literal?

746
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Yeah I was gonna say literally

747
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Fire

748
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But

749
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Fire and some sort of flammable oils

750
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
They gotta be asleep

751
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That's so important

752
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Or unconscious in some way

753
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Yeah you can't just like start

754
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
You will never work

755
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You will be shocked at how quickly a motivated man

756
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Is gonna fire

757
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Josh let me drop something on you

758
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
That Jerry Springer dropped on me when I was 12

759
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
A bottle of beer

760
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
A bottle of beer

761
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That is one of

762
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
The wise Jerry's final thoughts was

763
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
If someone will cheat on

764
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Someone to be with you

765
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Then they will cheat on you to be with someone else

766
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So drop that knowledge on her new boyfriend

767
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Like listen dude

768
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I don't know what makes you think

769
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
She wouldn't cheat on you she cheated on me

770
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Hey bye

771
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And then dip

772
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That's possible

773
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Maybe you just didn't love her hard enough

774
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I know that's kind of

775
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I know that's

776
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That's a harsh reality but

777
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Did you love her as hard as you possibly could?

778
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You know what you just said she's your ex

779
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Who cares man

780
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Let it go move on

781
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Griffin you made a great point too

782
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
No girl cheats on someone

783
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Or nobody cheats on someone they're happy with

784
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You know what I mean?

785
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Unless they get drunk at their office party

786
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Unless they get drunk at their office party

787
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Or the someone is profoundly physically attracted

788
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Also that

789
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And that's another thing I'm just going to heads up real quick

790
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Listeners

791
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000

793
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Questions about

794
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
How to get

795
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
People with boyfriends and girlfriends

796
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
To sleep with you

797
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Not really our expertise

798
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Or something we're going to address

799
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Not cool

800
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Not cool just be cool that's the number one

801
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Advice of my big bam

802
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And

803
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Just don't hate

804
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm just going to give you an in general answer to those questions

805
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Question my friend has a

806
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Girlfriend I want to sleep with what do I do?

807
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Answer realize he's not

808
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Really your friend

809
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You guys maybe aren't as close as

810
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You thought

811
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Joseph has a conundrum

812
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
There's a girl he works with

813
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Who he met while she was

814
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Reading about the new Pokemon game

815
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
That got the conversation

816
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Started now I'm at a loss

817
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
For what to do next should I just go

818
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Forward ask her out I'm really

819
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Bad at the asking out part what should

820
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I do what should I ask her out

821
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
To dinner or something

822
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Else maybe Digimon

823
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Hold on Gertrude

824
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Just go ahead

825
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I think maybe you could arrange some sort

826
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Of series of romantic Pokemon

827
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Battles right

828
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
You know what I'm saying maybe kind of

829
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Sexy Pokemon battles like that could be

830
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
The way that you ask her out like oh if my

831
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
My Charizard topples your Venusaur

832
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
How do you feel about a little

833
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Squirtle and of course you will because

834
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Her Venusaur will be weak to your Charizard's fire

835
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Attacks

836
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
That's all I can

837
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Do that's all I can summon up

838
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I can't do anymore

839
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I think that

840
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Ask her about your Pokeballs

841
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh Jesus

842
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You could

843
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You could just ask her if you

844
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You two want to meet up the next day we could do an anonymous

845
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Meeting I figure

846
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You could try that

847
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Ask her how her collection of cats is doing

848
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'm trying to make fun of this guy

849
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But honestly

850
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I feel like his email is pretty much just

851
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Sort of

852
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Got it out there

853
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I mean I don't want to make fun of him

854
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
We just said that

855
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It's a good reason to have a relationship with

856
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Somebody if you both dig Pokemon

857
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
We can poke fun all we want

858
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Dude met a girl

859
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
What's up beautiful

860
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Keep the human race going

861
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Joseph you had the courage

862
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
To email a podcast

863
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
To ask him how to ask out a girl

864
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Who your only contact with her

865
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Is Pokemon related

866
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I don't think you'll have any problem mustering up

867
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
The courage to ask her out and do something

868
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Your balls are huge dude

869
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Your pokeballs

870
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Your penis are ginormous

871
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You can see your pokeballs from space

872
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It doesn't matter what you do

873
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It doesn't matter what you ask her out

874
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
To do

875
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
As long as you have fun

876
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
As long as it is interesting

877
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Be interested in her

878
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
The date is not important

879
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The experience is important

880
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Be interested in her Pokemon

881
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
That's what she wants to talk about the whole time

882
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But you guys are making fun

883
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Dude if you've got that N

884
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
If that's your N

885
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
It's unconventional

886
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
But you gotta fight tooth and nail

887
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
For love

888
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And you have the best

889
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Nerd point argument ever

890
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Well I disagree

891
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Because I met a girl

892
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And you will win every nerd argument like that

893
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Joseph if I could just

894
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Give you one other piece of advice before we move on

895
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Hold on to this one real tight

896
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Just really

897
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Trust me on this one

898
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Don't let her go

899
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Just

900
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
We don't know how many more times

901
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
This opportunity is going to present itself

902
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
By which we mean none

903
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So just really hold on to this one okay

904
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
For me

905
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Just hold on tight

906
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Trust me

907
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Make it work

908
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Make it work

909
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Gordo

910
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
That's a great name

911
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Gordo asks on gmail

912
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I am super whipped

913
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
By my girlfriend and generally despise my life

914
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
My brother and friends say

915
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm more whipped than even the most whipped guy

916
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
On TV

917
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
No that's a good metric

918
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Haven't you seen the new reality show

919
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
The Most Whipped Guy

920
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I would break up with her but I feel

921
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Bad about it and I'm locked into a few

922
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Trips that include her

923
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
What do I do

924
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Stop planning trips

925
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Why do you have more than one trip planned

926
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Step one

927
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Start dropping subtle hints

928
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Asking about refundability of certain trip deposits

929
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Babe you know that trip we had planned

930
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
In 2015 I returned it

931
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Stop planning trips

932
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
We got Bonnaroo in June

933
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And then the cruise in September

934
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But so help me God

935
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
October rolls around

936
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Guys

937
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Listen man trust me on this one

938
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Trust me

939
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
If you get to a point where you think

940
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I want to break up with somebody

941
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Get in a car

942
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Find them and do it right then

943
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Because there's not a second of your life

944
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
You're not going to spend worrying about it until then

945
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And as soon as you do it you will be

946
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You will feel so much better

947
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And you are not doing them any favors by waiting

948
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Yep don't go on the trips

949
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Because then like okay

950
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Let's say you got a romantic cabin

951
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Trip planned for this weekend right

952
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You're going to go on that cabin trip next weekend

953
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You say I think we should break up

954
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Oh man that cabin trip

955
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
That you just went on is completely

956
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Invalidated like it never happened

957
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Even worse

958
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You're going to say nice things on that cabin trip

959
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You're not going to sit on the opposite side

960
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You're going to say like baby I love you

961
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And then the next week break up with her

962
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
That's going to make it messy dude

963
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And the thing is a lot of people shy away from breakups

964
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Because like oh it's going to be messy

965
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Every breakup is messy it gets better

966
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
The sooner you do it

967
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It starts healing immediately afterwards

968
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So the longer you put it off

969
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
The worse it's going to be

970
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I know it sucks man I know it sucks

971
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But you got to do it

972
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Don't waste any more time you're wasting your life

973
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And also your money

974
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Stop planning trips

975
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Stop planning trips Aaron from

976
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Gmail says how do I comment on my wife's

977
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Terrible new haircut without lying

978
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Here let me feed this one for you Aaron

979
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
You ready

980
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Get close

981
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Lie

982
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Glad I could help

983
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Rob on

984
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Gmail says I'm having a

985
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Baby girl in June my first

986
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
We have a first name

987
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Picked out but haven't chosen a middle

988
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
What do you think of the middle name Danger

989
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
For a girl my wife says it's white trash

990
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
But I don't know any white trash people with the middle name

991
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Danger Your wife doesn't know shit

992
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Yeah sorry Rob

993
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
But that doesn't

994
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Those two things shouldn't associate

995
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
With each other at all

996
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I generally have a baby naming

997
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Rule and that is that naming your

998
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Baby is not an opportunity for self

999
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Expression

1000
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Because your kid has to live with it for the rest of their life

1001
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
That being said

1002
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Danger as a middle name is

1003
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Badass

1004
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I say do it

1005
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
You are raising the sort of person

1006
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Where

1007
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
That's going to shape

1008
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Their life right

1009
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
They're going to have to introduce themselves to

1010
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
People that's going to come up

1011
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
They're going to associate with people who

1012
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Think it's cool that their middle name is Danger

1013
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And that's a cool crowd

1014
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
That's the kind of people you want

1015
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It'll be great and like her wedding

1016
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Her wedding day where there will be a lot of

1017
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
People in attendance who don't know her middle name

1018
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And the preacher will be like do you

1019
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Eliza Danger McCutcheons

1020
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Take so and so

1021
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And everyone in the audience will be like Danger

1022
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Sweet

1023
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah

1024
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I like it I'm a big fan

1025
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
If she ever becomes like an international super

1026
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Spy it's right there

1027
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Danger is my middle name

1028
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
She can actually say I love it

1029
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Right but that joke she's going to hate

1030
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That joke no unless she becomes

1031
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
An adventurer

1032
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
But even then like

1033
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
The danger is my middle name thing like people are

1034
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Going to say that to her at parties and she will

1035
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Get sick of it after like the second time

1036
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
That might get a little old actually

1037
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I'm saying that the word itself

1038
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The concept of danger

1039
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
As a moniker is so strong

1040
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Yeah what about

1041
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Adventure I like that one

1042
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Excitement Punctuality

1043
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Monkey Shines

1044
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Monkey Shines is my middle name

1045
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
What's the best way to

1046
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
This is from Maverick

1047
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
89 What's the best way

1048
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
To remember stuff you've forgotten

1049
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
This question is so paradoxical

1050
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I've been thinking about it all day

1051
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And I can't

1052
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I forgot to think about it

1053
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
No come on

1054
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
First creed

1055
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Now this

1056
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
A2 Travy

1057
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Listen it's been an awful week

1058
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I think you just need to sit down

1059
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You gotta sit down in the dark

1060
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You just gotta turn on the AC

1061
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Low as it goes

1062
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
High as it goes?

1063
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Make the temperature

1064
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
As close to zero as you can get it

1065
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Okay

1066
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Ice down?

1067
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Cover your body in ice and oils

1068
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Icy oil

1069
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Think as hard as you possibly can

1070
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
About some old shit

1071
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
That happened to you

1072
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Back there back in the day

1073
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Cause you got shit back there that happened

1074
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
To you with you

1075
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You have memories in there

1076
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Cobwebs

1077
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
They are cobwebs surrounded

1078
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And you gotta get back there with the oils and just get them out

1079
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Just dust them out

1080
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So what you gotta do is you gotta pop some ginkgo

1081
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Dust them off

1082
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Drink a shasta

1083
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Get in the dark and just sit and get them out

1084
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Watch some old movies

1085
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Watch a movie that was created

1086
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
In the year that you were born

1087
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And just think

1088
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Like the lake house? Were you born in 1997?

1089
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Like the lake house?

1090
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Think deep

1091
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
That movie came out in like 2005 dog

1092
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Sorry dog we're back

1093
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I forgot

1094
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
No but for real ginkgo it up

1095
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
The best way to do it

1096
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
If you're talking about something

1097
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And reset like I was gonna say something

1098
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And I can't remember it

1099
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Retrace what you were talking about

1100
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Or just stop thinking about it

1101
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
The more you try to think about it

1102
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
The more you're going to think about thinking about it

1103
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And not actually remember it

1104
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
As humans we have a short term memory and a long term memory

1105
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And getting things to transition from

1106
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Short term to long term memory is a process

1107
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Didn't you hear

1108
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
The part with the ginkgo

1109
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And the ice didn't you think that that pretty well covered it?

1110
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I answered this question pretty

1111
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Decisive. I feel like he's probably

1112
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Already remembered it. He's probably stopped listening already

1113
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Uh huh

1114
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Maybe he was trying to remember to unsubscribe

1115
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I don't think you can blame him

1116
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I know I can't

1117
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000

1123
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000

He's got a really really important question

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000

Don't even worry about it

1161
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Because that's not gonna work out

1162
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
