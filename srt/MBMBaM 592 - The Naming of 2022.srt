1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,660
Ah, it's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,660
My life

7
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,660
Ah, it's better, it's better with you

8
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,660
This is true

9
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,660
Ah, it's better, it's better with you

10
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,660
My life

11
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,660
Ah, it's better with you

12
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,660
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother, me and advice show for the modern era

13
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,660
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

14
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,660
And I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy

15
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,660
Wow

16
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,660
Feels good

17
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,660
It feels good, it feels real good

18
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,660
And I'm old man 2021

19
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,660
Oh, oh, oh no

20
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,660
Wah wah baby, it's 2022 here

21
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,660
Wait, did that baby just beat that old man to death?

22
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,660
It did, it's 2022, this is Griffin, this is sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy 2022

23
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,660
Is that what happens every year?

24
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,660
This baby is naked and it doesn't have a name

25
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,660
It's covered in blood it sounds like

26
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,660
It's covered in old man blood

27
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,660
When was the last time we recorded my brother, my brother and me?

28
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,660
Quick quiz

29
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,660
Before Krimi

30
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,660
I think it's before Krimi

31
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,660
It's before Krimi for sure

32
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,660
It was the first week of December maybe?

33
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:04,660
It's been weeks since we recorded, we're fired up, we're ready, we're excited to welcome 2022

34
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,660
Yes

35
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,660
Which we're not going to have to call it that much longer because we're about to pick our annual theme

36
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,660
This is an episode that I look forward to

37
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,660
If you haven't listened before, this is a great episode to get people started with

38
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,660
Is it?

39
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,660
Yeah for sure

40
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,660
I love this podcast, these guys do a half hour of clumsy wordplay at the beginning of every episode

41
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,660
Fight about nothing and then move on from there to talk about McDonalds

42
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,660
Let's just start it off

43
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,660
Yes

44
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,660
20 didgeridoo

45
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,660
20 didgeridoo is bad

46
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,660
Let's start it off by, and this is also tradition, going through previous years

47
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,660
Yes, yes, yes

48
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,660
2010, 2010, Zolo, of course

49
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,660
Ridingless, correct

50
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,660
2011, 2000 in heaven, get right with Christ

51
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,660
Okay

52
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,660
Then we had 20 does

53
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,660
Big swing

54
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,660
20 does, getting it

55
00:02:52,660 --> 00:03:00,660
A simple, it's so rudimentary, I love how simple we started with it before our palette expanded

56
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,660
20 dirt, dig it up, get it out, that is of course 2013

57
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,660
That's good

58
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,660
2014, 20 forward, sounds like a, I don't know

59
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,660
We really played fast and loose with the idea, I think we've like

60
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,660
We've grown up

61
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,660
It really codified in 2015, okay?

62
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,660
2015 was 20 grifty and the con is on

63
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,660
That was the best, right? We're not going to top that

64
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:30,660
You know what else I was reflecting on, a challenge, is that the years in the first decade we did this

65
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,660
I'm so old

66
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,660
The first decade we did this, the sounds are all the same

67
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,660
Yeah

68
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,660
I was returning to a lot of established themes this year, trying to find more rhymes for 20

69
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,660
Yeah

70
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,660
But okay

71
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,660
Then we had 2016, building bridges, we look back on that one pretty shamefully

72
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,660
Yeah

73
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,660
Oh boy

74
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,660
Maybe our biggest whiff

75
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,660
That might be the biggest ironic one we've ever done

76
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,660
If that could have been grift teen, that would have been really good

77
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,660
Yeah, that literally could have fixed some shit

78
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,660
20 serpentine, keep them guessing, zag on them

79
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,660
Very good

80
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,660
Very good

81
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,660
Collaborate teen, stronger together

82
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:11,660
I feel like we had a lot of so-so ones until we hit 2019, which was Frankenstein teen, become the monster

83
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,660
Right

84
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,660
That one might be the most potent, I think that we had done

85
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,660
That was a powerful one

86
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,660
That was a good one

87
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,660
Then we had 20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love, which then became 20 honey down to bee'sness

88
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,660
That's right, that's right

89
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,660
I'm so bad

90
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,660
That's one of the few slash years that we had

91
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,660
Yeah, and then we had, of course last year, 20 big dog run, no boats about it

92
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,660
Fuck, that was a good naming, last year's naming episode was a good one

93
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,660
I don't know that we're going to top it this time, but that is what we've done so far

94
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,660
How many names do you guys have in front of you that you cooked up?

95
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,660
None

96
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,660
I'm coming in hot

97
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,660
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

98
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,660
Oh my god, that's too many

99
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,660
I have five

100
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,660
Wow, that's a lot, okay

101
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,660
Okay

102
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,660
Because also, I'm just going to, I'm 38 now, when we started naming years, of course I was 25, now I'm 38

103
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,660
A lot of these are bad, I'm just going to, right off the top of my head

104
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,660
Okay, a lot of these are bad

105
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,660
A lot of these are just thought generators

106
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,660
Yeah

107
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,660
Thought starters, yeah

108
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:19,660
So, I want to throw out kind of a big conceptual one that I don't think will necessarily merit further consideration

109
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,660
But I was excited about it

110
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,660
Two, two, two, two, deuces are wild

111
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,660
And what this is, it reimagines a future where we've been hurtled 200 years into the future

112
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,660
Okay

113
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,660
Right

114
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,660
Okay

115
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,660
Two, two, two, because we're not going to make it there, Ovs

116
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,660
Two, two, two, two

117
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,660
Now, hold on, do you mean just us or the planet?

118
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,660
Just us, just us

119
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,660
The planet will make it

120
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,660
The planet will make it

121
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,660
We'll figure it out, we're humans

122
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,660
I might make it, Justin, you don't know

123
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,660
Two, two, two, two, deuces are wild

124
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,660
I think if it's just deuces wild, I think deuces wild

125
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,660
Deuces wild, yeah

126
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:56,660
I like deuces wild because the year that we are currently in, not 200 years into the future, does have a considerable number of twos in it

127
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,660
Right

128
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,660
But not all the twos

129
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,660
I just want you to get that one more two

130
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,660
Yeah, not all the twos it could have, to Justin's point

131
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,660
I mean, I understand that time travel would be a big conceptual thing

132
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,660
I'm embarrassed at this one and I don't want to talk about it anymore

133
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,660
It sucks

134
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,660
Travis, let me sort of traffic cop this a little bit until we sort of get our rhythm

135
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:18,660
Travis, do three in a row of your worst ones real quick, just so the audience doesn't have that sort of Damocles hanging over their ears

136
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,660
Okay, okay

137
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,660
Twenty hoo-hoo, let's learn about owls

138
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,660
Not even, like not even in the ball game

139
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,660
Just go, just go

140
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,660
Twenty hooty-hoo, let's learn about outcast

141
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,660
As a parry, they're good

142
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,660
As a parry, they're good

143
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,660
Next, I'm not even going to put these on the Google Doc, but keep on rocking and rolling

144
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,660
Third, twenty boppity-boo, be the magic

145
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,660
So you're not even, you have eschewed twenty as a rhyming

146
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,660
I told you they're not good

147
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,660
But I could say like Carl Daniels

148
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,660
No, they all rhyme with twenty-two

149
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:03,660
Hold on, wait, Justin's just introduced a really powerful concept that I wanted to stop and make sure we take a beat, okay?

150
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:20,660
And that is that, have we been hamstringing ourselves by needing to rhyme and also not giving the year a real human name like Carl Daniels

151
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,660
It wouldn't be powerful to be like, fucking Carl Daniels, Carl Daniels sucked

152
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,660
Or, if we're being optimistic, man, Carl Daniels was the best, wasn't he?

153
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,660
Carl turned it the fuck around for this nation of ours

154
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,660
If I could say, I think, oh my god, to send jokes out of the room

155
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:48,660
I think we do need to limit ourselves to the rhyme, because it's one of the few things, if we open the palette up that much, we'll never crack this

156
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,660
I think the restrictions make it important

157
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,660
There's so few things that people can rely on anymore, I think they need to rely on a rhyming year theme

158
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,660
That would be my argument

159
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:07,660
Instead of it being, just one last thing though, instead of it naming the year Carl Daniels, can we make it possessive and just make it Carl Daniels' kickass year

160
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:15,660
And then all the Carl Daniels' out there, just know that they're gonna find a 20 on the street every day

161
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,660
Well, what if we make it a rhyming year, but the tagline is, a good year for Carl's

162
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,660
A great year for a great Carl

163
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,660
It was a good year for Carl's, and make it retrospective right out the gate

164
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:35,660
I'm gonna go ahead and keep suggesting this, and it will be relevant every year this decade, to just do 20 cummies to

165
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,660
I hate it

166
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:46,660
And I still haven't learned really what that word means, aside from context clues that it does involve

167
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,660
Do we let Travis do one more bad one, just to get a story

168
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,660
Travis, why don't you get, are all eight of yours bad?

169
00:08:52,660 --> 00:09:00,660
There's one that I really like, and it would be kind of a different direction for our year of protection

170
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,660
Alright, let's have a beefy one, let's have one that we can really sup on

171
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,660
20 whoopty-doo, who cares

172
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,660
No

173
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,660
No no no no, Justin

174
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,660
No, I don't like the nihilism of that

175
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,660
No no no no, but let's fucking cross-examine it, don't just shit on it

176
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,660
You're right, okay, you're right

177
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,660
20 whoopty-doo, who gives a shit

178
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,660
Oh, I like that better, yeah, who gives a shit

179
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:28,660
We've given the years in the past powerful, powerful dragon shouts, I would say, of mottos and names

180
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,660
And what fucking good has it done so far, right?

181
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,660
Correct

182
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:38,660
Like we, certainly we look to Big Dog Run, and we think like, I could be stronger

183
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:46,660
But at the end of the day, you know, Omicron wasn't like, whoa, look at all these big dogs, let's get out of here

184
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:54,660
If we, if we like, don't necessarily look at the year, we don't quantum lock it

185
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,660
Is it possible that we could have, like the end would justify the means a little bit

186
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,660
It's interesting that 20 Big Dog Run was our most stationary year

187
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,660
Both physically and, I would argue, professionally

188
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,660
Just a real

189
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,660
Emotionally, psychically

190
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,660
Yeah, just keeping it between the navigational beacons, you know? Just trying to stay on course

191
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,660
What I also like about it is you could treat it like a genuine question

192
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,660
20 whoop-de-doo, who cares?

193
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,660
I do, I do

194
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,660
I care

195
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,660
I care

196
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,660
I'll answer that call

197
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,660
Okay, I want to, I want to put it on the, well, you know

198
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,660
It's on there, it's on there, Travis, you're not in this Google Doc, so I don't know what the fuck you're doing right now

199
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,660
That's more important than this

200
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,660
I'm listening and paying attention

201
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,660
Yeah, so where is the Google Doc?

202
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,660
I shared it with you, to your email

203
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,660
Where?

204
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,660
To share with your email

205
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,660
Okay, I'm in it

206
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,660
Okay, I'm going to throw out one of my, one of my better options

207
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,660
Alright, let's have it, let's have it

208
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,660
Okay

209
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,660
20 Yummy Stew, something's cooking

210
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,660
20 Yummy Stew, something's cooking

211
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,660
What I like, my argument for this is one, it's fun to say

212
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,660
20 Yummy Stew, something's cooking

213
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,660
I like there's an exclamation, I put an exclamation point in the notes just because like phonetically

214
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,660
Like it felt like you were kind of excited

215
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,660
But I do like having a punctuation mark in it

216
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:20,660
No, no, no, see the thing is you can delete the punctuation and then it removes pressure

217
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,660
What I like about this is like we can get to the end of the year and like nothing has happened

218
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,660
But it's like, I don't know, it feels like something's cooking

219
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,660
Something's cooking

220
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,660
Yeah, it's definitely, it's definitely I in apostrophe, I won't accept that G

221
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,660
Something's cooking

222
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,660
Something's cooking, now can you make it a question and make it 20 Yummy Stew, what's cooking?

223
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
What's cooking?

224
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,660
So then it's a little more interactive, a little more actionable, that's my worry

225
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:57,660
That's bad because if, you know, due to climate change, if wildfires continue to be the sort of clear and present threat they were in previous years

226
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,660
I think that that

227
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,660
That would be in poor taste

228
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,660
So then I guess you're also against 20 Yummy Stew, what's cooking good looking? Is that too much?

229
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,660
Yeah, I don't want to harass people with the name of the year

230
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:14,660
I feel like the only problem with this Justin is that in the last, let's say six years

231
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:22,660
I have, there has not been an event that has been sort of a slow building moment

232
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,660
That has been a good thing that we're all wicked looking forward to

233
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,660
Do you know what I mean?

234
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:36,660
It's not like, oh man, there's a sinkhole that's very, very slowly opening up somewhere in South America

235
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,660
And it's very slowly consuming this community

236
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,660
But what's that coming out of it?

237
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,660
It's taste stations and they're back

238
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,660
Like there hasn't been a thing that's like

239
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,660
I'm pretty sure taste stations are back

240
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,660
Something's cooking

241
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
Now can we go in a different direction where stew

242
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,660
Cream savers are back

243
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,660
Cream savers

244
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,660
Thank you, thank you, thank you

245
00:12:53,660 --> 00:13:00,660
Where stew is a sort of mixed up bag of ingredients

246
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:07,660
Is there something like 20 Yummy Stew, toss an onion in

247
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,660
Toss your stuff in

248
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,660
I don't think we need

249
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,660
I like people to sort of read their own context into it

250
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,660
Beyond the sort of like basic setting of expectations

251
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,660
I feel like that's where we're at

252
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,660
What do you do if something's cooking?

253
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,660
Well it's just like something's cooking, you know?

254
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,660
Travis is saying there needs to be an act

255
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,660
This is an observation

256
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,660
We need a like

257
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,660
Let me tell you a tagline

258
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,660
Mix it up

259
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,660
What about 20 Yummy Stew, mix it up

260
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,660
Well I've got a tagline that I'm pretty excited about

261
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,660
20 Yummy Stew, put it in the pot

262
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,660
Huh

263
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,660
Okay, what would that be?

264
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,660
What you have, what you've got, put it in the pot

265
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,660
20 Yummy Stew, let it simmer

266
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,660
Let it simmer is again like I don't

267
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,660
That's a very passive thing

268
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,660
Put it in the pot

269
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,660
Take what you've got

270
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,660
But what does that mean?

271
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,660
I'm trying to

272
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,660
We're talking about it

273
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:04,660
Instead of asking, just turn that beautiful thinking brain on

274
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,660
Put it in the pot

275
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,660
What do you have?

276
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,660
You have something special

277
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,660
I have something special

278
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,660
Put it in the pot

279
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,660
Oh, it's a stone soup scenario

280
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,660
It's a stone soup situation

281
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,660
Okay, stone soup

282
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,660
Now I get it

283
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,660
So we're all adding something

284
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,660
Put it in the pot

285
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,660
I just like how that sounds

286
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
Put it in the pot

287
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
Put it in the pot

288
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,660
That's not bad

289
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,660
Don't be embarrassed about that thing that you have

290
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,660
Just put it in the pot

291
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,660
That idea, put it in the pot, let's see what happens

292
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,660
Maybe it'll be good, maybe it won't

293
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,660
20 Yummy Stew

294
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,660
Okay, Trav, do you have another one that you'd like to offer?

295
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,660
Griffin, does anything

296
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,660
I got something that's been coming through my head

297
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,660
because I was thinking about this

298
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,660
Is it about cummies again?

299
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,660
It's not about cummies this time

300
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,660
But I will, sorry, I will add 20 cummies

301
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,660
No, I hate it

302
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,660
I hate it so much

303
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,660
And it's a different one

304
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,660
So just hang on, you ready?

305
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:03,660
20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

306
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,660
Try that out

307
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,660
Try that out for size

308
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,660
Wait, that's it?

309
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,660
I thought that was a build up

310
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,660
No, the name of the year is

311
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,660
20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

312
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,660
What is that for?

313
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,660
Try it out

314
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,660
You should have written some down

315
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,660
Why are you trying to break

316
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,660
We have so few rules and conventions, Griffin

317
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,660
You should have written some down, Griffin

318
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,660
But you should try saying it out loud because it feels good

319
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,660
20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

320
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
It does get me pumped

321
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,660
It does

322
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,660
Yeah, but I have had to institute a

323
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,660
we don't chant for things rule in my house

324
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,660
Okay

325
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,660
So it does

326
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,660
I can see it would be a little bit hypocritical

327
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,660
It would be a little bit hypocritical

328
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,660
because of how often my two children instigate each other into pounding the table to ask for candy or whatever

329
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,660
And this feels a little bit insightful, like inciting

330
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,660
Okay, all right, it's on the list

331
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,660
How about 20 funny shoes

332
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,660
20 funny shoes

333
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,660
They don't got to match all the time

334
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,660
Right?

335
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,660
I'm trying to think of something with shoes

336
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,660
20 funny shoes and odd pairing

337
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,660
Ooh

338
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660
Ooh, something different

339
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,660
Ooh, an interesting pairing

340
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,660
That would be cool if in past years we've been like, believe in yourself

341
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,660
Or work with others

342
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660
Or build those bridges

343
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,660
And then this year we're like, wear different shoes

344
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,660
You can do this

345
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,660
This you can do

346
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,660
Shoes not match

347
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,660
And then that would be great because then you would see somebody on the street with not matching shoes

348
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,660
You'd be like, that asshole listens to my brother and my brother and me

349
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,660
Yeah, that's like an international sign of

350
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,660
Just wish we could monetize it

351
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,660
That's the problem, we don't sell shoes

352
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,660
Not yet

353
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,660
Not yet

354
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,660
Okay, listen to this

355
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,660
All right

356
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,660
20 Venti Brew, oh that Java

357
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,660
Oh

358
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,660
20 Venti Brew, oh that Java

359
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:00,660
When you say it, you have this way of saying them afterwards that really sucks the fucking air out of it

360
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,660
Give it a little bit of panache

361
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,660
Let me try it again and you listen and imagine I came up with it and not you, okay?

362
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,660
20 Venti Brew, oh that Java

363
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,660
It was fun to say like that wasn't it

364
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,660
Yeah, that's pretty good

365
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,660
It was kind of fun to say

366
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,660
This is what I like

367
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,660
Maybe this year I could just get bigger coffees

368
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,660
Maybe that's what we've been missing

369
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,660
That's pretty good

370
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,660
What about

371
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,660
I don't like how Starbucks has kind of co-opted the Venti thing

372
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,660
I hate doing that

373
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,660
Wait, from you?

374
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
When you guys go to Starbucks

375
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,660
I say large

376
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,660
Large, right?

377
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,660
Yeah

378
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,660
A large, thank you

379
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,660
Yeah, like a human

380
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
What about

381
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,660
We just kind of brew blue right past it

382
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,660
I feel like it's on there and we'll circle back to it Justin

383
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,660
I don't want to spend too much time on it ruining it

384
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,660
I like brew

385
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,660
Brew as a verb I could get into

386
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,660
I don't know about Venti and having it be like a witch's brew

387
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,660
I guess we are getting back to something's cooking or put it in a pot

388
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,660
Yeah, that's true

389
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,660
What about 20 skies of blue, anything's possible

390
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,660
Whoa, I like that actually

391
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,660
Skies of though

392
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,660
Skies of blue is interesting because one

393
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,660
Wow, what an incredible

394
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:24,660
You are opening up the possibility space for us to fail even more powerfully

395
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,660
Yeah, yeah

396
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,660
Than we did in 2016

397
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,660
I have two options and it's either whoopty-doo, who cares

398
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,660
Or skies of blue, anything's possible

399
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,660
I only have two settings Justin

400
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:41,660
I see that you didn't add 20 skies of blue, anything's possible to the list

401
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,660
He'll add it, he'll add it, it's a good one

402
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,660
One, I don't know why I'm adding all of the things

403
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,660
Because you didn't come up with any numbers because you didn't come up with any names beforehand

404
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,660
So this is your contribution, your secretary, your stenographer

405
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,660
There you go, you're keeping the minutes

406
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,660
Let me hit you with this

407
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:04,660
I don't have a tagline for it but it seems like it's right for any tagline we could want to put on it

408
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,660
20 coming through, clear the way

409
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:13,660
20 coming through, emerge into your power

410
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,660
Emerge

411
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,660
Part 20 coming through, emerge

412
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,660
Oh shit, that's good

413
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,660
That's pretty good, I like that

414
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,660
Imagine that on like a big projector

415
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,660
A big, what are those things called that you put on the lights to make it appear?

416
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,660
A gobo

417
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,660
A gobo, a big gobo that just says emerge

418
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,660
Emerge

419
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,660
20 coming through

420
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,660
That's powerful as shit

421
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,660
20 coming through, emerge, I really like it

422
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,660
That's really doing me right

423
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:46,660
This is the episode, by the way, most of the episodes we record in a given year

424
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:53,660
The one where my let's not accidentally make a cult radar is up

425
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,660
Oh, you don't want to

426
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:01,660
I did just imagine a crowd full of people, this is by the way after we whipped this COVID shit

427
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,660
Just in an auditorium and the three of us

428
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,660
For some reason we're dressed in all white and our shoes don't match

429
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,660
And there's a big sign behind us that says emerge

430
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,660
As people chant against my rules, everybody's chanting emerge

431
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,660
Everybody's going 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

432
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:26,660
To the outside observer, we have made a cult for sure at that point

433
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,660
For sure, for sure, for sure

434
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:34,660
I also want to take a moment to celebrate us because in making this procedure public

435
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,660
We open ourselves up to, I mean literally every year

436
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:45,660
Multiple people telling us they wish we had done one of the other things that we talked about

437
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,660
And sometimes even suggesting other things we didn't say

438
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:56,660
This is interesting, in previous years we have opened it up to suggestions

439
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,660
And this is just us this time

440
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,660
I did not consult the crowd

441
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,660
Oh, you didn't need to

442
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,660
Plenty of people emailed them in and tweeted them

443
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:10,660
I would say also in our defense we have never gone with the audience suggestion for this

444
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,660
Because that's a little too important a decision I would say

445
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,660
It could be trademark

446
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,660
Yeah, that's a big thing too

447
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,660
Otherwise you're not going to get classics like this

448
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,660
Yeah, like 20 runny goo

449
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,660
No, no, I was leaning into a real great slide

450
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,660
You're not going to get classics like this

451
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,660
20 sun tee view

452
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,660
Porch life

453
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,660
20 sun tee view

454
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,660
You're holding the sun tee, right?

455
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,660
And this is your view from the porch

456
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,660
And you've got a sun tee view, porch life

457
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,660
Now I think the one problem with that, Justin, is I don't know

458
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:54,660
I don't think any human being has ever said, look at this sun tee view

459
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:00,660
What is sun tee? I don't drink tea, what is sun tee?

460
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,660
Sun tee is where you just make slow tea in the sun

461
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,660
You let the sun heat up your gross water

462
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,660
So it's not a thing then, right?

463
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,660
No, it's a thing, what do you mean it's not a thing?

464
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,660
Sun tee?

465
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,660
Yes, everybody's googling this

466
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,660
You put multiple tea bags in a picture and you put it in the sun

467
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,660
Oh, you're right, you're right

468
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,660
You put it in the sun

469
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,660
Okay, sorry

470
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,660
Did you just Google it?

471
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,660
Yeah, I Googled it, I'm sorry

472
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,660
Where's the trust, you know?

473
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,660
Is there something with kazoo?

474
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,660
No

475
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,660
Banjo kazoo

476
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,660
Banjo 20 kazoo

477
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,660
That was a really good banjo kazoo

478
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,660
20 Scooby Doo

479
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,660
No

480
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:49,660
All right, is it the time in the episode where we take a step away and say

481
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,660
What do we want to embody?

482
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,660
Well, have we put up all our suggestions?

483
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:03,660
No, no, no, no, I think this will help spread a little fertilizer around on the feet

484
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:13,660
It is important to me, kidding aside, it is important to me that it be somewhat either motivational or aspirational

485
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,660
In a way that gets you pumped for this year

486
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,660
Because I don't want, everybody, this is one of the years of your life, right?

487
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,660
You don't want to assign it to negativity this early

488
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,660
You will get there for sure, but you got to start fresh

489
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,660
But let me add this, because I agree with you, I do agree with you

490
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:36,660
But is there a way that we can embody, because in the past I feel like we've embodied like a naive kind of hope

491
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:44,660
Is there a way now that we're doing like a, this is a mature, this is a, it's still there, right?

492
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,660
This is hope for sure, but this is a cautious, powerful hope, you know what I mean?

493
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,660
Yeah, that's interesting, Travis, because I would say a weakness of

494
00:23:53,660 --> 00:24:01,660
Skipping 2020, which I think we can all agree, that year's motto, both of them were complete fuck ups

495
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:07,660
2019 and 2021, we have become the monster and big dog run

496
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:13,660
Like those are both very strong, but it was also like, get the most powerful and aggro

497
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,660
And that like, I don't necessarily think that's us

498
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:21,660
There are very few times in my life where I'm like, let's become the monster, baby

499
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:28,660
Because I'm, we are, we are, we are meeker than that, I would say

500
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,660
Two thirds of us definitely are

501
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,660
Yeah, so instead of it being like, let's go baby

502
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:39,660
Have it be like, maybe don't be so timid

503
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:44,660
Maybe don't be as timid as you usually are and take a shot, you know?

504
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,660
Like, not like, get it and win the game, but like, get in the game

505
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,660
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah

506
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,660
20 something new

507
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,660
20 something new

508
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,660
It's just not, it's not very clever

509
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,660
It's not specific, there's not enough specificity to it

510
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,660
Let me hit you guys with this

511
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,660
Yeah

512
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,660
Because I've been saving it, this isn't my last one

513
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,660
Oh fuck

514
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:14,660
When it came to me, I was like, oh, mama, like that

515
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:20,660
This is so exciting because this could either be the moment where Justin says the thing that like

516
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,660
Well, I have one more, Justin, do you want me to do?

517
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,660
Please do yours

518
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,660
Okay, 20 looky-loo on the horizon

519
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:32,660
I don't like the phonetics of looky-loo makes me feel bad

520
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,660
Okay, okay

521
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,660
I don't like saying it

522
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,660
That means something

523
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,660
Yeah

524
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,660
Did you guys watch that Beatles documentary?

525
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,660
Because it's dope, because they'd just be like noodling, like Scooby-Doo-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop

526
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,660
Hey, is this anything?

527
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,660
Scooby-Doo-bop-bop-bop

528
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,660
No, that's not anything

529
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,660
What about this?

530
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,660
Get back to where you once

531
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,660
And it's like, oh fuck, you guys just wrote get back

532
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,660
That's the moment we're at right now when Justin's about to say the thing that's like his get back

533
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
Okay

534
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,660
20 mummy crew back from the dead

535
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,660
Huh

536
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,660
20 mummy crew

537
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,660
What this is about is two things

538
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,660
Okay

539
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,660
One, back from the dead

540
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,660
Yes

541
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,660
Okay

542
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,660
Yeah

543
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,660
Well

544
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,660
Fair, right?

545
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,660
We've been ground down to a paste

546
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,660
Yeah

547
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,660
But it's also about, so it's about coming back from that

548
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,660
Yeah

549
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,660
But it's also about community

550
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,660
Oh

551
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:28,660
Because you look at anybody else that's with you, they're a mummy too

552
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,660
You're in the mummy crew

553
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,660
What about 20 mummy too?

554
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,660
20 mummy crew back from the dead

555
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:42,660
The idea of mummy crew, obviously Justin, is one of the best things you've ever sort of generated

556
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,660
Yes, correct

557
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,660
One of the best pieces of content you've ever created

558
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,660
It's up there with your two children who I love very much

559
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,660
20 mummy crew

560
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:56,660
The idea of us, instead of calling our audience Mbimbambinos or, you know, Mbimbambnation

561
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:01,660
The idea of them just being the mummy crew is so fucking strong

562
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,660
I tell you, I don't like having the word dead in the motto

563
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,660
Because that feels a little bit

564
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,660
We're back from the dead

565
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,660
Yeah

566
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,660
Right

567
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,660
Not why, but I do think that there's something, maybe it's 20 mummy crew, rise again

568
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,660
Or 20 mummy crew, straight out the tomb

569
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,660
Is that better?

570
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,660
Better than dead

571
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,660
20 mummy crew, arise my love

572
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,660
Hmm

573
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,660
That's interesting

574
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,660
Something for the Baptists

575
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,660
Something for the Baptists

576
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,660
20 mummy crew

577
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,660
Sarcophagit it

578
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,660
Ooh

579
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,660
Sarcophagit it

580
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,660
Ooh

581
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,660
If we hadn't already done getting it, I would

582
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,660
Yeah

583
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:48,660
I do love, by the way, the juxtaposition of me saying maybe tone it down to a more reasonable, let's not be so timid thing

584
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:54,660
And then Justin was like, alley-oop, 20 mummy crew, rise from the dead, back from the dead

585
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,660
It feels, also Juice, can I tell you a genuine concern of mine

586
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,660
And this is something I had a few ideas that I immediately shot down in my head

587
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:09,660
It feels a little bit like the Post Malone Jägermeister commercial

588
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:15,660
Where he's back at the bar and it's empty and the bartender's like, it's empty because of COVID

589
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,660
But then he's like, dummy, we're better now

590
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,660
And he walks out in the street with a bottle of Jägermeister and then the place is packed

591
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,660
And he's like, we worked hard for this, let's celebrate

592
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:29,660
And then it's like, a month later, it's like, uh-oh, I'm gonna cry

593
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,660
No, don't

594
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:35,660
I worry about it being like, 20, rise from the dead, baby, it's back

595
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:41,660
Go buy a Toyota truck, Toyota Nation, because we are here and we've waited long enough

596
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,660
Okay, okay, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

597
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,660
Along those lines, 20 mummy crew, lying in wait

598
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,660
No

599
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,660
Right, because the mummy's there

600
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,660
Way too passive, way too passive

601
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,660
Way too passive

602
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:57,660
I want something that says, we're not doing it now, but we, ooh, moments notice, you know what I mean?

603
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:02,660
If you want that, then get 20 yummy stews, something's cooking

604
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,660
Mmm, can we do 20 mummy crew, something's cooking

605
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,660
20 mummy stew

606
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,660
20 mummy

607
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,660
I'll be, can I be honest?

608
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,660
I feel like, of the things that we have

609
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,660
I feel like, I love the tagline, put it in the pot, a lot

610
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,660
I like the concept of mummies though

611
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:28,660
It is equivalent in my mind to like, don't hide your light under a bushel

612
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,660
Put it out there and let it become better

613
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:37,660
By becoming more fragrant and mixing around with the other stuff

614
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:43,660
To me that, and maybe we're getting, maybe that's trending a little too close to collaboratine

615
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:48,660
But even put it in the pot feels a little bit more achievable than go find a collaborator

616
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,660
So 20 mummy stew, 20 mummy stew put it in the pot?

617
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,660
20 mummy crew, together we rise

618
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:01,660
That feels, again, we're getting close to like a presidential campaign

619
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,660
Well

620
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,660
For mummies

621
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,660
I have been waiting to announce

622
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:10,660
20 mummy crew pyramid dreams, is that anything?

623
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,660
Ooh

624
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:20,660
Now we're getting into cult territory again, I feel like if we start leaning into pyramids, like symbology and shit

625
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,660
20 mummy crew

626
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,660
Under wraps

627
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,660
No

628
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,660
20 mummy crew

629
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,660
No

630
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,660
Wrap it up, it's about safe sex

631
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,660
That could be fun

632
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,660
I think if you don't, here's what I would say, if you don't have something about resurrection in there

633
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,660
Then, mummy crew stew

634
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,660
20 mummy crew

635
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,660
Sounds very strange

636
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,660
Yeah, I guess so

637
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,660
Mmm

638
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,660
Um

639
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,660
20, oh shit

640
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,660
What if, guys

641
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,660
What if we get really, really focused

642
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,660
Okay

643
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,660
On

644
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,660
Bringing back

645
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,660
Brendan Fraser's The Mummy series

646
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,660
And so 20 mummy crew

647
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,660
Is us

648
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,660
Really pounding the pavement

649
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:18,660
To get Brendan Fraser's The Mummy 4

650
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,660
Yeah

651
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,660
Yeah, it would be the fourth mummy

652
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,660
Off the ground

653
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,660
But you have to not count the Tom Cruise mummy

654
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,660
No, of course not

655
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,660
Of course I don't count the fucking Tom Cruise mummy

656
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,660
And we're bringing back Rachel Weisz, I don't care

657
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,660
Rachel Weisz

658
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,660
Rachel Weisz

659
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:42,660
Now Justin, you say it's unattainable, but I would argue that it is more attainable than us all becoming big dogs

660
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,660
I think if Brendan Fraser

661
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,660
I think if Rachel Weisz hears a knock at the door

662
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,660
And she opens it and Brendan Fraser's standing there

663
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,660
Yeah

664
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,660
She puts on her coat

665
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,660
And walks outside and follows him, no, like, no words exchanged

666
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,660
Just like, yes

667
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,660
Correct

668
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,660
Yep

669
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,660
It's time

670
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,660
I don't, I don't, I don't want to do this

671
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,660
You don't want to bring back

672
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,660
No, I don't want to bring back

673
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,660
This is going to be the one

674
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,660
Brendan's doing a lot of great work in a lot of different fields

675
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,660
Yeah

676
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,660
So, so good

677
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,660
I don't want to disrupt him

678
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,660
In Doom Squad

679
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,660
Now here's the thing, Justin

680
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,660
I want you to just brace yourself that this is going to be the one that everyone is going to be like

681
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,660
I can't believe you guys didn't commit to bringing back The Mummy

682
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,660
The original series

683
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,660
I don't think so, because most people, we are

684
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,660
The funny thing about that is we are

685
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,660
A hundred million light years from having the juice to get that done, a hundred percent

686
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,660
It's not even close

687
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:39,660
And most of our listeners are probably even more unable to bring back The Mummy

688
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
I think everybody working together

689
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,660
And you know what the other problem with that is?

690
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,660
Even if we do it, it doesn't benefit us enough

691
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,660
Okay, first of all, Justin

692
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,660
I've watched The Mummy

693
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:55,660
All you got to do to bring back The Mummy is like disrupt The Tomb or some shit, right?

694
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,660
And then the movie, mostly The Mummy brings itself back

695
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:03,660
What about, okay, 20 Mummy Crew, a Nox and a Moon

696
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,660
What do you think?

697
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,660
Is that anything?

698
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,660
Is that like a spell?

699
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,660
No, that was the name of the woman

700
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,660
It could be badass to have a spell in our year slogan

701
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,660
That like makes a magical thing happen

702
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,660
You know, Travis, you just said

703
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,660
20, 20, 20 viewers skew!

704
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,660
Let's meet Kevin Smith

705
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,660
That's attainable

706
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,660
That's fun

707
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:30,660
I feel like Travis said something not realizing the power inside of his incantation

708
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,660
And that was disrupt The Tomb

709
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,660
20 Mummy Crew disrupt The Tomb

710
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:46,660
The idea of like, of taking these sacred, you know, idols

711
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,660
Shaking them up a little bit

712
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,660
Disrupt The Tomb

713
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,660
Let's try something

714
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,660
Now there is a lot of colonialism associated with that

715
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,660
There is a huge, there's a huge

716
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:02,660
It's unthinkable, unthinkable that you would even suggest it

717
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,660
Wait, we're canceled mid podcast, we haven't even published

718
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,660
No, it's NBC guys, they canceled us again

719
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,660
Whoop

720
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,660
Whoop

721
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,660
Alright, don't disrupt The Tomb, fuck

722
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,660
20 Mummy Crew

723
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,660
20 viewers skew

724
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,660
Buried with cats

725
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,660
Buried with cats

726
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,660
20 running

727
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:29,660
Running is something, running is a word that could potentially go in there

728
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,660
I mean 20 running crew

729
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,660
That's nothing Travis

730
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,660
20 running shoo

731
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,660
20 running goo

732
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,660
20 running shoo?

733
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,660
Guys, you guys feel like we're in the weeds right now?

734
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,660
This is where I feel like our power lies

735
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,660
Is deep in the trash heat

736
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,660
When we just start saying

737
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,660
20 cunning shrew

738
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,660
What?

739
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,660
Like a cunning shrew

740
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,660
It's okay Justin, this is part of the process

741
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,660
This is how we get to Big Dog Run, you know what I mean?

742
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,660
Wait, what about 20 Mummy Crew emerge?

743
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,660
Emerge

744
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,660
Escape the grave

745
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,660
20 Mummy Crew, shame the grave

746
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,660
Shame the grave

747
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:14,660
It would be dumb if we just had a year of unabashed hedonism

748
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:19,660
20 Mummy Crew, death is only the beginning

749
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,660
Oh man

750
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,660
Maybe we should go to the money zone just as like a palette cleanser

751
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,660
And when we come back have sort of fresh eyes

752
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,660
And then we'll read through them again

753
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,660
This will be the whole, okay great

754
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,660
Great, actually, that's actually a great idea

755
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,660
Yeah

756
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,660
Cause I'm looking at this list guys

757
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,660
And it's maybe our worst list ever

758
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,660
But I think maybe we're just too close to it

759
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:51,660
I think we're way too close to it

760
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,660
It's better with you

761
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,660
It's better with you

762
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,660
Bombus

763
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,660
Boom

764
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,660
Watch your language

765
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,660
It's right there, Bombus

766
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
The mission is simple

767
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,660
Make the most comfortable clothes ever

768
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,660
And match every item sold

769
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,660
So when you buy Bombus

770
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,660
You are also giving to someone who's in need

771
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,660
You guys, I'm wearing Bombus socks right now

772
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,660
Whoa, me too

773
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,660
What?

774
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,660
Yep, you can tell cause of how comfortable I am

775
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,660
I'm not wearing socks cause I stepped in something wet earlier

776
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,660
And had to take the wet sock off

777
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,660
Oh man, that's the worst

778
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,660
Did you know what the wetness was Griffin?

779
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,660
Or was it mystery wet?

780
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,660
Rarely do I know what the wetness was

781
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,660
Oh, that's the thing man

782
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,660
I got two dogs and a potty training toddler

783
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,660
It could be anything

784
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,660
Okay, they also make shirts and underwear

785
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,660
And oh my god

786
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,660
These are incredible

787
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,660
It's my favorite shirt

788
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,660
My favorite t-shirt

789
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,660
It's made by Bombus

790
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,660
I said it

791
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,660
Everything they make is soft, seamless, tagless

792
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,660
And with a luxury, cozy feel

793
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,660
And they're made from stuff like marino wool

794
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,660
And pima cotton

795
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,660
And even cashmere

796
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,660
Which all sound so fancy

797
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,660
And make you feel fancy

798
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,660

Oh yeah?

805
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,660
Hey gamers, level up those clothes

806
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,660
Hey gamers, it's time to level up your fashion

807
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,660
A lot of people think that we might get to leave our houses this year

808
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,660
It's impossible to say

809
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,660
But you want to be ready

810
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,660
When we're allowed to leave our houses

811
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,660
There's going to be a rush in the clothing stores like you wouldn't believe

812
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,660
But you could have your fashion already ready to go with the power of SitFix

813
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,660
It could be already ready already?

Yes, you could shop at a store that just caters to you

816

Oh Justin, I'm too far into rhyming

822
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,660
Oh no

823
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,660
No, no, no

824
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,660

stitchfix.com slash my brother

841
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,660
You're in a theater

842
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,660
The lights go down

843
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,660
You're about to get swept up by the characters

844
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,660
And all their little details and interpersonal dramas

845
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,660
You look at them and think

846
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,660
That person is so obviously in love with their best friend

847
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,660
Wait, am I in love with my best friend?

848
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,660
That character's mom is so overbearing

849
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,660
Why doesn't she just stand up to her?

850
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,660
Oh God, do I need to stand up to my own mother?

851
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,660

Nine years ago, we started a podcast to try and learn something new every episode

860
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,660
Things have gone a little off the rails since then

861
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,660
Tune in to hear about

862
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,660
Low stakes neighborhood drama

Addiction to TV and sweaty takes on celebrity culture

867

And the weirdest, grossest stuff you can find on wikipedia.org

868
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,660
We'll read all of it, no matter how gross

869
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,660
There's something for everyone on our podcast, Baby Geniuses

00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,660
Hang out with us as we try and fail to retain any knowledge at all

872
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,660
Every other week on Maximum Fun

873
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,660
Baby Geniuses, tell us something we don't know

874
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,660
Is there a new one on the list?

875
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,660
Yeah, there's just this new one right here

876
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,660
Someone put that on there

877
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,660
What's it say, Griffin?

878
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,660
22 the Dew brought to you by Mountain Dew by Hot Blast

879
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:27,660
You know, it's funny you say that

880
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:32,660
I was actually thinking, I wish we would sell the rights

881
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,660
Like the branding rights, you know what I mean, to this thing

882
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,660
Oh, that's fun

883
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,660
I wish we did that

884
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,660
Well, this is a cold shot kind of selling it

885
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,660
Where we would name it that

886
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:48,660
And then get retroactively reimbursed for it

887
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,660
Yeah, and it would need to be a brand

888
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,660
It couldn't be like 20 Long John Silvers

889
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,660
No

890
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,660
Enjoy our crispy fish

891
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:59,660
Okay, just to sort of expand our mind a little bit

892
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,660
I am on rhyme zone looking at three syllable rhymes with ew

893
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,660
I did that as well, yes

894
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,660
Okay, so there's some stuff in here

895
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:13,660
Just like 20 BBQ, 20 Black and Blue, 20 Brunswick Stew

896
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,660
20 Brunswick Stew, that means even less than some of the ones we already had

897
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,660
I have two, can I throw out two that I thought of just as more thought starters?

898
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,660
Yeah, sure, sure

899
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,660
20 Cordon Bleu, Cookin' Fancy

900
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,660
Okay

901
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,660
And 20 something blue, Tie the Knot

902
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,660
This is interesting, we're getting even farther

903
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,660
That's fine, Juice, we have to get perspective, you know?

904
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,660
God is watching us from a distance, 20 Deja Vu

905
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,660
20 Broader View

906
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,660
20 Point of View

907
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,660
20 Point of View

908
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,660
Is nothing

909
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,660
Meaningless

910
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,660
Meaningless

911
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:56,660
Now, 20 Deja Vu, one more again, is not bad

912
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:02,660
Let me, I had a thought while I was recording the podcast

913
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,660
Yeah, sure

914
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,660
2020 Dew, Second Chances

915
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,660
Huh, here's what it is

916
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,660
2020, we messed up pretty bad

917
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,660
As a species, we whiffed it

918
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,660
It was going to be cool too, like that number was really a cool number

919
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,660
Yeah

920
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:25,660
But 2020 Dew, what that suggests is, let's try again

921
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,660
Let's try again

922
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:31,660
You can do 2020 again, but better, Second Chances, 2020 Dew

923
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,660
Okay

924
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,660
20 Debar Dew

925
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,660
It's also kind of continental too

926
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,660
Yeah, sure

927
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,660
You know what I mean? Kind of fancy

928
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:44,660
Yeah, because what it is that you are saying is, to translate, just for our friends who don't speak French, is 2022

929
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,660
Yeah

930
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,660
Right

931
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,660
It's also, Justin, if I may, would be the laziest one

932
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,660
You may, you may, you may

933
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:54,660
It's the laziest one we could have possibly done

934
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:58,660
No, actually 2022 would have been lazier, and that was my initial thought

935
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,660
But I kind of do like 2022 as a name

936
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,660
Like TOO?

937
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,660
No

938
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,660
No?

939
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,660
TWO, the number

940
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,660
Huh

941
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,660
That's cool, I like that

942
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,660
Is it?

943
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,660
Let's do it again, let's try it better

944
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,660
2022, a year of sequels

945
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:19,660
20 Pikaboo, here we are

946
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,660
20 Pikachu

947
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,660
20 Pikachu

948
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,660
20 Pikachu, electric mouth

949
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,660
20 electric boogaloo

950
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,660
20 Pikachu, don't evolve

951
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,660
Oh

952
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,660
That's kind of a fun

953
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,660
20 Rendezvous, good evening

954
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,660
Oh

955
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,660
Oh

956
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:48,660
This is a phase that I think we go in where we see how hard we can whiff

957
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:53,660
20, no I'm sorry, 20 Rendezvous, good evening, it's very good

958
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,660
20 Rendezvous, hello there

959
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,660
20 Rendezvous, on the veranda

960
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:05,660
20 Rendezvous, I see you there

961
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,660
20 Rendezvous, to the veranda

962
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,660
To the veranda

963
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:14,660
20 Rendezvous, a nighttime affair

964
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:20,660
20 Rendezvous, a night to remember, and we just do it like a senior prom

965
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,660
All you need to do is have one good night

966
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,660
Just one good night

967
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,660
Just have one good night

968
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:33,660
Then at all of our live shows we'll set up a photo, like set up a prom photo booth

969
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,660
And we will have all teams a night to remember

970
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:42,660
Guys, I'm kind of hooked on 20 Rendezvous, a night to remember

971
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,660
I think it's very close

972
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,660
I think a night to remember is a little

973
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,660
I think it's hitting like a walk to remember, maybe it's just 20 Rendezvous, a walk to remember

974
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,660
A walk to remember

975
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:08,660
No, Rendezvous, I like the class the night to remember brings, it also sounds like we're picking a prom theme

976
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,660
Which is very fucking to me

977
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,660
Enchantment in the evening

978
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,660
20 Rendezvous

979
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,660
Enchanté

980
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,660
20

981
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:17,660
Too hard to spell

982
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:18,660
So is Rendezvous

983
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,660
Yeah, we need to talk about that for a second

984
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,660
Do we just want to expect people to learn

985
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,660
How to spell Rendezvous

986
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,660
How to spell Rendezvous, okay, nobody look

987
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,660
Travis

988
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,660
Griffin, spell Rendezvous

989
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,660
R-E-N-D-E-V-O-U-Z

990
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,660
Incorrect

991
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:38,660
Say it again

992
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:45,660
R-E-N-D-E-V-O

993
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,660
Griffin

994
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:55,660
R, I know Travis got the first five letters right, R-E-N-D-E-Z

995
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,660
That seems like a weird pick

996
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,660
You sure you want to go with Z

997
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:07,660
R-E-N-D-E-S-V-O-U-Z

998
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,660
It's R-E-N-D-E-Z-V-O-U-S

999
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,660
Oh, so I was right and you were

1000
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,660
Yeah, but if you could be shaken from it, you didn't know

1001
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,660
Yeah, you didn't have it

1002
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,660
You were guessing

1003
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,660
That is tricky, I do feel like it robs it of a little bit of

1004
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:26,660
But maybe this would be something that we could concretely take away from it

1005
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,660
Is that everybody would learn how to spell one word

1006
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,660
That is true, that is an actual thing

1007
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,660
I'm working on spelling restaurant right the first time every time

1008
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:40,660
And so having that like, this is not only a good, obviously great motto

1009
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,660
But also a powerful learning experience

1010
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:49,660
Okay, earlier in this very episode you did say that you wanted it to be motivational or aspirational

1011
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:50,660
This is

1012
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:56,660
What does 20 rendezvous, a night to remember mean

1013
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:00,660
It's like saying, hey, make the most of it, grab this opportunity, this is a night to remember

1014
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,660
What if it's during the day though

1015
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:08,660
We could even make it more specific, which is like out of 365 chances

1016
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,660
Have like one night to remember

1017
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,660
That doesn't feel strong enough

1018
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,660
I feel like 20 rendezvous is good

1019
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,660
I feel like a night to remember could be stronger

1020
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,660
I am shaken by the spelling

1021
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,660
Okay, alright

1022
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:27,660
I'm a little bit shaken by the spelling thing, it robs it of some of its power to me

1023
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,660
Now we could, let me just, one more thing

1024
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:35,660
Just if we wanted to do perhaps our biggest cold shot ever in 13 years

1025
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,660
Fuck

1026
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:40,660
20 rendezvous, meeting in person

1027
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,660
That's cool, yeah there's nothing wrong with that right now

1028
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,660
Yeah, loaded, a little bit loaded

1029
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,660
How about this

1030
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,660
20 Jenny Sue, you get on out to that corn patch and feed them piggies

1031
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,660
Now, okay

1032
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:56,660
So once again, just cause, 20 Jenny Sue

1033
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:59,660
You get on out to that corn patch and feed them piggies

1034
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:00,660
Yeah

1035
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,660
20 Peggy Sue

1036
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,660
20 Jenny Sue, cause it rhymes with 20

1037
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,660
No I get that

1038
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:10,660
20 Jenny Sue, get on out to that corn patch and feed them piggies

1039
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:13,660
20 Peggy Sue, ooey oo, I look just like Buddy Holly

1040
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:18,660
Maybe, 20 ooey ooey ooey

1041
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,660
Does 20

1042
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,660
Wait, is that it? Wait, wait, wait, was that it?

1043
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,660
Ooey ooey ooey

1044
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,660
20 ooey ooey ooey

1045
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:28,660
20 ooey ooey ooey, that's a spicy one

1046
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,660
20 ooey ooey ooey, yummo

1047
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,660
20 ooey ooey ooey, a spicy one

1048
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:35,660
Oh, 20 ooey ooey ooey ooey, doo wop's back

1049
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:38,660
Uh, 20 switcheroo

1050
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,660
20 switcheroo, 20 switcheroo

1051
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:46,660
Ah, no, that doesn't, that doesn't, that doesn't, that doesn't, that provides no direction

1052
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:50,660
What about 20, 20 tried and true?

1053
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:54,660
20 tried and true reads a little patriotic

1054
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:55,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1055
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,660
20 Dr. Drew, he sucks now

1056
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,660
Oh, okay, so that would be a good way to get to 20

1057
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,660
Yeah, we just, old stuff kicks ass though

1058
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:13,660
20, 20 you should sue, get justice

1059
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:17,660
20 more bamboo, it's sustainable

1060
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:21,660
20 kangaroo, put it in the pouch

1061
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,660
20 kangaroo, jump on it

1062
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,660
20 started-oo

1063
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:30,660
No, that's actually too motivational

1064
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1065
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:36,660
That would be on the front of a planner that I would purchase

1066
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:41,660
20 revenue, maximize your earning potential

1067
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:51,660
What about 20 racing crew, it's about family

1068
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,660
20 more fondue, make it cheesy

1069
00:49:54,660 --> 00:50:01,660
Yeah, now I like that that implies that in previous years we've had some fondue, but this year it's 20 more fondue

1070
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,660
Turn it up

1071
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,660
20 Sudoku

1072
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,660
20 Sudoku

1073
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,660
20 Sudoku, line them up

1074
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:17,660
Can I tell you right now, I feel like we're never gonna find it, even if we find it we won't know it, and it's the worst episode we've ever made

1075
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,660
Yeah, this is our lowest again

1076
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:26,660
And this is, I feel the electricity right now because I believe you said that exact same thing last year right before we came up with 20 Big Dog Run

1077
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:29,660
Oh, oh, oh, okay

1078
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:36,660
20 Pay Per View, all of our episodes cost $1

1079
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:44,660
What if we did one just for us this year, it was like we've given you guys 11 good years

1080
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:50,660
This one's called 20 Pay Per View, and all our episodes cost $1 now, you have to put it into your phone

1081
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,660
What about 20 Miss Construe, say that again

1082
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,660
What was that?

1083
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:58,660
What was that?

1084
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,660
More for me and you

1085
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,660
No, 20 Miss Construe

1086
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,660
20 just for you

1087
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,660
20 just for you

1088
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,660
I feel like there's a lot of people in America that are already living that life

1089
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:11,660
Yeah, that's fair

1090
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,660
Yeah, yeah

1091
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,660
20 not for you

1092
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,660
20 New Tattoo

1093
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:21,660
Ooh, I, okay, okay, okay, let's, let's

1094
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,660
Let's take a breath

1095
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,660
Let's take a breath

1096
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,660
Now, 20 Big Dog Run, great

1097
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:36,660
Frankenstein Teen was the entire thing, is there something funny bamboo, funny big bamboo, funny

1098
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:46,660
20 monies through, time, crypto, time to become a crypto lord

1099
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,660
20 Santee View

1100
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:54,660
Oh yeah, now we're getting somewhere

1101
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,660
I got it

1102
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:56,660
Oh boy

1103
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:57,660
I got it

1104
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,660
Oh shit

1105
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,660
20 Rise of Groot

1106
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:06,660
Get back to where you once belonged, get back

1107
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,660
Coming this July

1108
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,660
Coming this July

1109
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:22,660
After many delays, we will finally be treated to it

1110
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:25,660
Despicable Me 4, The Rise of Groot

1111
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,660
It's Minions, The Rise of Groot

1112
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,660
Oh, okay

1113
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:29,660
Nice

1114
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:34,660
It used to be called Minions 2, and now it's called Minions Rise of Groot

1115
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,660
That's better

1116
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:44,660
20 Rise of Groot

1117
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,660
20 Baby Shoe

1118
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,660
For sale

1119
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,660
Never warned

1120
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,660
Why did you keep naming them?

1121
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:52,660
Oh, sorry

1122
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:57,660
It was, do you know that this movie was supposed to be released on July 3rd, 2020?

1123
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,660
That's why I think it's so powerful

1124
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:08,660
Because by calling the year 20 Rise of Groot, we're saying that this film will absolutely be released in theaters this July

1125
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,660
Yeah

1126
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,660
No bones about it

1127
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:17,660
What about 20 IOU, we will give the next year a much better name

1128
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:23,660
20 IOU, one good year name

1129
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:27,660
20 IOU, one hour of your life

1130
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:31,660
Let's do this, we'll go back through the list real quick

1131
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:36,660
I actually am warming back up to Carl Daniels Kick-Ass Year

1132
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,660
Yeah

1133
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:40,660
Okay, so just taking a look at the list, we got

1134
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:44,660
Carl Daniels Kick-Ass Year

1135
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:50,660
I'm gonna leave it in, I wish the name was funnier than Carl Daniels, but here we are

1136
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:54,660
20 Whoop-de-do, who cares, I still, I can't get on board with that

1137
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,660
20 Yummy Stew, something's cooking

1138
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,660
Or 20 Yummy Stew, put it in the pot

1139
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,660
Put it in the pot

1140
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,660
20 Cummies, ew

1141
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,660
20 Cummies 2

1142
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,660
20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

1143
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:06,660
Yeah

1144
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,660
Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony

1145
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:11,660
20 Venti Brew, oh that Java

1146
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,660
20 Skies of Blue

1147
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,660
20 Coming Through, Emerge

1148
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,660
20 Runny Goo, what?

1149
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,660
20 Runny Goo

1150
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,660
20 Runny Goo, 20 Sun TV, Porch Life

1151
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,660
20 Mummy Crew

1152
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,660
20 Do The Do, brought to you by Mountain Dew Baja Blast

1153
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,660
And then Griffin kind of abandoned his posts

1154
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:31,660
Cause I feel like 20 Rendezvous, still merits consideration

1155
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,660
20 Rise of Gru

1156
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,660
20

1157
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:40,660
I feel in my heart, my heart's telling me

1158
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,660
This can't be fun to listen to

1159
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,660
That Mummy Crew is

1160
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:47,660
See, I'm still on, I'm still stuck on Yummy Stew

1161
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,660
I like the

1162
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,660
I'm telling you guys, 20 Mummy Stew

1163
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,660
20 Mummy Stew

1164
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,660
20 Mummy Stew, do what thou wilt

1165
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,660
Wait a minute, no this is powerful

1166
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,660
Is there a motto that we can do

1167
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,660
That is like, you guys have, you all have

1168
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,660
Flown, flown away from our nest

1169
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:10,660
Like you don't need us in

1170
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:13,660
Oh, 20 up to you, the power is yours

1171
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,660
20 up to you, 20

1172
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,660
Oh man, hold, oh you're so close

1173
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,660
20, 20 up to you

1174
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,660
20 it's in you, the magic's been in you all along

1175
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:28,660
The magic, 20 it's in you, the magic is

1176
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,660
The magic comma specifically

1177
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,660
20 up to you, what are your ideas

1178
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,660
20 up to you, fill in the blank

1179
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:43,660
No, see that's like, that's like you're no better off having heard it

1180
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:46,660
You know, like you're exactly where you started

1181
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,660
That's like coming to the oracle and the oracle's like

1182
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,660
I don't fucking, I don't play Madden, get out of here

1183
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,660
What do you think is gonna happen

1184
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,660
What do you think, I don't know

1185
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,660
Can't see the future, what am I

1186
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:58,660
20 Mummy Stew, people used to eat mummies

1187
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:03,660
Is there something, is there something instead of stew

1188
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,660
Can we swap brew in there

1189
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,660
And is there a word that's like

1190
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,660
I'm imagining a bubbling pot

1191
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:13,660
And people putting their stuff in the pot

1192
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,660
And not being afraid to put stuff in the pot, like they're gonna ruin it

1193
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:21,660
And then you get out of that, you get like a soup or a potion

1194
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,660
I don't even know what you're asking

1195
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:24,660
Like a witches brew

1196
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:25,660
What are you suggesting

1197
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,660
Is there another word

1198
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,660
Is there another

1199
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,660
Yummy mummy stew, yummy mummy brew

1200
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,660
Yummy mummy stew

1201
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:34,660
Yummy mummy

1202
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:37,660
Yummy mummy brew

1203
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:41,660
From Budweiser

1204
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,660
Yummy mummy is a trademark

1205
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,660
So we can't, that's owned by the General Mills Corporation

1206
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:49,660
Dammit, cause that was gonna be it too, shit

1207
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,660
Yes

1208
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,660
Yes Griffin

1209
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,660
20 new shampoo

1210
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:04,660
20 new shampoo, gotta try something

1211
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,660
How about this, 20 new shampoo, gotta try something

1212
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:07,660
Something's gotta change

1213
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,660
The stakes, the stakes

1214
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,660
20 new shampoo, something's gotta give

1215
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:12,660
The stakes are low

1216
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,660
20 tummy goo

1217
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:18,660
What's that on your, what do you got on your tummy

1218
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,660
The upset tummy crew

1219
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,660
20 old U2, you just listened to Joshua Tree

1220
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:25,660
That's good

1221
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,660
20 no taboo

1222
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,660
Oh Jesus Christ no

1223
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,660
That could be problematic

1224
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,660
20 no taboo

1225
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,660
20 in review

1226
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,660
It's the 20 that sucks isn't it

1227
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,660
This decade's gonna suck to me

1228
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,660
This millennium is gonna suck

1229
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:44,660
This millennium, I'm gonna say 20, I want 30

1230
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,660
Can you imagine if we were in the 30s

1231
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,660
We could do like

1232
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:48,660
Oh you could do like dirty

1233
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,660
Dirty everything

1234
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:50,660
Flirty

1235
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:53,660
We gotta make it to at least the, we got dirty, flirty

1236
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:54,660
Shirty

1237
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:55,660
Squirty

1238
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:56,660
Squirty

1239
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:57,660
Squirty tummy goo

1240
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:58,660
I would give you that

1241
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,660
Are we skipping

1242
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,660
Squirty tummy goo

1243
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,660
2023, off the rails

1244
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,660
2023, take a pass

1245
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,660
2023, looking forward

1246
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:17,660
Can we go back to 20, 20, 20, 22, 22 deuces wild

1247
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,660
What if we just called this year the deuce

1248
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,660
Oh the double deuce

1249
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,660
2022, ballet time

1250
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:28,660
Let's see, let's get abstract

1251
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,660
We have been recording for so long

1252
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:31,660
Yeah

1253
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,660
Okay

1254
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:35,660
M-M-X-X-I-I

1255
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:36,660
Mix it up

1256
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:39,660
Is there

1257
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,660
20 bigly chew

1258
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,660
I feel like that's where we were

1259
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,660
Wait

1260
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:46,660
20

1261
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,660
Bigly chew

1262
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,660
20 breaking through

1263
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,660
Emerge

1264
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:56,660
But that doesn't feel, I can't get excited about that

1265
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:00,660
Not as much as 20 kangaroo put it in the pouch

1266
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,660
And we could do a mascot with that one

1267
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:09,660
We could have like a mascot that's a kangaroo

1268
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:12,660
We could call him Jack, but not that kangaroo Jack

1269
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,660
No, a different one

1270
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,660
20 talking to, sit down

1271
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:17,660
You're fucked up

1272
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:21,660
Sit down

1273
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,660
We need to have a talk

1274
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,660
Look he's talking to

1275
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,660
Meme

1276
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,660
Okay, we could just do this forever

1277
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:34,660
You know what I'm saying?

1278
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,660
Like we were very close with 20

1279
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,660
I feel like 20 rendezvous, a night to remember

1280
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,660
Is the most powerful one that I have experienced

1281
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,660
That is the one that got the biggest reaction from me

1282
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:46,660
That one gave me the chill bumps

1283
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,660
What's it mean though?

1284
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,660
I told you Griffin

1285
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,660
No, you didn't

1286
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,660
It's a night to remember

1287
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:55,660
Make the most of it

1288
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:57,660
What's it mean though?

1289
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,660
It means that when a slow dance comes on

1290
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,660
Get close

1291
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:06,660
20 rendezvous certainly hits the lips good

1292
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:10,660
A night to remember isn't any, it doesn't mean anything

1293
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:15,660
Can we take 20 rendezvous and make it more like secret spy kind of feeling

1294
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:19,660
But it's like if we do shows this year

1295
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:23,660
Then 20 rendezvous and night to remember will be very powerful

1296
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,660
Well that is a good point

1297
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:29,660
But what about 20 rendezvous trading secrets?

1298
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,660
What? No

1299
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:32,660
No

1300
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:36,660
20 rendezvous, there's been a murder

1301
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,660
20 mummy crew, wrap it up

1302
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,660
Now I already said that and make it about safe sex

1303
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,660
And we just kind of get right past that

1304
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,660
Yeah, just kind of

1305
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,660
20 rendezvous

1306
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,660
Get organized

1307
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,660
Organize

1308
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,660
Do it

1309
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:53,660
Seize the means

1310
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,660
20 rendezvous, stronger together

1311
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,660
Seize the means of production

1312
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:01,660
20 rendezvous, seize the means of production

1313
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,660
Why would those two ideas have anything to do with each other?

1314
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,660
Well you're rendezvousing

1315
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:09,660
It's like this is the year where everybody unionizes

1316
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:10,660
20 rendezvous

1317
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,660
20 rendezvous, strengthen numbers

1318
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:18,660
20 mummy crew, strengthen numbers

1319
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:21,660
God, now I'm back to liking mummy crew

1320
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:23,660
I know, 20 mummy crew

1321
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,660
The ties that bind

1322
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,660
20 mummy crew

1323
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:30,660
The ties that bind is not like

1324
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:34,660
Not everybody, I want it to be something everybody can do

1325
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,660
Sometimes you make it too hard

1326
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:40,660
It requires collaboration, that was our mistake in 2018

1327
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:44,660
20 mummy crew, weigh your heart

1328
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:48,660
20 busting through, oh yeah

1329
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,660
Oh that's cool

1330
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,660
Oh yeah

1331
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:52,660
Aid

1332
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,660
Cool aid

1333
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:54,660
20 busting through

1334
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,660
Oh yeah

1335
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:58,660
Now that feels dangerously close to

1336
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:01,660
We're hoping to be reimbursed

1337
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,660
20 we've been sued

1338
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,660
By the Kool-Aid Corporation

1339
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:09,660
Okay, right now for me

1340
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:13,660
It is between 20 rendezvous colon something

1341
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:16,660
And 20 mummy crew colon something

1342
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:17,660
20 what's this do?

1343
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:18,660
Mysterious buttons

1344
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:21,660
Now I just listed two options Justin

1345
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,660
And what you did

1346
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:24,660
Say yours again

1347
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,660
20 rendezvous something

1348
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,660
And 20 mummy crew something

1349
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,660
Something

1350
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:34,660
To me if we can find

1351
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,660
It's like the last Tumblr to click in place

1352
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:40,660
Is the thing that goes after them

1353
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:42,660
Not the year name

1354
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:43,660
Right

1355
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:44,660
20 mummy

1356
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,660
Is 20 mummy crew too close to Frankenstein team?

1357
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:49,660
I'm actually fine with that

1358
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:50,660
This is part of

1359
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,660
In the iconography this does worry me

1360
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:53,660
Because we did a lot of monster imagery

1361
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:55,660
We did do a ton of monster imagery

1362
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:56,660
But they didn't say

1363
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,660
They weren't like oh we've already got Boo Berry

1364
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:00,660
Can we do Count Chocula?

1365
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,660
I'm actually liking 20 rendezvous more

1366
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:03,660
Because it's like

1367
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:05,660
It's got like sort of a sexy adult energy

1368
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:06,660
Yes

1369
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,660
We've never really done that before

1370
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:12,660
Fuck it would be funny to just have a prom theme

1371
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:13,660
Thank you

1372
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:15,660
And not have it be aspirational at all

1373
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,660
But just have it be like the vibe of the year

1374
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:19,660
Can we do that?

1375
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:21,660
Can we define the vibe of the year

1376
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,660
And not necessarily the objective?

1377
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:25,660
Sort of like you're saying like a tonal

1378
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:28,660
A tonal motto and not

1379
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:31,660
20 rendezvous a night in paradise

1380
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:32,660
Because here's the thing

1381
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:33,660
When we tell people what to do

1382
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:37,660
One doesn't do anything materially to improve their lives

1383
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:39,660
Or two they don't fucking do it

1384
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,660
Yeah

1385
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:42,660
How many monsters do you think came out of 2019?

1386
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:43,660
Not a lot I would say

1387
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:46,660
But if we say 20 rendezvous a night to remember

1388
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,660
And then somebody

1389
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:52,660
It just has that energy in the ecosystem

1390
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:54,660
That could do something

1391
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,660
I think 20 rendezvous is it

1392
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,660
I think let's jazz it right now

1393
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:01,660
To find the right tagline

1394
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:04,660
Because I just don't think a night to remember is it

1395
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:05,660
Okay

1396
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:07,660
Okay listen

1397

01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:17,660
