1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,940
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,220
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,700
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me and I'm in the rice show for the modular

9
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,700
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis macabre

10
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,260
O'Roy, no

11
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,900
Macabre sounds like it

12
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,740
Yeah, and I'm I'm the I'm Griffin McElroy's bones

13
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:40,320
It's the time where everybody starts changing their names on social media and stuff to be like their spooky like Halloween version their name

14
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,320
And I've never come up with a good one

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,960
Our name is is is difficult to terrorize

16
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:54,800
Yeah, I've really thought about this in a long time and it gets it's it's like trying to pick it in August because it's instantly

17
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,400
Sweaty, it's just as soon as you come up with something. It's

18
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,040
one time at church camp

19
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,200
Someone called me Gryffindor macaroni, and then I realized I would never scare anyone

20
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,080
Yeah, I would never impose. I would never be scary or imposing or

21
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,320
Impressive here. The mirror wasn't what tips you off to that. It was the Gryffindor McElroy moment. No Justin Gryffindor macaroni

22
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,080
That would just want to make you say it again. Yeah, it's Travis McElroy anything. Is that scary?

23
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,360
I don't wanna get some afraid of I'm afraid of being smacked. I don't

24
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,160
I got smacked one time by a friend in middle school because I kept slapping the bottom of his

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,960
Disposable camera to make the flash go off and he was worried

26
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:42,760
I was gonna overexpose the film and he slapped my face and I pointed at him and I said don't ever touch me again

27
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,200
walked out of the locker room where this

28
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,820
Conflict happened and I just want to say Mike if you're listening name the time and place

29
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
motherfucker

30
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,760
Yeah, it's I've been sitting on this one I've been sitting on this one for 23 years

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,760
What else you remember about Mike

32
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,160
Well, he he did show me a pornographic magazine that belonged to his father

33
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:16,120
We were in middle school and I don't I'm not going to give the brand of the magazine free publicity

34
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Safe to say that it was not

35
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,920
the smoothest transition into my sexual awakening that

36
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:31,920
There was possibly there there was other reading material that skipped a common advanced level of pornography there was

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
there was an anatomical

38
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,680
realization that came before the

39
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,680
Erotic one and it made and the two got real confuddled

40
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,560
My 13 year old brain anyway

41
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,880
Like psyche and then it just sort of took wrong turns in the different roads that they weren't supposed to head down

42
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,720
Mike also gave me a heads up that I was being cheated on in college one time

43
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,760
So I think we're square Mike keep keep on keep on going strong. We don't have to fight

44
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,960
What are we doing? What do we do? What Mike? What are we talking about scary stuff Travis?

45
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:17,560
Did you have a comment about scary things like the the beginning of the Halloween season or do you want to officially?

46
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:25,160
Commence it because if you commit this is a problem with commencing Halloween season is that you have commit like that's the Christmas Creek

47
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,320
I think I think and I have a strong stance on this if I

48
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,400
That is shocking to me that I have a strong feeling about this the year part a holiday

49
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,720
Benefits from the addition of decorations on your house, which I believe Halloween does it should start

50
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,900
Earlier than a normal holiday season because the effort it would take to put up decorations

51
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,560
Right should be rewarded with the time of them being viewed and appreciated

52
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,040
So like I don't think you'd say like you can't put up Halloween decorations until like two weeks before that's too short

53
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,560
I think a window of time of two months prior

54
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,840
Oh

55
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,840
As soon as we hit

56
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,720
Listen, you can point at a calendar. Are you jabronis?

57
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,640
Sorry for calling you jabronis and say the actual first day of fall is in like September

58
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,520
21st or whatever and it's like yeah, man, but we all know September

59
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,080
Timber first is false September is not a summer month if anybody out of context said, you know

60
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,120
The summer months like June July August September. They'd be like, what are you talking about?

61
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,400
And you're like, well the majority of September is summer get the fuck out

62
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,920
Think about this way. Does anybody ever said oh my favorite winter holiday st. Patrick's Day. No

63
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,880
No, it's not that's in the spring

64
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:53,920
Guys, I love millennial Seinfeld as much as the next guy. But hey Griffin, are you just realizing that that's what this show is? I

65
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:00,200
I hate Trav. I fucking refuse to accept that. There's no there's no way

66
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Okay, Griffin's in a mood. Let's talk about it Griffin's in a mood where Travis and I find Griffin in this

67
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,520
sometimes where it's like I

68
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
Don't like that joke

69
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,240
I

70
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,480
Prefer another joke. I don't have I don't I don't have an alternative joke

71
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:37,960
Say I have this to say about Halloween the best Halloween innovation in the last decade has been the big skeleton that people I guess

72
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,480
Have been buying at I don't know where you get big skeleton. It's kind of Halloween

73
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,120
I don't think they have them at your local Costco the sign I at Lowe's yesterday

74
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:55,560
There was a sign that was like one giant skeleton per customer. It's a real issue. So I do think that

75
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,480
Mr. Biden if we could get one of those sent to every American household and

76
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,720
Then there would be a date prescribed by the government that you do put your big skeleton out

77
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,560
and then as you walk around the neighborhood, it reminds you that

78
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,640
Trick-or-treat is coming. Costume kids are coming

79
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,600
The grave just to keep that. Yeah, as a scary grave, then

80
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,560
That's a holiday. I can get into I would also say I think Biden should pass an amendment

81
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,480
That says like when you get your big skeleton up. No adorning it with any political statements

82
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,800
No, we don't want him holding a sign or wearing a hat if you know what I mean

83
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,160
Like this is a purely apolitical stance on skeleton awareness

84
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Maybe in Christmas. There's a sort of skin wrap

85
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,680
You can put on it to make it look like a Jack Skellington put the beard on it. You put the hat on no

86
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,680
I'm talking about a full

87
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,040
epi

88
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
Like epidermis

89
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,760
Sort of like a real skin when I say skin wrap. I don't mean a costume you put on the skeleton

90
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,840
I mean you make it a real a real boy, but a Santa Claus

91
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,360
Do you think that there was an original draft of Nightmare Before Christmas?

92
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,360
While where they were like, well, I think I think Jack Skellington knows that Santa should be like rotund

93
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
So what he's going to do is he's going to pop

94
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,480
He's going to pop Santa's skeleton out of his butt and he's going to climb in there and wear a Santa suit

95
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,320
And they said well save this for Tim Allen vehicle that's coming up and instead. Oh Justin's challenged by this idea

96
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:37,600
Justin and I had to stand up to think about Santa Claus's skeleton. Here's what I'm thinking guys. Okay. I'm going to think about this

97
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,800
No, no, no, no, this is like this is we're it's about we're about to get rich. Okay. Whoa. Whoa. Yeah, I know

98
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,120
Big Santa

99
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
Yeah, it's something I do sometimes

100
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
Sure. Big

101
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:04,080
Uh, Jack Skellington is something I do sometimes right? Yeah, but what about like like just what if the skeleton could just be a different big man?

102
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,560
For every holiday. Yeah, sure, right. So like you have big skeleton

103
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
That it's spooky, right?

104
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,760
Christmas

105
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
I mean makes it sound great

106
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,520
Right you wrap the Santa suit on him done. Yeah, good huge robe beard scythe

107
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:28,640
Father time sure. Are you like a diaper on the skeleton? He's like no save the diaper diaper

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
At midnight you rip the

109
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,720
Toga off the skeleton and it's wearing a diaper now and now it's just like why do we have so many different huge men?

110
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,480
Let's have one huge man that you dress up for any holiday

111
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,360
You want veterans day make him a soldier memorial day now, but is there always a skeleton underneath memorial day back to us?

112
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,720
back what yeah Travis that was going to be my joke before Travis did make sure to jump right in there and

113
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:01,280
Cut that cut that off. Sorry. I was just I wasn't even making a joke. I'm imagining the transitional period where

114
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,680
between each

115
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,280
Holiday, you do have to strip it back to a skeleton

116
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,520
And then dress it you're legally not allowed to do that while people are awake

117
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,480
You have to go door to door and knock on everyone's door and say are you guys out and they'll say yeah

118
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,400
And then you go and yeah, and you say tonight's my skeleton night

119
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,280
So don't come out and do your skeleton because we can't see each other do it. These are Biden issued

120
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,400
They call them they call them bitey bones because Biden said the pandemic's over. I got all this money

121
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,960
We're gonna do bitey bones

122
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,840
And everyone says all right, I'm ready and then the bitey bones just start showing up by the truckload

123
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,680
Every household gets a bitey pre-asset pre-asset multi-family housing. Every family gets a bitey bone

124
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,960
It's just a yard of skeletons outside. That's fun. Now. I do like it being pre-assembled and maybe like

125
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,440
It's still kind of warm and the bones are moist and hot like real boat and Biden's like don't ask questions

126
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
I got resources about the mighty bones

127
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,440
Um, but let's just say I got a lot of these laying around in a certain area in the desert

128
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hold on. Wait, hold on. Wait

129
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,360
Okay. Yeah, they they say all religions can be on the bitey bones. It's no problem if you want to do

130
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,560
Even if you belong or yeah, if if you belong to a religion that is like strictly anti-skeleton

131
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:30,240
Yeah, it said then it's okay. It's still okay because you still okay. You got a special permission slip from President Biden

132
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,520
Yeah, Biden says it's fine. These are a religious

133
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,760
apolitical skeletons

134
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:43,200
That you can dress up like anything you want you are making me so hugely uncomfortable not because you're standing but because you're kind of

135
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,560
Rocking back and forth. This is like me stand

136
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,940
Yeah, no, you look like you're a new judge on shark tank who does who very publicly does cocaine

137
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,760
And maybe it's also made some bad investments and really needs this one to work out

138
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,920
What?

139
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,840
What where is that?

140
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,880
Where is that episode of shark tank where you get the basketball player?

141
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,520
Who's like this wealthy but and he's but he needs he really needs one of these to work and you say it's a sure thing

142
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
It's a sure thing. It's a sure thing

143
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,440
All right, I'm willing to invest 20 million dollars in your frog warmers and the other sharks like don't do no

144
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,400
Hey, can't they can't accept that much money. It's like don't do this. It's a sure thing. They said so everyone's gonna want a frog warmer

145
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,160
20 million dollars for 500 percent of frog warmers

146
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,800
Let it ride

147
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,560
Let it ride baby. Let's see where this thing takes us. This is a this is an advice show where we uh,

148
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,600
You ask us a question you send it to

149
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,480
Mbmbam at maximum fun.org and then we answer it. It's like not a big

150
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,280
It doesn't it doesn't have to be a big thing. Don't make like yeah, don't make like an issue out of it. Okay?

151
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,440
um

152
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,680
I'm currently studying elementary education and I have a lot of experience working with kids on reading slash writing

153
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,880
In july my coworker and I began discussing the possibility of me tutoring his son in reading

154
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,120
He kept setting dates for us to meet for a tutoring session and then changed the date at the last minute

155
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
Eventually, he ended up sending me a hundred dollars

156
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,880
I guess to hold himself accountable to actually following through with tutoring

157
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,880
It is now september and I still have not tutored his son

158
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,200
The money is still in my venmo account and we haven't discussed the tutoring topic in weeks

159
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,280
I would very much like this money. Is there a point where it's okay for me to take the money?

160
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,000
Should I send it back? That's from broken birmingham. Oh my god. I feel like

161
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,200
I'm hearing the opposite side of most interactions people have had with me

162
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,360
And it's very very stressful to me

163
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,920
I feel like i've been this other person and i've been thinking i'm sure they're not thinking about this anymore

164
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,800
Right because right i'm just i'm just feeling guilty about it all the time

165
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,480
But they've probably forgotten and this question is like I haven't forgotten justin

166
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,320
And not only that

167
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,760
I was confused

168
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,680
By what you thought was a very clear indicator that the transaction was over because that's what I assumed the hundred dollars is

169
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,800
Is like you know what? This isn't gonna happen, but I feel so bad that I jerked this person's chain

170
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,520
So like i'm just gonna like give them the money

171
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,920
We agreed on that does feel like somebody was like I can't be guiltless. I can't feel bad about this anymore

172
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,680
Or maybe if I just do my part, they'll just find a chance and just find dirk somewhere in an alley and tutor him

173
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,560
I don't know. Maybe let's seek him out some tutoring on the fly. Hey, are you really good?

174
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,840
Okay

175
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,000
They never arranged the tutoring but then dirk just started like crushing it with everything

176
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,360
He tried to be like, I guess he's tutoring somewhere. I don't know about it, but i'll send him a hundred bucks just to be safe

177
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,520
This is a breach of etiquette. I feel like there there needs to be a law

178
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
about sending people

179
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,120
Funds and maybe i'm just saying this because people have sent me funds and then be like and now what are you gonna do?

180
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
About that the money I have sent you

181
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,360
uh

182
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,000
It's a breach

183
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,120
It's so it's not a nice thing to do to just send somebody money and be like you figure out what you need to do

184
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,760
For me now, it's you clearly owe me one

185
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,440
Figure out what that is. No, I guess you have the expectation

186
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,520
It is a weird inverse of capitalism if there's an expectation that you will be repaid in some way for you

187
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,040
Because I was gonna say giving money to people that's fine. Right? We could we're still fine with that. That's okay

188
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,360
Yeah, for sure. Okay, but if you're expecting something in return that's the problem

189
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,080
I think also this money is yours, right?

190
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,280
Because here's the thing you take that money at any point if your co-worker is like, hey, so when are we gonna schedule that thing?

191
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,280
right

192
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,680
You already have the money and if your co-worker never brings it up again, you already have the money

193
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,680
Yeah, you should take does vinmo you have to like take the money. No, you sadly it's in your account

194
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,880
Give it to you. Um, so here's what I need you to do, uh get on

195
00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:00,320
craigslist or if you really want to turn a quick buck on this fiber, um and find a

196
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,480
reading tutor

197
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,000
for this boy

198
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah, but get in there

199
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
at the lowest

200
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
possible price point

201
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,680
that you can't find somebody who's just like

202
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,520
It's 20 bucks, but I only do consonants

203
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,280
Uh, and then and then you and then you have just made you've turned a quick profit

204
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
while also

205
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,680
not

206
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,080
Fully ripping this person off because now you're just like a tutor eight you're a tutoring agent

207
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,840
Well to the stars the answer is simple if dirks in like third grade you hire a fourth grader to tutor dirk

208
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,240
And then it's one reading level above that and like 10 bucks a fourth grader love 10 bucks

209
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,600
Absolutely, they would fourth graders love 10 bucks

210
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,480
Justin what are you looking at?

211
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,800
You look really lost in thought i was thinking about a story that is related to this that I wanted to share with y'all

212
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,840
I don't cut my own grass

213
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,160
Yeah, I do most of the things in my house, but that's one thing that I decided like i'm gonna pay somebody to cut

214
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,240
My grass because I don't I hate I hate cutting grass. I you have definitely told us about your grass boy

215
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,120
That does your your okay. So, um

216
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,560
the my grass gentleman he cut uh, uh

217
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
I came home and he cut half the lawn

218
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,720
And he said he texted me and he said hey, i'm sorry that I only cut half the lawn

219
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,520
My partner who usually helps me

220
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Um died

221
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,440
And i've it's been really hard keeping up. I said, oh my god. I'm so sorry. I'll tell you what

222
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,120
let me go and send you the money for the for this cutting and then

223
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,600
You know whenever you can get back over to finish. It's like no big deal. He's like, thank you so much

224
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,840
But that was like a couple weeks ago now, right? So

225
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,360
Well now i'm in this situation where not it's not that my grass is long

226
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Yeah, it's that half of my grass is really long

227
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,880
there's two options for me, right one is

228
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,120
Are you still?

229
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
How's it go? How's it going?

230
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,720
With everything with them. Yeah with the with the everything or it's just like

231
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,800
Find someone else to do it and then he shows up. He's like god damn

232
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,320
Can one thing go right? I got scooped god. I cannot catch a break

233
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,720
Like so now i'm kind of in between those two positions and I don't really know

234
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,420
I don't have my brother my brother and me, you know what I mean? You do have two brothers people forget the pagliacci

235
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,480
That we that we are in like what would you guys do in my position I don't it shouldn't this is so key

236
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
I don't own a lawn mower

237
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,600
Like I don't I don't have one. I have a weed whacker for when I need to get some intense work done

238
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,680
But I don't have a lawn mower. Do you have a big pair of scissors for me?

239
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,640
Yeah, I had a lot of good some good ripping gloves I do have two kids yeah, there you go

240
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,560
Yeah, have them eat the grass like goats

241
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,240
Get up there eat the grass like goats. You should just text the lawn mower person like hey, let's schedule the next time

242
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,400
You're able to come out. Are you still by yourself? We could schedule it over two days if that helps

243
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,760
Yeah, that's good trap. Yeah, it's not a joke

244
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,720
But I can see that this is really bothering my older brother and I wanted to help

245
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,560
You could say like I know you had trouble with the right side of the yard

246
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,920
But I want you to know that it's basically just like the left side of the yard, but backwards does that help?

247
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,880
Does that help?

248
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:39,440
Your assumption driven is that the loss of the partner made it impossible to do both halves not because it was a time issue

249
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,920
But because when he reached the middle boy, he's like i've never done over there before

250
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,560
I I had got to a point where I almost asked if I could borrow

251
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,600
his lawn mower

252
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,240
um, so I could do it, but then I worried there was a reality where she's like

253
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,360
That was real good. I have one other yard

254
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
Are you looking for a side gig

255
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,120
It's like I do three or four yards because I feel so guilty that it's like wait a minute

256
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,520
I think I work for this guy now and then you find that it's your new passion and it's just like oh

257
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,560
What do I tell my brothers? How about another you guys want another question? Yeah. Yeah, you know what I really do

258
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,160
Or you know how we've been talking about starting our own band. Yeah

259
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,680
Yeah

260
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,280
The wizard had some help

261
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,760
For us eric sent this one in and it's how to find an interesting name for your band

262
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,480
And it can't be the mackerel brothers because that's actually taken I found out recently

263
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:39,120
There's like three mackerel brothers who do I believe it's called commercial rock or something, which doesn't seem like a thing

264
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,720
Well, we do kind of commercial rock do we like we well we have sponsors on the show and I think that our

265
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,120
comedy style

266
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,680
Really rocks. Well, we've covered we do scatting we do jingles. Yeah, um, we've done some musicals

267
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,440
Yeah, but we really shred these jokes

268
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,640
Are you looking for a catchy name for your band the name your band chooses can make the difference between success and failure

269
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,720
I think anecdotally I can think of a few bands that

270
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,400
Have some of the worst names i've ever heard in my life that managed to really take off. Yeah, um and find a lot of success

271
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,800
like cold play

272
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:24,000
I that's not that doesn't mean anything. Anyway learning the rules of good band names keep it short

273
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,360
Think about it. How many band names do you know that are more than three words long?

274
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,120
Not many. That's the rule of thumb. No more than three words long

275
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
You want people to be able to spell and pronounce your name?

276
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,120
Mostly you just want people to be sure they remember it. Can you abbreviate your band name easily?

277
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,520
That can be helpful for merchandising purposes. That's one reason that nine inch nails chose its name

278
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:49,200
Can we just all three i'm just gonna a quick test here off the top of your head. What's the most memorable band name?

279
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
We're gonna i'm gonna count down from three

280
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,680
Uh and on go say the most memorable band name. Okay, you ready?

281
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:01,200
Wait, the most memorable band name? Yeah, the band like when you think of a band name, right?

282
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,080
What what the first one the band itself, right? Like

283
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,520
Yeah, the work the just the name of the band

284
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,160
Right. Ready? Three two one go who cherry pop and daddy's is not a band

285
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,160
Is a singer now justin you say hubastank. That's a good hubastank

286
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:25,200
Hubastanks, i'll know that for the rest of my life. I'll never not know hubasek and i said cherry pop and daddies, which is uh,

287
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:32,160
Horrible, obviously obviously here also, that's so interesting, uh to hear you say and it's not the first time

288
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:40,000
God it's memorable really sticks in now griffin. You said a human being's name. Am I correct? Yeah, that felt fucked up

289
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
Because this is a real person

290
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,560
Ingleborg happening. Yeah, yeah

291
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,920
Okay, I would say red hot chili peppers because it's i'll tell you why four words four words

292
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:57,040
This is a part-time job to say the name of this band. Yeah, I have things to I have shit to do today

293
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,960
I have two children

294
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,520
I can't go around saying red hot chili peppers all the time

295
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,200
Just then when I said it I almost fell asleep in the middle of it

296
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,640
I almost needed a glass of water in the middle of saying the name of that band. They should just call it red hot pep

297
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:17,520
Or just the peppers. Oh, that's good. It'd be a better name for the band about it anthony

298
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,080
What's up anthony? What's up anthony? Hit me up. I got all kinds and friends

299
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,760
Kitas I got all kinds of great ideas for you pals. Yeah, there you go aunt flea and the rest

300
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,320
That's some four words damn it. You're right aunt flea rest

301
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Aunt flea, etc, etc

302
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,720
Make your uh, make your name seo friendly these days you want your name to be easily findable when you search on the internet

303
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
Names are too common who bestang?

304
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,880
Every one of these bits in this question or wiki how article we could just say who bestang. Yeah, who was thanks

306
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,200
Well, it's like a good name for a band. Like I don't know anything about the band, but it's a good name for a band

307
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,580
memorable short

308
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,600
Avoid anything with very negative connotations. You have to know how far you can

309
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
The one I sets out

310
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,840
You have to know how far you can push it

311
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,960
Okay, wait, wait, does who was saying qualifier or this is like hooba has no

312
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,120
I don't think it has well. Yeah, I guess stank and no I think that stank is right

313
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,840
Stank's not good. Like hooba like but hooba hooba disarms you. Yeah, hooba as a as a qualifier

314
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,760
Hooba has his arms up. It looks like grimace. It's as arson like come here, buddy

315
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
And then it's like stank is in the back

316
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,920
Yeah

317
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,920
Corn's a fun name. I know we talk about we're a bunch of bad ass seo though

318
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,720
Well, except you spell with a k so that's assuming you know that in this day and age gripping

319
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,400
You can't assume people know

320
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Because maybe they just hear it and then they're just talking to alexa and they're like alexa play corn

321
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,520
And then it plays that corn song from tiktok. You're like, no, no, no the one that goes

322
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,160
And alexa's like i've called the doctor for you

323
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,280
Um

324
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,920
I didn't know if there really is a corn song from tiktok, but it sounds

325
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,640
It sounds right. That sounds like something tiktok would have on it. You don't know about the corn boy song

326
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,800
Find a name that's fresh. You want to avoid band names that are cliched now because of because they were trends a long time ago

327
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,960
It's passe to add a number to your name boys two men seems so not now

328
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:26,000
Acronyms are out think in sync putting an exclamation point at the end of your name will date you too

329
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,960
Adding an extra d or t on the end of a name is kind of cliched avoid it think rat

330
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,040
rat

331
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,240
rats ratatouille, uh

332
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,440
Develop a vision for your band that one we've already done. Uh pop young

333
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,060
spirited, um

334
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Hip now

335
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,000
sexy

336
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,480
And these are words that we can take and fold. Sorry. I was saying that for the band name

337
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,080
Yeah, no, that's what i'm saying. So sexy coldplay would be a good one a better one

338
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Too many words it's it's pop

339
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,840
Well coldplay lets you know that it's going to be pop because this band has coldplay in it. Yeah coldplay with a k

340
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,680
Is that anything?

341
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,000
Hot hot play hot work. We've talked about hot work before we have made that no way

342
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:22,560
So find a word with meaning to you combine it with something perhaps your favorite candy bar the name of your girlfriend from

343
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,880
High school your hometown all these are words you could add to a band name or just uses one now

344
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,720
I assume when it says name of your girlfriend for high school. It doesn't mean like full name

345
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,180
Samantha davis three musketeers

346
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,880
Cindy score cindy score's not a bad name for a

347
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,520
love a score bar

348
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,160
I don't know that I thought that that was a I thought that that was a dipping tobacco. It's like a thinner heath bar

349
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,200
I thought it was the one what's the one that oh zero?

350
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,640
Oh, that's what I was thinking of with the nougat from the white chocolate use a pop culture or literary reference

351
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,720
Mikey way was working in the barns and noble and saw the book by Irvine Welsh entitled three tales of chemical romance

352
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,120
And then he came up with the name of the band

353
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:16,160
Coldplay, this is my band the so so gatsby's that's a pretty good name for a band. Thank you. Thank you

354
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,960
They're definitely I can't decide if they're emo or punk, but they're one of those two. Can you do screamo?

355
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:30,240
I always thought that was fun. Yeah, I can dude. Yeah screamo. That's perfect get inspiration from common products or things flowers food sewing machines

356
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,440
You name it look around the house. You'll find a lot of common things with interesting names

357
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,980
Acdc got their name from a sewing machine

358
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,880
Food names can also make good band names

359
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,400
That's what it's short for now a lot of people know that's what the h that's what the h stands for

360
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,120
Food names can also make good band names think black eyed peas or red hot chili peppers

361
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,760
So which one is it wiki? Which one of those is a good name?

362
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,880
Can we stay take a step back because right now you're telling me that red hot chili peppers is a good band name

363
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,640
But let me red hot chili peppers. That's four. Are you sure red hot's not one word?

364
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,040
Isn't there a candy called red hots and they're just the one word. Oh, that's right. And anthony keyda stated somebody named chili peppers

365
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,480
high school

366
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,080
Um

367
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,880
Pick a random name. Thanks. That's nothing sure use your own name or your initials

368
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,000
This is always a possibility, especially if your band has a front man

369
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,240
For example, the dave matthews band is simply based on one of the band members

370
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,960
What oh my god that makes so much it's never clicked for me before so wait

371
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,320
His name is dave. There's a real dave matthews. I thought it was like hooting the blowfish

372
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,280
Do you think that there was ever a moment when they were coming out and he was like?

373
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,840
what if we just called it the dave matthews band and they're like, uh dave, uh

374
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,200
I'm, not sure we were we were talking about a bunch of cool names

375
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:57,680
Yeah, but wouldn't it be similar if we just called it dave matthews band and like I don't think it would dave

376
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,720
um

377
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,600
So make up a new word is another one and they give the example

378
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,040
Metallica is the example of a band with a name that is a made-up word drummer lulz ulrich

379
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,160
Made up made it up while thinking about a metal magazine. That's a pretty cool. I wish I could live inside that man's

380
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,000
wonderful

381
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,120
fucking

382
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,520
Imaginarium of fucking dr. Parnassus my palace that he's got going on in there

383
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,680
It also says create a new word by misspelling a common word like corn, but that's taken unless

384
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,800
We wanted to do like k a u r

385
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,760
Okay, what about this this is the name of our band it's not it is what about corn with the c oh

386
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:43,120
Oh, oh I like that what's up everybody we're a corm did you say corm?

387
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,480
Zing zap a z ziba ziba, this is my band pooba stay

388
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:58,960
Are you teddy like what what did you say? Oh, man, um, make

389
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,960
Make sure someone else doesn't have your name. It would be a night

390
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:21,120
Wait, which one did you say I said corm can we be corn? How are you spelling it with a k? Yeah, it's fine

391
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:30,560
I can't see how that would be confusing at all. That was a competing band. Jonathan Davis started corn and a friend of his started corm

392
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,400
And corm was already on the rise corn had been on the scene for like two years

393
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,840
Corm had a c in the beginning but an m at the end

394
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:44,400
They were heading up and Jonathan Davis was like, I guess the thing that you need is for your band to be named after corm

395
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,440
Uh juice. I'm sorry for this one determine if the domain name is available

396
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,600
So corm.gov is hoomastank.com taken. It's got to be right

397
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
corm.com is available

398
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,120
That's gonna be a big ask though because it does look a lot like corn

399
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:11,840
I I can't imagine how it could be confusing. It's corn with an m it's different in every way develop more than one band name

400
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:18,560
No, fuck you. No, we have we struck gold here and then trademark your band name with the united states patent office

401
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,560
I don't is that

402
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,560
It took you a while to find that button because I know you didn't program that last time

403
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,760
Yeah, we talked about it last time but i'd switch the pads over. I know isn't that sad?

404
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,960
I feel like if we're gonna continue to or get now that

405
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,720
That came organically like do we just maybe?

406
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:46,240
Think about that corn is a lot more than other people do or are we just the only ones willing to talk about it

407
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,420
It's 2022

408
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,960
so

409
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
much stuff

410
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:59,280
Bad stuff. Yeah bad stuff has happened. Yeah since corn came on the scene

411
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,720
That it makes the fact that there was a band called corn that had a song that sounded like goomba

412
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,920
Really

413
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,920
Really funny to me

414
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:17,760
Yeah, like it's like we look back and it's like there were some bad there were some bad times in there

415
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,000
and then right before

416
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,480
It's like when people had to sit through hippies and stuff and they're like I miss when music was like

417
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,000
No now for us it's I miss when music was like

418
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:39,920
It's not even the music that I missed travis it was a more whimsical time. Oh, yeah a simpler and better time

419
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,080
Last time I wanted to make an announcement about the band corn. Okay

420
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,120
Last time

421
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,560
Uh, we talked about corn, which it's i'm sure it's been months now. Sorry, which band dressing corn or quorum?

422
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,840
Sorry, this is about corn and it is from last week. Okay, I mentioned, um heady

423
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,760
But the basis of corn is the name fieldy as several listeners kindly corrected me

424
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,100
A lot of real cornos in the audience and I did not know that a lot of cornographers

425
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,900
And I am uh, i'm so sorry to run afoul. Mr. Fieldy if you're listening

426
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,980
um

427
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,980
I'm, so sorry. There's no way anyone in that band listens to podcasts not one of them

428
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:25,860
There's no way anyone in corn listens to popcorn with a k i'm talking about now. You understand that not quorum

429
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,340
No, there's no way

430
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,340
Those dudes are way too fucking cool

431
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:43,140
Let's go to the money zone. It's better, it's better with you

You

488
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,100
Uh, here's another question

489
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:25,100
I'm a high school teacher and I just had a student tell me that I look like a trail mix

490
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,620
I don't really know what he meant by this, but I know he intended it as an insult. What could he have possibly meant?

491
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:37,660
Why do I feel so deeply offended by this comment? What course of punishment does this deserve? I can't stop thinking about it

492
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:43,100
That's from muddled in missouri. Now. There's two. I think there's two assets devastating. Yeah, it's devastating

493
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:50,060
I mean, it's so devastating my guess as to why it cuts too deep is that you are a person who has

494
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:56,940
Multiple times in your life eaten trail mix, but you do not like make it an everyday habit

495
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,500
So you can't outright deny it

496
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:05,820
But it does seem like they've peeked deep into your soul to know so that like I know that in your deepest darkest hours

497
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,220
When no one's around you eat trail mix

498
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,180
And it's just like this is I have eaten trail mix before. Yeah, you're right. I do eat trail mix

499
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,740
This is what terrifies me

500
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,340
about

501
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,420
Getting older is I don't know

502
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,460
What the thing is that I do?

503
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
that I will be

504
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,060
utterly humiliated for

505
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,940
And it'll be a totally innocuous thing like eating trail mix

506
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,540
um

507
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,260
but then somebody will point it out and that person will be

508
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:43,900
Half my age and they'll point it out to their friends and they'll all laugh and then they'll get on their hover skates or whatever and

509
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,820
drift off

510
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,300
Um, and i'll be left standing there like wondering

511
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,220
Everything about my life why I live the way I live. Um

512
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,660
This is a terrifying question to me

513
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,100
Yeah

514
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:02,300
I would also I would find myself immediately as soon as like their back was turned or I could get away from them

515
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:09,100
Googling like is eating trail mix slang for something. Is this is eating trail mix bad to do now?

516
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:14,700
Is this like from a meme where there's like a cartoon squirrel that eats trail mix and then like shits themselves like what?

517
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,060
What is this in reference to it can't just be?

518
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,500
Trail mix, right? That's the can't be no

519
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,860
I've always thought of trail mix as a very neutral

520
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,740
food like who wouldn't enjoy trail mix there's something for everyone in there and

521
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,140
And how could it become a bad thing?

522
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:37,820
Is it about nuts? It's got to be something about nuts, right? Nuts are in there. Are they saying that I

523
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,860
Like to have nuts like a testicle. Is it a testicles thing guys gotta be testicles

524
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,420
You gotta tell me the testicle thing because it can't be the chocolate candy part. Everybody loves that

525
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,620
No, everybody loves that. They love raisins. They're not telling me I

526
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,860
I mean it's the seeds. It's the seeds. It's weird to have seeds in the thing

527
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,420
Because you plant those you're not supposed to eat them

528
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:03,500
How stupid why don't I have any seeds for so long? Fuck they're right. They're right. They're right. They're right. I should expel them

529
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,780
Before anyone else finds out my secret gets out seed eater

530
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,980
Never come back to this school again. You just you just couldn't wait. Could you seed eater?

531
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,780
Gotta plant this belly like a sloppy little monster

532
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,900
loves his seeds

533
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,220
You look like you eat trail mix

534
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,740
Oh fuck it does hurt because it's so there's no

535
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:34,140
There's no implication whatsoever. So the mind just reaches for the worst thing

536
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:40,700
It's an insult that is like it impregnates itself like I don't know. What's the worst thing you think about yourself? Yeah, right

537
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:47,660
Have you considered that you eat trail mix being the worst thing about yourself you look like you like trail mix

538
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,820
I do have commitment issues. Yeah

539
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:56,880
Yeah, why how did you get there? Is it are they okay? The best I can figure is that you you have a crunchy aesthetic?

540
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,340
and by which I mean not because of

541
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,060
all of the

542
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:07,340
Toothsome legumes that you're shoveling into your mouth during your your lunch hour

543
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:15,100
But i'm more talking about sort of your hiking your you you eat trail mix because you find yourself

544
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,820
on trails a lot

545
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,980
oh, you're just like a kind of a

546
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:24,700
A trail junkie, but it can't be that you actually have that lifestyle

547
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,260
Like you're not bringing your hiking backpack to class because you're hitting the trails afterwards

548
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:34,380
It's like you wore a flannel and a knitted beanie once and they're like, oh, okay

549
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,420
Ah, you're like this idea in your head where?

550
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:44,380
When a teacher comes to school, they leave no hints whatsoever of the type of person that they are

551
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:50,300
Are you kidding me? That's all I would do the yeah, that's what i'm saying. Travis. Yeah

552
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:57,260
Because you're saying you would cloak your shit so that your kids would never know anything about you. Yes

553
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,860
How are you supposed to connect? How are you supposed to connect? I don't want griffin

554
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,260
We've already established the idea of connect

555
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:08,780
Maybe that's it is like you've cloaked your shit so good the best they can infer is like

556
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,100
I don't know trail mix something about trail mix

557
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:15,020
I think I saw them eating m&ms once and it reminded me of trail mix

558
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:15,980
I don't know man

559
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:21,360
Because here's the thing griffin as soon as they know any aspect of your life you've given them so much ammunition

560
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,860
Where they see you and they're like, hey cat mom and you're like god damn it

561
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,700
got me

562
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,700
to me, I feel like

563
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:33,100
if they said that to me, I would think about the only times I eat trail mix or when i'm like

564
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,020
Traveling and i'm really worn out and it's like you deserve a little treat

565
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:43,020
It's been hard for you and it's like they see me this is like a little baby that needs his bottom powdered and it's just like

566
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,060
a little

567
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,620
Little wimp who needs oh no energy

568
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,780
actually

569
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,740
Hey

570
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:55,020
Yeah, the only time I eat trail mix is when I am flying to one of our many

571
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,020
sold out

572
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,300

575
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,980
The only time I eat trail mix is when I am

576
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,620
Jet setting that's true from one city to the next

577
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:20,140
leaving crowds of people stupefied with my great jokes and so

578
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:26,060
Trail mix is not the food of some crunchy waistoid

579
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:32,780
Uh, that's someone who has so many other great comedy shows to do. Yeah, they only have time for a handful of food

580
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:37,340
So it better have a little bit of everything in there if I was a crunchy if I was a crunchy waistoid

581
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,740
I'd call it gourd because I am

582
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,580
a

583
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:47,340
Businessman. Yeah, essentially, uh who eats trail mix because it has the protein I crave

584
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:54,160
It has the carbohydrates and sugars that my body needs to like get me to my next sold out business entertainment engagement

585
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,320
Uh, this is a this is a power food for powerful people

586
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,080
The only trails that griven's worried about is kim trails the ones being left behind the plane that he's flying in to get to his

587
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,520
Next thing maybe that's what they're saying is you look like a government chill

588
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,160
Maybe yeah

589
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,360
Now see I think I was going a different way where the only time I eat trail mix is like I rip it open

590
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,760
And I slam it back like it's some kind of power pills

591
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,520
Uh from a video game that's filling up my energy bar

592
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:27,120
And so maybe what they're saying is you look like you uh move you move too quickly from thing to thing

593
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,920
You're not taking time for you. Maybe this is a they're worried about you. Hey, they're worried about you

594
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,400
You look like you're eating trail mix. You need to settle down make a meal make yourself a

595
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,240
A knife and fork meal you deserve it eat some knife and fork food

596
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,680
You deserve it. Don't just rip open a plastic baggie and slam it like some kind of like on-the-go machine

597
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,680
You're not a machine. You're a person you have needs and you know what worse, you know what?

598
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,400
Just take the time get a plate separate the trail mix bags. Thank you in the different

599
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,640
These are that's a meal. That's a meal because it's separate you just have well

600
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,720
You're going to use a spoon on the peanuts definitely a fork on the raisins. That's where you're going to feel it

601
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:09,680
What's that? Oh, you've you've melted the chocolate candies into some sort of fondue that you can dip some uh, that's great

602
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,440
You're doing it. This is a sort of deconstruction of trail mix. I call it

603
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:19,440
trail

604
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,720
It's not mixed at all. It's just it's it's just trail sort of composite. Um, you're gonna love it

605
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:34,480
Eat one thing and go in a clockwise order around the plate. This is my artist's intent. It's a hundred

606
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,880
It is it took me a lot of time to separate

607
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,760
All the things it's very labor intensive. We just we I have another question

608
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,440
We just moved the country and I pass by a little farm every day

609
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,640
That has a trailer at the edge of their property next to the highway

610
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,200
That trailer is full of beautiful plump pumpkins of all different sizes pumpkins

611
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,640
There's a no sign indicating if the pumpkins are free or not. Can I go take some?

612
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,560
Or are they decoration that's from pumpkin perplexed in minnesota. This will be quick. Hey

613
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,040
Hey, hey peter cottontail calm the fuck down

614
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Chill you need to chill the fuck out, dude

615
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,640
I know you're new you're new to the country

616
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:22,400
It doesn't work like that. There's no sign saying if they're free or not, you know what that's applicable to

617
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,160
All things pretty much like all things

618
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,520
My car doesn't have a sign that says this beautiful buick is is taken

619
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:37,600
And do not like whether it would be the alternate sign do not steal. I think if you don't see an is free sign

620
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,560
The assumption is the base case has to be do not steal. Yeah now

621
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,360
but unless unless

622
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,600
We've all had that thought where we've driven past

623
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,160
a cornfield

624
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,320
And seen these beauties

625
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:02,080
Yeah, uh, these golden beauties just shimmering in the sun and thought like if I just grabbed one of those

626
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,280
one beauty one beauty

627
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:13,680
Then there's no way that I would get caught. There's no way they would notice. It's one corn. You want to steal from farmers?

628
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,320
I think that the subsidies that my tax dollars provide allow me whoa. No, no listen

629
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,840
You can steal from farmers as much as I fucking want to oh, okay

630
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:29,040
You didn't let me finish the thought. Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry griffin. That's that's true. Yeah

631
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,720
And it's not stealing because i'm the only one that's doing it

632
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,960
So nobody they're not gonna know it's not like i'm telling everyone to steal from farmers

633
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,560
I'm saying I should be able to steal one thing from every farmer

634
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,800
It it's statistically a victimless crime. Yeah, it's basically around the grand scheme of things in the grand scheme of things

635
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,680
It's basically a rounding error now. I will now I will say aside from the humble water

636
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:57,520
Aside from the farmers on board aside from the humble watermelon farmer

637
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:03,840
There is not a worse produce. I could steal than a pumpkin because you talk about economies of scale

638
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,000
You can grow way fewer pumpkins than you can grow beautiful corn beauties

639
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:14,080
So that the bottom line will be more affected in the pumpkin in the pumpkin industry

640
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:21,360
Then that's why I feel fine stealing one soybean. That's something I feel comfortable doing right smaller than corn even less noticeable

641
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,320
I'm fine with us as long as we're talking about cornfields

642
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:29,680
Can I make a call to hollywood stop making it look so fun when cars go like barreling through cornfields?

643
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,160
And I know it's supposed to be like a scary or whatever the funnest thing

644
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:38,400
But like every time I pass a cornfield, there's this party that's like what if I just hooked left because there's no way

645
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,120
You would get your car would get halfway into the cornfield before it would come to a dead stop

646
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,640
Oh, yeah, just from pure pure corn friction

647
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,880
Which is like it would get wrapped up in your undercarriage all kinds of corns up in the works shouldn't be in there

648
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,840
No, but it looks like fun because it's like

649
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,640
You cannot

650
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,760
You don't need us to hey. Hey friend

651
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,160
You don't need us to tell you that you can't just take some pumpkin off a corn field or a pumpkin field

652
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,320
You know that right? They don't want you if they wanted you to there'd be a sign

653
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:19,440
This is another example of a sign would help if there was a sign there that said hey free pumpkin

654
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,600
Yeah, you should take it. Otherwise, it's just they're a decoration, right?

655
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,600
I've got some pumpkins in front of my house now that I put out there because it's the fall

656
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,840
And the idea of someone like well if they're just sitting there and I see them every day when I drive by so they want

657
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,920
Me to take one, right? No

658
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:40,320
There's more pumpkins. I would say it's like the that you are actually stumbling into the base tenant of

659
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:47,680
Society which is if I set this here. I don't need to put a sign on it. It says don't steal it, right? I'll just

660
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,480
People won't steal it. It's like a base

661
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,400
Ten. Yeah

662
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:58,240
I have to announce it's free because that is not it's a natural that's not the natural state

663
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:04,800
default also if you try this to take a pumpkin you then burn it at peter's might come out and make your

664
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,520
Make your balls shrivel up. Yeah with her magic with her magic with her magic

665
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,120
Yeah

666
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,320
I want a munch

667
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,720
I want to munch

668
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,720

That sounds nice won't allow me to do that schlotz keys

Is still in the fucking mix not in Huntington the Huntington one closed?

675
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,000
But somewhere they're out there doing their sandwich business

676
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,640
Sandwich place can't stay afloat in Huntington like get out of the full game to be fair

677
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:07,120
We also lost the quiz nose. We lost the credit to highfalutin people couldn't wait for the toast thing

678
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,480
Yeah, that's true. Uh, then there was a new york maple company there and now it's a place where you drink wine and paint

679
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,560

00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,560
You pay to do it not just like oh, never mind. I can I can drink wine and paint at home

681
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,080

692
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,600

699
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,920
I'm mad at Shlotsky's and for some reason I'm mad at bare naked ladies

700
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,600
And I know they had nothing to do with this. They were always going to get dragged into this though travis. That's a great point

701
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,400
Um, no, it's the bare naked pizza

702
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:52,160
You know how sometimes when you pick up a tomato and you say oh naked sauce. It's like it's just like that. It's one step before

703
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,320
The thing so the uh, shlotsky's is undressing its pizza

How much is a regular pizza that's good and has stuff on reminder schlotsky's deals in like personal pan like there this is not a

This experience schlotsky's is undressing its pizza one topping at a time and slow

709
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:30,740
That's not the way you would make this. There's no way travis. Let schlotsky's give us a boner

710
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:35,060
Okay, schlotsky's is undressing its pizza one topping at a time

711
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,460
at a slow

712
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,140
salivating seduction

713
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:43,380
resulting in limited time only bare naked pizza

714
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:49,380
Uh, the beloved fast casual restaurant that sentence didn't communicate more information

715
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,060
It just wanted to be sexy for a second

716
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,300
Yep

717
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,420
Because it's schlotsky's and it wants to find it sexy and live there

718
00:54:54,820 --> 00:55:01,220
The beyond and I want to empower them. I want to empower them to do like I know that schlott corporations aren't people

719
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:06,580
But someone at schlotsky's is trying to figure some shit out about themselves and they're using

720
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:12,580
The work that they do is the vehicle for that discovery. I think that's beautiful and pure

721
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:16,200
Um, but I don't want to I but I don't want to pay 4.99

722
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,060
for a crust round of

723
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,700
no cheese crust round, uh

724
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:26,580
That is going to not scratch the pizza itch because it's a p it's actually a pita

725
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:30,420
Yeah instead is what we're talking about. I would also be willing to bet

726
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,580
that this

727
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:36,020
Uh naked pizza comes with sauce to dip it in

728
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,940
There's no way that they hand you this without

729
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:47,460
Something to dip it in the beloved fast casual restaurant famous for its made in house oven baked sourdough bread is giving customers

730
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:54,900
Another way to indulge by featuring mouth-watering videos celebrating its unique one-of-a-kind sourdough pizza crust on the new

731
00:55:55,540 --> 00:56:01,060
Bare naked pizza only fans page get the fuck out. Yeah, baby

732
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,620
I don't need to get the fuck out travis because i'm not

733
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,020
Lying to you

734
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,020
Hold on

735
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:14,100
Here it is, oh I hate it the bare naked pizza

736
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,300
Uh only it does have a page on only fans

737
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:24,340
So you can subscribe to that and see its dick so many people were involved in that being on there

738
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:28,180
Do you know how many fucking meetings? Yes, travis exactly

739
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:33,380
How many means are like there's had to be like three or four people who are like we can't

740
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:40,520
We can't we don't come back from an only fans page. We're schlotzkis. We're not experimenting. We're schlotzkis

741
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,220
We're not trying to make ends meet

742
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,220
Maybe they are schlotzkis

743
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:50,980
I'm upset at schlotzkis. We're using our expertise in fresh fresh baked sourdough to create

744
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:55,540
Irresistible pizza dough that we think is the best in the biz and also some

745
00:56:55,860 --> 00:57:00,180
Very specific pornography. That's according to schlotzkis executive chef

746
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,380
Jennifer keel who probably didn't have a hand in the only fans thing

747
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:07,540
We're so confident in our delicious doughs that we're willing to serve them in their bare naked

748
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:13,220
So pizza lovers can taste our perfectly crispy yet light and airy crusts in all their glory

749
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,380
So it's just the thing is about this is that they're selling you bread

750
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,300
You know

751
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:25,140
Yeah, you know, it's bread. They're calling it a different thing, but it's

752
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:32,500
It's it's definitely bread. It's definitely bread and the reason I know that is that they're not

753
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,620
selling sauce cup

754
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:40,420
Which is a cup of pizza sauce and they say we're so confident

755
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,540
about our pizza sauces tangy

756
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,160
flavors that we have

757
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,540
Created it's a pornography website

758
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,640
exclusively for the for this

759
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,640
red wet sauce

760
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,400
um

761
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,560
And we don't think we even need the bread anymore. That was stupid. That was a stupid joke

762
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,600
The sauce is what's up now sexy

763
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:13,440
We're so confident. You'll love you'll love our pepperonis that we open up our only fans page and this one is actually

764
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:21,040
Really popular actually, it's just this these huge long tubes of pepperoni and we're cutting them in half with knives and people love it

765
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,040
Which people like that? I don't know. I

766
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:28,320
I'm excited for like two weeks from now when schloss is like releasing a press release list like hey

767
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,520
Uh, we have to stop that only fans page

768
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:37,280
Because way more people subscribe to it than we are comfortable with it's getting to be a tax issue

769
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,080
normally, we love the money but

770
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,920

773
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:01,280
This month is we didn't actually figure out the supply chain issues. So, um, that has to be what this is

774
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,160
Yeah, a hundred hundred percent like they got too much

Thanks to montaigne for the use of our theme song. My life is better with you

801
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:13,460
I'm sure you've listened to the album making it now at this point, but have you tried listening to it?

802
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
backwards because

803
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,700
That is where the all the secrets

804
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:22,660
lie about the

805
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,140
government

806
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,340
cover-up

807
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,340
of the big expose

808
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,580
That you would not believe

01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:34,100
about the army's secret program

810
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:43,220
That they don't want you to know about but let's just say those uh superhero movies

811
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,660
They're not just

812
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:50,340
They're not entirely works of fiction and that's all i'll say about it

813
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:54,980
And the only way for you to know about that. I got two and a half hours of sleep last night

814
01:01:54,980 --> 01:02:00,100
The only way for you to know about that is to listen montaigne's album making it do it forwards first

815
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:03,140
But then backwards to find out about how the government
