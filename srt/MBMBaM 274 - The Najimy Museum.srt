00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

14
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:50,480

17
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,160

18
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:20,080
quick that's not a witness protection work now you have to live here too i can't you know too much

19
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,480
you're not like in hiding mummy rat well that's kind of a weird name god damn it you found me out

20
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,480
not again i wish this was a better disguise i gotta stop witnessing murders around halloween

21
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,680
they have fun there at the police department movie would be about a dracula that witnessed

22
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,600
a murder on halloween and then they put him in witness protection he had to try to blend in

23
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,400
in like a new neighborhood where they couldn't know that he was dracula now here's my question

24
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,320
justin is the fact that he is a dracula completely coincidental or is it connected

25
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,360
to the murder in some way like did he see a wolf man get killed no that's racist travis

26
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,600
that you think you hear dracula and you think oh they probably did a murder no no no i'm not

27
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,920
saying the dracula did the killing i'm saying that he just witnessed another spooky character

28
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,360
like he maybe saw boo berry get killed no no no that this is the best part it was a gangland mob

29
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,360
slaying so now the mob is after dracula and then at the end of the movie he's like well i try to

30
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,160
blend in and play by the rules he's got a cop partner i tried to blend in and play by the rules

31
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,720
but it looks like i'm gonna have to play by the one sorry sorry play by the ghouls yeah i'm gonna

32
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,400

33
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,520
of sunglasses like track style and then the last 15 minutes is dracula murdering um uh an army of

34
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,320

00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,600
it's gonna be second you're a big dick in like lingerie no no well yeah maybe that is how you

74
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,160
get the idea across although you'd look just silly wouldn't you a little bit not like how

75
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,600
do you sex up a dick like it's already the sexiest you give it a really like like ripped abs

78
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:32,320
sexiest dick that's good that's a great costume on the nose but don't put your sexy dick on

79
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,240
anybody's nose how can you be sexy star wars and this one's gonna be also pretty conceptual

80
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,400
because you're not talking about a star specific character but rather i'm not talking about slave

81
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:48,160
leia i'm not talking about crotchless han i'm talking about sexy star wars they don't talk

82
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,640
about that when he came out of the when he came out of the uh crowd carbonite yeah the carbonite

83
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,880
that they'd frozen his crotch off his dick was well no his crotch was there but the crotch of

84
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,440
his pant was gone and it was just let's just say i shot first during that scene if you know what i

85
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,240
mean do you think that there will be a lot of sexy bernie sanders out there this year you know there's

86
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,160
gonna be a million sexy bernie sanders's i heard that sexy pizza rat costume is already on sale

87
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:22,480
oh it just sold out no and it's gone and it's stopped being funny damn just missed it should

88
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,400
you eat all the good candy first or save the best for last that comes in from carissa carissa

89
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,360
is this a good idea i don't know we can at least milk it for a little bit i feel like we had very

90
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,000
very different um candy storage ideas yeah like what what was our concept there travis what was

91
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,320
your sort of plan mine was very much um i would hide it away until a mouse found it and then throw

92
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,080
it all away yeah definitely a mouse based economy yeah that was kind of the built-in

93
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,920
expiration date of whether a corner of the bag was gone or not yeah i ended up with a lot of like

94
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,880
uh like the sprees where there's like three in a package you know what i'm talking about

95
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,040
like a little paper package with three sprees and it's almost like what am i gonna do with

96
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,120
like is this even three sprees yeah opening the thing i would end up with like a pillowcase full

97
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,680
of those and just like you can't throw it away because it's it's candy and you're a little kid

98
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,000
you can't just like get candy whenever you want to but also at the same time like oh we're going

99
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,520
anywhere inside me for sure can i read this one because it made me laugh when i read it's from

100
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:40,000
buick said something like that they said which cursed me with revolting rhythms what does that

101
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,640
mean and how is it cured uh just take some zinc that usually knocks them yeah usually knocks them

102
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,960
right out it will take usually like two or days two or three days for it to be fully flushed out

103
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:59,600
so sorry you gotta pass a lot james asked this i i will be gone halloween night but i still

104
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,640
want to leave out candy how can i ensure that nobody just steals the whole bowl not how any

105
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,160
of this works if i see a bowl with candy sitting on a stranger's doorstep i'm gonna do one of two

106
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:17,360
things not touch it because it could be a it could be a an improvised explosive device and i don't

107
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:24,720
fuck with that and the other thing it could be is that i could i will take all of it now that i'm

108
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,800
an adult looking back at like trigger treating and all the fears where people were like they

109
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,160
might put drugs in the candy now i'm an adult and i realize like who's this person who just has all

110
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,120
these extra drugs lying around that they're gonna waste on kids right it was just like oh yeah i

111
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,040
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on drugs and i'm giving them away and that was hot that

112
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,400
shit was hilarious let's do some heroin to celebrate oh no what what poor forethought on my

113
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,960
part we put our good heroin to those apples that we gave kids damn it well i'm gonna go shave oh

114
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:05,200
damn it i can't do that either ironically as we learned from super sized me the this whole

115
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:13,040
time the candy was the poison super sized weed i got a question from brendan i don't get off work

116
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,560
till after 11 on halloween is that officially too late to engage in spookery uh they have a

117
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,440
name for that brendan and it is vandals like you're a hooligan at that point they have another name

118
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:31,120
for that it is november well no as long as you do something spooky before 11 59 and 59 seconds

119
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:38,080
but if you're good but then it's basically we're talking about a spooky purge yeah all my favorite

120
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,600
romantic comedies revolve around like a guy just trying to find a girl that he can spook before

121
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,400
midnight just gotta find somebody really sneak up behind him and give him a good scare well he was

122
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,360
cursed and he was told if he didn't spook by midnight spook true love true spook he would die

123
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,120
it's true it is true that did happen that's not a movie that's real it was called true spook that

124
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,400
event in real life well again it wasn't a movie it was a real event that we all refer to as true

125
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:11,360
spook you remember i read about it on snopes how do i make this is from dr g how do i make glasses

126
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,440
work with my costume i don't have contacts you gotta play through the pain baby i know this

127
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,320
feels i know how this works because i i have a beard and as a bearded man you either have the

128
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,640
option to like choose a costume that is spectacled or you are you know wolverine but with glasses

129
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,040
you know what i mean you're you're dumbledore but with oh you're nerdy wolverine yeah oh i'm

130
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,880
just travis i'm a wolverine thing but like everybody's got these things like unless you're

131
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:46,880
like a super like hot guy or girl you are probably like every halloween costume i think of like am

132
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,880
i gonna go as wolverine no i'm gonna go as husky wolverine like where i want to go is like uh

133
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,880
frankenfurter from rocky horror picture show no i'm gonna go as husky frankenfurter like it you

134
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,440
gotta people have to know that it's just it's just for laughs you know in the end in the end

135
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,920
it's not though it's serious it's serious i met um i met a couple of my neighbors last night and

136
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,040
they invited um a few of us to their halloween party and like last night was the first time i

137
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,600
met them and this will be the second time i see them and they i imagine they're gonna go hard i

138
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,880
don't know how hard they're gonna be and it's it's very stressful this idea of costume like

139
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,640
competition the original plan is we're going to drive in and we're gonna go see hocus pocus

140
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,600
driving you don't need a costume at the drive-in but now unless you want to cosplay as one of the

141
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:44,800

162
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:41,200
guys but nobody recognized us outside of a single uh trio of friends we ran into at a bar who dressed

163
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,600
up like bob and lynda and there was jean there dressed up as bee squash that shit was dope but

164
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,080
otherwise nobody like i i i was on a bad streak there of putting a lot of effort in costumes and

165
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,480
getting absolutely no recognition which is why we do it i showed up one year to a party and

166
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,960
did some bar hopping as a contestant from legends of the hidden temple and i like bought a blue

167
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,800
barracuda shirt and i had like the gold helmet and the knee pads and everything fucking nobody

168
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:13,040
nobody zero buddies i i couldn't i most of mine really work um i i'm pretty good at this whole

169
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,520
halloween costume but you can be good at putting together a costume and still not have anybody know

170
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,680
who the fuck you are and best costumes that have ever like succeeded with people going oh my god

171
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:30,480

172
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,920
and it cost like zero money and then i did done you just you just murdered some people yeah and

173
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:43,440
i did quail man and it only took me ruining a green sweater i uh when in my mid teens i saw

174
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,760
the indie film six strings samurai but a guy who looked like buddy holly uh traveling around a

175
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,440
wasteland with a sword and a guitar on his back and i thought man that is a cool movie so for

176
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,640
halloween that year i dressed as uh well husky six string samurai and uh just ended up being

177
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,360
i didn't have a guitar at the time so i just a guy in a black suit with a sword on his back

178
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,320
and then you're just samurai buddy holly not that anybody would have gotten it like the other way

179
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:17,920
oh i know that one kind of art house i'm into it indie smash uh yeah costumes are a real nightmare

190
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,440
it was both a bad costume and a bad bit i would have been happy if either one had panned out

191
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,680
i would have been thrilled i'm looking at some tweets right now about being gauzy is there

193
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:49,680
says ben yeah that's pretty good uh i got a question from i'm just picking one at random here

194
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,960
you know there's a lot of questions about candy corn a lot of people are really down on candy corn

195
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,560
i just guess i guess i just need to touch in with you guys about candy corn uh what's your what are

196
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,520
your feelings on me personally i don't think it's as bad as everybody makes it out to be you know

197
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,840
sometimes it's kind of it's got a satisfying chew and it's got a waxy quality that i i kind of like

198
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,560
i kind of feel like i'm punishing myself when i eat it and i guess i really like it i think it's a

199
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,680
real chore do you think what do you think is a chore about it travis what's like biting off the

200
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,080
little segments and see if they're different flavors they don't have i did justin and then

201
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:33,200
i became a man and put away such childish things now i only eat food for sustenance to live to live

202
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,360
and it's candy corn is like eating sugary candles and i don't have time for that shit i eat i eat my

203
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,720
soylent and then i'm back out there working for money none of this is true right i'm just i'm out

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,160

as part of my not slash gimmick whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa this is the most this

221
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,720
is the most important advice we're gonna give don't do this thing don't do any of this thing

222
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,320
can we okay no no this is this is the question what costume could this person possibly be wearing

223
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,640
or touching a trick or treater is like you just won't get what the costume is unless they are

224
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,360
touching a trick or treater what's the character from babes in toyland they're like catchy's kids

225
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:54,960
in a giant night kid getter cake getter what about child spider and it's a spider for children

226
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,080
oh you're a spider no no no watch no look you get it now oh you're a child spider some sort

227
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,480
of child spider i'm guessing yeah you got it maybe you got bozo the clown and you have to

228
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,400
keep redirecting the idiot kids towards the buckets in the grand prize game like no dip

229
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,480
shit it's over there you were so far off i hate you do people still do that where like you have

230
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,960
to like go through the grand prize game on bozo's super sunday show they do not no i mean like a

231
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,200
spooky haunted porch thing to get to that can't like walk through these plastic bags and then you

232
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,360
can have this the candy and it's like man listen this is a simple one in one out transaction i say

233
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,360
trick or treat you hand me the candy i say thank you i leave the porch i leave the porch jonathan's

234
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,160
monster tweeted what's the worst halloween costume related goof slash disaster you've

235
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,920
had oh had i thought i said heard because if it was heard i was gonna say that last question

236
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,160
uh there's a question here from arrogant wanderer who says my friends are celebrating halloween as

237
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,760
couples they're all in relationships and want me to go should i i'm single the answer is absolutely

238
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,240
yes well wait hold on what do you mean they're celebrating as cut like they're just going to

239
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,800
get together in a circle as couples and be like nice like are they going to a party are they going

240
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:12,720
to a scary movie so what do you mean they're they're probably just going together like to

241
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,800
trick or treat together as couples because you get twice the candy as adult couples holding bags

242
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,040
we're adult couples so we could carry all the candy we're hollow tonight high five we don't

243
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:28,400
even have to go back and switch out bags or nothing i love being married and i love having

244
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,200
a significant other in my life the only thing that is made harder is the costume

245
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,240
yeah thing because it's like there's a lot of things that i come up with are like oh that would

246
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,680
be a killer costume for me because it has to be the right fit you know this has to be something

247
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:49,920
you can you can live with but it a lot of times it's like really dynamic guy and then so what

248
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,000
i'll just be in a dress or something you know what i mean like or or or the reverse right like

249
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
if she dresses as buffy and i'm gonna dress as like what zander i'm gonna wear a hawaiian shirt

250
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,640
like that's i don't i don't have that problem because teresa has been dorothy from the wizard

251
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:13,200
of oz since she was like six for every halloween that's easy god i wish i had she has a costume

252
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,520
in storage halloween comes it's dorothy time and she puts it away for next year god i wish i

253
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,600
thought to do that yeah fuck i wish i thought because of this one it's just established like

254
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,520
it's not weird right it's just the thing that she does if i try to do that in a couple like i'm an

255
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,840
oddball but if i've been doing it for years it's like my thing yeah oh god that's it's genius um

256
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,680
i want to talk about the question that we addressed for a moment john jonathan's monster

257
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,040
about the worst halloween costume related goof slash disaster you pack because i don't know if

258
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,120
i ever talked about this on the show but the year i lived in chicago me and my roommates like went

259
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:53,440
around the town we went to a couple parties uh and did it up chicago style baby deep dish

260
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,200
only i put off getting a halloween costume until the day of and so i went to the halloween supply

261
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,280
store next to the trader joe's uh in roscoe village and i rolled up there and it was pretty barren and

262
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,040
the only thing i could find that i enjoyed was the costume from kickass the hit movie kickass

263
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,560
and comic book kickass so i bought it but they didn't have my size they only had a size smaller

264
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:22,880
than i wore i was like oh that's probably okay that costume is spandex and it was basically

265
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,560
it was basically what it was

266
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,640
so kind of like turned my whole body into like some sort of dick museum

267
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,200
like i was so proud lights highlighting it the glass and like a little placard like donated by

268
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,680
griffin and it basically was just like hey guys how's it going nice to meet you i'm real uncomfortable

269
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:56,000
and i'm very cold and yeah thanks for asking that is my dick so um i went to a party uh the first

270
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,520
party we went to and i checked out the situation and i never checked out your situation yeah it

271
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,480
was a bad situation so fortunately i reached into the backpack that i had the foresight to bring in

272
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:13,040
case that i did not feel confident enough to pull this bold look off and i went in their bathroom

273
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:19,200
and i put jeans on underneath the costume and then i just looked like a weirdly dumpy legged kickass

274
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,200
it was bad bad beat griff it was a bad beat it was a bad beat and a bad year and the costume cost me

275
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:34,640
like 60 dollars last year teresa and i worked uh in a haunted house that uh was in a very rich

276
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,200
family's garage there's this company that like basically comes in and they throw big halloween

277
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:48,720
parties and they build like really um let's say uh you know thrown together how uh haunted houses

278
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,600
in people's garages and uh teresa and i were scaring in it and uh an eight-year-old ballerina

279
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,640
came out walked out to me i jumped out oh she looked at me looked at me and reached up and

280
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,480
smacked me real hard in the face fuck yeah and then i had to like go up to my boss and complain

281
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,520
about the eight-year-old ballerina that hit me in the face and how i didn't want to do it anymore

282
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,760
is it because you didn't scare her good enough no well it was like her eighth time through i

283
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,040
think you know she'd seen it she'd been she'd been around she knows how where the scares are

284
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:27,360
ah i love that punk shit that's dope i mean don't hit obviously that's like that's rule number one

285
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,080
for me just like in life guys if you listen seriously don't hit but that shit rules well

286
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,120
it's already demoralizing enough to be the person scaring in a haunted house because it's just like

287
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,880
you you like have it's not i don't know what type of person does it and feels rewarded though i

288
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,560
imagine there are those people but i do it and i'm just like ugh i know like best case scenario i

289
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,200
just scared the shit out of someone worst case scenario i jumped out and went and they just

290
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,000
looked at me and walked past like there's not a good feeling that can occur unless you scare

291
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,200
someone and they go oh thank you thank you for that i feel alive for the first time wonderful

292
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,760
spooking that was real top-notch spooking only now do i appreciate the things in life that have

349
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:47,040
teeth of a wolf banana but two of the sharp teeth are longer like a dracula okay and then he does

350
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,320
have some bandages but those are just covering wounds they're not like his clothes he has other

351
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:59,920
regular clothes on and if you see him it's too late once you see him you've initiated the bond

352
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:08,080
is he sexy he can be depends on what you're into huh i can't tell i can't and also it depends on

353
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,480
like what he's wearing and like how he's done his hair and if he's like been taking care of himself

354
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:19,040
you can't discount confidence that's so right right now i'm wearing like a shitty polo right

355
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,200
now and some old jeans because i need to do laundry as soon as we're done like i i'm a little

356
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,200
greasy because my fans turned off in the room like i'm not sexy right now can i get sexy sure

357
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,880
and the same as you know you're right i didn't mean to pass it like pass it as just a blanket

358
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,000
statement does he have the capacity to appear sexy yeah of course feels like everyone everyone

359
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,080
does everyone does you know that's such a good point griffin yeah what does he do to uh teens

360
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:48,080
if he kept well i told i told you well you you see him he forms the bond once the bond is formed

361
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:55,360
it's unbroken until one of the two of you dies or until thursday rolls around on thursday it resets

362
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:00,000
thursday next or like because like it is like the coming thursday or it's it's the shitty thing

363
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,040
right trav if you get bonded on thursday you've got to wait until the next thursday oh that's

364
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,760
that's weak that's the worst but if it's like wednesday night like if it's wednesday and you

365
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,400
get and there's this uh death man like knock on the door um which is just like a regular knock

366
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,600
but there's a lot of whaling then go you can open it because like you do only have like a few hours

367
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:25,200
so you're gonna have to deal with this fucking guy but do it before it turns midnight or like it's a

368
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,520
whole thing but watch out if he touches you don't let him touch don't let him what happens if he

369
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:36,560
touches you oh boy you are in for it like what what happens don't leave me a suspense well you're

370
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:44,800
gonna start getting thinner oh no wait like like an unsettlingly thinner like the movie thinner

371
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,440
no not that fast but you are going to lose a little bit of weight but then after but then

372
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,520
like so far after the cycle you're gonna regain that weight you're gonna be back to the normal

373
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,840
weight that you were so frustrating it's really very very frustrating because you just went out

374
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,680
and bought those new pants for yourself that you liked so much guess what you got to return those

375
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,880
and while you're on your way back to the gap to return those pants you get hit by a truck and die

376
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,360
oh no no what a twist that's how that's how death man gets you one of the interesting things about

377
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,880
death man is that i thought when you said his name uh which i recall correctly is death man

378
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,600
yeah he would like like his touch would like kill you like it would kill you to touch him it does

379
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,040
it was but like very indirect it's very like final destination stuff it is if if the final

380
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,880
destination of every death in the movie was like guys we gotta stop returning these pants

381
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,440
just to eat the loss okay no i hey mom i thought you said we were heading home oh yeah i just

382
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,360
remember we had to return the jeans at the gap no they don't even give you cash to give you

383
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:50,320
store credit yeah that's as good as cash idiot um anyway uh that was a good bit and the next

384
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,840
middle see if we can get something good out of this i want to tell you guys about oh shit i've

why not get two wands and then you and your lady can both do magic quest that's a great it's a

440
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,840
great as opposed to just making your weight in the car that's really fucked up and maybe the first

441
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,280
time because you want to scout it out yourself before like you do because what if it's not fun

450
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:13,280
dracula whoa whoa really yeah and so i think that there's maybe like a little bit of chip

451
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:22,000
on his shoulder because everybody knows dracula i'm biz and i'm teresa and we host one bad mother

455
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:49,600
maximum fun.org i want to make a point okay we said we're gonna split this right now there would

456
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:57,840
be absolutely nothing crazier than an episode of this program if it's 50 minutes of halloween content

457
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:04,880
and 10 minutes of non-halloween content for i guess for non-observers to try to make it like a

458
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:11,200
pan religious thing oh don't worry we have a non-halloween option that's just it's weird

459
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:19,440
it's weird way to the back can i change a yahoo to be halloween themed oh this okay this one's

460
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,760
about fear perfect how about this this one was sent in by zoe kinsky thank you zoe climbing

461
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:34,320
that ladder it's by yahoo answers user anonymous they ask um charm jarmel charm moosh charm moosh

462
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:41,760
asks silly irrational fears and how to overcome them i can't remember when i first found out about

463
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,080
this fear but it feels like i've been suffering from it for years it was rational it would be

464
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:52,160
okay but it's far from rational uh basically i'm absolutely terrified such disturbed repulsed by the

465
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:59,520
extinct shark called megalodon nope not great whites or any living shark just a long dead fish

466
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,240
it wasn't a huge problem as i could avoid seeing hearing anything about the creature pretty easily

467
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,120
that is until i went to south carolina and there was a skeleton recast there and that was enough

468
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,200
to get me to weeping my friends even after explaining it to them found this hilarious and

469
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:19,760
have since been sending me funny megalodon pictures anyway they can despite it frightening the hell

470
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:25,200
out of me uh they say it's a stupid fear and i need grow up and i know they are right but that

471
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,440
doesn't stop the hysterics the panic the tears the nightmares how can i overcome this i feel like the

472
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:36,800
more exposure i get to the extinct animal the more hypersensitive i become i okay i the the fact

473
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:43,200
that you encountered a megalodon uh-huh even though you know you have a paralyzing fear of

474
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:50,240
megalodons is insane do you know how easy it is to avoid megalodon related content just check on

475
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:56,560
yelp and look where it says megalodon statue yes or no yes or no and then if it says yes just don't

476
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:03,360
go there and also can i say real gold star friends when they see you weeping at the site and they're

477
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:08,800
like let's send her some photos looks like you found a glowing weak point it's this giant old

478
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:18,080
ass fish wow guys if i saw somebody weeping at the skeleton of a megalodon i would laugh

479
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:24,480
like a misinformed racist man at the don rickles show like i i the only way you can turn that is

480
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,200
like somebody comes up to you are you crying you go yeah i'm just sad they're all gone such a sad

481

00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,560
him while they were alive can i can i devil's advocate here real quick i fucking get it imagine

484
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,560
being a caveman person or something you're swimming in the ocean having a beach party

485
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,880
you see one of those things as soon as you see one of those things it's you're done their mouths

486
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:00,080
are their mouths are so big i just want to jump in and say that caveman beach party usa is already

487
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:05,600
copyrighted by my copyright and mailed it to myself death man cave caveman beach party and

488
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,160
the other thing that we said we're going to copyright dracula cop all definitely definitely

489
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:16,080
copy written biteless protection program that's probably what oh nice that was under the cover of

490
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:21,440
night what did you hear when i said bite let's protect no no i'm giving you a tackling that's

491
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:28,400
the tagline okay undercover of night is the tagline well you guys did the title and tagline

492
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,920
so i guess i'll just do the whole script the tagline is he's wearing a cape behind the drapes

493
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:41,040
biteless protection program colon colon undercover of night he's like peeking through

494
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:46,880
the drapes oh and his partner's name is night with a k this is a good movie can we get can

495
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:52,480
we get a plot line in there about how he's recently divorced from death man yes we can

496
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:59,360
griffin crossover hit of the summer and also and also deadpool is there yeah is megalodon

497
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,640
they were just king shit of fuck mountain huh like i'm trying to imagine that way he's gonna

498
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,880
step to him like we're at the top of the food chain right but a shark will still eat our ass

499
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:14,720
because if we get careless for like a second well if we do if we do anything seal like right um

500
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:22,320
um nothing can eat a megalodon except a bigger megalodon okay but still a megalodon um super

501
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:28,000
megalodon were they just on top of shit were they just sort of rule how did how did they go extinct

502
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,720
that's the ultimate carelessness they they just became whales well i don't think that's just sort

503
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:42,160
of scientifically sound i think the more logical thing is that they they thought it was so sweet

504
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:48,880
when they ate stuff that because it was that they ate too much stuff oh we're stuff to eat

505
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:54,640
you know what i mean they created so did yeah well i got that they got they got the megalobetes

511
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:34,320
spurling thank you rachel it's by yahoo answers user mother green who asks

512
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:39,200
what would batman think of marijuana would he look down on people who use it

513
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:46,320
this is like a random question that popped in my head also i'm bull boo word nice um good

514
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:51,200
like what would he think of people with anxiety using it or any other medical condition

515
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,960
adds a really interesting twist there because at first you hear the question you're like

516
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,240
i don't know if he likes to party or not this is a tough question but then he adds another layer

517
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:07,360
of what if you needed it what if it was medical herb riddle me this batman what do you think of

518
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:14,000
that dank herb but for medical use i think it all depends on what else you're doing like that's a

519
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:22,640
good answer man marijuana seems like a low-hanging fruit but if the penguin's like i wear this this

520
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:28,080
monocle for my glaucoma like and he also smokes pot i think he's going to go with that i don't

521
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:33,360
also smoke spot i think he's going to try to bust oh i thought he will probably add it to the list

522
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:39,120
of charges oh i see i see what you're saying if he runs into the penguin he's smoking that big fat

523
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:46,320
old kush rod um and he slaps it he's like what the fuck we're in portland it's totally cool he's

524
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:53,200
like no it's for the the robberies oh okay good point i did do those do you want to do like chill
