1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:52,720
Oh man, I can feel it.

6
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,360
You know, until you hit the second part of that verse, it's very confusing.

7
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,840
Yeah.

8
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,240
Every human heart will shudder.

9
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,720
Still could be Tim Curry talking about fucking.

10
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,560
Every soul will shake with fear.

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,000
Less about fucking, but...

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,560
Tonight, the creepiest. Tonight, the scariest.

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:33,040
Tonight, the most wonderful night.

14
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,720
Oh yeah, buttery.

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,320
Oh, oh.

16
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,920
Oh, ah yeah.

17
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,200
I have goose flesh, and I'm also rock hard all over.

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,600
Yeah.

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,200
Anything can happen on Halloween.

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,600
Your dog could turn into a cat.

21
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,840
There's a surprising, you're doing a surprising amount.

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,240
Maybe a toad in your bass guitar.

23
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,880
Oh, your sister could turn into a bat.

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,760
That's the end of fair use.

25
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,360
Christmas time brings the snow.

26
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,320
Summertime brings the sun.

27
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,480
But on Halloween, your blood begins to run.

28
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,680
There's something spooky going down now.

29
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,320
Anything can happen on Halloween.

30
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,280
We owe them a tremendous amount of money now.

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,440
It's better than a video.

32
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,640
Is this fair use?

33
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,360
No, not at all.

34
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,720
Gremlin's gonna mess up every cassette from London to Idaho.

35
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,320
April 1st can be fun.

36
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,080
New Year's Eve is a bore.

37
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,760
But on Halloween, your flesh begins to crawl.

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,160
Oh, I'm losing control now.

39
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,440
Anything can happen on Halloween.

40
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,960
Your toenails go wrong and your hair turns green.

41
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,520
What?

42
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,800
Your teacher could become a sardine.

43
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,280
What?

44
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,160
Your dentist could turn into a queen.

45
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,000
Anybody seen my tambourine?

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,360
I might start playing.

47
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,560
I've been fighting a fucking tambour.

48
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,880
I'm gonna play and begin the begin.

49
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,240
The craziest night you've ever seen.

50
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:32,960
This hairy, scary, creepy, crawly Halloween.

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:39,440
So that was from the worst switch, the 1986 version, not the new one.

52
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,440
And that was produced by HBO.

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,760
So this might be the last episode of My Brother, My Brother.

54
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,520
I mean, I think they probably fight for the protection of their properties.

55
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm pretty sure that's fair use.

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't think singing the entire song,

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,160
somebody could just cut that and put it up on Spotify

58
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,040
and then we'd get all of Tim Curry's money on that one.

59
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,720
So do you want to introduce the show

60
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,640
or do you think that pretty much summed it up?

61
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,360
I'm Justin McElroy, the best witch.

62
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,160
I'm Travis McElroy.

63
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,640
I'm okay.

64
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,360
I do okay as far as witching goes.

65
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,360
I'm neither top nor bottom.

66
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,640
I would say I am a mediocre witch.

67
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,520
I'm Griffin McElroy.

68
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,320
I'm a sandwich.

69
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,320
Sandwich.

70
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,880
I get it.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,440
Very good, Griffin.

72
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,320
Jesus, Juice.

73
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,160
That was, I didn't think you would really do the whole, the whole track.

74
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,640
Once I get started, I can't stop.

75
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,600
It's so good.

76
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,240
And now your voice is sort of extra gravelly.

77
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,600
It's been touched by Tim.

78
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,160
Justin's going to be in that deep register,

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,680
touched by Tim the whole recording.

80
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,400
I need a little bit of this Taco Bell diet Pepsi.

81
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,080
Live moss.

82
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,560
So this is an advice show for the Modron era.

83
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,240
I don't know why I'm the one that has to say this stuff

84
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,560
where we take your questions and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

85
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,760
Free breath.

86
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,480
Yeah.

87
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,600
Well, this is our extra special spooky Halloween crawly episode.

88
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,760
Our All Hallows' Eve, our Samhain, our Dia de los Muertos episode.

89
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,640
Sure.

90
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,920
Our other, there's gotta be more trick or treat.

91
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,960
That's not a real-

92
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,320
Robber's Day is celebrated in some places.

93
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,960
So-

94
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,320
All Saints Day.

95
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,600
All Saints Day.

96
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,560
And it's not Candle Nights yet, though.

97
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,760
It's coming around the corner, though.

98
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,040
I feel-

99
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,800
Unless it is Candle Nights for you.

100
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,600
It might be.

101
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,480
Well, that's true.

102
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,000
Right now, it's just Pumpkin Days.

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,600
Pumpkin Days and Scarecrow Nights.

104
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,240
You know what I mean?

105
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,920
D-A-Z-E.

106
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,960
That is me.

107
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,160
I am in a Pumpkin Days.

108
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,360
In a Pumpkin Days,

109
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,440
because everything's got that pumpkin spice in it.

110
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,000
Am I right?

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,520
The other day, I had pumpkin spice flavored gas in my car.

112
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,360
So what it sounds like, and let's be careful here

113
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,200
because Travis might be on the verge of establishing

114
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,720
some permanent bim bam lore,

115
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,320
but sounds like you want to add to the agenda Pumpkin Days.

116
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,200
D-A-Z-E.

117
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,000
All one word.

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,240
And this is a precursor to Candle Nights

119
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,920
that can last in any amount of time when it's over.

120
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,440
This has a finite beginning.

121
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,400
The beginning of Pumpkin Days is when Starbucks brings back

122
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,920
the pumpkin spice latte.

123
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,520
I don't like giving them that amount of control.

124
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,280
That feels awful commercial to me.

125
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:19,760
I know.

126
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,840
But listen, we're at a point now we've sold out.

127
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,400
I want to talk about something other than pumpkins.

128
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,840
Well, pumpkins.

129
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,120
Not pumpkin flavor.

130
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,240
I think pumpkin flavor we've covered pretty well.

131
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,760
As a people, we've all talked about

132
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,440
how we feel about pumpkin flavor.

133
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,400
And it's very fun.

134
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
The reason we keep talking about it is it's very funny

135
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,040
to make a joke about this hot, sweet beverage.

136
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,040
I want to talk about pumpkins.

137
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,800
Okay.

138
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,120
Yeah.

139
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,360
Okay, so I drove around-

140
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,240
What even are they?

141
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,200
Big potatoes?

142
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,240
No one's quite sure.

143
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,240
I drove around my neighborhood,

144
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,640
and while some people have Halloween decorations,

145
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,480
which is terrifically spooky,

146
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,280
there's a lot of people who have just put a pumpkin

147
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,160
on their porch.

148
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,280
And I think that that's great and festive.

149
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,360
But I do have to think about this.

150
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,480
It's every pumpkin's first Halloween.

151
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,320
That must be so confusing.

152
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,640
So you sit sort of at a patch with all your buds,

153
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,880
and then someone brings you home

154
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,440
and just puts you on their porch.

155
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,920
And they're like, well, that'll do.

156
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,880
And then they walk away.

157
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,320
As a pumpkin, what are you expected to do?

158
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,760
It must be very confusing.

159
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,480
What is your role if you're a pumpkin in that scenario?

160
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,640
This is feeling a lot like a new Pixar DreamWorks film,

161
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,560
but maybe an extremely bad one.

162
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
So maybe it's actually just a weird,

163
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,400
secular episode of Veggie Tales.

164
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,280
So Justin, if I can make sure I get this straight,

165
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,600
you're worried about the pumpkin's experience in all this.

166
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,000
How is the pumpkin experiencing Halloween?

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,240
I don't want to personify it too much

168
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,520
because obviously things get a little rougher

169
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,520
for the pumpkin before they get better.

170
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

171
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,920
And by which they never get better

172
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,080
because they don't get put back in the patch.

173
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,920
I think if you do get the Jack O'Lantern treatment,

174
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,040
at least you know where you stand with your owners.

175
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,600
At least you know it's a contentious relationship

176
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,280
and nothing is expected of you.

177
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,920
Yeah, Justin's saying this relationship is,

178
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,440
you were in a field and now you sit in front of my house

179
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,880
and you're just gonna chill there

180
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,440
until neighborhood tubs come and smash you.

181
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,880
Right, if it's a Jack O'Lantern,

182
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,120
the pumpkin's like, oh, I get it, I'm being murdered.

183
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,640
Yeah, and what do you think the pumpkin-

184
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,720
I'm performance art, I get it.

185
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,640
And what do you think the pumpkin thinks

186
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,560
when they cook them into a pie

187
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,920
and sees other food getting cooked

188
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,080
and the food's like, oh no, I'm getting cooked.

189
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,640
Like the funny cartoon sort of sex romp

190
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,560
that the super bad guy made.

191
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,000
I just think it's confusing.

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,760
I think that pumpkins are confused.

193
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,960
I mean, like the trees, at least they're a tree.

194
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,040
You just have to tree and they put pretty stuff on you.

195
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,640
I get that, I get that.

196
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,120
But I think for a pumpkin it's like-

197
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,160
Do you mean Christmas tree?

198
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,480
You mean Christmas tree makes sense, we get it.

199
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,760
Christmas tree makes sense, I get it.

200
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,600
You're decorating a tree, I get it.

201
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,400
But the pumpkins are just like, you're food,

202
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,800
but I'm gonna keep your eye here, if that's okay.

203
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,640
And what do the rabbits think on Easter

204
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,760
when I bring them into my house

205
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,800
and I put the little Easter hats on them for the holiday

206
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
and I put an egg up inside them?

207
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,640
Yeah, and what about the Arbor Day celery?

208
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,520
You know what I mean?

209
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,120
That's gotta be confusing for the celery.

210
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,120
Bunnies don't even lay eggs.

211
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,080
You ever think about that?

212
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,440
That's why I have to put one in, in there.

213
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,000
Wait, hold on.

214
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,520
What the fuck do you think

215
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,520
we're coloring all these eggs for, Trav?

216
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,520
Just to have a bunch of loose eggs all over the place?

217
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,200
No, it's to finish the illusion,

218
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,160
it's to complete the art, complete the egg.

219
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
I guess I got egg on my face.

220
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,120
We gotta tell a joke at some point,

221
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,240
we're like 10 minutes in.

222
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,520
So far all we've done is sing a Tim Curry song

223
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,120
and then done a bunch of,

224
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,880
we've just said a lot of sentences,

225
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,360
but they haven't had a sort of traditional joke construction.

226
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,680
I feel like if more people around the podcast

227
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,280
had leaned in with my great pumpkin material,

228
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,400
that it would have caught fire.

229
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,440
I would just sort of scattering tinder on the ground,

230
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,800
hoping that someone would come along

231
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,840
and light it into a comforting comedy blaze.

232
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,200
So should we do a question?

233
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,640
Yeah, it seems, I mean, that might work.

234
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,840
Oh, I do wanna say,

235
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,560
so I was putting questions together for this episode.

236
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,440
We did not announce like we're gonna do a Halloween special,

237
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,520
but y'all just sent in some questions

238
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,120
intentionally Halloween spooky,

239
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,160
but some questions that were just naturally spooky

240
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,480
and it makes me wonder if maybe the world is just scary

241
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,640
all the time and it's Halloween to notice.

242
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,920
Yeah, weird, yeah, weird.

243
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,800
You just noticed now, okay.

244
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,160
Here's the first question.

245
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Earlier, I was speaking to my brother

246
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,400
and he stopped in the middle of the conversation,

247
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,680
stared me dead in the eyes

248
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,120
and ripped out the pockets of his jeans.

249
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,640
I've never been more terrified by a human's raw power.

250
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,080
The strength of not only him ripping the fabric out of his pants

251
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,480
as he was still wearing them,

252
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,760
but also these are his favorite pants

253
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,120
and he still wears them.

254
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,160
Should I confront him or immediately go

255
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,680
and search for a priest?

256
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,840
That's from thank you for your time,

257
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,600
but I fear by the time you see this,

258
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,480
he will have come from my own pockets, Gmail.

259
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,800
I don't know, I mean, this is certainly startling.

260
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,400
I don't know if this is Halloween spooky.

261
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,280
I don't think your brother is the pocket man

262
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,520
and there they go.

263
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,560
This does make me think,

264
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,440
you know, it's easy for us when we watch a horror movie

265
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,240
and you see someone acting strangely in the movie

266
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,160
and you, the observer are like,

267
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,760
why doesn't this person realize that something's off

268
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,280
with the clearly something's off?

269
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,120
But then you see this story and it's like,

270
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,200
you know what, maybe they're just like,

271
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,960
well, that's my weird brother

272
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,800
who rips the pockets out of his jeans.

273
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,640
And he's like, no, he was possessed.

274
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,280
He was possessed.

275
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,000
Why didn't you see it?

276
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,320
Like anyone watching the movie of Question Askers Life

277
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,160
was like, get out of the house.

278
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,880
What I think happened here is,

279
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,400
cause really there's no reason to rip pockets

280
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,000
off of your jeans.

281
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,440
I am convinced that the only reason

282
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,920
we are all wearing pants is because of the pockets

283
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,080
so we can have a place to carry our yo-yos in.

284
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,680
But I think maybe the pockets were maybe loose already.

285
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,440
And as a fun stunt or a sort of superiority play,

286
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,600
your brother just weirded out Yankovic

287
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,680
those bad boys right off the pants.

288
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,960
I am more impressed.

289
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,800
I am, okay, let's take a quick poll.

290
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,760
What's more impressive?

291
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,520
The raw power of rending the pockets from the jeans

292
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,040
or the sort of like devil may care,

293
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,160
throw caution to the wind nihilism

294
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,920
of saying I don't need pockets

295
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,760
because I, Justin McElroy, I need pockets desperately.

296
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,320
Oh yes.

297
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,000
Like I think non-pockets would be insta-trash

298
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,520
for my jeans if they didn't have pockets.

299
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,160
Human beings need pockets so badly.

300
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,240
We invented fanny packs.

301
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,640
Yep.

302
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,880
Like we had to get additional pockets

303
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,480
to strap onto our pants.

304
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,040
Nobody looks at a cargo pant and says

305
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,000
that will make people very attracted to me.

306
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,880
They think I have a full-size original Game Boy

307
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,320
and damn it, oops, I have four of them

308
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,880
and now I have a home for all of them and this is great.

309
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,920
If you imagine it from this person's perspective,

310
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,800
it would be pretty terrifying.

311
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,880
Yeah, especially if there's some kind of noise

312
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,000
associated with the tear.

313
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,640
Like there's a, he did it and then he dropped right back to.

314
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,880
So anyways, yeah, Garden's a gallon ticket too.

315
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,680
I really liked it.

316
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,280
It's like, no, what just happened?

317
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,600
We gotta, it's gotta be the rear.

318
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,800
I'm looking at my own pants now

319
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,160
and I would encourage everybody at home

320
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,000
to think of this as your own self.

321
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,600
I can't really tear the front pockets out of my pants

322
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,080
because they are part of it.

323
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,080
It's not like I have a pocket on top of it.

324
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,200
Like I do, the back pockets are just like a flap

325
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,440
that's buttoned up over the butt of my jeans fabric.

326
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,040
That is not true for the front pocket.

327
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
So this had to be a rear pocket situation,

328
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,960
which I think only makes this more confusing for me.

329
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,640
Oh, see, I was picturing like the fabric sleeve,

330
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
the fabric- The fabric sleeves,

331
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,000
whatever it means, for sure.

332
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,080
The pocket remain, the outside,

333
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,560
but if you're taking like the inner guts of the pocket out,

334
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
maybe this person is planning-

335
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,160
He wants to do a secret jerk off.

336
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,360
Well, I wasn't gonna say that, Griffin, but sure.

337
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,160
Your brother's nasty.

338
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,280
Why would he do this before you?

339
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,640
Because now it's gonna be like,

340
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,480
uh-oh, someone's doing a secret jerk off.

341
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,000
We need clues, Mindhunter.

342
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,120
Oh, I know.

343
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,160
I think I know the culprit.

344
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,600
He did it fucking right in front of me,

345
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,480
ripped them right out.

346
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,280
I think it would be, maybe he's like

347
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,280
kind of a Gallagher sort of person or a carrot top.

348
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,960
And he's got a bit where he's like,

349
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,520
I'm trying to find my keys.

350
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,960
And if he did this,

351
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,200
he could just keep reaching deeper and deeper into the pockets.

352
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,280
It would be pretty good if he's like,

353
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,320
no, that's not there.

354
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,520
Nope, nope, that's not there.

355
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,560
No, that's my knee.

356
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,280
Huh, weird.

357
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,480
And then eventually he would probably fall over.

358
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,640
I'm trying to imagine what the punchline is.

359
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,080
He put like really deep pockets.

360
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,920
You're like, okay, you ripped the pocket out.

361
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,880
But then from his knee, he pulls out the keys.

362
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,920
And it's like, holy shit.

363
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,360
He has the world's deepest pocket.

364
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,040
Maybe he's like installing, oh, okay.

365
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,680
Jeans makers, as far as your arm goes down,

366
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,080
that's how long pockets should be from now on.

367
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,880
Man, I love that.

368
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,560
I could get so many runts in there.

369
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm gonna do a little experiment.

370
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,640
Like we're on a Bill Nye show

371
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,800
and I'm gonna try to tear the fucking fabric

372
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,240
out of my pants pocket right now.

373
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,040
I'll try mine too.

374
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,320
I'm wearing pajama pants.

375
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,520
I love the pants I'm wearing.

376
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,520
They're some of my favorite brown pants from the Gap,

377
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,480
but I'll still try it.

378
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,760
So Juice, you wanna go same time?

379
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

380
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,080
All right, Trav, count it down.

381
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,280
Three, two, one, rip.

382
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,880
I'm getting some traction.

383
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,920
Listen, listen.

384
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,200
I'm definitely getting some tear.

385
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,680
Kevin, stop.

386
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,240
Think about it.

387
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,040
It's not worth it.

388
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,540
Shut up.

389
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,280
Oh, I'm doing it.

390
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,760
Okay, I'm done.

391
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,320
I'm done, I'm done.

392
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,560
I'm gonna stop.

393
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,320
You can't start and then not fit.

394
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,480
All right, guys, I really love these pants.

395
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,960
They make my butt look like just two hams.

396
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,840
But you're already...

397
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,000
Okay, this is another great move.

398
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,280
Now take those to a tailor or a dry cleaner

399
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,960
and be like, yeah, pocket mishap.

400
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,840
Oh, bummer.

401
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,000
It wasn't the pocket that was tearing.

402
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,680
It was the seam on the side of my pants.

403
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,960
Okay, let's talk about my current look.

404
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,160
Because now it's not like a cool sort of skinned knee look,

405
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,000
you know, like the acid wash cool look.

406
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,920
It's like maybe six inches from the belt down

407
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,320
on the right seam of my pants.

408
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,920
There's a considerable hole

409
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,640
that one might be able to slot a jawbreaker into.

410
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,040
And I'll never be able to explain to anyone

411
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,000
why they are that way.

412
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,880
Can you text a picture?

413
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,080
Yeah, I'll text you a picture right now.

414
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,680
Oh, no, I don't have my phone.

415
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,560
It's charging in the other room.

416
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,400
But do you not trust me that...

417
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:12,960
No, I do.

418
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,760
No, I heard it.

419
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,720
I heard it.

420
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Shit, guys, I really like these pants.

421
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:17,760
Fuck.

422
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,760
All right, well, how about a Yahoo?

423
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,120
Fuck, I'm gonna be sad.

424
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,000
Why did I do that?

425
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,840
I hate peer pressure.

426
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,040
We didn't make you do it.

427
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,920
No peer pressure.

428
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,640
I didn't even suggest it.

429
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,760
Run back the tape.

430
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,720
You brought it up.

431
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,520
I think this is cyber bullying

432
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,560
because we're on a Skype call.

433
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,960
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in

434
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,560
by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

435
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,280
Thank you, Seth.

436
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,840
Shit, man.

437
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,080
Thank you, Seth.

438
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,000
It's Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

439
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,640
Jim Curry asks,

440
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,280
I have to convenience...

441
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,280
Jesus.

442
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,680
I have to convenience my friends on social media

443
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,800
that I have kidney stone.

444
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,800
It's not for attention.

445
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,320
Actually, I failed my exam

446
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,600
and I have to prepare for it

447
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,800
and I feel ashamed.

448
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,080
So I want to give them an excuse

449
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,320
why I'm not going to spend the weekend with them.

450
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,820
Help.

451
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,380
This isn't...

452
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,560
It's...

453
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,000
I think kidney stones,

454
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,880
personally speaking,

455
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,800
is not a rich comedy vein

456
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,680
because I had one once

457
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,200
that they had to surgically remove it.

458
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,920
I think they put,

459
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,520
you know,

460
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,480
little...

461
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,840
little Dennis Quaid in a machine inside my penis

462
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,000
to go up in there and sort of laser blast it.

463
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,400
And it sucked a lot.

464
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:24,880
So it's not...

465
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,040
I'm not necessarily thinking it's the funniest,

466
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,240
but I do think that somebody

467
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,680
trying to sell a fake kidney stone

468
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,160
vis-a-vis 140 or perhaps even 280 character tweets

469
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,040
is good to me.

470
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,680
So can you sort of describe

471
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,760
what the experience of having a kidney stone was like?

472
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,280
Can you sort of describe what the experience of having a kidney stone was like, Griffin?

473
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,920
Yeah, sure.

474
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,360
You know how sometimes-

475
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,320
My body's a temple

476
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,840
and I don't allow that sort of thing.

477
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,240
Your body is a fucking bean hole.

478
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,280
It's a hole that you pour beans into

479
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,560
in order for you to just continue to function.

480
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
Well, isn't that true of all of us, though?

481
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,600
We're all just bean holes

482
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,280
and if you really think about it.

483
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,120
What it was like...

484
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,760
Okay, you know how sometimes you pee is yellow?

485
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,080
Uh-huh.

486
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,240
Yeah.

487
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,040
Yeah.

488
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,360
Nope.

489
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,080
Not this time around.

490
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,360
You know sometimes you pee

491
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,400
and it doesn't feel like you've just been gored by a big, big bull

492
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,280
or hit by a regular size train?

493
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,600
Uh-huh.

494
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,720
Well, that doesn't have to be the case all the time.

495
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,840
I think maybe we could pull this off with a Vine.

496
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,000
We have to bring Vine back in a six-second video

497
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,400
of you doing a vape trick or water bottle challenge

498
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,160
and you do the water bottle challenge and you get it

499
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,560
and you're like,

500
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,000
haha, hell yeah, oh!

501
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,960
And you fall over.

502
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,480
And then the caption of the Vine is like,

503
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,280
lol in the hospital now, had a kidney stone attack.

504
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,280
But did you see that?

505
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,560
Did you see that flip though?

506
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,520
Hashtag dab.

507
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,000
So what color was the pee?

508
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,920
The bad color, Justin.

509
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,520
Let's not.

510
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
People listen to this podcast for pleasure.

511
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,400
I'm just trying to figure out if we could sort of replicate that

512
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,880
with food coloring of some sort

513
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,160
that you could text to your friends,

514
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,600
like guys, I'm freaking out.

515
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,440
You don't go for kidney stone.

516
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,160
You enlist your friends in the diagnosis of it.

517
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,400
So when you do arrive at kidney stone,

518
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,480
it's a win for everybody.

519
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,280
Do you understand?

520
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,160
I do like this.

521
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,160
It's like hashtag lol anybody see Riverdale last night.

522
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,800
So weird.

523
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,360
Also, I have cloudy or foul smelling urine

524
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,520
and persistent need to urinate

525
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,680
and nausea and vomiting lol.

526
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,120
Hashtag jughead.

527
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,680
What a clown.

528
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,520
I'm looking at the Mayo Clinic page for this now.

529
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,800
And it's like, did anybody hear,

530
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,440
anybody got extra tickets to the weekend concert?

531
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,960
Very excited for it.

532
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,840
Also, I'm experiencing-

533
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,720
Who's playing?

534
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,400
Oh, the weekend, but without the second E or the third E.

535
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,560
And also I'm experiencing pain so severe

536
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,880
that I can't sit still or find a comfortable position.

537
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,120
Hashtag hit me back.

538
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,080
I'm available.

539
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,920
Standing tickets are fine.

540
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,520
Does anybody know how cushy the seats are

541
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,400
at the weekend concert?

542
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,320
Maybe you go even further back

543
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,040
and it's not just you talking about the symptoms,

544
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,280
but you set it up for a while in advance

545
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,240
and it's like, haha, anybody get to steak and shake

546
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,520
after the game on Friday?

547
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,800
I'm real excited.

548
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,160
I've been really enjoying my high calcium oxalate diet.

549
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,200
And also I have a family or personal history

550
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,560
of kidney stones, which lol,

551
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,400
I hear is sort of a genetic risk factor.

552
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,760
Lol.

553
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,720
Lol.

554
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,240
Never been a problem for me though.

555
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,200
Lol, I sure have-

556
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,240
Hashtag blessed.

557
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,480
Lol, sure I'm dehydrated, not drinking enough.

558
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,920
I wonder if that's a risk factor

559
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,800
for any sort of condition lol.

560
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,760
Then you loop your friends in like they're like little

561
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,280
little houses and you say like, I don't know,

562
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,320
maybe I've left some clues somewhere in my timeline

563
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,160
where you could help me fix it together.

564
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,880
You could have saved me.

565
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,840
You had all the clues.

566
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,660
Lol.

567
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,020
Lol.

568
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,880
That especially works if he has a friend named Lol.

569
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,640
You could have saved me Lol.

570
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,760
Lol, have I mentioned I've always had gout

571
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,400
and just cannot get enough of all this high sodium,

572
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,840
high oxalate diet, just really getting going for it.

573
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,240
Also I did great on the exam.

574
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,640
Don't even ask.

575
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,560
Also I did very good at the exam.

576
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,560
And I was eating really salty pretzels

577
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,320
while I took the test and they gave me energy

578
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,920
to get 101% and now I'm the teacher.

579
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,280
Kidney stones are intensely, intensely personal.

580
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,720
Maybe you could just have gout.

581
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,640
Yeah, just have gout.

582
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,160
Gout's a way better way to go.

583
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,720
You tell like a 10th grader you've got gout,

584
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,600
they're not going to know what the fuck you're talking about.

585
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,960
Tell them you got the consumption.

586
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,160
I'm a loner.

587
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,320
And you have to move to an arid climate.

588
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,720
I know we were going to play Mario Odyssey all weekend,

589
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,280
but yeah, I've got TB.

590
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,120
I don't know what to say.

591
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,640
Gotta move to the desert.

592
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,000
Y'all I'm thinking about it.

593
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,560
Disquade never did come out.

594
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,400
He's in my wormy somewhere.

595
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,540
Yeah.

596
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,720
Exploring.

597
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,280
Meditating.

598
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,080
Meditating.

599
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,920
He loves, he's very peaceful.

600
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,240
Dennis, please don't, please don't go back.

601
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,400
Please don't go back inside of there, bud.

602
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,760
Oh, shoot, bud.

603
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,800
Oh, no.

604
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,000
You'd make my, don't bud, come on.

605
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,520
Don't make my business explode.

606
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
So on Thursday, I went to a Halloween party

607
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,120
being hosted by a club at my college in full Druid costume.

608
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,040
Very cool mask, the works.

609
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,120
About 45 minutes in, I was informed by a sheepish gentleman

610
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,920
it was, in fact, a club only party, not one hosted by the club.

611
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,440
And I had drastically misunderstood the situation.

612
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,840
Thank God I had not eaten any of their food yet,

613
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,200
and I made a rapid escape, absolutely mortified.

614
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:10,820
Wow.

615
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,080
Well, hold on.

616
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,280
I need just like one second.

617
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,200
There's a lot of, yeah, I'm a, I'm a-

618
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,880
That is like, so brittle.

619
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,680
Oh, God.

620
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:23,680
Oh, that's from, my question is, how do I retrieve my skin?

621
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,920
My question is, how do I retrieve my skeleton

622
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,600
from when it jetpacked directly into the sun and recover?

623
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,800
And that's from question,

624
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,600
worst social anxiety situation ever?

625
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,760
Question mark, no, exclamation point, friend.

626
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,520
That's definitely one of the worst things I've ever-

627
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,520
There couldn't be a worse, unless they were like,

628
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,000
unless, the only way this could have gone worse

629
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,200
is if they'd been like, excuse me, it's,

630
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
and you're like, oh, sorry, club only party?

631
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,320
A funeral, actually, is what you've arrived at as a funeral.

632
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,080
And it's a club only funeral.

633
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,160
It's a club, also it's a club only funeral,

634
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,600
and you're not welcome.

635
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,560
That's the thing, every, every place I go, I'm waiting,

636
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,840
my fear is, I'm waiting in fear for someone to walk up and say,

637
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,840
you're not supposed to be here.

638
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,080
Oh, I can't, I cannot tell you how far

639
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,760
this would set me back as a person.

640
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah.

641
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,880
It's like every, it's been such small increments

642
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,000
in not getting told that I don't belong at any one,

643
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,400
and like, I cannot think of a situation

644
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,320
that line would not work on me.

645
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,200
Especially if I was in costume, that's the thing.

646
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,800
Like, you're not supposed to be here,

647
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,720
and also you clearly spent a lot of time

648
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,000
putting that costume together,

649
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,920
and you're also not supposed to be here.

650
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,320
Like, okay, bye, I'm a hermit now.

651
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,960
I, if we were doing a live show,

652
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,320
and my face was on the marquee of the venue,

653
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,520
and someone was like, actually, you're not supposed to be here,

654
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,000
I would immediately leave and just assume

655
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,240
you guys hired Dustin Diamond or something.

656
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,040
Yeah, Juice, that's who we, yeah, Juice, yeah, Juice.

657
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,720
Good pool, good pool.

658
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,720
Travis, luckily, even though it was a bad pool,

659
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,600
you said pool.

660
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,000
I did.

661
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,520
And so we can all focus on that.

662
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
Yeah, I'm saying cool first.

663
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,680
This reminds me, this occurrence reminds me

664
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,360
of one of my favorite Brent and Travis College stories,

665
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,440
which is, we were trying to branch out,

666
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,520
and meet new people outside of the theater department,

667
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,440
so we went to a party in the science and engineering building

668
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,680
with all the science and engineering kids.

669
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,480
They're all very nice.

670
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,000
We knew nobody.

671
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,680
I knew nobody there.

672
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,520
We were moving around the room,

673
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,200
introducing ourselves, making new friends.

674
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,000
We were thirsty.

675
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,760
We saw a 12-pack of Mountain Dew.

676
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,920
We broke into it, got two Mountain Dews out.

677
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,200
Oh, what a party we said.

678
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,720
And then, about 20, 30 minutes later,

679
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,200
they announced that the auction would be starting

680
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,280
to raise money for the science and engineering,

681
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,360
department, and the first item of forbid,

682
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,480
a 12-pack of Mountain Dew.

683
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,000
Now, in our defense, not a good auction item.

684
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,960
No, please tell me you just bought the whole thing

685
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,680
to make up for your sins.

686
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,960
No, we ran away.

687
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,160
For two Mountain Dews, that is actually the most,

688
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,560
a lot of people say the quintessential college story

689
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,040
is like, yeah, I got so fucked up and barfed on a,

690
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,880
you know, barfed on my dad,

691
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,160
but I stole two Mountain Dews and ruined a party

692
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,600
because of it is actually more sort of my kind of experience.

693
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,880
So I'm right there with you.

694
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,960
Can I do something real quick?

695
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,200
I'm gonna reach down here.

696
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,720
I'm gonna take off my shoe

697
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,440
and I'm gonna put it right on the other foot.

698
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,480
Oh no, it doesn't fit good

699
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,440
because that's not how shoes work,

700
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,840
but I want you all to envision

701
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,560
that you are in this club or perhaps the president

702
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,120
or consigliere of this club,

703
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,440
and you are throwing this party

704
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,880
and all the club members are there

705
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,480
and you're having a great time.

706
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,680
And then a person you don't know shows up dressed up

707
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,720
as a druid and starts just sort of milling about.

708
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,160
Do you think you would have the gumption,

709
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,400
the gumbo to walk up to them and say,

710
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,280
get out of here?

711
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
Griffin, I don't know that I would have the gumption

712
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
to do that if somebody walked into my house

713
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,360
dressed like a druid,

714
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,360
let alone a party I was throwing.

715
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,160
Now druid costume, I feel like the fact that you say

716
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,680
very cool mask that works

717
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,120
kind of paints a picture in my mind.

718
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,800
If it was just druid costume,

719
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,200
I feel like that is abstract enough that I would not.

720
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,480
But I'm imagining sort of,

721
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,440
we're dealing with a mask,

722
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,400
we're dealing with a cool mask

723
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,400
and we're dealing with a robe, almost definitely.

724
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
I cannot imagine a druidic sort of garb

725
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,680
without a robe involved.

726
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,800
Person you don't know walks in with a robe and a mask.

727
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,120
I cannot imagine asking them to leave the party

728
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,560
without receiving some sort of Halloween,

729
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,680
you know, spooky fright of some sort.

730
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,840
Yeah, I do, by the way,

731
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,200
my favorite part of this question is,

732
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,040
thank God I hadn't eaten any of their food yet.

733
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,040
Yeah, it's like the river sticks

734
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,920
once you enter five gamma gammas spot

735
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,360
and you taste of their apples,

736
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,240
you are actually, now you're a pledge, I'm so sorry.

737
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,120
We're gonna need you to leave,

738
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,240
there's a club only event

739
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
and you are going to need to reimburse us

740
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,840
for those five peel and eat shrimp.

741
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,120
It is a horrid, think about this for a second.

742
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,960
You see someone in a robe

743
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,400
and they're wearing a very scary mask

744
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,560
and then you go up to them

745
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,240
and you're like, hey, sorry, bud, club members only.

746
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,760
I don't know if you've ever seen a horror movie,

747
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
but you're about to get stabbed.

748
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,800
You have definitely entered like a stabbable situation

749
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,320
with that sort of pull.

750
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,840
I don't know how usable this information is,

751
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,400
but if this ever happens again to anyone listening,

752
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,200
just slowly turn your head to face them,

753
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,120
say nothing, look at them.

754
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,840
Or sort of croak like a, oh.

755
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,840
Yeah, and then just like walk past them

756
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,320
as though you didn't register what they said

757
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,480
and then about five minutes after that, you can leave.

758
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,680
You turned and ran away

759
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,520
and that is what anybody hosting this podcast now

760
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,280
would have done, definitely, I feel you.

761
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,600
But did you consider maybe the other option

762
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,640
of something else you could do,

763
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,840
which is you just turn into a bunch of bees

764
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,760
or turn them into a bunch of bees?

765
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,680
Did you even think about turning them into bees

766
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,720
or yourself into bees?

767
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,840
Did you consider maybe I'd like to pursue membership now?

768
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,800
Yeah, I'm in your club in the future, hi.

769
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,360
I wanted to make a big impression on you

770
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,920
so I could get in your club.

771
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:39,680
Why was this party advertised?

772
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,280
Why did you know about it?

773
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,480
Why did you know about it?

774
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,560
Why would they put up a flyer?

775
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,520
It's like sweet party, costume a must, no outsiders.

776
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,320
No druids.

777
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,560
No druids allowed.

778
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,840
What if you had lifted your mask

779
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,520
and your face was their face?

780
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,440
I think that would be the best response to it.

781
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,720
Club members only, boom.

782
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,120
You're club members only,

783
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
you open up your bunch of skeleton bones.

784
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,920
Could you do it?

785
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,640
Could you do that?

786
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,160
Next time this happens to you,

787
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,920
when you take your mask off,

788
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,000
it should be the person that tells you to leave

789
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,360
but 30 years older.

790
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,960
And they're like, I've come to warn you.

791
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,920
And make it clear they've seen some shit.

792
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,880
It's gone downhill since this party

793
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,080
where they kicked you out.

794
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,600
Don't kick me out.

795
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,000
If you do, things will go very terribly for you.

796
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,360
And then they're like, okay, cool.

797
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,480
Have some Mountain Dew.

798
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,440
And you say, all right.

799
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,280
And then you stay, you have a good time,

800
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,560
and now you turn into a bunch of bees.

801
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,480
I just really want that to happen.

802
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,600
You do have to turn into bees.

803
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,080
One way or the other.

804
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,120
At some point, it's not a party

805
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,600
unless someone turns into a bunch of bees.

806
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,240
Yeah, that's what our grandma always said.

807
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,080
As mortifying as this would have been,

808
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,960
on some level, it had to be a relief

809
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,880
because I could think of maybe three parties

810
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,400
in my entire life where if someone had walked up to me

811
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,560
and said, you have to leave now,

812
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,320
I would kind of be like, oh, thank God.

813
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,400
Oh, great.

814
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,360
Cool.

815
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,560
Thank you so much.

816
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,280
That's excellent.

817
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,640
That's excellent news.

818
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,960
Justin, I'm curious about a thing you said.

819
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,520
Do you think, Justin, you've ever turned into bees

820
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,080
at a party that you maybe even threw?

821
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
Maybe you threw a party and you're like,

822
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,560
oh, boy, anxiety is a little high.

823
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,200
Time for bees.

824
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,720
And you turn into bees to get out of there?

825
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,920
I've wished for that ability.

826
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,560
I know I don't have that ability

827
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,840
because I've tried so hard to turn into bees

828
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,160
so many different times and it has never worked.

829
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,160
Oh, don't abuse the power.

830
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,960
Don't abuse the power.

831
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,760
It's got to be in situations where-

832
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,120
When it's right, you'll know.

833
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,800
I do like that Griffin, for you, turning into bees

834
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,960
is synonymous with making a quiet exit.

835
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,720
Well, hold on.

836
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,280
Because now I tore my pants earlier.

837
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,480
This sounds like another challenge.

838
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,360
I'm going to sit here real hard.

839
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,560
I'm going to try to turn into bees.

840
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,480
Travis, count me down.

841
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,520
Okay, three, two, one, bees.

842
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,660
Fuck.

843
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,040
I just turned into one big bee.

844
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,360
Well, that always means it's time to go to the money zone.

845
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,280
Or should we say the honey zone?

846
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,400
I got honey dripping out of my stinger and everything

847
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:32,160
like bees do, I think.

848
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,160
Our first sponsor this week is pollen.

849
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,200
I love scooping it up and shitting it out

850
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,520
into that good stuff that people put in their tea.

851
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,800
No, it's just Harry's.

852
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,840
Harry's.

853
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,600
You guys know my favorite cereals?

854
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,960
Honey Nut Cheerios and Honeycomb.

855
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,460
Yeah.

856
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,520
And Honey Bunches of Oats.

857
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,560
No, fuck that shit.

858
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,680
Harry's is all about a great shave at a great price.

859
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,360
There's no bees in any of this stuff.

860
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,200
Do you have a Harry thorax?

861
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,040
Sure, we all do.

862
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,280
Hi, I'm Travis McElroy for Harry's,

863
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,680
and we want to shave your bee butt or whatever.

864
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,320
Harry's was started by two giant bees

865
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,880
that were fed up with buying overpriced razors.

866
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,760
So they bought a German factory with over 100 yards of blade

867
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,800
making experience to ensure the highest quality.

868
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,520
And over 100,000 bees.

869
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,120
The smallest possible blades for the bees.

870
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,680
They sell their blades online,

871
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,920
and so they're able to cut the cost.

872
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,320
That's not italicized like it's a joke,

873
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,280
but it probably should be.

874
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,600
Yeah.

875
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,440
They're able to cut the cost of the middleman.

Yes?

892
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,360
Can I tell you about Zip Recruiter?

893
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:09,680
Okay.

894
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,000
Do you have a joke past that?

895
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,280
Uh, I plan on being the rest of a bee

896
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,040
for the rest of the podcast, Trav.

897
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,760
Oh, okay.

898
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,480
Yeah, that's the joke.

899
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,240
Cause I've dedicated myself to being a bee

900
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,960
for the rest of the podcast.

901
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,520
Oh, okay.

902
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

903
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,040
Go on, go on, go on, go on.

904
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,000
I don't know.

905
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,360
I don't know how to replace it.

906
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,600
I already got full dog body surgery

907
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,080
and I don't know.

908
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,200
I think I can't go.

909
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,560
I have the punch card from Dr. Cool Body's surgery studio.

910
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,840
So I guess I could go back in there

911
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,120
and see if I could get a freebie.

912
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,360
But anyways, Zip Recruiter, are you hiring?

913
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,480

I hate webs cause I flew in one.

921
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,880
One time spider almost got me.

922
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,280

Inhumation is a comedy drama web comic

946
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,680
about dead teenagers burning in hell.

947
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,120
And by burning in hell, I mean working a fast food job

948
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,560
and going on awkward dates.

949
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,920
The artist also does illustration commissions.

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,560

So ivstudios.net slash Inhumation.

955
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,400
You didn't do enough bee stuff in that one.

956
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,360
Bees.

957
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:13,920
Okay.

958
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,960
Griffin, do this one.

959
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,840
Why do I do it?

960
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,360
Because there's a part about honeymoon

961
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,240
and I thought that would be good.

962
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,160
Okay, okay, okay, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.

963
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,040
I'll edit this one out later, Greg.

964
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,120
Who is this message for?

965
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,240
It's for Caroline.

966
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,680
And it's from Mike Tibbs in Sayley who says,

967
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,680
happy birthday slash wedding day and or honeymoon

968
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,800
to my favorite per-

969
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,520
Fuck, hold on.

970
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,000
Happy birthday slash wedding days and or honeymoon.

971
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,200
Mm, sounds delicious.

972
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,800
To my favorite, they don't eat the honey today.

973
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,440
Let me try again.

974
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,440
Happy birthday slash wedding day and or honeymoon.

975
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,320
I make honey.

976
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,760
To my favorite person in the world,

977
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,600
here's to years and years of us watching TV and movies,

978
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
playing video games, cuddling with the fur babies.

979
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,960
I'm assuming that's bees.

980
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,120
And whatever flavor adventures we find ourselves on.

981
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,920
Best honey flavor.

982
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,040
I love you.

983
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,720
That's so sweet, like honey is.

984
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,920
I need to help.

985
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,800
I'm Hal Loveland.

986
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,680
I'm Danielle Radford.

987
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,720
I am Michael Eagle.

988
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,320
And we are the hosts of Tights and Fights,

989
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,080
Maximum Fun's newest podcast dedicated to all things wrestling.

990
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,680
We'll be talking about Sasha Banks,

991
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,920
the women's revolution, Sasha Banks,

992
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,400
the brand split and Sasha Banks' wigs.

993
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,720
And we'll also be talking about wrestler fashion.

994
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,720
Some wrestlers wear too many clothes.

995
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,480
Some wrestlers don't wear enough clothes at all.

996
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,000
And I'll be doing impressions of all your favorite wrestlers.

997
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,880
New episodes Thursdays on Maximum Fun

998
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
or wherever you get your podcasts.

999
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:42,160
Oh yeah, dig it.

1000
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,200
How about a Yahoo?

1001
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,600
Yeah.

1002
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,080
This is a good one from Jake Lousing.

1003
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,560
Thank you, Jake.

1004
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,080
It's Yahoo Answers user.

1005
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:54,480
Latanya asks, how to get slime off the ceiling?

1006
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,080
How to get slime off the ceiling?

1007
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,200
Additional details.

1008
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,840
Happy Halloween.

1009
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,400
That's for me.

1010
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,440
Very spooky.

1011
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:05,920
Okay.

1012
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,200
I want to say something.

1013
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,520
I'm a parent of a three-year-old.

1014
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,440
There's nothing funny about this question.

1015
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,600
This question is not funny at all.

1016
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,280
It's very serious.

1017
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,720
Because there's slime.

1018
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,760
Here's a question.

1019
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,560
How do I get slime out of my fucking house?

1020
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,640
My daughter likes to make slime with glue and contact solution

1021
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,560
and all manner of ungodly things.

1022
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:41,040
There's lard and glitter and the little foam beads

1023
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,160
that you put into things.

1024
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,640
It's a nightmare.

1025
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,200
Foam what?

1026
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,320
Like a little, you know, like micro fill, like micro beads

1027
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,000
that you would put in a bean bag or something.

1028
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,280
A bean bag?

1029
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,800
A bean bag.

1030
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,280
Sounds terrible.

1031
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,040
Don't put me in a bag.

1032
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,840
She likes to make a lot of it, not play with it,

1033
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,640
and then put it in a bag where it could be my problem forever.

1034
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,280
I've started like reverse contraband,

1035
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,400
trying to figure out ways that I can smuggle slime

1036
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,920
with other trashes that will not be detected.

1037
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,520
You just gotta eat a little bit, just a little bit at a time.

1038
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,440
Hide it behind Rita Hayworth, I think.

1039
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,560
Yeah.

1040
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,360
The slimy, slimy Rita Hayworth poster you've got.

1041
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:30,720
What's going on?

1042
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,520
You don't understand.

1043
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,720
There's a bunch of slime back there.

1044
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,080
Do not touch that poster, please.

1045
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,640
Please don't.

1046
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,760
This is for the good of everyone.

1047
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,920
I've been digging a hole to put the slime into.

1048
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,840
And Chris this morning, Charlie, come in here.

1049
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,080
What?

1050
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,800
It's just a poster.

1051
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,920
Yeah, rip.

1052
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,880
Slime deluge.

1053
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,520
Slime.

1054
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,760
Oh, Justin, is that the problem?

1055
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,800
Did you say, I don't know?

1056
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,600
No.

1057
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,960
Did you say, I don't know, Justin?

1058
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,520
That would get slime off the ceiling, right?

1059
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:51,920
Yeah.

1060
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,480
Can I ask you?

1061
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,800
If you stand underneath it, say, I don't know,

1062
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,000
and it'll fall right on there.

1063
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,640
Yeah.

1064
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,160
Was Rosie O'Donnell anywhere?

1065
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,080
Just sort of hiding,

1066
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,240
but also secretly hosting the Kids' Choice Awards.

1067
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,840
No, she was not.

1068
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,440
But can I just say,

1069
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,320
I think that you can't do that on television.

1070
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,000
Gag is really gonna land with our demo.

1071
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,480
Yeah.

1072
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,200
Appreciate that.

1073
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,720
How has that not had its own nostalgic resurgent?

1074
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,160
Like, I don't know.

1075
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,680
I feel like it should have hit, right?

1076
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,600
Let's do the hidden temple hit.

1077
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,400
Where's my Pete and Pete like rebirth?

1078
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,000
I would watch a, you can't do that.

1079
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,520
Oh no, I'm thinking of what would you do?

1080
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,120
Shit.

1081
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,560
Where's that what would you do rebirth?

1082
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,680
That was what I'm looking for.

1083
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,040
Just people opening up lockers

1084
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,640
and maybe there's a pine and maybe there's just slime,

1085
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,400
but maybe there's rollerblades.

1086
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:38,640
Yeah.

1087
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,240
Okay, now is what would you do the one with John Quinones?

1088
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:42,480
Yes.

1089
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,360
Or is that the up?

1090
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,360
That's the one where John Quinones puts people

1091
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,120
in awkward situations in real life

1092
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,400
to see how they respond to them.

1093
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,280
And if they do a good job,

1094
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,800
he lets them go to the prize lockers.

1095
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,760
And sometimes there's a gag in there

1096
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,040
and sometimes there's a floam in there,

1097
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,880
but sometimes there's a, you know,

1098
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,120
tickets to Universal Studios Orlando, Florida,

1099
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,600
where they can go and catch a new episode

1100
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,920
of the Mystery Files of Shelby Woo.

1101
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,040
Or catch a predator.

1102
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,000
Or catch a predator.

1103
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,680
Was that Quinones?

1104
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:07,840
No.

1105
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,200
Was it?

1106
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,280
No, that was Shelby Woo did that.

1107
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,000
She hosted.

1108
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,400
She hosted to catch a predator?

1109
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,200
Yeah, the fictional character did.

1110
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,160
Okay, horrible news.

1111
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,480
What would you do is in fact the name

1112
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,080
of the show with John Quinones

1113
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,320
and the game show with Mark Summers.

1114
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:24,560
Yeah.

1115
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,640
I'm not gonna change it.

1116
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,440
They have to change it.

1117
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,680
That show's been off the air for a long time, John.

1118
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,160
I don't care.

1119
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:30,960
I'm not changing it.

1120
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,560
Now, John Quinones, have you considered putting

1121
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,960
maybe even a little bit of gag in your situations?

1122
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,040
Just to sort of serve as a narrative thread.

1123
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,920
Just so what?

1124
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,400
Oh, this army vet lost his wallet

1125
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,240
and also his gag.

1126
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,560
Now, in order for this to be fair use,

1127
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,160
it had to legally be a remake.

1128
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,880
So for the last three minutes of the show,

1129
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,120
I'm not gonna put any strangers in awkward situations.

1130
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,040
I'm just gonna throw a pie at my dad.

1131
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,640
That is how every episode of the Mark Summers

1132
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,240
will end in.

1133
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,880
How do we get this fucking slime off the ceiling though?

1134
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,920
And I put this one on here

1135
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,680
because maybe I thought it'd be a spooky Halloween one.

1136
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,440
I didn't know it would reverberate with Justin

1137
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,040
quite as much as it did.

1138
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,320
Yeah, it is scary to me.

1139
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:08,960
I will say that.

1140
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,280
I'm sitting here spooked.

1141
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,480
Why doesn't your daughter just have one slime?

1142
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,240
I don't understand the need for more slime.

1143
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,920
She doesn't wanna play with it.

1144
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,800
Wants to make it.

1145
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,760
But then you're not allowed to throw it away?

1146
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,280
But then I can't throw it away.

1147
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:23,760
Because it's a gift.

1148
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,760
So she makes it and keeps it

1149
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,240
and then that's it.

1150
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,920
What I should try to get her to do

1151
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,920
is start selling it.

1152
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,280
Maybe I could put her to work

1153
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,360
in that sort of junior achievement sort of situation

1154
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,800
where she's just like making the slime

1155
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,880
and then putting it in little containers

1156
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,400
and selling it to buy food.

1157
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,920
What if you started storing it in a very large lock box

1158
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,920
and then on her 18th birthday,

1159
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,280
you wheeled it out and said,

1160
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,200
this is where your college money went.

1161
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,400
Yeah, to this nice slime box.

1162
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,560
Yeah, this is, well, I mean, the money,

1163
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,360
I don't know what,

1164
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,520
but you're talking about contact solution and glue.

1165
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,560
That ain't cheap.

1166
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,000
Contact solution isn't cheap.

1167
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,280
So like, I don't know how many thousands of dollars a week

1168
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,760
you're spending on slime fixings,

1169
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,800
but it can't be cheap.

1170
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,000
Are you okay, Justin?

1171
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,240
How are you doing with your money?

1172
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,920
Are you poor now?

1173
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,600
It's not pricey.

1174
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,560
I mean, it's Elmer's glue.

1175
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,680
It's contact solution.

1176
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,760
No, don't give out the recipe here.

1177
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,480
Are you crazy?

1178
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,280
Why not?

1179
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,120
If I give out the recipe

1180
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,480
and there's a huge rush on it,

1181
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,560
maybe I won't be able to find the ingredients at the store.

1182
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,360
What if everybody in our whole listening audience,

1183
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,080
here's the recipe you give out, makes their own slime,

1184
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,400
slime gets big and strong, takes over the whole world

1185
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,000
and spreads and consumes all of us.

1186
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And then that one's on you, Juice.

1187
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,480
There are certain ratios of the slime recipe

1188
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,840
that turn it into a fun slime for the whole family

1189
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,240
that does not stick to your furniture.

1190
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,920
And then there's other ratios

1191
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,960
where it's basically a furniture destruction kit

1192
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,640
where it's like, I just wanna destroy this ottoman forever

1193
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,120
and this is the slime that I've made to do it.

1194
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,960
Juice, I got a great idea for you.

1195
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,760
What's that?

1196
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,960
You get Charlie and you say,

1197
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,400
all right, new slime recipe time.

1198
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,160
And this one's gonna be a lot of fun.

1199
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,800
And you say, Terry, take this ground beef

1200
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,680
and you take these onions and some minced garlic

1201
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,680
and chili powder, salt and some oregano and stewed tomatoes.

1202
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,040
And then, oh, you're gonna love this.

1203
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,320
It makes it all sticky and fun.

1204
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,720
Some tomato sauce and some kidney beans.

1205
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,920
And we'll put them in this crock pile,

1206
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,920
make the most fun slime.

1207
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,960
But then at the end of the day, you say,

1208
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,640
it's like, guys, it's gonna take eight hours

1209
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,840
and we're gonna turn this to high

1210
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,600
because that's how the slime gets the best.

1211
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,600
And then at the end of the day, you just got chili, baby.

1212
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,800
Edible slime.

1213
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,000
Chili is just edible slime, my man.

1214
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,520
Chili is just edible slime.

1215
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,240
But oh, what a good and delicious prank to pull.

1216
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,040
And then you don't have the slime problem anymore.

1217
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,640
And then all of a sudden now,

1218
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,280
she's on MasterChef Junior, but she can only make chili.

1219
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,920
Today, you're going to make my most electable beef Wellington.

1220
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,200
Charlie, let's see what you've got.

1221
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,200
Oh, it's chili again.

1222
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,200
Well, it's very good chili.

1223
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,800
It's good chili and God, gosh dang it, you're cute.

1224
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,360
Let's get rid of an ugly boy.

1225
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,120
But my crust is so flaky.

1226
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:19,920
Yeah, I don't care.

1227
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,600
You're gone.

1228
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,600
But I'm also British.

1229
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,600
Now, Charlie, here this time,

1230
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,320
I see you just sort of dollop chili into cupcake wrappers.

1231
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,840
You know that that's not a cupcake, right?

1232
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,240
I mean, that's chili still.

1233
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,400
And my sweet Charlie, what do you call this?

1234
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:38,900
Slime.

1235
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,500
Okay.

1236
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,000
Daddy's slime.

1237
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,200
Daddy's slime.

1238
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:43,680
Okay.

1239
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,720
I think that considering chili is one of the three foods I can eat,

1240
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,600
that's probably good.

1241
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,280
The jig's gonna be up pretty quick.

1242
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,480
I had to look up an all recipes chili recipe

1243
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,120
to name all those ingredients, by the way.

1244
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,800
And now I'm just looking at pictures of chili

1245
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,800
and just having some sweet daydreams.

1246
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,040
Justin, read the next question.

1247
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,880
Oh, all right, Trav.

1248
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,520
No problem.

1249
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,560
I'm hungry for chili now.

1250
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,760
I need to get this show done

1251
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,800
and we got a three question minimum before we can wrap up.

1252
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,600
Okay.

1253
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,880
This next one's weird.

1254
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,040
For as long as I can remember,

1255
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,960
my dad has been afraid of loose buttons,

1256
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,840
like the ones you would sew onto a shirt.

1257
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,640
He refuses to be near them or interact with them in any way.

1258
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,480
However, he's completely fine with buttons

1259
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,520
that are attached to clothing.

1260
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,320
My mother also sews frequently.

1261
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,800
So there's a large amount of loose buttons around their house.

1262
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,280
Perfect.

1263
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,240
How can I help my dad overcome his fear

1264
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,600
of small plastic circles?

1265
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,400
And that's from disconcerted descendant in Decatur.

1266
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,520
The real Sam and Diane situation going on here.

1267
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,680
No, can't you boys see?

1268
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,520
Can't you see the truth here?

1269
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,080
Look at the pieces.

1270
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,280
Put the pieces together.

1271
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,400
I had the clues the whole time.

1272
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,360
I could have saved her.

1273
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,880
You had the clues the whole time, lol?

1274
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,400
The buttons.

1275
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,880
The mother likes to sew buttons, right?

1276
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,720
Hey, honey, will you sew this button on a shirt?

1277
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,200
I can't.

1278
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,960
I'm afraid of loose buttons.

1279
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,600
What?

1280
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,320
Yeah.

1281
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,520
Committed to that.

1282
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,680
That, like, the father-

1283
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,560
You're saying the dad doesn't want to sew so badly

1284
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,360
that he says he's afraid of-

1285
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,560
A fear of loose buttons.

1286
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,760
Like, I say I'm afraid of the noise that the weed whacker makes.

1287
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,320
And so I just won't go near it because it scares me so bad.

1288
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:18,560
So it's sort of like,

1289
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,160
honey, the button fell off my favorite Oxford.

1290
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,840
Can you sew it back on for me?

1291
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,960
I'll get around to it.

1292
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,240
But I'm freaking out!

1293
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,040
Yeah.

1294
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,840
Help!

1295
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,880
Please do it now!

1296
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,440
It's just sitting there, mocking me!

1297
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:31,940
Look at it!

1298
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,720
It's gonna eat me or whatever.

1299
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,120
It looks like a very bad plate.

1300
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,720
A very small, bad plate.

1301
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,680
What if it gets sucked up in the vacuum and breaks it?

1302
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,800
That's terrifying.

1303
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,840
It's kind of like how I'm afraid of distortions in the world's electromagnetic field.

1304
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,240
Because it throws off all my receptors.

1305
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,340
Shit.

1306
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:52,840
Um...

1307
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,900
Throw away all the buttons!

1308
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,300
Like, throw away all the buttons or put them in a special button box.

1309
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,900
If your dad says, here's a button.

1310
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:07,460
Your dad worked so hard to, you know, send you to dentist school or seminary.

1311
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,980
The only two schools there are.

1312
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,180
And the least you could do is when you hear him yelling and yelling and yelling,

1313
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,820
you go and you pick up the small button and you put him in the button box.

1314
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,940
This is not that-

1315
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,340
If this is your dad's thing, there's not-

1316
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,860
There are worse things.

1317
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:20,980
There are worse things.

1318
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,740
You do have to think of it when it says loose, but it's not like buttons on the loose, right?

1319
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:28,420
It's like even if they're in a container, it is still a loose button.

1320
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:31,300
You just put them in a closet or he doesn't know where they are.

1321
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,140
But here's the thing, right?

1322
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,820
I'm afraid of spiders, right?

1323
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,900
I've told my wife this many times.

1324
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,220
And if my wife was like, no, I'm still going to keep an old cookie tin full of spiders.

1325
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,340
That's the most buck wild thing you've ever fucking said, Travis.

1326
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,340
But that's what's going on here.

1327
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,940
Your dad's like, I'm scared of buttons.

1328
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,220
And mom's like, cool, cool, cool.

1329
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,980
Here's my big thing of buttons.

1330
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:54,580
Yeah, but she probably isn't mean about it like that.

1331
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,300
Now, I will say you could be.

1332
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:02,900
You could have essentially what I would consider to be a human no-no can.

1333
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,180
If your dad starts acting up or, you know, maybe he tells an embarrassing story at a wedding

1334
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:14,100
or a graduation party or a, you know, seminary graduation party,

1335
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,860
then you just get out the no-no can.

1336
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:16,500
And you don't even-

1337
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,740
I think at a certain point, you don't even have to shake it anymore.

1338
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:19,220
He sees it.

1339
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,100
He knows what's in there.

1340
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,500
Buttons.

1341
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,300
He knows what he did.

1342
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,100
He knows what he did.

1343
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,140
Well, you don't even need that.

1344
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,460
You just start tugging at a button on your shirt.

1345
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,980
Like, oh, feels a little loose.

1346
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,740
And then your dad like runs away.

1347
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:29,060
Yeah.

1348
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,660
I, you, your dad, I kind of have to side with Griffin here.

1349
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,740
Your dad has been through a lot raising you.

1350
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:42,740
And I guarantee as a child, you had fears and concerns that were far more rational

1351
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,020
than loose buttons.

1352
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:48,820
Yesterday, my daughter screamed, literally screamed for 15 minutes

1353
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,940
because I flushed a poop of hers before her mommy could see it.

1354
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:59,060
And that was 15 minutes of that because she really wanted mom to come in and see the-

1355
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,140
Mommy wasn't there at the moment.

1356
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:06,180
So it would have been sort of a museum piece for a little while.

1357
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,780
But still, I shouldn't have flushed it.

1358
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:14,980
So like you've done, like you had worse things than loose buttons when you were a kid

1359
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,260
and your dad didn't, didn't, you know, try to throw them in your face.

1360
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,700
So don't throw loose buttons at your dad.

1361
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,900
In his face, unless.

1362
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:23,460
Unless.

1363
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:23,940
Unless.

1364
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:32,820
You can set up the best, most effective, and most cost-efficient haunted house

1365
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,180
that has ever been devised.

1366
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,140
And they just walk into the house

1367
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:43,060
and there's no decorations or spooky lighting or a, you know, chainsaw man,

1368
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:45,140
but there's no chain on it because we're just having fun here.

1369
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,900
It's just you and your standby or laptop plugged into

1370
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,220
maybe 14 speakers arranged all in a circle around the room.

1371
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,260
Door will lock behind him.

1372
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,940
You're gonna need mom's help with that one.

1373
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,500
Get your mom.

1374
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,140
Hey kids, get your mom's help for this fun haunted house.

1375
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:05,300
And then you press play on Spotify and it is the Pussycat Dolls featuring Snoop Dogg's buttons.

1376
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,820
And then you just reach into just a big box you have

1377
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,820
and you just start letting those little guys fly.

1378
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,980
Can I tell you why I love this girl?

1379
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:13,780
One, it's a great idea.

1380
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,140
But two, I love the idea of-

1381
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:16,740
The song Pussycat Dolls, but-

1382
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:16,980
Yes.

1383
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,100
You did the buttons.

1384
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:22,660
I like the idea of a bespoke haunted house that is only meant for one per-

1385
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:30,660
Like, Derek, I heard you were afraid of, you know, the car from Knight Rider.

1386
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:33,220
And so like you walk in, I built you a whole haunted house

1387
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:36,100
that's just about the car from Knight Rider.

1388
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:40,500
I've put a lot of work and it's only going to be effective for one person.

1389
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,060
Yeah, I have Mr. Feeny here and he's gonna do the thing.

1390
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:48,100
Mine would be, so Justin, welcome.

1391
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:53,300
The door locks behind me and it is the robot woman from Superman 3

1392
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,060
standing in front of the old HBO logo as it flies across the screen.

1393
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,660
That would be very-

1394
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,220
Yeah, that would take me to town.

1395
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:04,900
But here's the thing, this doubles as fun Halloween fare and immersion therapy.

1396
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:09,140
I came out of a regular haunted house and I haven't been cured of my fear of mummies

1397
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:14,740
and generally being murdered by supernatural or natural forces.

1398
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,780
But after this sort of buttons gauntlet,

1399
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,940
after this sort of Pussycat Dolls torture chamber

1400
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,020
that you're locking your dad inside for a little bit,

1401
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,340
I think this problem's gonna solve itself.

1402
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,420
Griffin, what is your greatest fear?

1403
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,020
Mine?

1404
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:35,060
Yeah, I feel like Justin and I talk about our fears a lot on this show.

1405
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,980
Yeah, so I think that we, other than the intro,

1406
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:41,460
didn't say anything funny for the first 10 minutes of the podcast.

1407
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,660
And then we did a lot of B-talk that I think maybe overstated

1408
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,780
to welcome us by a significant margin.

1409
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:50,980
And I guess my biggest fear is all the tweets we're gonna get from people saying like,

1410
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:56,500
man, my Bim Bam is over or like, you know, I was excited that it wasn't gonna be

1411
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,740
another live episode because I hate those for some reason.

1412
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:03,300
But it was, there was just, all the B stuff didn't really connect with me.

1413
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,380
So you think the episode's gonna generate a lot of buzz?

1414
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,260
Well, that's gonna do it for us here on My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1415
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,780
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1416
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:22,340
Want to say a reminder to you that we are sort of,

1417
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,780
we've got the rest of the year like lined up ticket-wise.

1418
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:32,660
If you want to come see us live, you have basically two slim opportunities to do so.

1419
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:40,020
The first is in Chicago on the 16th at the Chicago Theater.

1420
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:44,180
And the next is in Milwaukee, November 19th at the Riverside Theater.

1421
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:49,780
You can find links to both of those McElroy shows dot com slash tours.

1422
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:54,740
There is a third option.

1423
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:56,500
What's that?

1424
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,580
PodCon.

1425
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,140
Oh, that's right.

1426
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,260
PodCon for sure.

1427
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:00,580
Yeah.

1428
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,540
Good point, Trav.

1429
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,660
December 9th and 10th in Seattle.

1430
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:09,380
We're all, so we're going to be doing an NBNB AM and also an Adventure Zone Q&A.

1431
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:12,500
Also like we'll be participating in a bunch of different things.

1432
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:17,700
Also there is gonna be Welcome to Night Vale, Last Name Basis, John and Hank Green.

1433
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:24,900
Let's see, Sawbones, Still Buffering, a bunch of things.

1434
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:30,180
And you can find out the whole lineup at podcon.com.

1435
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:35,220
Tickets are still available and there is also an option even if you aren't able to attend

1436
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:40,500
where you will be able to hear everything later, like in a remote attendance thing.

1437
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:44,660
So go check that out at podcon.com and we hope to see you there.

1438
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,460
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

1439
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,780
a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1440
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:53,780
It's an extremely spooky album that gives me horrible nightmares.

1441
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:56,180
Well, no, it's not.

1442
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,940
I also want to thank Maximum Fun for having us.

1443
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:02,340
You can go to MaximumFun.org slash Jumbotrons because they are going to go on sale this

1444
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:04,660
week to get Jumbotrons on the show.

1445
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,860
They're going to be selling them for the first six months of 2018.

1446
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,300
They're going on sale November 1st.

1447
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,860
That's this Wednesday at 11 a.m. Pacific time.

1448
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:15,940
And I promise you they will sell out, so if you want to get a message on the show or any

1449
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:20,900
of our podcasts for the first half of 2018, make sure you lock down your spot this Wednesday,

1450
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,260
November 11th at 11 a.m.

1451
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,220
Pacific time.

1452
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,140
Maximum Fun.org slash Jumbotron.

1453
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:33,620
Speaking of November 1st, at Joseph Beth Booksellers here in Cincinnati, I am going to be moderating

1454
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:39,620
an event, a book, reading and signing with the new Welcome to Night Vale book.

1455
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:45,540
With Joseph Fink and Jeffrey Cranor, the book is It Devours.

1456
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,540
Justin did the last one, so I get to do this one.

1457
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:50,820
She last time asked me to do that, and I guess I must not have...

1458
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,820
Well, now I live in Cincinnati.

1459
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,860
Hmm.

1460
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:58,180
But that's going to be Wednesday night at Joseph Beth Booksellers, I believe seven o'clock.

1461
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,180
Hope to see you there.

1462
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,380
I have one more little plug, too.

1463
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:07,380
It's the Radiotopia Place Drive is going on.

1464
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:13,540
The Radiotopia Place Drive is going on right now, Radiotopia.fm.

1465
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:18,620
Our dear friend Roman Mars has a whole bunch of stone killers over there getting it done

1466
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:22,140
every day, and you should kick a few bucks their way if you like some of the great shows

1467
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,140
they do.

1468
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,140
So Radiotopia.fm.

1469
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,660
Here's that final Yahoo! is sent in by Kiersten.

1470
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,660
Thank you, Kiersten.

1471
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,660
It's Yahoo!

1472
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,660
Answer is user.

1473
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:30,660
Come on.

1474
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,660
Come on, baby.

1475
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,660
Come on, baby.

1476
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,660
Nope, it's not going to load.

1477
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,460
Roman Mars asked this, and it's really him.

1478
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:42,080
This is really Roman Mars, so I'm going to do his voice.

1479
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,540
Where does the noise from the doorbell come from?

1480
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:49,100
I'm Justin McElroy.

1481
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,340
I'm Travis McElroy.

1482
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:54,380
I'm Roman Mars, and this is going to be the worst episode 99% visible ever.

1483
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,380
I'm so sorry.

1484
00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:13,460
I have no ideas.

1485
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,460
Maximum fun.org.

1486
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,060
Comedy and culture.

1487
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,060
Artist-owned.

1488
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,060
Listener-supported.

1489
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:21,100
Hey there, folks.

1490
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:25,460
I am writer and performer Dave Holmes, and I host International Waters, where we pair

1491
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:30,500
a team of comedians in LA against a team of comedians in London in a pop culture trivia

1492
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,100
battle royale.

1493
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,460
Comedians like Josie Long.

1494
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:38,700
I worry that it makes me seem like I'm 80 years old, but I hurt my knee, and it is just

1495
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:39,700
on the mend.

1496
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,500
And I can't tell you how delightful that feels.

1497
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:46,060
If I want to walk down some stairs, I just go for it now.

1498
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,060
Michaela Watkins.

1499
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:54,180
We have a country where our leaders actually deny global warming, so we are going to have

1500
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:59,380
more beachfront property than any other nation.

1501
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,340
I mean, it's going to shrink our country in half, but it's okay.

1502
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,420
But that's just more beach.

1503
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,420
And many more.

1504
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,140
Join us every other week on International Waters with me, Dave Holmes.

1505
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:18,020
Find it on MaximumFun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.
