1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,360
It's time for the record. You don't get anything for free in this world.

6
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,000
We are cutting you off. This is no exception.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,480
44 episodes in, the bill is due. The bill is due, bitches!

8
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,880
It's my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

9
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,800
You gots to pay the piper.

10
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,920
Time to pay the piper, sluts. Welcome to the greatest pledge episode ever.

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,720
This is the best little, the best little pledge episode in Texas,

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,480
is what we're calling this one. This is my brother, my brother and me,

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,680
it's an advice show for the modern era. I am Justin McElroy, your oldest brother.

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,840
I'm Travis McElroy and we want your money. If you want to know my name,

15
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,240
it's going to cost you like two bucks. It's actually, it's Griffin.

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,240
If you want that last name for real, two bucks. So we've got a big episode for you. Lots of fun.

17
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,920
Juicy. It is, it's ripe. It's sagging with juices.

18
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,160
Let's thump this melon. Let's thump this melon.

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:57,520
Like Gallagher too. I live with my boyfriend. When I get home from work,

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,040
I like to pretty quickly change into comfy at-home clothing,

21
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,840
pajama pants or yoga pants and a t-shirt of some sort.

22
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,360
Usually this comfy clothing is baggier and less flattering than what I wear

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,680
for being out in public. That's why it's comfy.

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,200
Am I slowly but surely ruining my relationship and killing my boyfriend's attraction to me

25
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,240
by spending so much time, probably the majority of our time together,

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,000
in slouchy clothing. Thanks. Sweats in the city.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,760
That's the best. That's a good one.

28
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,320
I mean, of course you are, right? But it's an expectations game you're playing right now.

29
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,800
You're lowering the bar. Exactly.

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,720
I think that if you came home every day and like got more dressed up,

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,760
like it's going to lose a lot of the effect. But if you sit around in like scuzzy clothes,

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,960
like for a hundred days and then one day like put on some jeans and a t-shirt,

33
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,520
you're going to look awesome. Yeah, hang on.

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,760
Do you don't want him to have the pressure of trying to continually outclass you at home

35
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,880
and then it culminates with him wearing a tux and you emerging from a clam shell

36
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
when he gets home from work? Like you don't want that.

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,080
Do you guys remember what my jam used to be? What was your jam?

38
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,000
Taking your pants off as soon as you got home. Oh my God. I would cross the threshold of our

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,280
childhood home and my pants would just disintegrate off of my body.

40
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,720
Our parents went through so many pants bills.

41
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,240
As if by magic, my pants would vanish into the luminescent ether.

42
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,760
Griffin actually invented tear away pants for that very purpose.

43
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,120
I actually I had this trick where I could just like I could stand narrowly.

44
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,320
I could stand with my frame narrowly and my pants would just fall off of my body.

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,800
That's not a joke. That was a real thing I could do.

46
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,320
Yeah, so maybe that's a good thing because no pants is about as comfortable as humans get.

47
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,920
And kind of sexy.

48
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,040
Kind of sexy.

49
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,160
Little sexy, little hot.

50
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,480
Listen, young lady, I want to make two really important points.

51
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,720
One, he loves you.

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,160
He's going to think that the things that you wear, you know, just around the house or whatever

53
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,880
are adorable because he loves you.

54
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,760
And this is part of being in a loving relationship.

55
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,600
He likes to be cozy, too. He gets it.

56
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,520
Two, if you're worried about the attraction thing, he's a guy, sweetheart.

57
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,400
And you're a girl.

58
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,120
You flash, you flash a boob.

59
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,480
A one boob.

60
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,520
Like half a boob.

61
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,240
Like half a boob.

62
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,040
Take him to the English show.

63
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
And you do like a quarter of boob.

64
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,360
You get like a quarter boob and he's down.

65
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,640
He's DTF.

66
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,320
And that's short for down to fuck.

67
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,640
And that is not and that is not something that you acquire over time.

68
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,640
For guys, it's a very instantaneous.

69
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,920
So like, oh, there's a boob.

70
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,760
Time to go.

71
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,520
You know what's always sexy?

72
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,320
What's that?

73
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,360
A robe.

74
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,560
Because it's mysterious.

75
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,280
What's underneath?

76
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,480
That's a good point.

77
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,600
Kind of sexy, right?

78
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm robed right now.

79
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm wearing a robe.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,800
Teresa and I, like we often have robe dates where it's just like we get home from work

81
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,480
and we've had we've had a long day and it's like, let's robe it up.

82
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,640
And then we watch David Attenborough specials.

83
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,400
I never disrobe before a gunfight.

84
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,120
That's just me.

85
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,160
I don't know.

86
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,040
I don't know where you guys are.

87
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,440
Anybody else you drive angry?

88
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,640
That was a good one.

89
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,600
Yeah, that was a good reference you just made.

90
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,480
I don't like the picture.

91
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,440
Everybody enjoys that.

92
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,560
I can only wear my robe for about an hour or two in the morning because I always feel

93
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,960
like I smell really bad when I'm wearing a robe.

94
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,800
Oh, yeah, it's a cocoon of stink coming off of you.

95
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,920
It's like a second skin that you wear outside of your normal sweaty, stinky skin that absorbs

96
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,560
your stuff.

97
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,440
And then I don't know.

98
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,960
There's something about the way that it just it hangs on my body.

99
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,560
It just seems to funnel.

100
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,360
It seems to funnel like the smell like up and out and in my my nose.

101
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,160
It's really bad.

102
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,760
Do you bathe?

103
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,280
Yeah, I bathe.

104
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,280
I mean, did you say you bathed or you bathe?

105
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,960
Like, what's our tense?

106
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,240
Let's take a tense check.

107
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,280
I'm familiar.

108
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,300
Right.

109
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,520
I'm terrified.

110
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,120
I have this friend who's been dating this guy on and off four different times now.

111
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,000
Every time by the end, they seem to hate each other.

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,800
But then two months or so, they're dating again.

113
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,560
How can I tell my friend to just give up on him?

114
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,200
P.S.

115
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,400
My friend's a girl.

116
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,200
That's from Brandon.

117
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,760
I used to have the theory that like once a couple broke up, they're broken up.

118
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,920
Yeah, like there's no coming back from that.

119
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,280
Now, everybody listening is going to say, but I know this one guy.

120
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,600
Great.

121
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,720
Yeah, you know the exception.

122
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,600
That's awesome.

123
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,920
But I'm saying as a rule, like once you break up, how do you come

124
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,560
back from that?

125
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,000
Like, especially after two months, it's like, oh, hey, want to go at this again?

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,760
I didn't work out this time either.

127
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,560
Whoops.

128
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,920
It's like forgetting the ending of a book and then rereading the book and going, oh,

129
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,720
fuck, they die.

130
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,520
That's right.

131
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,960
Your relationship sucks.

132
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,240
Don't get back into it.

133
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,440
Yeah, I think Travis makes a great point because one time I the first girl I ever dated, we

134
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,680
dated for a couple of months and then we split up for reasons that aren't exactly clear.

135
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,920
And then later I married her.

136
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,120
What are you doing?

137
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,720
You fucking monster.

138
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,600
I'm the other guy.

139
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,240
I'm the thing.

140
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,120
I'm the thing here.

141
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm the guy here.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,440
I'm not an exception of telling you.

143
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,240
You're crazy.

144
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,440
You're the exception, Travis.

145
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,160
You're the exception.

146
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,680
I'm the exception.

147
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,280
Have you ever dated a girl twice?

148
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,920
Oh, yeah.

149
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,160
Okay.

150
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,280
So just Travis then.

151
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
Travis is out on his own on this one.

152
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
And let me tell you how well Griffin turned out.

153
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,040
Might work out really well, yeah.

154
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,360
I would say that we're 50, 50, 50 here.

155
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,520
I think that's fair.

156
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,120
I don't know.

157
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,000
I think that, I don't know, it can really go either way because maybe sometimes you

158
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,400
break up and that breakup period, that brief breakup makes you realize that you need that

159
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,520
person and that you've changed and that you've grown.

160
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,520
Yeah, you've grown and evolved.

161
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,560
Have you grown?

162
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,880
Okay, but we're giving advice to the person breaking up and getting back together.

163
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,560
Four times is a little excessive.

164
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:56,880
Yeah.

165
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,120
This guy's asking how does he tell his friend to end it?

166
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,920
I don't think you can.

167
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,960
I don't think you do.

168
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,920
What do you care?

169
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,040
Why are you, why do you care?

170
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,800
You got to jettison now.

171
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,400
All you could do is be really passive aggressive and like when they come back and be like,

172
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,520
oh, I got back together with him.

173
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,040
Just go, oh, really?

174
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,800
Huh, huh, huh.

175
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,240
That's, that's all you could do.

176
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,920
We broke up.

177
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,440
Oh, did you break up?

178
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,200
So treat it like it's not a thing at all.

179
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,720
And then he's probably just doing it for the attention or she is, you know?

180
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,160
That's a good, yeah, that's good.

181
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,120
We're back in it now.

182
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,960
You got to disengage.

183
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
Four times sounds like they're like 15.

184
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,920
You got to disengage from this relationship, from their relationship.

185
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,400
You got to say like, oh, whatever, she's doing this with this guy.

186
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,800
It has no bearing on me.

187
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,800
That, that is what you should say.

188
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,000
Because it's, that way lies madness.

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,240
Like getting all up in other people's cream.

190
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,440
Like you don't need that.

191
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,080
Also, you run the risk of really sounding like an asshole.

192
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,960
Like, you know what I mean?

193
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,040
Like if your friend's not looking for the advice there, then you just want to stay out.

194
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,840
It's a loser.

195
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,120
It's a, it's a, it's a real loser.

196
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,320
You don't, you don't need it.

197
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,520
Speaking of loser.

198
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,800
Speaking of loser.

199
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,600
Let's talk about winners.

200
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,720
How about a Yahoo?

201
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,220
Yes.

202
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,240
This one was sent in by Vikram Murugaval.

203
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,680
I prayed to Jesus.

204
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,400
I said that right.

205
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

206
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,840
Not that Vikram Murugaval likely believes in Jesus.

207
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,720
He sounds like a heathen.

208
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,180
Okay.

209
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,560
He sounds like a pagan.

210
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,600
Is he a pagan?

211
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,240
I think he's a pagan.

212
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,880
There's that one racist thing we say every episode I have to edit out.

213
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,280
This one is, this one's by Yahoo Answers user Dragon101 who asks,

214
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,480
I'm a dragon.

215
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,700
Okay.

216
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,640
But I don't know how to summon my special skills.

217
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,120
I can do some things unordinary.

218
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,160
Anyone have ideas?

219
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,160
This is kind of new and also confusing for my age that is.

220
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,880
I can tell you right now that I'm under 21.

221
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,240
Anyone have ideas on what I could do because I'm a dragon?

222
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,740
Please.

223
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,360
Well, this is the age old question of is it a mental thing?

224
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
Is there a muscle that you flex?

225
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,560
Is there an incantation?

226
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,880
It's age old questions, you know?

227
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,520
And really it's different strokes for different folks.

228
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,400
Like for me, for me, it's all muscular.

229
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,480
I've had to tone.

230
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,800
I've had to develop.

231
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,240
You've had to kegel?

232
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,040
I've had to kegel my dragon muscles to the point where I can, you know,

233
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,840
execute my unordinary abilities.

234
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,840
But the thing is 21, that's kind of a little late to the game.

235
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,400
You are.

236
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,520
You're getting a late start to learning your Drachen in the old tongue.

237
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,040
Your draconic.

238
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,360
Your draconic abilities.

239
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Because I mean, that's a weird age.

240
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,320
Dragon of Puberty.

241
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,960
Like, I hit mine in middle school.

242
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,400
I was kind of an early bloomer.

243
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,280
You know, some things just hit me in the third age, but it was a long time ago.

244
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,240
Oh, okay.

245
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,740
Yeah.

246
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,720
I just become, I just became so terrified because I just realized that dragons have

247
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,960
learned to use the internet and we've lost our one vantage.

248
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,080
The one thing we had that they didn't.

249
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,920
I don't know how to break this to you, but one out of every four people you talk to or

250
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,640
meet on the internet is a dragon.

251
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
Holy shit.

252
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,640
Is that a velociraptor noise?

253
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Travis, oh shit.

254
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,640
Travis is one of them.

255
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
I didn't know this was a dragon cast.

256
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
If dragons aren't using the internet, then explain TMZ.

257
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
You can't.

258
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
It can't be done.

259
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640
Made by, made by, gossip by dragons for dragons.

260
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
Perez Hilton, half dragon.

261
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
What does a dragon keyboard look like?

262
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
Do you think it has runes?

263
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,640
I think it has runes.

264
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,140
I think it's very runic.

265
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,140
I think it's made out of, like, lute.

266
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,140
What?

267
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,140
It's made out of what?

268
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,140
It's made out of lute, like dragon lute.

269
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,140
Dragons have hoards, right?

270
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,140
Just full of, like, jewels and gold.

271
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,140
Travis, a lute.

272
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,140
Oh, L-O-O-T, not L-U-T-E.

273
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,140
You think he made several little stringed instruments?

274
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,140
Like, that's what his keyboard was made out of?

275
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,140
I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't.

276
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,640
Like Sting?

277
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,140
Like Sting plays?

278
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,640
Yes.

279
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Sting is a dragon?

280
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,640
Sorry, Travis.

281
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,640
Sorry, I didn't, I didn't mean to, uh...

282
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,640
I'm sending out an SOS of sadness.

283
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,640
Aww, don't be sad.

284
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,640
It's just Sting.

285
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,640
I know.

286
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,640
How do you...

287
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,640
I can't remember how I dealt with the pressure of being a teenage dragon.

288
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,640
I made a Disney movie out of it.

289
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
And it was called How to Deal with the Pressure of Being a Teenage Dragon?

290
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,640
Yeah, it wasn't very popular.

291
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,640
Yeah?

292
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,640
Speaking of dragons,

293
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,640
Uh, it's...

294
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
We need your fire.

295
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,640
For the Maximum Fun Pledge Drive.

296
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,640
It's pledge week.

297
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,640
We want you to rush, rush My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

298
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,640
Pledge our frat.

299
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,640
Our fraternity of chuckles.

300
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Can we haze our listeners?

301
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
I think this is a hazing.

302
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,640
Every week's a hazing here at My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

303
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Uh, so this is our pledge drive for 2011.

304
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,640
Uh, we're gonna talk a little bit about the network and some of the benefits of donating here in a sec.

305
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
But first, just to let you know how this works.

306
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
There's a network.

307
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
It's family.

308
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
And like a family,

309
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,640
Daddy's got to get paid.

310
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,640
And so...

311
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
And Daddy, in this case, our daddy,

312
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,640
is the Maximum Fun Network.

313
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,640
And you, uh, find folks who enjoy the programming here,

314
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
uh, pay for us to make it.

315
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,640
You pay to help us buy, uh, equipment.

316
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,640
You pay to help us run our website.

317
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,640
And you pay to help us host our shows.

318
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
And you're paying for it.

319
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,640
I like to think of it like a medieval patronage.

320
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,640
How's that? How's that work?

321
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,640
We're like kept people.

322
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
We're like serfs.

323
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
Yeah, I was gonna say, I feel kind of serf-ish.

324
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:58,640
It's more like how the king would want Mozart to write a piece for him.

325
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,640
This is not medieval times, of course, anymore.

326
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,640
So we're like Da Vinci.

327
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,640
We're like Da Vinci, basically.

328
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
And this show is like our Sistine Chapel.

329
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,640
We're like Da Vinci, but better at drawings.

330
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Yeah, I think it's an accurate way to put it.

331
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,640
So, Griffin, can you tell them a little bit about, uh,

332
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
why they should donate? Why it's so important?

333
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
Well, I'm working on this helicopter.

334
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Like kind of a Worley gig helicopter

335
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,640
made out of, uh, parchment and wood framing.

336
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,640
And it's an expensive project.

337
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,640
I want to make a man fly.

338
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Can you help me make a man fly with wood framing?

339
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,640
I'm making parchment wings.

340
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
Parchment wings.

341
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,640
Eureka.

342
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:46,640
We have, donations from listeners is our main, you know, lifeblood.

343
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,640
It's our lifeblood.

344
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,640
It pumps through our veins and gives us strength and energy

345
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
to do this thing that we do.

346
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,640
And all the other Maximum Fun podcasts do.

347
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,640
Listen, podcasting is kind of, uh, it's still in its infancy, you know?

348
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,640
It's still fresh. It's still new.

349
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,640
The rule book hasn't been written yet.

350
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,640
Um, and so Maximum Fun, uh, and one of the main reasons we joined Maximum Fun

351
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,640
is because they're doing awesome things.

352
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,640
We're doing awesome things, I guess, because we're part of that family.

353
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,640
But, you know, we cover topics that aren't really covered in other places.

354
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,640
And, you know, we do it in a way that a lot of other forms of programming don't do.

355
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,640
Um, and we fostered this community of, well, we didn't foster.

356
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,640
You know what I'm saying.

357
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,640
Maximum Fun has fostered a community of,

358
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
probably the best community on the internet.

359
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,640
I would say, I think that, especially after they fused with my brother,

360
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,640
my brother and me, the Mibimbambinos,

361
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,640
I think that they really, uh, it really is a top flight community.

362
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
We gave them that spice, that picante.

363
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,640
With that, like, mmm, what a delicious flavor.

364
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,640
With that last, like, dash of, like, pepper, where you go.

365
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,640
Yeah. Exactly.

366
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,640
You know, it's funny, Griff.

367
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,640
You watch so much stuff on TV and so many movies that is supposed to be funny,

368
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,640
and you think, wow, this doesn't really get me.

369
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,640
You know, this isn't really up my alley.

370
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,640
And then you listen to stuff on Maximum Fun, and it is.

371
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,640
It is sort of, you know, when you find something that you really like,

372
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,640
um, you, you know, you want to support it and show that you're out there listening.

373
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
Um, and we need to get that chatter.

374
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
What the fuck?

375
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
Gotta get that chatter.

376
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,640
You know, it's a cool thing because, I mean,

377
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
you can see it in the way that the My Brother, My Brother and Me community

378
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,640
has sort of meshed into the Maximum Fun community,

379
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,640
is that you, it's basically just like a big group of friends.

380
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,640
It's like finding this new big group of friends,

381
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,640
but also that group of friends does, you know, shows.

382
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,640
And they're all, they're friendly shows?

383
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,640
I don't know. I lost my train of thought there.

384
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
No, no, you were doing great.

385
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,640
Trev, why don't you tell us, let's get to what people really want to know.

386
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
What's in it for me?

387
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
What do you get?

388
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,640
Obviously, like the most obvious thing is 44% is banned.

389
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,640
Time to pay up.

390
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,640
Yeah.

391
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,640
Time to pay the piper.

392
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,640
You can, you can alleviate your guilt.

393
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
I know your guilt.

394
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,640
I hope that every week you laugh and you feel guilty.

395
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,640
And after this, you can narrow that down.

396
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,640
You can whittle that down to one of those.

397
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,640
And not only that, but now you can laugh and feel superior

398
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
to all those people that didn't donate.

399
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,640
And you can start talking about those freeloaders

400
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,640
and like hating on the lower class.

401
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
It's pretty awesome.

402
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,640
But also you get tangible gifts.

403
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,640
There's many different levels of donation.

404
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
Bust it out, Travis.

405
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,640
Well, for the $2 or $5 a month level of donation,

406
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,640
you get the Max Fund Membership Card

407
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,640
and access to exclusive episodes of JJGO,

408
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,640
My Brother, My Brother and Me, John Hodgman,

409
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,640
and Stop Podcasting Yourself.

410
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,640
So they're all special episodes that you only get access to

411
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,640
if you're a donor.

412
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,640
And also we've done some RIFT movies,

413
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
kind of, you know,

414
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,640
hilarious old-timey 1950s instructional videos.

415
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,640
And we did one, Stop Podcasting Yourself did one,

416
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
and Jordan did one,

417
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,640
and Jesse, I'm sure, was in there as well.

418
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,640
So there's that.

419
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
Those two also get you stickers.

420
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,640
Would that come with the membership card

421
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,640
that you can, you know, apply to Elisa Frank Trapper Keeper?

422
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,640
If people are still, I was an all-star,

423
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,640
or a five-star man,

424
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,640
but I'm sure that the Trapper Keeper is still hot.

425
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,640
You could also apply those stickers to a sleeping friend.

426
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
Mm-hmm.

427
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
We recorded our special episode yesterday,

428
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,640
our Plus Drive episode, your bonus episode yesterday,

429
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
and it is...

430
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
Probably the best.

431
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
It's a barn burner.

432
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
And I would say star-studded.

433
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
Yeah, we got some, can we tell them about the stars?

434
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,640
Yeah, please.

435
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Yeah.

436
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Oh, we've got, you want Jordan,

437
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,640
you want Jesse Thorne from Jordan and Jesse Go?

438
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
You got him.

439
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,640
Dave Shimka and Graham Clark from Stop Podcasting Yourself?

440
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
Yeah, sure, why not?

441
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
You want Clint McElroy?

442
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Just toss him in there.

443
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
You want Clint McElroy?

444
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
Who?

445
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
That's right.

446
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,640
Clint McElroy.

447
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
McElroy Scion.

448
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
You want Clint McElroy?

449
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
No problem.

450
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,640
How about John Hodgman?

451
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,640
Yeah, I think you might want to go get that app.

452
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,640
And you can only get it by donating to Maximum Fund Drive

453
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,640
as little as $2 a month.

454
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
I know you can afford that.

455
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
But if you want to bump it up,

456
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,640
let's say you want to get up to $10,

457
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,640
you say I can afford $10 a month for things I like.

458
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
If they want to go to $10?

459
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,640
Yeah, $10 you get a tote bag.

460
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,640
You're gonna get a tote bag.

461
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,640
We would, you can get it for any Maximum Fund show.

462
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,640
There's only one right answer, of course.

463
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
We all have our own designs.

464
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
Ours was done by Mr. Justin Russo

465
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,640
whose work you're probably familiar with

466
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,640
because it's pretty much the best work on the planet.

467
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,640
Have you guys seen the Constitution of the United States?

468
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
He's like Da Vinci's Da Vinci.

469
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,640
Yeah.

470
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,640
He did the layout for the Constitution,

471
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
is what I'm saying.

472
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
Yeah.

473
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,640
And those tote bags come from the fine people.

474
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,640
Those tote bags are from the fine people at EcoBags.

475
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,640
Thank you so much.

476
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
Fine people at EcoBags.

477
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,640
Who did the printing on those?

478
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,640
I believe it was VG Kids.

479
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,640
I've seen their work before.

480
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,640
It's equally exquisite.

481
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
So that would be awesome.

482
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,640
If you want to get that tote bag,

483
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,640
and make sure you do request My Brother My Brother Mute tote bag,

484
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,640
it's the best one.

485
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,640
It makes the other ones look like a dookie bag.

486
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,640
That's all I'm saying.

487
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
That's all I'm saying.

488
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,640
I don't want to judge them.

489
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,640
You get the Max Fund pack

490
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,640
and the Donors Only episodes with the $10 a month.

491
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
Go ahead.

492
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,640
Each of these levels, you get the shit in the last level,

493
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
the previous levels as well.

494
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
Yeah.

495
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
It's just the values.

496
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,640
The value is out of this world.

497
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,640
And then at $20 a month, if you go to $20,

498
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,640
you're going to be a part of the Diamond Friendship Circle.

499
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,640
I'm going to tell you.

500
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,640
$10, you're a friend of the family.

501
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,640
$20, Diamond Friendship Circle.

502
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,640
My knee is bleeding.

503
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,640
I don't know why I mentioned that, but it is happening.

504
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,640
Is it because of all the special feelings you're feeling right now?

505
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,640
I feel so emotional that my knee is bleeding.

506
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,640
That's love.

507
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,640
That's love coming out of your knee.

508
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,640
You're going to get a special Max Fund USB drive.

509
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
So cool.

510
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
It's made of wood.

511
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,640
How does it keep all the technology inside?

512
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,640
Dryads.

513
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:17,640
It's a special USB drive made of wood emblazoned with the Rocket to the Stars Max Fund logo.

514
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640
It's full of Max Fund shows.

515
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
You delete them, I don't care.

516
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Wholesale.

517
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
I don't care.

518
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,640
Screw you.

519
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,640
Put porn on it.

520
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
Do what you like.

521
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
Tote bag, got it.

522
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
Max Fund pack, you know it.

523
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Dryads.

524
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
You put porn in the tote bag.

525
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,640
Exclusive access to donor-only episodes of podcasts and three-year short films.

526
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
Yeah, I should say so.

527
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,640
Uh-huh.

528
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,640
We'll tell you about some of the other donation levels here in a bit.

529
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,640
But we really, really could use your help here.

530
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,640
If you want to go to maximumfund.org forward slash donate, you'll see all the different

531
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,640
levels right there.

532
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,640
If you don't have the internet, how the fuck are you listening to this, you wizard?

533
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
You silly bitch.

534
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
You silly bitch wizard.

535
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,640
I just want to say this really is a really cool way for you guys to invest in the show.

536
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,640
You guys have been nothing but warm and receptive to us since we started.

537
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
And this thing just keeps growing.

538
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,640
And we want it to keep growing.

539
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,640
And we could use whatever help you could give us because, yeah, just get involved.

540
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,640
You're going to feel so good if you donate.

541
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,640
And every time you listen to the show or any of the other fine shows on the Max Fund

542
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Network, and you'll know that it's because of you that we can keep doing this awesome

543
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
thing that we absolutely love doing.

544
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,640
Think about it like buying stock in My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

545
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
Yeah.

546
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,640
And pretty soon you'll be part owner of My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

547
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,640
Minority stake.

548
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,640
We're the Green Bay Packers of podcasts.

549
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
Okay.

550
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,640
I like it.

551
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,640
And we're Super Bowl champs.

552
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,640
Mm-hmm.

553
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,640
Mm-hmm.

554
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,640
I'm the Clay Matthews of audio broadcasting.

555
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
I'm the Vince.

556
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,640
And I'm the other one.

557
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:02,640
I'm the Vince Lombardi of taking it downtown for the three-point goal.

558
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
So donate right now.

559
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
Don't wait.

560
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Don't hesitate.

561
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
Go get on your computer.

562
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,640
I know you have the internet.

563
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,640
Stop playing.

564
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,640
Go to MaximumFun.org.

565
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,640
And get on board.

566
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,640
Moving on.

567
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,640
I met this girl at a party on Saturday, and she asked me for my number.

568
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,640
I requested hers in return.

569
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,640
What is the correct number of days I should wait to call and ask for a date as to not

570
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,640
seem too eager or dismissive?

571
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
I love this.

572
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
She's really pretty.

573
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
Wait.

574
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
Forget about the name of this one.

575
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,640
Well, I don't believe in that.

576
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
I mean, I don't either.

577
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,640
I don't believe in the waiting period.

578
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,640
And I'll tell you why.

579
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,640
First off, you're not in swingers.

580
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,640
Fuck you.

581
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,640
All right.

582
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,640
I'm sorry.

583
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
You're no Vince Vaughn.

584
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
You're barely a Jean Favreau.

585
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,640
And even if you are Jean Favreau, you're Jean Favreau and Rudy carrying an extra 50 pounds

586
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,640
or so.

587
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,640
Whoa.

588
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,640
If you like somebody, had a good time, you're going to wake up the next day thinking about

589
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
that person.

590
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
Guaranteed.

591
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,640
And they're going to wake up the next day maybe thinking about you.

592
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
Maybe they're not.

593
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
Like, you've got to guarantee.

594
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,640
You've got to close.

595
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
You've got to ask for the sale.

596
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,640
You've got to get on the horn and make contact.

597
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,640
I say no waiting.

598
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
I don't believe in it.

599
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
I think that's a great point.

600
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,640
If you call someone and it's quote too early to call them, newsflash, they weren't that

601
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,640
interested.

602
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,640
If you tell me that you're going to wait three days to call a girl that you were really into,

603
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,640
you're going to have to convince me that you are not going to get hit by a bus tomorrow

604
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,640
because if you can't prove that, then pick up the phone and start dialing.

605
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
That's all I'm saying.

606
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,640
Live like you were dying.

607
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,640
And anyone that tells you you should wait, you shouldn't listen to their advice.

608
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,640
Like, that's the kind of thing.

609
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,640
Like, it's just the beginning of like a mind game.

610
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,640
Like, you don't want to do that.

611
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,640
It's stupid.

612
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,640
If you think this person is real pretty and you're actually interested in them, why wait?

613
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,640
Like, it doesn't make any sense.

614
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,640
There are no laws to love.

615
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
Throw that rule book out.

616
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
Well, there are laws.

617
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,640
There are no laws.

618
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,640
Age limits.

619
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,640
There are no laws when it comes to age of love.

620
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
You can't put a legal age on love.

621
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,640
That's what I always say.

622
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,640
Oh, you always say that?

623
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,640
You do.

624
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640
We have.

625
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
We already did that as a society, I think.

626
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
Put an age on love.

627
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,640
Just love with reckless abandon.

628
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,640
Within reason.

629
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,640
Definitely.

630
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
Yeah.

631
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,640
Nope.

632
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
You can't put a reason.

633
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
Love ain't got no reason.

634
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
Well, I don't know.

635
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Love don't cost a thing.

636
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,640
I learned that from an American idol who's Jennifer Lopez.

637
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
Don't need money.

638
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
Don't need money.

639
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Don't need fame.

640
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
Don't need fame.

641
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,640
What about credit?

642
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
What about credit?

643
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,640
I'm almost certain.

644
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,640
Where are we at on credit cards?

645
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,640
You can ride this train without any form of credit or debit card.

646
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Incidentally, a credit or debit card is a perfect way to donate to Maximum Fund.

647
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,640
If you just want to go ahead to Maximum Fund.org, forward slash donate right now.

648
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,640
You can just get it.

649
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,640
I want to throw out just in case this wasn't implied, you should wait at least 12 hours.

650
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,640
Before donating?

651
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
No, before calling.

652
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,640
If you get her number, do not call her on the way home.

653
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,640
Yeah, that's weird.

654
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,640
Hey, listen.

655
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
Excitement is one thing.

656
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,640
Stalker is another.

657
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,640
Let's make this more relevant for the now generation.

658
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,640
You don't tweet them.

659
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
Yeah, it's Facebook.

660
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,640
What's the ruling on Facebook sending a Facebook friend request?

661
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
Because I always feel weird.

662
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
No.

663
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,640
I'll meet somebody and be like, you seem like a cool person I can be friends with.

664
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,640
But if I Facebook them as soon as I get home, I'm going to seem like a fucking weirdo that

665
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,640
was like, I can't wait to put you in my collection.

666
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
Here's what you need to be aware.

667
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,640
If she's giving you her number and then you Facebook friend request her, you're taking

668
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
a step back.

669
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,640
You've already got the number.

670
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,640
You need to move forward.

671
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,640
Also, you shouldn't text her until you call her first.

672
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:53,640
And if you do tweet, make sure you remove the location, especially if it is in her bushes.

673
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,640
That's really important.

674
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
Where is this coming from?

675
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
This tweet is coming from my bushes outside.

676
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
This tweet is coming from inside the house.

677
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
It's coming from inside the house.

678
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,640
He's tweeting.

679
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,640
Is that a Marcus shaped topiary?

680
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
Nope.

681
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,640
Nope.

682
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
Marcus is in my bushes.

683
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,640
It's just Big M stalking again.

684
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
Lately, I've noticed something.

685
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,640
My girlfriend's unable to keep quiet when we're trying to indulge in any sort of recording

686
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
media.

687
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Even when it's something we're both interested in, movies, podcasts, TV shows, etc.

688
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,640
I can count on it being interrupted by a story that lasts forever.

689
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,640
I'm the kind of guy that likes to catch every second of what I'm watching or listening to.

690
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,640
I've given up listening to your show when we're together because I'll hear an explosion of laughter from Travis and have no idea what I just missed.

691
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,640
What's the most what I just missed?

692
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
That's what I said.

693
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
That's what he typed, I swear.

694
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,640
What's the most polite way to say shut up?

695
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,640
Talked out in Toronto.

696
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,640
Hey, dog, there's not.

697
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,640
You just got to pick and choose your media, my friend.

698
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,640
If you want to end your relationship real quick, the best thing to do is as soon as she starts talking,

699
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,640
pause whatever you're listening to or watching, let go of a deep sigh and turn towards her and go, no, please go on.

700
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,640
Oh, God.

701
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,640
That's brutal.

702
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,640
That is really brutal.

703
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,640
Yeah.

704
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,640
Or you could also get also in that relationship right quick just by saying shut up.

705
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,640
Shut up.

706
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,640
Shut up.

707
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,640
Shut up.

708
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640
Miet.

709
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
Miet.

710
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,640
Miet.

711
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Miet.

712
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,640
Just keep saying that till she stops.

713
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,640
She'll get the message.

714
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:35,640
I think the best way to deal with this is to, before you indulge in the recorded media, talk her out.

715
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,640
Just let her get it all out.

716
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,640
Let her hear about everything that's been going on in your life, in her life.

717
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,640
So she feels that like sated.

718
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,640
She's obviously got a need to connect with you.

719
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:53,640
And you know what, there are some shows that you can be sort of understanding about this with.

720
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,640
Like Sydney and I have shows that we watch, that we watch-watch.

721
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,640
But there are other shows that we like to watch just because it kind of starts conversations.

722
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,640
And you can talk, you know, like we don't sit there mum while we watch.

723
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,640
Sister Wives.

724
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,640
Sister Wives or Top Model.

725
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,640
Top Sister Wives?

726
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
Top Sister Wives.

727
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,640
I'm the best sister wife there is.

728
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
Yeah.

729
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,640
Ezekiel's next top sister wife.

730
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:21,640
I think we can all agree that Robin is the clear winner this season.

731
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,640
Yeah, she is.

732
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,640
She's a beautiful, homely, strong woman.

733
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,640
I think it's Omarosa.

734
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,640
She's back on TV.

735
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,640
She is on everything.

736
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,640
Man, I love New York.

737
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,640
And she is doing a great job on Ezekiel's next top sister wife.

738
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
So let me give you this.

739
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,640
Pick your battles.

740
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
I'm going to give you some Zen advice.

741
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
Uh oh.

742
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
Yeah.

743
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,640
In this modern age of technology, that's what TiVo is for.

744
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,640
It's what pause and stop buttons are for.

745
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,640
And like there is nothing in this world that's so important that you need to tell her to shut up.

746
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,640
You can rewatch something.

747
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,640
You can catch a rerun of it.

748
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,640
You can listen to it again.

749
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:05,640
Or if it's a podcast, you could delete it and then download it again just several times until you get your fill of it.

750
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,640
Just keep deleting and downloading our podcast.

751
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
Because that's good for our numbers.

752
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
And it's good for your love life.

753
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
Well, it's good for our numbers.

754
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,640
Do you think that she talked during the finale of Lost?

755
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,640
Because fuck that noise.

756
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Oh, then you throw her out a window.

757
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,640
Yeah, it's got to have limits.

758
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,640
Hey, where's Debbie?

759
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
Oh, Debbie?

760
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,640
I threw her out a window.

761
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,640
She talked during the finale of Lost and I threw her out a window.

762
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,640
We live on the first floor, but she still went away.

763
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,640
No court will convict you for that crime.

764
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
There's not a court in America.

765
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
Not a court in the land.

766
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,640
There's not a court in the land that would bust you for that.

767
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
Griffin, I need a Yahoo answer.

768
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
It's pretty important.

769
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,640
Sure.

770
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
Let me see if I can do something for you in that department.

771
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,640
Okay.

772
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,640
This one was sent in by OurGayHeart.

773
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,640
Thank you, OurGayHeart.

774
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Alexis who asks,

775
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,640
What should I call my boyfriend?

776
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,640
My boyfriend and I joke around and call each other by fun pet names like Chump and Punk.

777
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,640
What are some names I could call him, or what have you called boyfriends or girlfriends?

778
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,640
I usually call my girlfriends Chump or Punk, so I'm fresh out of solutions.

779
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,640
You could combine it and just call him Chunk.

780
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,640
Yeah, or Pump.

781
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,640
Sydney and Chunkpump.

782
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,640
Sydney is an encomadont.

783
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,640
Is that normal?

784
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,640
Is that okay?

785
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,640
This is my girlfriend Chunkpump.

786
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,640
I love her very much.

787
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,640
She's very sweet.

788
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,640
This is my girlfriend The Captain.

789
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,640
I really love her very much.

790
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
She's a real sweetheart.

791
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,640
Chunkpump makes me think of the old-timey way that pioneers used to get creamed corn up out of the ground.

792
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,640
Got a deep vein here.

793
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
This is a nice vein.

794
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
It's rich.

795
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,640
Let me get out my creamed corn dowsing machine.

796
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,640
It's made of creamed corn.

797
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:03,640
I hold a scoop of creamed corn in my left hand and it leads me home.

798
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,640
More creamed corn.

799
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:12,640
I think we can find some elucidation in the answers that have been provided.

800
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,640
Okay.

801
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,640
That's good.

802
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:28,640
I have answers user PB responded, names I've called him sap, sweet boy, his middle name Dumbo, loser or just L.

803
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
Is his middle name Dumbo?

804
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,640
Reginald Dumbo Bevans.

805
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
Killer.

806
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:42,640
Cop boy or his occupation hyphen boy.

807
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
Unemployed boy.

808
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Hey, cop boy.

809
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
Hey, count boy.

812
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,640

846
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,640
Answer.

Answer.

862
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,640
You call your, you basically call your boyfriend.

863
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,800
I'm just, there are so many in the answers I'm not gonna say who gave them.

864
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
The worst.

865
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,320
Just the worst things you can come up with.

866
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Punk chunk.

867
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,320
Punkin' chunkin'.

868
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,880
And he seems really into you.

869
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,280
Except for blonde dumbo, that seems a little out of line.

870
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,600
Well yeah, it's a little mean.

871
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,840

00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,840
I'm Professor Bon Bon Sugar Lips.

882
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
I'm Bon Bon Bon Sugar Lips.

883
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:19,840
The next thing is the best thing I've ever read.

884
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
Badoodly kitten.

885
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
What?

886
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,840
Badoodly kitten?

887
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,840
Say that one more time.

888
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
Badoodly kitten.

889
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Can I get one more?

890
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,840
Just take me to the bridge?

891
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,840
A Badoodly kitten.

892
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,840
That would be B apostrophe D oodly kitten.

893
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:43,360
I didn't know that we could just like say sounds and like mash them together.

894
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,140
Like bequonja.

895
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,080
Like bequonja?

896
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,080
Like that's...

897
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,080
Badoodly kitten.

898
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,080
Badoodly kitten.

899
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,080
Kissy kissy sweetheart.

900
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,600
Love and lovey poo.

901
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,400
Sexy yum yum cupcake.

902
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Badoodly kitten.

903
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,400
Badoodly kitten.

904
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,400
Sweetie kins.

905
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,000
These are starting to sound like the names of like really bad Japanese anime.

906
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,720
Sweetie yum yum cakes.

907
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,440
It was sexy yum yum cupcake, which...

908
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
Excuse me.

909
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
Probably sounds...

910
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
Excuse me.

911
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,440
Pardon me.

912
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
Yeah.

913
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,440
That's it.

914
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,440
Badoodly...

915
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
Sweetie pie cutie cake was your last girlfriend.

916
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
I know.

917
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
I know what you've been doing behind my back.

918
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,160
Don't you confuse me with her.

919
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,160
I'm not your Badoodly cake anymore.

920
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,400
I don't think I've ever been in any relationship where I had nor distributed pet names.

921
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Really?

922
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,720
I don't think you should have more than like two.

923
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,600
Then it just becomes like a game and kind of stupid.

924
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
A little stupid.

925
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,840
Justin, you sounded surprised by my assertion.

926
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,360
Do you and your wife have...

927
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,160
Well I think employing pet names is fine.

928
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,040
I think assigning them is probably a little much.

929
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,240
Because I'm sitting here having a memento sort of flashback moment, I'm realizing that

930
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,400
my wife has, to my knowledge, never employed a pet name when speaking of me.

931
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,760
So maybe I'm off base or maybe this is a one-sided type thing.

932
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
But you have one for her?

933
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,640
Are you going to keep it secret like a power word?

934
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,360
I don't have like a specific pet name for her.

935
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,360
Okay.

936
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,360
You yell down the stairs at her.

937
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,360
What?

938
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,360
I don't know.

939
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,800
Just Honey or Sweetie.

940
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
You know different malleable nouns?

941
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,000
Like I'll just swap one of those in.

942
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,120
It doesn't really matter.

943
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,400
Here's an action item for this week.

944
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:35,240
I want you to only refer to your wife by one of the names I've mentioned in this line

945
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,600
of questioning.

946
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,960
May I recommend Badoodly Kitten?

947
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,220
Perhaps Badoodly Kitten.

948
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,320
Maybe Kissy Kissy Sweetheart.

949
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,320
I think it's going to work out really well.

950
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,320
Sexy Yum Yum Cupcake.

951
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,160
That was my last girlfriend.

952
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,680
So you know we've been having a lot of fun here.

953
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,120
And I know that when I am having a lot of fun, what I always think is, I wish I could

954
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,680
pay for this.

955
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,120
The good news is, you can.

956
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,720
This is Pledge Week for maximum fun.

957
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:12,720
And we are, we wanted to go over some of the other donation levels, but I wanted to thank

958
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,800
you in advance.

959
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,100
And just record, if you haven't donated yet, just go ahead and skip this and then come

960
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,200
on back.

961
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,520
But thank you in advance for donating.

962
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,520
Because it's not just for us.

963
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,400
We're part of a family here.

964
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,520
And we use this money for a lot of really cool stuff.

965
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,960
We're going to use it for, you know, goes to meetups is something that your money goes

966
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
towards.

967
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,780
Helping us get together with you guys.

968
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:45,300
It goes, like we've said before, to hosting fees, to pay artists who help create stuff

969
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,300
with us.

970
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,300
Things like merchandise.

971
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,300
Merchandise, yeah.

972
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:54,200
I mean, it's a really positive way to spend your money.

973
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:59,800
Because what maximum fun puts into the world is goodness.

974
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,520
It's unadulterated joy.

975
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,580
Just pleasure.

976
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,520
You're donating to the creation of pleasure.

977
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,620
And if there's a finer way to spend your money, I haven't heard about it.

978
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:17,280
And if there's a finer level for you to donate at than $35 per month.

979
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,200
There are many higher levels.

980
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
These rewards.

981
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,200
I mean, there are.

982
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,200
But there are.

983
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,840
But the rewards for $35 per month is Griffin.

984
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,840
Hit me with it.

985
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,840
It's almost it's on.

986
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,800
I feel like I'm in some sort of dream state.

987
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:35,200
I've been in a dream state since I first saw it because it's too incredible to be real.

988
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,200
Judge John Hodgman's post apocalyptic justice squad friend of the show.

989
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
John Hodgman.

990
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,200
I feel like I need to make that sound.

991
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
Yeah.

992
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,200
Can you make it one more time?

993
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,400
Can you step down a little bit?

994
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
Awesome.

995
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
So what do you get?

996
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,840
You get Judge John Hodgman's and Maximal Fund's completely collectible, completely proprietary

997
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,920
nerd emergency kit.

998
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,320
What's in an emergency kit?

999
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,200
That felt good to say.

1000
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,760
I would say the centerpiece, the cornucopia in the middle of your Thanksgiving dinner

1001
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:20,000
table is an Eton self-powered AM FM weather radio with flashlight, a solar USB power station

1002
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,600
for your phone.

1003
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
And that's it.

1004
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,080
I kept adding on to that sentence like there was something else on it.

1005
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,280
How much more shit do you need?

1006
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,080
It's a radio that gets AM FM and weather band.

1007
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:37,240
It charges both solarly and with a crank and has a flashlight on it and a USB power station

1008
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,300
for your phone.

1009
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:45,680
If your shit, if Earth's shit gets fucked, like in 2012, if we experience a 2012 scenario,

1010
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,120
everyone who doesn't donate $35 per month is going to die on Earth.

1011
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,560
I'm sorry, $10 and $20 and $2 and $5, like you guys are great.

1012
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,560
Good job.

1013
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,560
Thanks for all that.

1014
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,560
But you're fucking dead.

1015
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,560
You're fucking dead.

1016
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,560
You're in heaven.

1017
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,560
You're dead.

1018
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,400
You didn't go to heaven though, unless the people who paid nothing went to hell.

1019
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
That's just religion 101.

1020
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,400
$2, $5, $10, $20, heaven.

1021
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
$35.

1022
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,200
So don't even fret about heaven or hell yet because you've got a long, long time left

1023
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,080
to live because you have this sweet ass emergency kit that will keep you alive forever.

1024
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,800
Until the vegetables die out.

1025
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,760
Then it's like every man for himself.

1026
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,320
Another awesome thing about that radio is it comes with the Red Cross logo emblazoned

1027
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:29,720
across it because every portion of what you donate goes to help the Red Cross in, you

1028
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
know, those-

1029
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,720
You're donating-

1030
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,720
Catastrophied countries.

1031
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,700
To joy, both here and abroad.

1032
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,440
The Maximum Fun USB drive is also in there.

1033
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:47,100
You're going to get a really cool book called Role Models by Mr. John Waters.

1034
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:52,640
He was very, very kind to let us include this book in the nerd emergency kit.

1035
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,640
Okay.

1036
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,640
We're not even done yet.

1037
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
We're not even done yet.

1038
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,640
This is the craziest thing.

1039
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,640
You ready?

1040
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
There's so much more shit.

1041
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,640
This is what I'm really excited about.

1042
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,640
Oh.

1043
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,480
There's a credit card survival tool that's a can opener, knife edge, screwdriver ruler,

1044
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:10,080
tap opener, four position wrench, butterfly wrench, saw blade, direction ancillary indication,

1045
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,760
and a lanyard hole.

1046
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,400
You get a saw blade?

1047
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,720
A saw blade and a saw blade.

1048
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
Yeah.

1049
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,200
Both of those things are in it.

1050
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,200
Pad of graph paper?

1051
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,200
Sure.

1052
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,200
A mechanical pencil?

1053
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Why wouldn't you?

1054
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
White surgical tape?

1055
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
Don't mind if I do.

1056
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Wait, what would that be for?

1057
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,200
20-sided die?

1058
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
What?

1059
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
What's the white surgical tape?

1060
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
For taping up your glasses.

1061
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,200
This is the best kit ever.

1062
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,200
A 20-sided die?

1063
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,200
Sure.

1064
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Let's have some fun.

1065
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,840
A 20-sided die only rolls 20s.

1066
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,240
Nothing but critical hits for you and your friends.

1067
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:45,520
Dinosaur band-aids, astronaut ice cream, powdered tang, and you're going to get the eco bags,

1068
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:51,600
tote bag, and the access to all the shows.

1069
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
And the stickers in the membership card.

1070
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,840
And the stickers in the membership.

1071
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,280
Holy shit, guys.

1072
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,720
$35 a month.

1073
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,600
I feel like you should include extra money in there just for how great that is.

1074
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:09,440
This year alone, I have bought, piecemeal, an Eton self-powered AM-FM weatherband radio

1075
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:16,680
with all that chargey shit, and a USB drive, and that book, and that tool, and some paper,

1076
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,760
and a mechanical pencil, and white surgical tape, and a 20-sided die, and dinosaur band-aids,

1077
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,240
and astronaut ice cream, and powdered tang.

1078
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,920
You know how much it cost me altogether?

1079
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,920
How much?

1080
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,920
$400,000.

1081
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,320
Griffin is so deeply in debt, and there's only one way to get him out, and that's to

1082
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,440
go to MaximumFund.org forward slash donate.

1083
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,600
You can't argue the value of this fucking near-emergency kit.

1084
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,640
It will blow your face off with value.

1085
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,240
And pledge right now, do not hesitate, because we need it now.

1086
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,240
Griffin's so broke.

1087
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,240
I am so, so, so broke.

1088
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,240
They're coming.

1089
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,240
They're coming for him.

1090
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,280
Why did he buy so many astronaut ice creams?

1091
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,280
That's the question.

1092
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,480
Also, this is worth mentioning, for the first year, Maximum Fund has switched its donation

1093
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:07,480
method off PayPal, because PayPal had it snoot so deep in the tiller.

1094
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,480
PayPal was cutting a lot, a significant amount of money out of your donations.

1095
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,480
Not no mo.

1096
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:19,880
We have a new donation system, so I think it's basically 99.99% of all the money you

1097
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:25,200
donate goes to Maximum Fund, and goes to supporting great shows like us, and Jordan and Jesse

1098
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:31,860
Goh, and Judge John Hodgman, and Stop Podcasting Yourself, and Sound of Young America.

1099
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:37,800
We need your help to stay alive, because you guys are the only source of revenue that the

1100
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,800
Maximum Fund network has.

1101
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,800
So please help.

1102
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,800
Well, that's not true.

1103
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,800
Well, you're pretty much, you're 99.99%.

1104
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,920
Again with these numbers that I think you're just making up.

1105
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:55,120
Also, there are challenge donors, which are people who have donated, who have agreed to

1106
00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:00,920
donate a certain amount of money for every new donor that Maximum Fund gets.

1107
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,240
So your donation is basically a double donation.

1108
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:12,620
The final tally for challenge donations is $5.66 and a half cents.

1109
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:19,160
I'm going to meet that guy who donated 1.5 cents, and I'm going to high-five him someday.

1110
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,660
He's the coolest guy ever.

1111
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:26,160
So for every donation, your donation also nets Maximum Fund an additional $5.66 and

1112
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,080
a half cents.

1113
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,280
So there's double incentive for you to give.

1114
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,560
So go donate, because you're going to feel so great, and we're going to feel so great,

1115
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,320
because we can keep growing, and keep expanding, and keep this show floating.

1116
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,320
Making you laugh.

1117
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,320
Keep bringing you joy.

1118
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,560
Pleasure, I would say.

1119
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,840
We want to please you.

1120
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,160
We want to touch your deepest pleasure centers.

1121
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:57,840
Listen, guys, I have trouble waking up in the morning, but especially on weekends.

1122
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,400
Recently I woke up at nine, which is when my alarm was set, and went back to sleep.

1123
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,840
I woke up later at three in the afternoon, meaning a good portion of my day was already

1124
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,840
gone.

1125
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,840
Oh, man.

1126
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,840
Wow.

1127
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,840
That sucks.

1128
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,680
I don't really have this problem on weekdays when I have school, but it happens nearly

1129
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,600
every Saturday and Sunday.

1130
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,440
What can I do to help myself wake up earlier?

1131
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,160
I have a suggestion.

1132
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,160
What?

1133
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:27,480
Get in a really bad car accident, or fall down a manhole, or almost drown, or get in

1134
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,040
a plane that almost crashes.

1135
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:35,080
You got to come face-to-face with your own mortality, Neil, and only then will you realize

1136
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,480
how precious every second you spend on this earth is.

1137
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,480
Wow.

1138
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,520
Griffin, that's beautiful.

1139
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,160
Just like the movie Fearless.

1140
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,520
If Fearless was a podcast, it would be My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1141
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,120
You have two options.

1142
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,120
You come face-to-face with your own mortality, or you buy one of those CD players that will

1143
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:56,960
start playing a certain track at a certain time, and just reach into your bag of Black

1144
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,120
Eyed Peas CDs and put in any one that you want, because there is not a track on there

1145
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,120
that won't wake you up.

1146
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,160
Boom, boom, boom.

1147
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,160
You skewed off there.

1148
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,160
Boom, boom, boom.

1149
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,160
Yeah.

1150
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,480
I thought you were really on point, and then that happened.

1151
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,840
I keep on copping my swagger.

1152
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,840
Oops.

1153
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,840
I'm awake.

1154
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:19,120
Neil, I'm worried about you, because waking up at nine, and then falling back to sleep,

1155
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,320
and accidentally sleeping for another six hours.

1156
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,880
That's a whole sleep.

1157
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,880
You sleep twice.

1158
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,920
You had a whole nother night's sleep.

1159
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,160
What time did you go to bed?

1160
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,440
Did you go to sleep at 8.30, and wake up at nine, and then sleep for another six hours?

1161
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,400
Hi, I'm Koma Neil.

1162
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,440
I don't know if we've met, but I go into Komas sometimes.

1163
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,200
Maybe you should just get up and go to school.

1164
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,080
I mean, I know it's Saturday, but just go to your school and sit there.

1165
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,400
Maybe you'll be up, at least.

1166
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,000
I bet you'll meet some interesting people.

1167
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,260
You know what I do, because I really like snoozing, but what I do is, as soon as my

1168
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,440
alarm goes off, don't even think about it.

1169
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,600
Just sit straight up in bed.

1170
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,080
If you lay there for a minute, and let the alarm go, and think about it, you're going

1171
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,120
to talk yourself into hitting the snooze button or turning off the alarm.

1172
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,080
But if you just spring up out of bed, you're up.

1173
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,080
You're good.

1174
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,080
Just get going.

1175
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,080
Don't lay there.

1176
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,440
Another good one is to put your alarm clock on the other side of the room.

1177
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,440
Don't put it right next to you.

1178
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,440
Put it on the other side of the room.

1179
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,440
Because then you're up and out of bed.

1180
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,480
And once you're out of bed, half the battle is already won.

1181
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,880
Maybe Neil's got a tiny Chicago bedroom where it's impossible to put your alarm clock at

1182
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,400
a place you can't reach while supine.

1183
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,720
Well then, if you have a phone and an alarm clock, set your alarm clock and then set the

1184
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,960
alarm on your phone for one minute later.

1185
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,440
And then tape them both to the ceiling.

1186
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,320
And then put them in your roommate's room.

1187
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,240
I still say, Neil, guess what?

1188
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,760
You're gonna die.

1189
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,760
Hey, Neil?

1190
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,760
You're gonna die.

1191
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:51,960
It might be today, it might be tomorrow, it might, no, it's probably today or tomorrow.

1192
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,240
It's definitely this weekend.

1193
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,400
I'd get out there.

1194
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,160
Every second counts.

1195
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,960
One hundred twenty seven hours.

1196
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,080
Every second counts.

1197
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:04,000
Shatner says start living like you're gonna die because you're gonna.

1198
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
So think about it.

1199
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
That's what Shatner says.

1200
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,520
That's from Bill Shatner, founder of the Black Eyed Peas.

1201
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,760
I got a feeling that tonight you're gonna be dead.

1202
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,880
Yeah, I got a feeling you're dying tonight.

1203
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:21,840
Griffin, Yahoo Answers, I need a taste, I need a sliver, I need a slice, I need a chunk.

1204
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,400
Okay, I actually, I have something.

1205
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,880
It's not a Yahoo Answer.

1206
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:30,160
I'm flipping this, I'm flipping the script right on its ear.

1207
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:36,320
I mean, we're on the topic of death, which is serious and, and, and, you know, it's hard

1208
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,320
to deal with.

1209
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,320
But sexy.

1210
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,320
Serious but sexy.

1211
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,600
Kind of sexy, but it's, it's hard to wrap the old noodle around.

1212
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,240
Oh yeah.

1213
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:50,760
So this, this topic, I guess is the best thing to call it, was sent in by Uber Anthony.

1214
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,960
Thanks Uber Anthony.

1215
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:59,560
It's an eHow article, which I'm sure you all know is the world's leading source of, of

1216
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,560
information.

1217
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:09,160
It's, it's by eHow contributor Nancy Hendrickson, who has pinned an article, a helpful article

1218
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,440
titled How to Talk to Dead People in Dreams.

1219
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,440
Uh-huh.

1220
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,440
Okay.

1221
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:21,320
The difficulty of this article is moderately challenging, which is if you're looking for

1222
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:27,080
an easier nighttime activity, maybe go find something else, uh, because this is moderately

1223
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,800
challenging.

1224
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:34,400
This is not like a relaxing way, uh, to your stroll through the park talking to dead people.

1225
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,200
This is like really getting in there and getting it.

1226
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,580
Thanks to the popularity of psychics such as John Edwards and Lisa Williams, more and more

1227
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,120
people are interested in communicating with the dead.

1228
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:48,600
You can spend years in training to become as accomplished as professionals, or you can

1229
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:53,800
use your own dreams as a way of communicating with loved ones who are no longer on the earth

1230
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,800
plane.

1231
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,800
Hmm.

1232
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,320
The earth plane, got it.

1233
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:02,360
Prepare your sleep space to begin your quest to communicate with the dead via dreams.

1234
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,960
Your bedroom shouldn't be dark and without the possibility of interruption.

1235
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,520
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1236
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,920
You mean before I go to sleep, it should be dark and shouldn't be interrupted?

1237
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,920
Yeah.

1238
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,920
Go on.

1239
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,920
I'm listening.

1240
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,920
Hey, Tommy, what you doing?

1241
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,920
Hey.

1242
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,920
Shhh.

1243
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,080
Fuck, I'm trying to talk to my peepums.

1244
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,080
Please leave me.

1245
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,440
Let me pee.

1246
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,080
Play relaxing meditation music if it helps you, uh, relax quickly into a dream state.

1247
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,920
If you choose to play music, be certain that the music has no dramatic spikes in sound

1248
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,960
or intensity, as these may wake you up.

1249
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,960
We suggest black-eyed peas.

1250
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,760
Play black-eyed peas backwards and you'll fall right asleep.

1251
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:45,240
See, I used to listen to the soundtrack to Carl Sagan's Cosmos, uh, but I can't do it

1252
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,520
anymore because once it gets to Mars, it's like, oh shit, like I'm up now.

1253
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,520
Oh, got them up.

1254
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,520
I'm up.

1255
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,800
I was talking to peepums about the great war.

1256
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,960
Place a dream journal pin and nightlight next to your bed.

1257
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,360
Date the journal entry and create a list of questions or topics you hope to discuss in

1258
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,480
your dream.

1259
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,800
The purpose of this exercise is simply to set your intent, the intent being clear communication

1260
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,760
with a specific person who has passed from the living to the world of spirit.

1261
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,240
Oh, God.

1262
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,360
Is spirit an acronym for something?

1263
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:19,560
The way you said it made it sound like it's like S dot P dot I dot R dot I dot.

1264
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:26,720
Super pathetic internal REM cycle inside Timothy.

1265
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,720
Timothy!

1266
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,720
It's inside Timothy.

1267
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,000
You have to be inside Timothy for this exercise.

1268
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I'm a member of spirit.

1269
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:43,040
Maybe you are the world's most prolific crime fighting team slash dead people talker tours.

1270
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,200
This is my boss, your peepums.

1271
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,600
This part, oh my fuck, you guys, this step is so important.

1272
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,740
Say a simple prayer of protection before drifting off to sleep and ask the person with whom

1273
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,160
you wish to communicate to appear in your dreams.

1274
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,120
Be open to receiving communications in varying ways.

1275
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:02,600
For example, your dream may be filled with a conversation with a dead person or the dream

1276
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,800
may be filled with images, colors, or symbols.

1277
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,720
I had this dream where I ate a giant sandwich.

1278
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,960
What do you think Hitler was trying to tell me?

1279
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,400
It was very colorful, the sandwich, and symbolic in a way.

1280
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,000
As an example, the dead person may say to you, I can't get through to your mother.

1281
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,880
She isn't picking up the phone.

1282
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,880
Let me try that again.

1283
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,340
Could you try her for me?

1284
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,600
Maybe send her a text.

1285
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,600
Let me try again.

1286
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:34,920
As an example, the dead person may say to you, I can't get through to your mother.

1287
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:40,040
She isn't picking up the phone.

1288
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:45,360
Obviously there is no spirit phone, you dumb fuck.

1289
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,360
You dumb shit.

1290
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,360
Hey, dummy.

1291
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,360
How far do you think this extends?

1292
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,440
But it's the dead person's way of saying that they're coming to you because the other person

1293
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,520
isn't open to communicating with the dead.

1294
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:58,760
And rather than say that, they brought up the complicated idea of a phone.

1295
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,760
Travis, listen.

1296
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,500
There's imagery, there's colors, and there's symbols.

1297
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,280
The spirit phone is a symbol.

1298
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,680
Your mom-moms don't talk to ghosts.

1299
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,200
Tell your mom to stop being such a prudish bitch.

1300
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,600
I'm trying to get your noodle.

1301
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:17,160
If I have a dream in which I'm in Pee-wee's Playhouse and all of the talking furniture

1302
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,640
sounds like Charles Nelson Riley, what's going on?

1303
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,360
Ghost of Charles Nelson Riley.

1304
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,360
Is he still alive?

1305
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,360
He's in Paul Reuben's house.

1306
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,920
He's buried underneath Paul Reuben's house.

1307
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,000
Paul Reuben killed Charles Nelson Riley.

1308
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Everybody knows that.

1309
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Buried him in the cellar.

1310
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Yeah.

1311
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,720
And now he makes the corpses of Charles Nelson Riley watch him eat dinner.

1312
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,440
It's a really weird arrangement they have.

1313
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,440
Mystery solved.

1314
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,440
Mystery solved.

1315
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,640
It would have gotten away if it weren't for us meddling kids.

1316
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,640
Guys, listen.

1317
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,280
I don't think Paul Reuben's killed Charles Nelson Riley.

1318
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,280
He probably didn't.

1319
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,280
Not yet.

1320
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,280
Not yet.

1321
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,280
Is that liable?

1322
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,280
No.

1323
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,280
I just said he didn't.

1324
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,280
It's cool.

1325
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,280
Yeah.

1326
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,040
It's only if you express doubt in your assertion is it not liable.

1327
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:07,960
So I'm going to say with 100% certainty that Paul Reuben's killed Charles Nelson Riley.

1328
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,960
That's definitely true.

1329
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:09,960
I believe it.

1330
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,960
And I have facts to back it up.

1331
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,960
Listen.

1332
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,760
Give yourself the opportunity to develop this new communication vehicle.

1333
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,500
As they say, Rome wasn't built in a day.

1334
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:22,260
Like all new things, communicating with the dead in dreams takes practice.

1335
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,260
You don't believe it?

1336
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,260
Ask Julius Caesar.

1337
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,680
How do you get to Carnegie Hall?

1338
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,680
Dead people.

1339
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,680
Practice.

1340
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,680
Practice.

1341
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,680
Talk to dead Mozart.

1342
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,680
He'll give you tips.

1343
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,680
He'll give you pro tips.

1344
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,840
I'm going to try this tonight.

1345
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:40,440
I don't know about you guys, but I'm ready to start developing this communication vehicle.

1346
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:47,080
If you, I'm already doing it every night, but it is yet to work out for me.

1347
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,560
Who are you chatting up in the dream space?

1348
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,760
Oh, Rock Hudson.

1349
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,760
Really?

1350
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,760
Yeah.

1351
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,880
I asked him if he had any other secrets.

1352
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,880
You know what I mean?

1353
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,880
Mm-hmm.

1354
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,880
Yeah.

1355
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,200
You know who I talked to is Betty White.

1356
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,720
Now, stay with me.

1357
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,320
She's actually been a hologram for the past couple years.

1358
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,320
Holy shit!

1359
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,320
Yeah, I know.

1360
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,320
That was good.

1361
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,000
Because human beings can't be that sexy.

1362
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,040
Here's a fact.

1363
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,360
This is a stone fact.

1364
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:23,600
If you search for eHow Moderately Challenging to try to find other tasks that are of the

1365
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,600
same difficulty level, here are the top three.

1366
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:33,680
How to become a journalist, how to become a screenplay consultant, and how to overcome

1367
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,480
an octopus phobia.

1368
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,600
Those are the top three.

1369
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,280
But aren't those three things basically the same?

1370
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:48,680
I ran a screenplay about the news story about how I overcame my fear of octopi.

1371
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,640
Guys, listen.

1372
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,020
I'm a journalist.

1373
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,080
That's my job.

1374
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,180
I can talk to dead people in dreams.

1375
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:59,120
And I know a shit ton about screenplays and their submission.

1376
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,960
I am scared fuckless of cephalopods.

1377
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,360
Get him out of here!

1378
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,360
Can't overcome it.

1379
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,360
You'd think.

1380
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:11,600
You'd think my skill level of Moderately Challenging would enable me to overcome that.

1381
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:17,960
I can't even play with Nerf guns because those suction tips remind me of the cold, slimy

1382
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,840
feelers of a cephalopod that just wants to drag me down to the briny deep.

1383
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,840
Man, I...

1384
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,840
Oh, eHowl.

1385
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,680
Maybe, maybe that's a new vein for us to tap.

1386
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,680
I don't know.

1387
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,680
Maybe.

1388
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,520
Well, everybody, keep your eyes out on that.

1389
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,480
I have a problem when it comes to girls.

1390
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,120
Seems I lose interest after I get a girl to like me.

1391
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:41,520
It's almost as if I'm addicted to the thrill of the chase.

1392
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,720
This really sucks because I've missed out on being with some really nice girls.

1393
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,720
Any advice?

1394
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,400
Storm spring.

1395
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,400
You're gay.

1396
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,400
No way.

1397
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,400
Hold on.

1398
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,400
Now, wait.

1399
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,400
What if he's gay?

1400
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,520
What if he dislikes winning girls over and then he realizes like, I'm not that into it

1401
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,560
because I'm a little...

1402
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,560
I'm kind of gay.

1403
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,560
Maybe.

1404
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,560
Is that possible?

1405
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,560
I think it's...

1406
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,240
I mean, anything's possible in this big blue world.

1407
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,800
I'm fucking storyboarding this one, Griffin.

1408
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,560
I'm just asking if it's possible.

1409
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:13,000
I think you're waterboarding this one.

1410
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,560
I've known guys like you, Chase.

1411
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,560
Is that his name?

1412
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,560
Yeah.

1413
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,560
And that is now.

1414
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,560
Yeah.

1415
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,560
Chase is actually what he was doing.

1416
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,480
He had the thrill of...

1417
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,840
But if we can just call him Chase.

1418
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,840
Okay.

1419
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,080
No, and then he could refer to himself as the thrill of the chase.

1420
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:35,520
Lady, are you really ready to experience the thrill of the chase for the next three

1421
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,280
to four days of your life?

1422
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,800
We have to have at least one listener named Chase.

1423
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:44,400
And if that's your name, congratulations, we just gave you the best pickup line ever.

1424
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,400
Yeah.

1425
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,960
I would say that anyone who...

1426
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:51,960
The way you describe this whole situation, granted it's three short sentences, but you

1427
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,080
say you missed out on being with some really nice girls and you're just interested in the

1428
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,080
thrill of the chase.

1429
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,600
It doesn't sound like you're really interested in these girls.

1430
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,000
You're interested in their interest in you.

1431
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,080
So maybe you need to slow your roll and be a little bit more choosy about the women that

1432
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,520
you pursue and not just go for...

1433
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,520
Yeah.

1434
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:18,200
I think that maybe you need to take a break from that whole situation.

1435
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,240
Maybe you need to take a break from...

1436
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,240
Chase listen.

1437
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,680
Chase listen.

1438
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,320
Come kick it with me in my lady siesta.

1439
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:33,040
Now there's definitely a point at which that sort of falls off.

1440
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,960
You think like, okay, I'm not going to do that anymore.

1441
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,960
Yeah, sure.

1442
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:43,800
I guess that turns into like a lady coma, a lady shipwrecked, a marooned on an island

1443
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:49,080
by herself with no survival skills and no hatchet with which to fashion...

1444
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:53,280
Man, you guys remember that book Hatchet?

1445
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,080
I feel like you're changing the subject, but yes.

1446
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:01,280
Have you guys ever read Hatchet by, what's his name, Paul Rubens?

1447
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,280
Rubens.

1448
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:12,840
Hatchet, the story of how I chopped up Charles Nelson Riley, an erotic adventure, a Goosebumps

1449
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,840
classic.

1450
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:18,920
He actually used a credit card survival tool to chop up Paul Rubens.

1451
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,920
Gary Paulson was his name.

1452
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,920
But you know what?

1453
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,120
He's a donor, so he's still going to heaven.

1454
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,680
So basically Paul Rubens killed Charles Nelson.

1455
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,400
Is that the supposition we're working under?

1456
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,400
Yep.

1457
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,400
It's not a supposition.

1458
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,480
It's a 100% stone cold fact.

1459
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,080
Oh, because the libel worry.

1460
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,080
I gotcha.

1461
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:41,200
Listen, we've had a lot of fun here today.

1462
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,680
You always start with that.

1463
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,680
What?

1464
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,720
I mean, people know how much fun they're having.

1465
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,680
I find I don't really enjoy things unless people tell me that I'm enjoying them.

1466
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,340
You're having a great time right now.

1467
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,720
That's how I learned how to eat kale.

1468
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,840
People just told me like, this is delicious, and eventually I bought it because I'm a sucker

1469
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,840
that way.

1470
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:01,000
Hey, and if you're a sucker, why not give us some of your money?

1471
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:08,240
We've talked to you about the amazing $35 donation level for Maximum Fund.

1472
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:14,040
You're helping all these great shows, and you're helping us out.

1473
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:22,980
We haven't really hit home yet, and it's what I really want to hit home this break, is that

1474
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:27,200
we need you guys for us to look good.

1475
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:35,680
We need you to donate and tell them that you're a Maximum Fund, you're an NBNB AM listener

1476
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:39,200
because we want to bring you guys into the fold.

1477
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:47,840
We want our new overlords, our new family to think that we're a valuable contributing

1478
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,000
member of the team, so we need you.

1479
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Listen.

1480
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
We're relying on you.

1481
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,180
This is our first year on Maximum Fund.

1482
01:00:55,180 --> 01:01:01,320
It's also Judge John Hodgman's first year on Maximum Fund, and he's like wicked famous.

1483
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,920
He was on Battlestar Galactica.

1484
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,640
I don't know if you guys know that.

1485
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,200
He was kind of on Battlestar Galactica, and you know.

1486
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,200
I wasn't.

1487
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,440
I don't know if you guys were.

1488
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,520
I have seen Battlestar Galactica.

1489
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,320
I was, but they cut the scene.

1490
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,040
That's this fucking industry, man.

1491
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,040
I know.

1492
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,920
Anyway, it's both our first years.

1493
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,080
The pressure's kind of high for both of us.

1494
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,200
We need to crush him.

1495
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,480
We want to take him apart.

1496
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,600
He was super nice and gave us a question.

1497
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,600
A real sweetheart.

1498
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:33,840
He was a real sweetheart and gave us a question for our Donors Only episode, but we want to

1499
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,840
destroy him.

1500
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,840
We want to destroy him.

1501
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,400
Yeah, we want to disembowel him.

1502
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,840
We want to make him tear up.

1503
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:45,800
Now if you want to make it count, if you want to go deep, you want to say, like, I want

1504
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,600
to crush John Hodgman in an authoritative way.

1505
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:52,200
Not like in the wimpy way that some of these other people.

1506
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,600
You can get hectic on it.

1507
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,360
We have three other donation levels for $50 a month.

1508
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:00,040
You're going to be part of the Thorn family Blondie Brigade.

1509
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:07,800
You OK, Jesse and Theresa Thorn, sweethearts, future parents will bake you a homemade batch

1510
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:12,600
of their signature blondies and FedEx them to your door.

1511
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,920
What can you imagine how delicious that tastes?

1512
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,900
You know, it tastes like generosity.

1513
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,920
Maybe throw him in the microwave first to get him soft and moist again.

1514
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:26,520
Or are these I've heard story I've heard tell of the Thorns cooking prowess.

1515
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:33,880
Do you think they've discovered some sort of ever gooey, some sort of ever gooey, you

1516
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,000
know, formula?

1517
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:41,840
They probably just don't call them ever gooey blondies because it's the worst, the grossest

1518
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,840
thing you could say.

1519
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:48,880
But you're also going to get the nerd emergency kit, which is amazing, as we've already covered.

1520
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,480
You're going to get a USB drive with all our shows.

1521
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:57,080
You're going to get the Eton self-powered AM FM weather radio.

1522
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,080
That's probably that nerd emergency kit.

1523
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,240
You're going to get roll models by John Waters.

1524
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:05,880
You're going to get an eco bags tote bag with my brother, my brother and me.

1525
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,740
Really cool art emblazoned on it.

1526
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:10,440
It's probably at Maximumfun.org right now if you want to go look at it and we'll tweet

1527
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,560
it and stuff like that.

1528
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,120
But it's a great Justin Rousseau design.

1529
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,220
He really outdid himself.

1530
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:19,200
It's also worth mentioning that these blondies, they have a half-life of 65 years.

1531
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,360
So they're going to, they're going to go with you into the apocalypse with the nerd emergency

1532
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:26,560
kit and they'll, they're rich in nutrients and flavors.

1533
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:33,700
So they'll sustain you for, if you're rich in nutrients and also money, you can be one

1534
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:36,140
of Jesse's golden eagles for a hundred dollars a month.

1535
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:39,880
That will net you all the things we've talked about before, plus homemade blondie delivery,

1536
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:44,720
an emergency kit, Max Fun Drive tote bag, Max Fun Pack with the stickers, exclusive

1537
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:49,940
access to all these episodes and an invitation to the Max Fun Dinner, which is a special

1538
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:55,960
dinner the night before Max Fun Con with staff performers and friends of Max Fun Con.

1539
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:01,640
If you can't make it, Jesse will personally take you to lunch when you're in LA.

1540
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,880
So go to LA, Jesse will take you to lunch.

1541
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,880
It'll be a lot of fun.

1542
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,980
For $200 a month, that's the biggie.

1543
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,320
That's the big guy.

1544
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,280
Jordan's platinum angels.

1545
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,760
Pre-registration at the next Max Fun Con.

1546
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:18,360
Come to the dinner, going to get the blondies, new emergency kit, USB drive tote bag, Max

1547
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,760
Fun Pack exclusive X episode to all the podcasts.

1548
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,960
I know that not everybody is going to be able to give $200 a month.

1549
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,840
Like I wish I had $200 a month to donate.

1550
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:28,840
I don't.

1551
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:34,840
But if you have been with us over this past year, you've enjoyed the show and you're looking

1552
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:40,560
for a way to support us in what we're doing and support some of the great Max Fun shows.

1553
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:46,920
I think if you can't do, you know, you can't maybe do $200, maybe you can do $50.

1554
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:50,920
Maybe you can do $35 and get that amazing nerd emergency kit.

1555
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,080
$20 a month.

1556
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,000
You know, the diamond friendship circle.

1557
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,720
Just think about what the kind of entertainment you're getting from our show and the other

1558
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:01,000
shows and what it's been worth to you.

1559
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Justin, may I say something?

1560
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
No.

1561
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Okay.

1562
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
People.

1563
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Oh shit.

1564
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,280
Shit's about to get real.

1565
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,280
This is going to be real.

1566
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,480
I can't lie.

1567
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,480
I love you.

1568
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,480
Oh man.

1569
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,480
Yeah.

1570
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,480
There it is.

1571
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,480
I said it.

1572
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,480
I love you.

1573
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,480
Are you in love with them?

1574
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,480
I may be.

1575
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,480
I may be.

1576
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,480
They're pretty wonderful people.

1577
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,760
And as I look out upon you people, imaginarily in front of me, I see some beautiful faces

1578
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,760
out there.

1579
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,520
Some average faces, but no ugly faces, so good work.

1580
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:40,240
And I would like to look each one of you in the eye in my imagination and say, the bills

1581
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,800
come due.

1582
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:48,200
Some of this money goes to pay the staff of Maximum Fund, which does include your friends

1583
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,080
at My Brother and Me.

1584
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:59,680
Last night, I put on a suit and I went and ate a steak and I brought a flask of whiskey

1585
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,920
and poured out half of my Diet Coke and filled the rest up with whiskey.

1586
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,400
This sounds like a classy evening.

1587
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,400
What could possibly-

1588
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,560
And went and saw Drive Angry 3D.

1589
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,080
That's what I do with my money.

1590
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,360
You don't want to support that?

1591
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,360
Fuck you.

1592
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,880
Justin, I think you meant to say Drive Angry shot in 3D.

1593
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:19,680
Drive Angry, shot in 3D.

1594
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,600
That's what we're doing.

1595
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,080
And I need your cash to do that.

1596
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,800
Nicolas Cage doesn't pay himself.

1597
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,360
This is an ecosystem you're supporting here.

1598
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,360
It's not just me.

1599
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,000
It's not just about us.

1600
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
It's about the family.

1601
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,320
Do you know how much it costs to maintain my collection of baby ducks?

1602
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,320
Why would you-

1603
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,320
Jesus Christ.

1604
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,160
He has to kill them, first of all, when they turn one.

1605
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,160
Well, yeah.

1606
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,160
Thanks.

1607
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,160
That's what I'm saying.

1608
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:48,240
And then to replenish, like it's a constant stream of baby ducks and baby duck corpses

1609
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,080
out one door.

1610
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,080
It's terrible.

1611
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,600
I'm going to tell you the most exciting part.

1612
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:59,240
If you flash your Maximum Fun membership card at any of us, that comes in the Maximum Fun

1613
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:05,840
pack that is at any donation level, you are owed a hug from any of the three of us, all

1614
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,000
three of us, however you want to break it down.

1615
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
We'll give you a hug.

1616
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,880
If we're all three there, yeah, we can do like a triangle hug if all three of us are

1617
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:13,880
present.

1618
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:14,880
Yeah.

1619
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:15,880
There's no touching.

1620
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:16,880
We just, we cover you in our energies.

1621
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:17,880
Yeah.

1622
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:18,880
Just get our energy.

1623
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,760
Get our chakras up in you.

1624
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,880
But if you flash your card, we will give you a hug.

1625
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:24,880
The best fucking hug I've ever received.

1626
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:30,880
Also, you earn the rights, like the massive, massive Twitter bragging rights.

1627
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,680
You get to go on Twitter and lord it over every other My Brother, My Brother and Me

1628
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:37,480
fan that you have donated and they have not.

1629
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,480
Make sure you do.

1630
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:43,240
Make sure you flaunt it because we want to know who the real heroes are, the real special

1631
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,240
people.

1632
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:49,760
And I'm sure we'll be retweeting those as people donate and helping to spread the word

1633
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,920
there.

1634
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,040
And if you know a buddy has it donated, get on them.

1635
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,040
Say hey jerk.

1636
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,040
Hey dummy.

1637
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,040
Jerk wad.

1638
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,040
Hey stupid.

1639
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,040
Hey Chunk Pump.

1640
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,040
Hey Chunk Pump.

1641
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,080
How about putting up some dough?

1642
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,880
Just go to MaximumFun.org right now.

1643
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:03,880
Don't wait.

1644
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,880
Slash donate.

1645
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,280
Slash donate.

1646
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,280
And pledge.

1647
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,280
Pledge what you can.

1648
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,000
And you have no idea how much we appreciate it.

1649
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,120
It really means a lot to us.

1650
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:17,240
And you're going to get some really cool, some really cool gifts.

1651
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:23,280
I actually asked Jesse if it's okay if I, or if it's weird if I donate because I want

1652
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:27,840
the, I want the Postalumdian Justice Squad kit.

1653
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,400
And I want to try his blondies.

1654
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,400
What's so weird about that?

1655
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,400
There's nothing weird about it.

1656
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,400
I mean when I said it just now.

1657
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:38,840
I want a membership card so that I can finally get a hug from my brothers.

1658
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,660
One more thing.

1659
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:45,640
One of the coolest parts about us joining Maximum Fun, or for me, one of the coolest

1660
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:51,760
things that happened was when we joined up and a lot of people in the Maximum Fun community

1661
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:57,000
said this is so awesome because I already listened to this show before I joined the

1662
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Maximum Fun.

1663
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,400
And this is just kind of a reaffirmation that Maximum Fun knows what I like.

1664
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,500
Knows how I do.

1665
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:09,280
And to those people and the people who are already Maximum Fun donors, like thank you

1666
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,820
a fuck ton.

1667
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:13,640
Thank you so very, very much.

1668
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,960
Maybe you want to bump it up this year.

1669
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:19,720
I've seen a few people on the forums talking about kicking it up to Notches Unknown.

1670
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,000
Well I guess the Notches are pretty well established.

1671
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:28,280
But if you want to do that, that would be absolutely incredible because our family is

1672
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,280
getting bigger.

1673
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,280
You know?

1674
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,280
We've got more responsibilities.

1675
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,280
Both figuratively.

1676
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,280
Yeah.

1677
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,280
All you've got to do.

1678
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,280
We can wait.

1679
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:40,440
We won't be funny for the next 30 seconds as you go to Maximum Fun dot org.

1680
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,440
That's the site.

1681
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,200
Maximum Fun dot org.

1682
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,520
You click, you see a button there that says donate.

1683
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,040
Or you can just skip it.

1684
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,040
Skip the rigamarole.

1685
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,680
Go to Maximum Fun dot org forward slash donate.

1686
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:55,000
And make sure you tell them we sent you.

1687
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,640
And seriously, it means so much to us.

1688
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:05,720
Also if you have an old donation in the PayPal system, go to that page too so you can get

1689
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:10,340
a new, you know, get on this new system and email Teresa at Maximum Fun dot org and she

1690
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,840
can get rid of your old subscription.

1691
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:17,040
And email PayPal a picture of you just farting.

1692
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,040
Like farting out of your butthole.

1693
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,600
And say this is you.

1694
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,600
Yeah.

1695
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,480
Have an arrow pointing to your fart and have it say this is you PayPal.

1696
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:26,640
Because PayPal is a fart.

1697
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:31,560
You're really turning this from like a pledge show into like an anti-Paypal show, I feel

1698
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,560
like.

1699
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,560
PayPal banned my account.

1700
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,560
And that's true.

1701
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,880
PayPal once banned my account because I bought some Pokemon cards.

1702
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:37,880
Oh good.

1703
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:38,880
Oh no, no.

1704
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:39,880
I'm sorry.

1705
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:44,000
I sold some Pokemon cards and I didn't pay like the eBay fee or whatever.

1706
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Because that's some bullshit.

1707
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,640
I'm not going to pay eBay to sell my shit.

1708
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,920
And they shut my account right down.

1709
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:54,160
There's a hologram Blastoise in there.

1710
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,160
I'm just letting you go.

1711
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,160
I'm going to go get it first.

1712
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,160
I had a holofoil Blastoise.

1713
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,160
Yeah.

1714
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,160
A holofoil Blastoise.

1715
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,160
Listen.

1716
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,680
All my Pokemon cards are gone.

1717
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,680
I need a new source of income.

1718
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,500
Please donate.

1719
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,500
Please donate.

1720
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,200
Guys, I live in New England with my super hot wife.

1721
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,560
I was just offered a great job in Southern California.

1722
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,560
So Cal.

1723
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,000
He doesn't say that.

1724
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I said that.

1725
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,960
But my wife needs to stay here in New England to finish two more years of law school.

1726
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:23,680
We think we're going to do the long distance thing until she can join me out West.

1727
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:27,400
We'll have the means to fly back and forth for school between breaks and vacays.

1728
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,660
So it doesn't seem like it'll be that bad.

1729
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,200
Even so, most people tell us we're making a mistake.

1730
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,200
We're in our late twenties.

1731
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,760
We've been married for about eight months.

1732
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,760
Is this a very terrible idea?

1733
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:46,480
Is it fucked up that, like, in my mind, there's no such thing as a long distance married relationship?

1734
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,480
That seems like it's just-

1735
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,480
Well, you're just married.

1736
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,480
Yeah.

1737
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:50,480
You're just, like, married.

1738
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,480
Yeah.

1739
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,480
Yeah.

1740
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,480
I think that this is totally doable.

1741
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,480
I mean, it's totally workable.

1742
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,480
Is it a mistake?

1743
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,480
Like, I don't know.

1744
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,880
I mean, it will probably be a stress on your relationship.

1745
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,880
Yeah.

1746
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:01,880
It's going to suck.

1747
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:02,880
It's going to suck.

1748
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:03,880
Yeah.

1749
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:06,000
But it doesn't sound like it's really, like, a choice.

1750
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,040
He's in law school and you got offered a job.

1751
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,920
It's not like one of you is like, I'm going to go check out what it's like on the other

1752
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:11,920
coast.

1753
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:16,280
Like, you're in a situation in life that dictates that you may need to be apart for a little

1754
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,280
while.

1755
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,800
You're eventually going to be back together, so it's not, like, a permanent sucky thing.

1756
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,880
You just got to put up with it for a year or two.

1757
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,960
There is a problem.

1758
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,000
Have you seen the ladies in Southern California?

1759
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:33,780
Have you seen those so Cal honeys, those so Cal shawties?

1760
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,880
They all look like Katy Perry.

1761
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,480
They all, all of them look like Katy Perry.

1762
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,880
It's like an invasion of the body snatchers thing going on down there.

1763
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:42,880
Yeah.

1764
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,880
It's weird.

1765
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:47,440
It's, I mean, I've only, I've never, have I been to Southern California?

1766
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,120
That's like, that's like LA, right?

1767
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,120
Is that Southern California?

1768
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:51,120
Does that count?

1769
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,120
Fundamentally?

1770
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,120
Yeah.

1771
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,120
It's so, just so many shawties.

1772
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,120
I don't know.

1773
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,120
I've watched a lot of OC.

1774
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,120
A lot of bangin' beauties.

1775
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,120
Too much OC.

1776
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,120
A lot of Billsons.

1777
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,120
Too much OC, some people would say.

1778
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,120
Some would say.

1779
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,040
I think Tim has a rock solid will.

1780
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,440
I think he's going to be all right.

1781
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,720
Can I, can I tell you guys the truth?

1782
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:09,400
Can I disagree with you guys?

1783
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,680
I'm going to disagree with you guys.

1784
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:15,000
And this is me stepping away from Justin, giving you advice for what's best for your

1785
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
life.

1786
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,960
And this is just my honest, like from the heart, this is, this is the case.

1787
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:26,160
I don't, I don't think you should move away from your wife for two years.

1788
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:32,640
I mean, I understand your career and I understand that, I understand that that's important.

1789
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:38,560
And maybe this is like a once in a lifetime opportunity.

1790
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:43,920
And you're, and you're going to, and it's totally worth this, but you've been married

1791
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:50,800
for eight months and the, these first couple of years are some of the best, like in terms

1792
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:58,520
of learning about each other and kind of forging your relationship and growing as a couple.

1793
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,040
And you're going to, you're going to miss out on those.

1794
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:05,400
I mean, you're going to, you're, you're going to miss out on some stuff.

1795
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:08,960
And maybe this job is like so worth it and it's, and you know, you need to do it.

1796
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:14,480
It's like going to, you know, America from the old country to try to build a life for

1797
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,480
your family.

1798
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:19,480
If there's that sort of situation and this is a question of necessity, I get it.

1799
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:24,560
But if you're on the run from religious persecution, yeah, exactly.

1800
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,560
Then yeah, sure.

1801
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:26,560
I get it.

1802
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,800
It sounds like you're saying the answer to this question is it's time to do a lot of

1803
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,800
soul searching.

1804
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,400
I know you, I really think, and I'm not saying like, so you guys should break up like that

1805
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:38,280
cause you're married and that's not really an option, but I mean, really think about

1806
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:41,720
why you're not in my religion.

1807
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:47,500
I really think about why you're doing it because you love this girl and you guys just got married

1808
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,800
and you are, and I'm not saying it's going to jeopardize your relationship.

1809
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:55,040
I'm just saying you're going to miss out a lot on a lot.

1810
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,080
And I know with technology and stuff, it can be very tempting to say, well, well, you know,

1811
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,360
we'll Skype every night and I'll just tweet out and that's probably true.

1812
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:05,600
I'll just get at her on form spring, ask her anonymous questions about what she did that

1813
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,600
day.

1814
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,920
But I, I don't know, really think about it, Tim.

1815
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:13,440
I think it'll be, I think you'll, you'll make it, but I, you love this girl and you just

1816
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:17,800
got married, you're newlyweds and that's a great period and I hate for you to miss out

1817
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:18,800
on it.

1818
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:19,800
That's just me.

1819
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:20,800
That's not advice, Justin.

1820
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,840
That's just from the heart, Justin.

1821
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,840
Yeah.

1822
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,680
If it's from the heart, Travis, I wouldn't do it either.

1823
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:30,920
But if you're dead set on doing it, advice, Travis says, do it, but it's going to suck.

1824
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:35,400
Your wife is, your wife is super hot.

1825
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,400
That's all I got.

1826
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,920
Just thought I'd comment on it.

1827
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:38,920
Your wife is super hot.

1828
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:43,400
That's got to, that's got to put some, put some, you know, English on the ball, right?

1829
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,400
Little English.

1830
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,880
Little English on that ball because your wife's super hot.

1831
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:49,080
So maybe don't leave her for two years because you're going to go to SoCal where all the

1832
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,560
honey bunnies are smoking, piping hot.

1833
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,200
Oop, don't touch that plate's hot.

1834
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:58,760
So shows your wife and she lives in New England and she's going to have all kinds of, Tom

1835
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:03,320
Brady's going to come up to her and try and throw a touchdown on your wife.

1836
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,320
Yeah.

1837
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,960
You know how guys in New England, he's going to throw a touchdown at your wife.

1838
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:11,760
Listen, you got to be careful because Tom Brady will scoop up your wife and you're going

1839
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:16,360
to scoop up, you know, all the Marissa's and Summers you can handle.

1840
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,740
Just be, just don't do it.

1841
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,840
You don't want, listen, you're going to, she's going to be in New England.

1842
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,380
We've really turned around.

1843
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:26,320
Some guy in overalls is going to come up to her and be like, oh, you want to go to the

1844
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,320
old butt in that tree?

1845
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,880
You want to go have a smooch?

1846
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:30,880
There's a Norissa blowing.

1847
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:31,880
There's a Norissa blowing.

1848
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,680
Come check out my orchard.

1849
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:41,200
Some founding father is going to sign some parliamentary actions on her, on that ass.

1850
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,960
Tim, just don't do it.

1851
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:43,960
Not worth it.

1852
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,880
Tim, Tim, we flipped.

1853
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:51,160
Someone's going to crack her Liberty Bell and that's in New England, right?

1854
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,160
Dog, where do you think New England is?

1855
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,040
You're making me so mad.

1856
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:59,480
You're referencing Philadelphia and I don't understand why.

1857
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,480
Is Philly not part of New England?

1858
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:02,480
No.

1859
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,480
No, dog, no.

1860
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,520
It always seems sort of ambiguous to me.

1861
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,520
Has it to you?

1862
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,520
It's like, ooh, that way.

1863
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:11,120
Once you get north up and there's trees and shit, you made it.

1864
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,720
Can I just say, Griffin, chances are that it seems ambiguous to you, but to the rest

1865
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,480
of the population it's probably pretty clear.

1866
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:17,480
Yeah.

1867
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,480
Probably.

1868
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,280
I'm almost certain there's a set amount of states that exist within New England.

1869
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:24,360
Now Tom Brady, he plays for the New England Patriots, right?

1870
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,360
Yes.

1871
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,360
Right.

1872
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,360
That one was good.

1873
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,360
That's why we were all kind of laughing and playing along.

1874
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,360
Listen.

1875
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,640
Does that make some sort of fucking sense?

1876
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:35,200
Listen, everyone who's listening, continue to listen.

1877
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,240
We need to buy Griffin-

1878
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,520
I got to go to some fucking night classes.

1879
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,280
I need to get my Rand McNally on.

1880
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,520
That's so bad.

1881
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:47,160
It's gotten really serious over here.

1882
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:51,800
You know, they say that ignorance isn't a problem unless it interferes with your podcasting,

1883
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,040
and this is seriously getting to be an issue.

1884
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,680
I made two jokes that didn't make a goddamn lick of sense.

1885
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:02,280
Griffin was like, and then go to see Rushmore.

1886
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,280
Where's the Alamo?

1887
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,280
I don't know.

1888
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,280
Please help me out.

1889
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,280
You guys want to hit up an Indian reservation?

1890
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,600
Tim and closing.

1891
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,600
Don't do it.

1892
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,600
That's me.

1893
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,600
That's where I'm at.

1894
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,600
Seriously.

1895
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,400
I was like, I think you guys will wreck your relationship.

1896
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,760
I just think you're going to miss a lot, and I don't think you should do it.

1897
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:24,120
But if you do do it, I'm sure it'll be fine, and you'll get through it.

1898
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,560
I hate for you to miss out.

1899
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:29,800
I hate for Tom Brady to scoop your snoot.

1900
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:33,280
I hate for your snoot to be scooped by Tom Brady, as they say.

1901
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:38,800
I'm going to get a t-shirt that says that my snoot dumbed scoop by Tom Brady, footballer,

1902
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,080
popular footballer Tom Brady.

1903
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,080
Known leatherhead.

1904
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:46,440
That's what they call footballers.

1905
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,440
That's good to see.

1906
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,440
Now you're back on.

1907
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,520
You're just 50 years in the past.

1908
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,520
Maybe 100.

1909
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,960
So do you want to move on to our last question?

1910
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:58,240
We want to wrap this production up.

1911
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:06,120
Before we do that, real quick, because you guys have been so indulgent to listen to our

1912
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:10,680
request for your help, our pleading, if you will.

1913
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:15,680
My brother, my brother, and me is the name of this podcast, nbmbam.com is our website.

1914
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:18,680
You can go there, and you'll find our email address there.

1915
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:22,520
It's nbmbam at maximumfund.org.

1916
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,000
You can also find us on FormSpring.

1917
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
It's formspring.com.

1918
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:32,120
Is it formspring.me, my brother, my brother, and me, or nbmbam, is that right?

1919
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,820
Formspring.me, nbmbam.

1920
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:40,640
We love to see on Twitter quotes, things like that, just encouraging people to listen.

1921
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:45,600
And you guys have helped us spread the show so much.

1922
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,920
And the only reason we're still doing this is because of the great reactions from you

1923
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:51,920
all.

1924
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:56,400
Speaking of Twitter, if you do donate, let us know on Twitter.

1925
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:02,640
Listen, I'm usually not down with those people who are like, I just gave 25 bucks to save

1926
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:03,640
the children.

1927
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,640
Like, fuck those guys.

1928
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,640
But this is way better than children.

1929
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,400
This is 100 times better than save the children.

1930
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:11,920
If you donate, let us know on Twitter, and we'll shout you back.

1931
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,360
We'll say, thanks.

Thanks for your love and support.

1933
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,220
Would you like a foot massage?

1934
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:18,520
Is that something that you'd be into?

1935
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,240
Would you like some ever gooey blondies?

1936
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:26,840
We will ever goo your blondies.

1937

01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:33,960

If not, why are you spending so much time listening to podcasts?
