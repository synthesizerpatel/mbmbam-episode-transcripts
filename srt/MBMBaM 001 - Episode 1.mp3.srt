1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Every second, real time, this is why it's a modern show, it's every, every, now

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If you want to reach us, you can always ask a question

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:25,000
On Twitter you can use the hashtag MBMBAM or you can email us, it's MBMBAM at gmail.com, that of course stands for my brother, my brother and me

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Our original title was deemed too long

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I actually have a list of some of the titles as we were spit balling

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We'll go ahead and say yours because I know what you're going to

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
My personal favorite, it wasn't mine, I'm pretty sure you came up with it

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It was absolutely mine

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Keenan and Kel and Justin and Travis and Griffin

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Which is a better name than my brother, my brother and me

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And can you imagine after our first 350 episodes when we finally had the draw to get the KKs up on the show

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The Keenan and Kel run off where people will want to listen for Keenan and Kel and then they're not there at first

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh right, right, yeah, and you don't want to lose that demographic of Keenan and Kel

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I also don't want to lose all of my orange soda because Kel would drink it right up

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You know who loves orange soda?

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I've heard that Kel enjoys the occasional orange soda

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Loves orange soda

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
From time to time

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Guys, I don't actually, you'll have to forgive me, does drinking orange soda have racial connotations that maybe fans of Keenan and Kel

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh no, I didn't even think about that

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Does it?

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Guys, guys, listen, listen, I'm not racist, Keenan and Kel, I'm sorry

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Kel totally loves orange soda, that is the frequent subject on that show

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah, this is a topic

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I get verified, he does, he does, he does

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You tube it, just tube it

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Side note, let's go ahead and derail this train of thought a little bit further

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Kel I think was in a movie that I saw at the Blockbuster Video called Who Made the Potato Salad

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes, it was

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That was the last, that was in 1998 when I saw that video cassette on the store shelf and that was the last time I ever saw Kel Mitchell

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He went into his novel writing career

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't actually think

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You know what's weird about that? By sheer serendipity, our first question this week on My Brother, My Brother and Me comes to us from the potato

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The underscore potato on Twitter

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He asks, I want a larger follower account but I'm finding it difficult to get more than two in a day, what can I do?

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Start a bunch of accounts and have them follow each other

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah, we're talking about a question of determination, right?

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You could open a business where you have a thousand accounts, right?

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't think there's any limitation to that, right?

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's not like Facebook, you can just, you know, shit and five Twitter accounts fall out

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You could have this network and you could say, I will give you a thousand followers in a day, you just pay me fifty bucks

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And then, you know, you're spending all day clicking the follow button but it's still fifty bucks

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You know what I'm willing to bet? Someone is doing that somewhere

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Tell me who they are and I'll shell out fifty bucks for a thousand

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The question is really one of quality, right?

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Like, if I see a funny tweet, usually I'm going to click on that name, I'm going to say, what are you offering?

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What's your story?

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Right

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You know, and I will look at them, I will read their words, I will open up their mind and see what's inside

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
If I'm climbing around in there and I like what I see, I like the territory, I'm going to state my claim

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Can I say, if you're getting two new followers a day, that ain't bad

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, that's pretty good, because pretty soon, exponentially, they're going to start re-tweeting the funny shit you say

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And then it's going to be three followers a day and then four followers a day and then, hold on, let me remember

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I got to pull out my Fibonacci sequence, but I think it's sixty-two

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah, sixty-two and then from there, you just start tweeting about products you're using, sponsored tweets

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And then boom

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Highway to the Danger Zone, you're rich

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And you're famous

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yep

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
That's how it works

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So?

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's how you get money

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's how you get beebed

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah, that's how Bieber did it

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Bieber started his career standing in the middle of malls, just singing at the top of his lungs

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Then two people came up and they're like, what are you doing? And he's like, exactly

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He wasn't even singing at first, he was just like, just ate a sandwich at Subway, it was real good

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But he had to say it in less than 140 letters

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Now he's on Saturday Night Live

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Now let's say, I don't know who Justin Bieber is, I know of his existence

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So talented

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I have no context

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Do you realize that that sort of like, that like, postmodern detachment from popular culture, that's not cool anymore

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Like, he was cool back in the early 2000s, but it's hot enough

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I know, I said he has a funny game

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No, no, no, no, he really is, like, this is me being completely unironic

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You guys remember how I got on that Twilight kick?

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But you guys knew that it wasn't, I was being ironic

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is me, my most sincere Justin Bieber, super talented

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Watch him on Saturday Night Live last night

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, he knew what was up

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He knew how to work or shit

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He was on Saturday Night Live, didn't he like, 8?

92
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What?

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He's like, 8

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He's 13

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He stayed up past his bedtime to rock us all

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
To sleep

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, to rock you to sleep, ironic

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Cause like, I heard by 12 he was getting super cranky

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He's like, I wanna go down

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Well, you know, I believe that answers your question, who is Justin Bieber?

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah, someone had to have asked her, right?

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Speaking of questions, this one comes from Yahoo

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The question is, what is the chord progression during the intro of the ABC series, Greek?

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What?

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Comes to us from Yahoo Answers user Rezuin

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Was it all in caps?

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Was it all in caps?

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He had to know right this second

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You know what, it's all actually, except he capitalized chord progression and intro, which, no

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But he did put Greek in single apostrophes

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What?

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah, I know, it kind of followed AP style

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So, Rezuin was

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
More importantly, what the fuck, man?

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's what you care about?

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What?

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What?

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Do you think that Rezuin is his Christian name?

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Or do you think that his manager, Arby's, is like, Rezuin, make all these tries

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I think

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Rezuin, why don't you have a girlfriend?

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
More puzzling than his moniker is why he's trying to play the chord progression during the intro of the ABC series, Greek

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Sorry, let me finish the question

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What is the chord progression, or is it from a song?

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm not talking about the Plain White T's song

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm talking about the short five second chord progression that plays during the intro to Greek in the current season

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Well, they're currently in season five

128
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So, not to be confused with the progression

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Don't get it twisted because the first four seasons opened up with Hey There Delilah by the Plain White T's

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Now it's just a generic sort of four chord, you'd know it if you heard it

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah, of course

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's just a square, bar, bar, beep, right? That one?

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You play it by ear

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I love that that's a concern, like that he watched the show and all he came away with was, what were those notes?

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What were those notes?

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll get that occasionally, like from a television show, like I'm sure that there have been, like a tailspin

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Sure

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll learn the intro to a tailspin on guitar and then I will go and I will make that dream a reality

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We're not talking about

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We're not talking about a timeless children's cartoon classic

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We're not talking about a song where you play it at a party and get the whole party rocking

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We're talking about five notes where someone's like, what is that? Was that a song?

143
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Oh, you know, the beginning of Greek, just kicking it off

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The beep, boop, bop, boop, beep song

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, you know, from Greek

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh, wait a minute

147
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Wait a minute

148
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Not a few would have not recognized that upon hearing it

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No one watches Greek, no one's ever seen it

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No, no, listen, I got it, I just got confused

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He said ABC series Greek

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's ABC family series

153
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Oh, right

154
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I have seen that show

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay, yeah, no, those five notes rule, they're epic, tears

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I have the whole collection, the whole Greek, they call it the frat house box set duplex edition

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It comes in a keg, which is nice

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It comes in two kegs because there's a lot of discs

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And as soon as you go to open it, it melts it down

160
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
As well it should be

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Great

162
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's a fine question and I don't have an answer for you

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Go play their music, go learn how to play

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
There's so many good songs

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Spambot wants to know

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
How do I get my incredibly talented artist friends to draw more?

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't think if your quote unquote incredibly talented artist friends

168
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If they don't draw that frequently

169
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Then they're either not incredibly talented or they're not artists at all

170
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Or they're not your friends

171
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Well, no, I wouldn't go that far

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Maybe they're doing all this secret drawing and they're just keeping it

173
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah, that's their real friends

174
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh shit, here comes Spambot, put the pencils down

175
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Put down the pencils

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't want her to see, because every time he's like

177
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's a 20 minute conversation

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He sees them working and it's oh I'm so glad to see you're doing that

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Keep it up, keep it up

180
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Whatever happened, you did two years at RISD and then you just bounced

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What happened to your life?

182
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Now you're doing sculpting, go back to drawing

183
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
My advice is this, most likely they know better than you know

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
How good they actually are

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Their advanced knowledge of the field

186
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, so you're looking at it going oh my god

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But they've just been sketching Marvin the Martian

188
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And you think it's funny and ironic but really they know it's Marvin the Martian

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Listen, I just drew this dog

190
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You're an upside down heart and he's a happy dog

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And you're like oh my god

192
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And you're crying and moved

193
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Let them not draw that anymore

194
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's probably a good idea

195
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Here's another one from the Yahoo Contingency

196
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This one's from Caitlin W

197
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
These are not our fans by the way

198
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Jump back real quick

199
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You actually want them to draw more and encourage them

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Are you really just going to

201
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No, no

202
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We're done with here

203
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Here we go

204
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Headline, I went on a first date with this guy

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I didn't know what to say to him

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So a guy I knew went on a date with me today

207
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I was really excited beforehand and I couldn't wait to see him

208
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I really like him a lot, no words can describe it

209
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So anyways, we went to a movie and then when it was over we walked around

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But I didn't have much to say

211
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Neither did him

212
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It felt sort of awkward

213
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I did want to say something, I just don't know what

214
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So I hope to god that there's going to be another date with him soon

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You know who I like? That quiet girl

216
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
She goes on to ask for topics

217
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What struck me was, yeah we had this super awkward date

218
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Didn't have anything to talk about

219
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Just three hours spent in the most horrifying silence imaginable

220
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So can't wait for date two

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Date two, bring him back

222
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
He said he'd take me to Coldstone

223
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
At least at Coldstone you have

224
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So what did you go with?

225
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Cake batter and graham crackers

226
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Are the gummy bears in there?

227
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's not a big deal

228
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Do you have a funny story about graham crackers?

229
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't either

230
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Can't wait to see you on date three

231
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What time is it? It's only 7.21, oh my god

232
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What time is your mom picking us up?

233
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You know the real awkward moment that had to be like

234
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Hey, what are you writing on your phone?

235
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I was just asking Yahoo

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The date was going, I thought it was going pretty good

237
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Oh my god I didn't read the answers

238
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
There were no answers

239
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I've already found my favorite

240
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
This one isn't my favorite

241
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm going to save the favorites

242
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Here's not my favorite

243
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Ooh, he probably thinks you're not interested in him now

244
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Text him now and say I really enjoyed our date with a smiley face

245
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
This is so important, the smiley face

246
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
One person says, Danny says well for my first dates I usually go on a double date

247
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Well that makes, you know, I've played that game before

248
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Here's my favorite

249
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
This one's from Jack Daniels

250
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
One of the few people on Yahoo questions with an avatar and it's him

251
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Ironically, if you're Jack Daniels you never have to worry about what to say next

252
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's just there

253
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's an avatar of him and he's wearing a backwards baseball hat

254
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He's got headphones on and he's winking

255
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Wait, this is Jack Daniels with like the old black

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Jack Daniels avatar

257
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's like one of those fucking zwinkey

258
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Cartoon yourself

259
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Here's the answer, are you ready?

260
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
No laughing, seriously

261
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
This was answered 23 minutes ago too, so this is hot off the oven

262
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Shh, shh, shh, shh

263
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I can't do this

264
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Shh, shh, shh

265
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Sometimes the quietest moments can say the most about yourself

266
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:59,720
I'm literally creating a Yahoo Answers profile right now so that I can give his comment a

267
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,440
thumbs up and make it the highest rated answer of all time.

268
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,800
I would like to picture him really super drunk when he wrote that too.

269
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,640
Hey Jack Daniels, can you take your headphones off and talk to me?

270
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,120
No, girl, no.

271
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,400
Listen, straight up.

272
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,800
The quietest moments, girl.

273
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,920
I just told this one bitch on Yahoo Answers, what's up?

274
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,480
I just told her the quietest answers, you know?

275
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,480
What's up?

276
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,320
To be fair, his answer is all lower case twos.

277
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,640
And you know what, he's right, because those quiet moments told her date, this is a terrible

278
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
date.

279
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,720
This is awful.

280
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,120
You did in effect communicate more than you probably could have.

281
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
Guess what?

282
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
I'm boring.

283
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,920
This is what it would be like forever if we got there.

284
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,920
Forever.

285
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,200
Can you imagine our children sitting in silence and staring at us and wondering why mom and

286
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
daddy don't talk?

287
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Think of it.

288
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,360
It's a world away, but it's really just a second date away.

289
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
Call me.

290
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
No, don't.

291
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,400
Text me and then I won't answer and it will be like I'm there.

292
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,760
Call me and I'll breathe into the phone for a while.

293
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:16,640
Suzanne, I believe it's I-L-E-S, but it could be two L's at the end.

294
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,560
She's actually from County Cork, according to her Twitter profile.

295
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,740
She wants to know how she can add oh, about 10 hours to her day.

296
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:33,960
Now this is of course impossible, but time management, what's the secret?

297
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:39,200
I really need advice on how to add oh, about 10 hours to my day.

298
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Could you help?

299
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,800
We can, of course.

300
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,440
We always have an answer.

301
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,760
The not sleeping thing is good, but not jokingly, like sleep less.

302
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,680
Go to sleep earlier, wake up earlier.

303
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,680
I don't agree.

304
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
I don't agree.

305
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
I don't agree with that.

306
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,160
I think your sleep time is so important.

307
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,800
It is important, but you don't have to do 13 hours of it.

308
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,760
You've got to take good care of yourself and then get, I don't know, seven?

309
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,800
Here's the way I look at it.

310
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,560
Go to sleep later, but wake up at the same time because that's so much for me is I wake

311
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:16,960
up earlier and I'm tired even if I got the same amount of sleep.

312
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:24,920
Do you know what another good one that I've been working on in that just don't try your

313
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:30,640
very best to not read anything.

314
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,840
Because every second you spend, not even a book, but on the internet, every second or

315
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:47,160
a road sign or instructions for medicine, those are minutes a day that you spend reading

316
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,360
that you could spend doing other things.

317
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,000
You can read a lot and if you cut that out of your regimen, oh, it's so much time.

318
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,120
You'll be amazed at how the day opens up to you.

319
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,240
In the news biz, we have something called the Inverted Pyramid where the most important

320
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,640
stuff is at the top.

321
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,480
So basically, just read the headline and if you're not getting the news, then they let

322
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,480
you down.

323
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,200
You have to read beyond that.

324
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,680
I should have been more specific.

325
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,480
Just don't read the news either.

326
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,120
There's not much of a reason to read it.

327
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,760
Once you read the news, it's already happened.

328
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,760
That's past.

329
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,760
That's done.

330
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,760
That's back.

331
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
You know what?

332
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,320
Another thing people do is they do things too many times.

333
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,520
You go to hug someone and you start the hug and it's like, yes, I get you're hugging

334
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
me.

335
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,960
You start enjoying it too much and you're there for, what, 20-30 minutes.

336
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,260
Just give them a quick in and out.

337
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,960
You give them a quick hug, you're done.

338
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,600
The hug is accomplished and then you just picked up 20 minutes.

339
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Also, stop eating.

340
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
No, eating's cool.

341
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
No, eating's down.

342
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Eating's pretty cool.

343
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,240
I'm saying that you need to reevaluate.

344
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,400
You need to look at the things in your life that you're doing and you need to figure

345
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,480
out what you would rather be doing with that time.

346
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,280
Also, it seems counterintuitive, midday nap.

347
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,800
Just super energizing, get yourself a piziz going, just in and out.

348
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:13,200
If you can get a 20-minute power nap in midday, then the rest of the day is going to feel

349
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
longer.

350
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
It's a little secret.

351
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Right.

352
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
Well, pro tip.

353
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
It's about perception.

354
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,360
It's a question of perception.

355
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,280
Brian Gann is afraid of bees, wasps, and hornets.

356
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Should be.

357
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,920
He said, when he wears red shirts in the spring, he seemed to go near me.

358
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,920
What do I do?

359
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
Don't go outside.

360
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:38,040
Okay, first off, that's a perfect – we have so many fears that are irrational.

361
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,080
The fear of stinging insects is a direct – celebrate that fear.

362
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,640
That's exactly right.

363
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
Yes.

364
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,040
I'm being afraid of a shark that's swimming near me.

365
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Yeah.

366
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
Yeah, absolutely.

367
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Yeah, I'm afraid of that shark.

368
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,040
Absolutely.

369
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:57,120
I mean, the smart ass answer is, don't wear a red shirt.

370
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
He doesn't have a choice.

371
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,120
That's what I said.

372
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,120
But I –

373
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,520
The Enterprise captain told him that he doesn't have long for this world, so he's wearing

374
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
a red shirt.

375
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
He's going to get skooked.

376
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
But I get –

377
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,760
Going to get a planet floor and get skooked by some multi-tentacled fixer wheel.

378
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:18,760
I understand that I have so few shirts in my life that I think I have a good, positive

379
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,000
body image when I'm wearing, and one of them is red.

380
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,960
And maybe Ryan's in the same boat where he's got this sweet ass red shirt that he

381
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,200
got at PacSun, and it makes him feel good to wear it.

382
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Griffin is sort of like Doug Funne.

383
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
It makes him feel good to wear it.

384
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,400
Griffin has fundamentally what is a uniform, the Griffin uniform.

385
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,280
You open up his closet, it's 20 of this red shirt from PacSun.

386
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
An all snap button shirt.

387
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
It's red flannel –

388
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Slacks, a cock ring.

389
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,280
It's red flannel –

390
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
A cock ring.

391
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,600
It's the same every day.

392
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
And his mask.

393
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,100
A red cock ring.

394
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,400
But I understand what he's saying.

395
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,520
Not wearing the red shirt is not an option because if you stop wearing the red shirt,

396
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,940
then the terrorist wasps win.

397
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:05,840
So what you can do is you can spitz yourself with off, but that's not – you don't

398
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,020
want that scent following you around.

399
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,880
I heard about these things.

400
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
They are medallions.

401
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:17,640
They're medallions that you can either snap to your belt or I guess wear around your neck.

402
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:24,920
They're not particularly stylish, but they exude off or some sort of bug repellent.

403
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,760
That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard.

404
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,560
No, it's not like a – why is it disgusting?

405
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
It's not unsanitary.

406
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
It's like a little cunt.

407
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,560
No, because I'm picturing wearing it like a necklace and it just exuding off.

408
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
It's really gross.

409
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,880
Like ants who lost pheromones.

410
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,480
What do you smell like?

411
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
You smell like off.

412
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
You have a deet.

413
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
You have a deet-esque aroma.

414
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,040
You have a real strong citronella smell.

415
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Citronella.

416
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,480
Sort of a citronella meets off.

417
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,480
And ass.

418
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
And just an ass.

419
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
You smell like ass.

420
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,480
Like an ass.

421
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Dude, that medallion though.

422
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
But you look awesome.

423
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,480
You look fucking beautiful.

424
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,840
It looks really great with that red shirt.

425
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,120
It all colludes.

426
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,040
Are we talking about like an enchantment?

427
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Is this more of an enchantment?

428
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
I would say –

429
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,840
The only medallions that I know of are either beef or enchanted.

430
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Here's what you do.

431
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,160
You go down to the magic store and you tell them that you're having a wasp issue.

432
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,160
A wasp issue.

433
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
We're not talking about it.

434
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Don't worry.

435
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
He's got it.

436
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
It's very old.

437
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,880
He goes down to the medallion wing of the magic store.

438
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
Gets you a medallion.

439
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
Not a big deal.

440
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,040
The other thing you can do is just run away from them as fast as you can.

441
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,680
They're really small.

442
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,240
Make sure you scream like a girl too.

443
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,240
That's really important.

444
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,360
That is a natural defense.

445
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,760
Travis and I in our Cincinnati love nest, we have a balcony and I'll occasionally

446
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,280
go up there and play guitar for all the children.

447
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,280
The small children.

448
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,280
He plays the five chords from Greek.

449
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,800
I play the five chords from Greek over and over again.

450
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:55,040
Sometimes I'm just having a good time playing a mellow Greek jam and then like three big

451
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,280
fat bumblebees will come up and like start a jam.

452
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,280
Is that Greek?

453
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,440
Are you playing Greek?

454
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,840
These motherfuckers, they are plump with blood, I think.

455
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
Yes.

456
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Yes.

457
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,120
Bees that carry blood from birches can inject them with blood.

458
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,240
I've seen bees and that's how babies are made.

459
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
That's how babies are made.

460
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,240
Exactly, Travis.

461
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,240
That is the best bees I've ever seen and they'll just rush me and I have to get up

462
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,040
in the middle of my jam and squeal and just throw the screen door open and get inside

463
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
it.

464
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
I just bought this new guitar.

465
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,280
I don't care if it slams into the brick wall as I'm getting into the building and shutting

466
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,760
the screen door behind me.

467
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,640
It's terrifying but you just got to get out of there.

468
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,440
It's just one of those things you have to deal with.

469
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
You know what?

470
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
That's life.

471
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,160
Scratty Bones, do you guys know him?

472
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,720
Scratty Bones on Twitter.

473
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,480
Scratty Bones Jones?

474
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,280
Scratty Bones Jones.

475
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,400
How many times a week should I shampoo my hair?

476
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,920
I'm currently on a wash thrice shampoo every third wash cycle.

477
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,800
Okay, we're going to get just real talk here.

478
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,760
Yeah, you just entered into our wheelhouse.

479
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,560
Listen, this is a matter of some debate for men of dry hair.

480
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:09,640
Let me open up by saying I didn't know this is one of those many, many things that I as

481
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:16,920
a 22-year-old adult should know and incorporate in my life but I shampoo my hair every time

482
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
I get in the shower.

483
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
See?

484
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
That's why you've got that close hair.

485
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,720
That's why you've got that hair like you have.

486
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,640
You're having an awakening.

487
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,360
Guys, it's our first awakening.

488
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,360
I feel like when I don't…

489
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,960
You're listening to awakenings with Justin Travis and Chris and the rest.

490
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,320
I feel like I'm getting dirty.

491
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,320
If I don't do it, I feel dirty.

492
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:41,480
The thing is the natural oils that your scalp produces makes your hair look…

493
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,560
Think of it from a caveman era.

494
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,080
Your body biologically wants your hair to look better.

495
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,000
It's trying to make your hair look better.

496
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,360
It's doing what it can to help you.

497
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,200
I like the three-day rotation.

498
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,560
I like the three-day rotation.

499
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
I am down.

500
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,400
Now sometimes, what's the problem?

501
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,760
You've got to get in there on that third day with a real hard scrub or your scalp's

502
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,440
going to go to shit.

503
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,080
That's the nightmare scenario.

504
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,480
When my hair gets longer and I know I'm running my hands through it a lot and getting

505
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,640
it real gross, I'll do a two-day rotation.

506
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640
Sure.

507
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
Yeah.

508
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,800
If you use a lot of products one day and you've got to get away from that feeling…

509
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
You know what?

510
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,800
I would also, if that's not good for you, get yourself a nice smoothing gel, something

511
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,720
that's going to reduce that frizz for you.

512
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,680
My man Sunny, my gay Persian hairstylist, the master cuts.

513
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,440
That's my boy Sunny.

514
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,840
He said, oh, we'll get you something that looks real good, buddy.

515
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,400
That's what he always says no matter how he cuts it.

516
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Wait a minute, Sunny.

517
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
I know that fool.

518
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,960
He used to work at Fantastic Sam's, right?

519
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
Yeah.

520
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
Yeah.

521
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
And he migrated.

522
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
He migrated.

523
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,960
He looked like a beautiful…

524
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Two more gay Persian-friendly things.

525
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Yeah.

526
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,720
The Fantastic Sam's wasn't gay Persian-friendly enough for Sunny.

527
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,240
Well, with a name like Fantastic Sam's, I mean…

528
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,240
Yeah, you think.

529
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,200
Oh, you know, they're real heterosexual American-friendly.

530
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
You know what's adorable?

531
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
You know what's adorable?

532
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,960
He says, so I say, I'm always going on a Friday for some reason, and he says, so what

533
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,040
are you doing this weekend, buddy?

534
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,040
You know, I'll tell him whatever boring shit I'm doing.

535
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,680
He said, I'm going to go down to this new gay bar.

536
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,720
It's called whatever, Accelerate or whatever the new gay bar is, Shamanigans.

537
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,680
I want to go down to the Shamanigans, and you know, my friends, they always drag me

538
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
to these gay bars.

539
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
I don't know, buddy.

540
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
And it's like, come on.

541
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
Come on, Sunny.

542
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
I don't even know what's going on.

543
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,680
Come on.

544
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,680
I mean, I'm impeccably dressed.

545
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
Come on.

546
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,680
I don't care.

547
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,840
It's sad.

548
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:37,600
The region we live in, he's been conditioned to try to keep that on the DL, but no, he's

549
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
great.

550
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:46,080
Anyway, my man, Sunny, my boy Sunny, he says to use the, he says that I should use a smoothing

551
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,080
gel, so I do.

552
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,080
Just a nice…

553
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,240
It's important to note, you should still rinse your hair out.

554
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,360
You should get in the shower and rinse your hair, because if not, that's gross.

555
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:00,280
There's one unsolved mystery here, because you guys obviously know more about this than

556
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:06,920
I do, but if you don't shampoo your hair, then how are you supposed to put shampoo in

557
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,880
your hair and let the suds run down, and then just use those suds as soap?

558
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
Right?

559
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
Oh, okay.

560
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,120
Listen, great question, but I pass the head all together, go straight to the chest hair.

561
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,720
You're telling me that I shouldn't use soap, is what I'm hearing, except for every Wednesday

562
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,040
and Saturday.

563
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,620
I think that this grooming section, I'm going to, has taken a weird turn where it's more

564
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,620
about…

565
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,620
How gross Griffin is?

566
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,880
Just a terrible life of Griffin Mackerel, it's weird.

567
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,280
It started out as about one thing, now it's kind of depressing.

568
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,040
I'm as clean as a motherfucker, but I do it in suspect ways.

569
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
Yeah, yeah.

570
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:51,520
He's going for that every man, I've got this, why not just combine the two tasks?

571
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:57,320
I operate outside of the accepted social norms when it comes to showering.

572
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:04,280
This has gone from a Dear Abby column to a photocopied independent comic that someone

573
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,280
on the streets of Brooklyn would hand you where it's like, my terrible life, what

574
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,120
a wreck I am.

575
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,520
Or perhaps an intervention.

576
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,760
So apparently, Suzanne, if you want to shave a few minutes from your day, just use your

577
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,720
shampoo for soap.

578
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
Like a monster.

579
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
And then cry.

580
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
Cry for it.

581
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Just cry yourself.

582
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,320
How much time do you have to black out for crying?

583
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,720
Before next week's show, I'm going to get a bar of soap, I'm going to get a thing

584
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,920
of shampoo, and I'm going to read off the ingredients in both, and it's going to be

585
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
the same.

586
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
Wait, can I, can I, can I, Griffin, can I say?

587
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,920
I'm so embarrassed.

588
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
Griffin, are you conditioning?

589
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

590
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
Okay.

591
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
All right.

592
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,320
Oh, see, but you don't want to do that every day either.

593
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,120
No, I do that every, I do that twice.

594
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,120
I do that twice a day.

595
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,120
No, you do not do that.

596
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,120
What?

597
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
I do not.

598
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
Yeah, you didn't know that?

599
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,840
I'll carry a little bottle of shampoo, of conditioner around with me.

600
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
I'll do it in the shower.

601
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
Oh, no, no, no.

602
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,840
And then just like after lunch, I'll just.

603
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
You don't want to condition every day.

604
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,840
Dry.

605
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,480
Every time, every time I go to get my hair cut, when I get my hair cut, the girl's like,

606
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,560
have you conditioned yesterday or today?

607
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,200
And if I say yes, she won't do it.

608
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,120
Like, because you lose manageability of your hair.

609
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
That's like, I know.

610
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,440
But like, your hair should be somewhat coarse so it holds a natural shape.

611
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,000
Working Stiff Pro says, yeah, this is our settled cue.

612
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,880
Dear MBMBAM, I'm looking for love.

613
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,920
Not the sicko type, but if I find that, I'm not opposed.

614
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,920
Hey.

615
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
Nice.

616
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
Keep it open.

617
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
Any ideas?

618
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,080
I think that you've got to stick up your ass.

619
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,480
I don't think you should.

620
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,760
If you ain't got love, you shouldn't be able to, you know, cast aspersions, but.

621
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,360
Yeah, maybe you get that weird love, that love with a pillow shaped like a person love.

622
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,480
Who's to say that's not love though, right?

623
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
Like in that person's mind.

624
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,600
I actually, I just had my mind changed on internet dating.

625
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Yeah.

626
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Um, like I was talking to a female friend of mine and all she does is internet dating

627
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,240
because in her mind she doesn't have time to go through all the shit of like going to

628
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,120
a bar and like the guy she works with, she sees every day so she doesn't want to do that.

629
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,320
And I was like, you know what?

630
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,440
I had been judging that too harshly.

631
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,440
Now that being said, ladies, don't get near that Craigslist.

632
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:24,200
Freaks on the internet do not trust people in anything, but I now see that as a viable

633
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,280
like, hey, good work.

634
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,880
If you want to go through internet dating and that's your jam, do it.

635
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,880
Don't be ashamed of it.

636
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,040
But even when that internet dating is like a Craigslist listing, it's like, hey, how's

637
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
it going?

638
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
You want to come over and hang out?

639
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,920
We can watch movies and you can jerk off, you can jerk off my dog.

640
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
No, wait a second.

641
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:45,120
But that's still love for that person.

642
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,160
Go to a community.

643
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:52,320
If you're going to shop online for dudes or chicks, ladies, excuse me, make sure it's

644
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,440
a community you trust like the NB, NBAM community of fans.

645
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Lots of singles.

646
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,160
Lots of singles just mixing it up in there.

647
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Pics only, please.

648
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Pics only.

649
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Yeah, pics only.

650
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
SL.

651
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,160
And no fatties.

652
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,560
Best way to do it, meet new people, dude.

653
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,640
Just meet new people.

654
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,440
Every day, meet some new people.

655
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,760
Yeah, get a – and remember, here's a good tip for life.

656
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,320
Remember it's impossible to get someone interested in you, so be interested in other

657
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,320
people.

658
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,320
That's the secret to success.

659
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,600
Everybody wants to be – feel like people are interested in them.

660
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,920
Get interested in other people and the love, the love will find you.

661
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,580
And here's my secret trick, dude.

662
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,800
When you go out and you're looking for a girl, have girls with you.

663
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,960
Girls will trust you so much more.

664
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,960
That's good too, yeah.

665
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,960
That's good too.

666
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,720
Because that's the thing, because there's always that natural like I feel creepy walking

667
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,560
up to a girl at a bar and be like, hey, baby, can I buy you a drink?

668
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,520
But if you have another girl with you, that's a litmus test for that girl like, oh, this

669
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,880
dude's not a super creepo serial killer.

670
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,520
I can at least chat with them for now.

671
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,520
And then don't push it.

672
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,520
Don't push it.

673
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,440
If you're like, can I buy you a drink?

674
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,360
You have a good 10-minute conversation, be like, all right, that's a W. And if we come

675
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,320
back and talk again later, great, but don't try to move from 10-minute conversation to

676
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,120
so do you want to get married?

677
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,040
Just like enjoy that 10 minutes and then, you know, see how it goes later.

678
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:24,480
Or another option, don't feel like you have to be in love with somebody, you know?

679
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
I've got a pretty good life.

680
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,560
I'm not, you know, I'm single, no prospects.

681
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,160
I eat, I eat, I eat.

682
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,360
And he also shampoos every day.

683
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,440
Water laced, shampoo with soap, Griffin McElroy, it's on the market.

684
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,520
At 12.30, I wanted to have a hot dog and a soda, but we didn't have buns.

685
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,680
We had some leftover brats that my brother made last night on the grill.

686
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,680
And I cut it up.

687
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,560
That was already a week old, important to note.

688
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:55,560
Put it in ramen and I didn't have soda, so I drank beer and it was 12, it was 12 o'clock.

689
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,120
So you don't need any, you don't need, you know, if you have someone, they could tell

690
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,160
you not to do that.

691
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,360
It doesn't matter, sicko, it doesn't matter, love.

692
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,360
You just need someone to tell you.

693
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,720
Just so long as they have enough cognizant awareness to say, hey, don't eat brat and

694
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,720
ramen and beer.

695
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
It's 12 o'clock.

696
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
You're nicer.

697
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,720
Go outside.

698
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
You need people in your life.

699
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,160
You need, I've got Justin and Travis, without them, fuck, I would be, I would be, just eat

700
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
the shampoo.

701
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,200
I would get confused.

702
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,000
And then rub the ramen all over yourself, that's why I'm not willing to say he has not

703
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
done.

704
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,640
So, well, look, when you don't have a loofah, sometimes you don't have a loofah.

705
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,860
Desperate times call for desperate loofahs.

706
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,120
This one comes from Yahoo.

707
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,720
Open question from Tara, the top contributor.

708
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,840
I don't know if that means like of all time or just for today, but the question is, what

709
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:51,920
is the first song that comes to mind when I say the word party?

710
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,340
I'm pretty sure I know what Justin's answer would be to that question.

711
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,920
You know what, I'm going to say that the top answer on this Yahoo question is the correct

712
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
one.

713
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,720
Is it Andrew WK's?

714
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
Party Hard?

715
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,760
No, it is on, that is on there.

716
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,160
What about DMX's Party Up In Here?

717
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,160
I don't actually see that on the list.

718
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:15,560
If we're assuming that the answers that have been given are indeed the correct answers.

719
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,280
I have one more guess, Lionel Richie's All Night Long.

720
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
No.

721
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,280
Close.

722
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,920
Party All The Time by Eddie Murphy is one of the top answers.

723
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,880
That's not the top answer.

724
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,240
Someone said Birthday by the Beatles.

725
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,560
Actually, no, that's the worst song ever recorded.

726
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,760
Party in the USA is on here a couple of times by musical ingenue Miley Cyrus.

727
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,000
She wrote the Greek theme song.

728
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,360
The top answer though, do you guys really not know it?

729
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,360
Tell me.

730
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,500
I guarantee you know it if you think.

731
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,120
I will probably know it once you say it.

732
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,880
I mean, I will be familiar.

733
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,600
It's Hollywood Nights by Pete Seeger.

734
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:02,600
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots.

735
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,400
That's the best answer ever.

736
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,720
I mean, that's a very good answer.

737
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,500
I mean, it should come to your mind when someone's trying to get the party started.

738
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,400
No one's ever been having a bad time and someone dropped shots and everyone's like,

739
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,460
I don't know, no, it's time.

740
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,680
There are two words in that song that always make me go, well, yeah, and it's buttery

741
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,680
nipples.

742
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,920
And when they say it, oh, that is heaven, that is heaven.

743
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,800
For me, it's shots and shots.

744
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,800
And then they say.

745
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,280
The 23rd and 28th instances of the words being used.

746
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,680
And I think it's the best usage of Little John I've ever seen.

747
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,680
God.

748
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,360
The best use of the force that is Little John.

749
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,740
I think the best use of Little John was that time when my car broke down and he pulled

750
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,880
over to help me with my tire.

751
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
That was pretty cool.

752
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,880
It was nice.

753
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,440
I was like, I'm right here, John.

754
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
You don't.

755
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,440
Little John.

756
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440
Old John.

757
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,760
I don't know.

758
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,120
You look about the same height as me.

759
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,760
I will just pass you the one that you don't need to yell.

760
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Unnecessary.

761
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,240
Now I really want to listen to shots.

762
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
Unfortunately, that's.

763
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,240
It's the theme song to our show.

764
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
It's the theme song of my life.

765
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,240
It's a sad thing to say out loud.

766
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
Yeah.

767
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
I can't think of a finer, finer moment.

768
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:32,240
I think it would be good for us when we end each show to have one question that we announce

769
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,480
at the end of the show and then just ruminate on until the start of the next week's show

770
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,080
once we've had a week to think about it.

771
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,080
You have a question, don't you?

772
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,080
I have it.

773
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,080
Yes.

774
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,080
That's what I thought.

775
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,080
Absolutely.

776
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,680
So you let me know when you're ready for the end to come.

777
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,480
Justin, if they want to contact us, what's the best way to get a question out into the

778
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,600
Ethernet for us?

779
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:09,120
You just use the Twitter and use the hashtag NBNBAM or you can use the Internet, say email.

780
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:14,920
It's NBNBAM at gmail.com and we will have more options for you as we progress.

781
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:21,040
Whatever other things are in the works, but for now, that's how we roll.

782
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:27,320
Final question of the day from Yahoo Answers user Mallie.

783
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,720
Can birds get allergies?

784
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,080
I'm Justin McElroy.

785
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,280
I'm Griffin McElroy.

786
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,280
I'm Travis McElroy.

787
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,520
And this has been my brother, my brother, and me.

788
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:56,760
You will never know me.

789
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:11,960
I'm Travis McElroy and I'll see you next time.
