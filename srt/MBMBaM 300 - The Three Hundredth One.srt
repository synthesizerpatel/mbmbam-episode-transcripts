1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:58,160
Get rich. Aren't we a pair? Me here lies on the ground, and you in mid-air.

6
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,640
Send in the clowns. No. No. No, you know what? This time we're not sending- no,

7
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,560
there aren't any fucking clowns this time, Justin. One who keeps tearing the rock-

8
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
To be fair, Griffin, I think the point of the song is supposed to be that there are no clowns

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,680
to sing in, and in fact, the singer and the person being sung to are the clowns.

10
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,880
Desiree, Travis, Desiree.

11
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,040
I know, but I was making it more general, Justin. I believe it's Vincent and Desiree.

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,200
I'm just exhausted by it. Justin's become the fucking Scott Bakula of this podcast.

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,280
I'm not doing this episode unless I get to sing in it.

14
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,120
Oh, I thought you meant that Scott Bakula sung

15
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,480
Send in the Clowns on just a fuck ton of episodes. Do you remember that,

16
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,720
how there were like 10 quantum leaps in a row where he just, apropos of nothing,

17
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,920
sung Send in the Clowns? Yeah, that's like his whole thing.

18
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,880
Singing Send in the Clowns?

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,280
Yeah, it was like a platform for his musical career.

20
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,520
When he released his album that was all Send in the Clowns?

21
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,200
Yeah, it was weird. It was just 10 tracks. And what's weird is it wasn't just the same

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,640
song 10 times over. It was 10 discrete recordings.

23
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,400
And he did them in different styles. There was the Calypso Send in the Clowns,

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,600
a Jazz Send in the Clowns, a Zydeco Send in the Clowns.

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,800
The Zydeco Send in the Clowns is actually really great. And there's a chart topping hit.

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,160
Isn't it rich?

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,240
Wait, no, no, no. Don't start over. Don't start over. Don't start over.

28
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,000
Isn't it queer?

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,120
Don't start over. Don't start over.

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,920
This is the end.

31
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,720
Oh, okay, okay.

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,320
Losing my timing this late in my career.

33
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,120
Where are the clowns?

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,800
I feel like you lost the key, maybe, like a stanza back.

35
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,640
There ought to be clowns.

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,680
Are there clowns?

37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,720
He found them.

38
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,440
Don't bother.

39
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,960
They are here.

40
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,760
They are here.

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,000
All right, a Lady Gaga second finish.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,200
Well, maybe next year.

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,560
Yeah.

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,120
Hello, everybody.

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,320
Welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, Adventure 300.

46
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,680
It's gonna be embarrassing for you, Justin, when Griffin cuts that entire song.

47
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,040
The whole fucking thing.

48
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,240
Not any of it.

49
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,320
Well, this is the show that you signed on for.

50
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,400
You've been with us for 300.

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,560
And here we are, volume two.

52
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,960
Okay, so we didn't have an episode zero.

53
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,200
So is episode two coming to a close or is episode two beginning?

54
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,200
I mean, episode two, was everything else episode one, part one, part two, part three, part four?

55
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,960
You guys know you're supposed to listen to all of those first 300 episodes back to back

56
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,560
to back over a 300 hour just fucking sweat lodge, right?

57
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,040
Don't do that.

58
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,080
That would be disastrous.

59
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,680
My name is Justin McElroy, and I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

60
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,880
I'm Travis McElroy, your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

61
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,960
I'm Scott Bakula, and today I'll be playing the role of the baby-est brother, Griffin McElroy.

62
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,360
Well, here we are, folks.

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
We did it for 300.

64
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,400
I started thinking when I was coming downstairs, I thought, you know what?

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,520
This is 300.

66
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,080
Got to do a really great show.

67
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,600
And then I thought, you know what?

68
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,680
I'm the one being celebrated here.

69
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,640
Right, exactly.

70
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,800
Why should we have to work harder to make a really good one?

71
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,360
You know what I mean?

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,720
Do you remember when MASH did its 300th episode and they really phoned it in?

73
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,880
I do just want to like check in with you guys and make sure that we are still definitely

74
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,040
on for this like 300 Roman Centurion bit.

75
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,040
We're like, oh, you remember we're going to be all like-

76
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,640
We were supposed to wear our leather bracers and stuff.

77
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,360
Yeah, well, more importantly, we were supposed to be like nude from the waist up and then

78
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,880
like all oily and stuff.

79
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,720
Nah, this is why we haven't done video for several hundred episodes.

80
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,920
I turned up, we decided to Google Hangout, not for volume two, but just for, because

81
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,120
we, because we, the Skype is shit in the bed again.

82
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,320
And when I turned it on, Griffin was in a black tank top.

83
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,440
And it was weird because it was like, it felt like a betrayal of sorts.

84
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,880
Like he was going to do a whole show and not tell us he was wearing a black tank top.

85
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,360
Yeah, I changed, I've changed out of that.

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,640
Yeah, Griffin is now oiling himself up.

87
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,440
And I will say, it looks like he's drawn on his chest hair.

88
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,160
I think that's my takeaway from this.

89
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,440
The chest hair is hard to like, you got to really grease her down, you know?

90
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,120
Yeah, and then you got to stipple it on to give it a little extra color and depth.

91
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,360
OK, so I'm closing this.

92
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, one last thing.

93
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,640
I can't look away, Justin.

94
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,160
Wait, wait, wait, I'm almost done.

95
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,720
I'm almost done.

96
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,760
Are you really almost done?

97
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,560
Yeah, yeah, look, look.

98
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,480
This is Sparta.

99
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,520
That was the end of the joke.

100
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,000
Now you're tallying off, you disgust me.

101
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,640
So anyway, this is my brother.

102
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,560
My brother made an advice show for the modern era.

103
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,360
We help people.

104
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,520
Please just turn your video off.

105
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,400
I'll give you anything.

106
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,800
It's off.

107
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,640
No, it's not off.

108
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,840
I turned it off.

109
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,640
Don't you dare.

110
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,040
Griffin, we're looking right at your nudity.

111
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,480
I turned the video off.

112
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,920
OK, we have a lot of people to help.

113
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,040
We have a lot of special guests.

114
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,600
We have a lot of fun in store, a lot of surprises.

115
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,720
What have we learned by the end?

116
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,920
Someone will die.

117
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,880
Somebody will fly.

118
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,440
We got some save the cheerleader, save the world.

119
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,760
We got some special things for this 300th episode, which you may not think just hearing

120
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,560
the beginning of it.

121
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,440
But man, this water-based lubricant is going to stay on the body, I guess, for a while.

122
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,600
Is that Extreme Restraints brand lubricant?

123
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,200
Yeah, it is bringing them back into the fold.

124
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,800
Welcome back to the family, Extreme Restraints.

125
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,120
We're going to get you back on the podcast one way or another.

126
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,840
We'll get you inside the podcast, if you know what I mean.

127
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,640
And I do.

128
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,520
So here's a question.

129
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,720
So later tonight, I'm going to a party where I'm signed up to bring the drinks.

130
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,960
Along with a few other things I brought, I am also bringing some already open half full

131
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,000
soda bottles.

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,520
Is this appropriate?

133
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,200
The soda isn't too old, and I'm not going to drink them all by myself.

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,520
Since it takes you guys several months to respond, I'm going to bring them anyway.

135
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,960
Yeah, maybe Future Me can go back in time to warn me of the awkward situation that may

136
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,080
or may not ensue.

137
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,000
That's from Don't Want to Be Wasteful in Washington.

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,200
If people do that, please send a follow up to let us know how it went.

139
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,400
Two liters of soda.

140
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,080
Let's really finally crack this nut open because we've been like dancing around it

141
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,720
for long enough.

142
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:40,000
I only, like most people, buy two liters of soda for parties because I don't want to

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,520
have to have a bunch of cans taking up a refrigerator space.

144
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,440
So I buy two liters of soda for parties, and it lets you get a variety of things.

145
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,800
Inevitably, all the diet soda gets drunk.

146
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,200
The regular soda is just like there, but I feel like I should have it on hand for people.

147
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,400
And then I'm left with like four, two liters of varying levels of emptiness.

148
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,200
It feels like such a waste to throw them out, but I'm never going to.

149
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,080
I never do that.

150
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,280
I don't like ice in my drink.

151
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,680
You know, that's prizes at the end of the night.

152
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,560
You know, this is this is actually how the Blue Man Group got started.

153
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,320
They're like, we gotta do something with these.

154
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,200
They blew it.

155
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,720
That's them blowing into them.

156
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,160
Sorry, my Foley wasn't on point.

157
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,840
One of them had some sort of lung condition, and it's just like, that's how we talk.

158
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,960
Like, guys, I think we should start the number one Vegas percussive act and we'll paint ourselves.

159
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,280
Sorry, I'm a lunger.

160
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,320
Got the consumption.

161
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,960
I think that this is why BYOB is a thing, isn't it?

162
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:44,880
That you say like, hey, bring whatever two liter you want and then take that shit with you when you go.

163
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,160
No, that's not the taking.

164
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,560
That's different.

165
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,520
Take only pictures.

166
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,720
Leave only footprints.

167
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,440
That's not.

168
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,560
Okay, first off, that's not what BYOB means.

169
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,480
I'm trying to bring your own beverage.

170
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,080
No, that's not what it means.

171
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,320
But then there's a secret series of letters, a silent series of letters that come after it that

172
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,880
signify, and then take your half empty two liters home with you, thank you.

173
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,640
What if it was BYOB, B-T-S-E-B.

174
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,640
Bring your own beverage, but take someone else's beverage.

175
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,280
Okay, so you're just kind of, it's like a Yankee swap for Bev's.

176
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,240
Ah, that's way better.

177
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,440
I was going to say like a beverage key party, but yours is better.

178
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,880
What, you fuck the beverages?

179
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,240
Well, no, you just take a different beverage to bed.

180
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,320
Well, I ended up with Mellow Yellow.

181
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,880
All right.

182
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,000
I've always been curious.

183
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,000
We haven't even addressed the fucking question at hand, which is, is it okay for this person

184
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,440
to bring old soda?

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,680
Hi, I brought old soda.

186
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,400
Yeah, sodas seem better days, but it's still potable.

187
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:42,880
Go for it.

188
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,800
I brought an old soda and a half empty box of club crackers, like out of the packages.

189
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,040
Where do I put this?

190
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,560
I wrapped up some old cheese and some Saran wrap, and this is some flat soda.

191
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,840
Thanks for inviting me.

192
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,560
Do you remember summer Pepsi where you could unscrew the cap and then type the code into

193
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,320
the website and get a hacky sack?

194
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,120
Yeah, it's from 1999, but it's still good.

195
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,040
You can still put some whiskey in there.

196
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,360
I brought a half empty bottle of Josta.

197
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,520
Do you want me to put it in the fridge or just leave it out so people can get at it?

198
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,240
Guys, fruitopia party.

199
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,200
Come get it.

200
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,960
The only way to test to see if two liter soda is like still potable is that I have found

201
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,680
that I utilize in my day to day is dump a little down the sink and see if it fizzes

202
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,160
up or not.

203
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
If it doesn't fizz up, it's already up.

204
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,040
So just like leave it tilted and get that syrup out.

205
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,360
But if it fizzes a little bit, sometimes I'll still be like, well, it didn't fizz that much.

206
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,960
Yeah, yeah, dump it the rest of the way out.

207
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,760
Can you give me a just like is or it's not where it is.

208
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,200
That's right.

209
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,000
Feel the fizz.

210
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,600
That's a good soda.

211
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,240
Pop a little thumb.

212
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,240
God, we need more rules of thumb out of our wisdom.

213
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,560
And that's like the first like really useful like life hack that we've been able to produce.

214
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,360
Come along.

215
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,000
You belong.

216
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,880
Feel the fizz of Cuvicola.

217
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,380
Exactly.

218
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,880
They've got the flavors, orange, grape and cherry.

219
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
That's not a good spread.

220
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,680
But yeah, no, like regular soda flavors.

221
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,880
Hey, do you guys want a Yahoo?

222
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,240
Yeah, don't.

223
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,440
Did we like address it?

224
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:13,920
Don't do that.

225
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,040
Is that answered?

226
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,760
Don't do that.

227
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,360
Just go to the store and get a two liter for like ninety nine cents.

228
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,480
Go to Sam's Club.

229
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,440
Buy a by a four liter of Dr.

230
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,480
Lightning and then it's going to cost you sixty one cents.

231
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,600
And then you take that to the party and you have the best night of your life.

232
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,560
You just get jacked on Dr.

233
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,040
Lightning.

234
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,800
You get a fucking prescription from Dr.

235
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,440
Lightning.

236
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,280
You drink all four liters of that bad boy of that extra big jug and you're ready to go.

237
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,080
Is it Dr.

238
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,560
Lightning?

239
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,920
I'm not sure that's accurate.

240
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,040
They got Dr.

241
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,760
They got Dr.

242
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,360
He's a doctorate in history.

243
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,080
They got Dr.

244
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,560
Lightning.

245
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,280
They've got Mr.

246
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,200
Cool.

247
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,120
They got Pibster Esquire.

248
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,400
They got Pibster Esquire.

249
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,480
They have soda time.

250
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,680
Exclamation point.

251
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,880
They've got Mountain Don't.

252
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,400
Mountain Don't.

253
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,760
I need to turn my AC off one second.

254
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,520
I think I can come up with more soda names.

255
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,320
Okay.

256
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,080
Yeah, let's just bounce them off each other.

257
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,640
Popsie.

258
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,640
Now what's okay.

259
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,440
Diet Cork.

260
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,080
Diet vanilla cork.

261
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,480
Well, you got a whole cork family.

262
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,600
Have you had oops all soda?

263
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,160
I wish Justin was here to hear that.

264
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,360
I know it's a good one.

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,800
Shit, that's good.

266
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,640
I was going to go with caffeine free diet rainwater, but nothing.

267
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,560
I couldn't pull it together.

268
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,840
How about this Yahoo?

269
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,360
And it was sent in by level 9000.

270
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,280
Yeah, Drew Davenport.

271
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,680
Big ups to my main man, Drew Davenport.

272
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,760
Keeping it real for three centuries.

273
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,160
I don't know.

274
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,600
Actually, I don't think he was on at the very beginning, but he was an early adopter.

275
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,160
And this was also sent in by Aaron Keese, who's gotten enough Yahoo's on the show now where

276
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,720
I need to know how to pronounce the last name there.

277
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,560
Thank you to both of you.

278
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,240
It's by Yahoo Answers user Chris G.

279
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,280
My boss at Polygon, Chris Grant.

280
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,560
Who asks what are the five hardest tricks for a magician to do?

281
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,240
Oh, good question.

282
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,760
Ollie 360 Jesus spin.

283
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,360
No, it's called Christ air.

284
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,960
It's not called a Jesus spin.

285
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,880
No, Jesus.

286
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,040
Then I think is what sign dancers do.

287
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,480
The five hardest tricks for a magician to do.

288
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,960
Justin, I mean, we the three of us all know them.

289
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,400
Let's just start with number five.

290
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,760
I've the fifth hardest trick for a magician to do.

291
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,560
Justin is.

292
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,640
Doves.

293
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,120
Now, which which one?

294
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,160
Just like finding them is kind of a trick because it's like, where did you get that?

295
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,520
Yeah, you know, there's it's not like there's a dove store.

296
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,600
Now you can't just buy a dove.

297
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,400
Now, do you think what I'm not sure if it was on prime?

298
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,520
Yeah, you can prime it.

299
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,760
Um, so they probably have those at the pet store, right?

300
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,560
Magic doves?

301
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,600
No, yeah.

302
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,960
Doves, just regular doves.

303
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,920
You buy them at the pet store.

304
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,480
You got to.

305
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,640
There's no other place to buy them at the pet store.

306
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,920
Do you think if you walk in with like a top hat and a cane and a cape in the pet store,

307
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,320
they're like, I saw you coming.

308
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,840
I got to point to a sign that says no magicians.

309
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,720
No magicians.

310
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,760
I know what you're gonna you're gonna stuff this in a pie tin, aren't you?

311
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,200
I hate that.

312
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,760
Well, a clever magician leaves the costume at home and then they buy another animal and

313
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,040
then pretend like the dove is just like a I got a wild hair at my ass.

314
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,520
My, you know, I think I'm going to get a dove too.

315
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,600
But that doesn't work if you're buying a wild hair because then they'll think the worst of you.

316
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,040
Yeah, no, it's not a if you buy those in a bundle, this you get taken to magic

317
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,280
jail.

318
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,680
Definitely.

319
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,960
But otherwise, like you can just get something expendable too.

320
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,720
Like, can I get like I've wanted this for a long time.

321
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,240
I think I'm going to get 30 tadpoles and you know what?

322
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,960
How about a dove?

323
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,240
A dove?

324
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,440
How much are those doves?

325
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,040
Can I get a price check on dove?

326
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,480
But then you get outside, you take that bag full of tadpoles and you fucking throw it on the ground.

327
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,000
Throw it down a sewer.

328
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,040
At least it'll have a shot.

329
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,280
Yeah.

330
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,800
Teenage Ninja Frogs.

331
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,280
Good luck.

332
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,760
God knows I'm I'm a fucking mess, man.

333
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,960
I can't take care of you guys.

334
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,280
I saw the price you all had on doves and I just couldn't help myself.

335
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,160
That can't be beat.

336
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,000
I didn't even want a dove when I came in today.

337
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,120
But that's 30 tadpoles, one for each day of the month, depending on the month.

338
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,160
That salesperson over there, they really sold me on it.

339
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,680
Sir, you're pointing at an aquarium.

340
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,960
That's an empty aquarium.

341
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,840
Well, gotta go.

342
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,360
We'll give that fish a promotion.

343
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,920
Here's your change, sir.

344
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,880
Where'd your coin go?

345
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,840
It's behind your ear.

346
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,400
God damn.

347
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,520
Oh, so tired of this.

348
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,480
The fourth is, of course, cutting a woman into 37ths.

349
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,680
Half is easy, but to get 37 equal portions takes a lot of calculation.

350
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,360
Lot of planning.

351
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,520
It's not even like you can do half season and half season.

352
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,360
It's not it's not factorable by two.

353
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,840
So that's yeah, it's a rough one.

354
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,360
But if you can, you know, you're watching hand.

355
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,720
You know, you're watching Hannibal with me with a magician because every few minutes,

356
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,920
like, yeah, right.

357
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,480
Yeah, I wish I wish it could look like that.

358
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,200
You also have to get 36 very little people.

359
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,000
Very little borrower size.

360
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,220
Yeah.

361
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,120
Griffin, what's the third?

362
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:32,880
The third hardest magic trick is de-levitating and that's like getting up there.

363
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,680
So easy.

364
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,600
Everybody is like, you know how you haven't heard of David Copperfield lately?

365
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,240
It's because he didn't get the second step of it down.

366
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,320
And like the first step is like he's in Vegas.

367
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,640
He's like, this time I'm going to take my act outdoors right in front of that big Bellagio

368
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,280
fountain, baby.

369
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:47,920
Here I go.

370
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,680
Levitating up I go.

371
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,640
Pretty incredible, huh?

372
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,040
What if I made an airplane disappear while I was up here?

373
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,000
Not just kidding.

374
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,640
Anyway, here I.

375
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,960
Hey, this is hey, this is weird.

376
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,640
Hey, I've never gone up this far before.

377
00:16:59,360 --> 00:16:59,920
Oh, no.

378
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,320
Oh, God.

379
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,040
Oh, God.

380
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,880
Hey, does anybody have like a rope or something?

381
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,360
Does?

382
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,080
Hey, does anybody?

383
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,280
Can someone like fly a drone up here and give it?

384
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,160
Does it?

385
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,200
Oh, shit.

386
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,280
Into the fucking sun gone.

387
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,360
David Copperfield gone from the Earth.

388
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,880
Never learned how to de-levitate.

389
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,480
He's the only human satellite.

390
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,600
He's the only one.

391
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,360
Do you think they just keep do you think that?

392
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,640
OK, if he levitated into space, he was already defined the laws of gravity, right?

393
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,680
And the laws of God and the laws of God.

394
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,720
So I wouldn't think that he is being propelled.

395
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,320
He's being propelled by something outside of the natural laws that we understand, right?

396
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,520
You think he'd be OK in space?

397
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,240
Is that what you're saying?

398
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,320
No, I'm saying that, like, OK, I think David Copperfield's icy corpse would continue to

399
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,880
rocket through the depths of infinity, indeed going farther than any man has gone before.

400
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,280
Not to say he's a mere man.

401
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,120
He's become much more than that.

402
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,120
He's a vessel for something.

403
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,000
Our wishes and dreams as an American people, I think.

404
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,520
For levitation magic.

405
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,360
For levitation magic, certainly.

406
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,440
And the number two hardest magic trick is becoming a successful magician when your name

407
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,600
is also Criss Angel, because-

408
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,880
But C-H-R-I-S.

409
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,600
Yeah, just regular Criss Angel.

410
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,720
I am Christopher Angel.

411
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,560
Christopher Angel.

412
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,720
I have a regular haircut and a face like a person.

413
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,960
And I do not look like an embodiment of the Sandman.

414
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,640
I freak the heart is more my thing.

415
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,400
Criss Angel, heart freak.

416
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,520
I got you roses.

417
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,680
Oh, that's sweet.

418
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,880
My heart is freaked.

419
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,320
Heart freak.

420
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,920
Hey, do you remember that one time when you told your 10-year-old, when you were 10 years

421
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,280
old and you told your best friend that all you wanted was a silver pony with a golden

422
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:45,840
mane?

423
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,280
I got that for you.

424
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,840
Heart freaked.

425
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,960
Hey, I heard about you and Sheila.

426
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,840
Are you doing OK?

427
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,400
Heart freak.

428
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,080
That's really, that's really nice of you to ask.

429
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,640
Hey, man, I know Cinco de Mayo's coming up.

430
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,200
I know that that was the day of the big boat accident for you.

431
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,000
So I'm just calling to check and make sure that you're doing all right and see if you

432
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,640
need any company.

433
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,200
Heart freak.

434
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,600
And the number one hardest trick as a magician is explaining what you do to your grandmother.

435
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,880
That seemed like it actually would be pretty easy.

436
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,720
Yeah, they had magicians back then, I think.

437
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,960
Great grandmother?

438
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,640
How far back do I have to go before you get burned as a witch?

439
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,800
Not, sadly, not that far back.

440
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,760
Not so far, yeah.

441
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,400
Now, maybe you have to-

442
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,080
I'm listening to this heart freak stuff.

443
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:39,040
My new number one superpower, most requested superpower, would be being able to say exactly

444
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,120
what a person needed to hear in any given moment.

445
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,680
You know what I mean?

446
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,520
Like, haven't there been moments in your life where if one person had just looked at you

447
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,640
and been like, I heard about the Cinco de Mayo boat accident and I just want to make

448
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,400
sure that you're okay.

449
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,240
And you just burst into tears and you know it's all going to be okay.

450
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,280
What I love about that, Justin, is-

451
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,600
I mean, except for the fact that your whole family just, like, Cinco de Mayode.

452
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,200
They sunk, oh, de Mayode.

453
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,240
What I love about that, Justin, is maybe it's epic.

454
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,280
Maybe it's like something incredibly tragic has just happened to you.

455
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,480
But also, maybe it's just like you wore a pair of shoes that day and you're like, I'm

456
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,760
not sure about these.

457
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,320
And you just look at them and go like, you were right.

458
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
The shoes are great.

459
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,920
And they're just like, thank you.

460
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,720
Just to like debrief a little bit, it would have been nice for either of you guys to say

461
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,440
something about my body while I was glistening up or said something like, wow, Griffin,

462
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,200
you can really pull off an A-frame tank top.

463
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,520
I think that you should try that look out more often.

464
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,240
And instead, I got what could be called either, you either ignored it or derided it.

465
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,520
And either way, it made my, you didn't freak my heart, you fucked it.

466
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,880
Gross.

467
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,160
So it's our 300th episode.

468
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:57,200
We wanted to do something special for it, by which we mean we wanted to bully the people

469
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,640
who have formerly been guest spurts on My Brother, My Brother and Me into saying how

470
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,880
the show, how being on the show has affected their lives.

471
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,320
Let's hear from some of those lucky individuals right now.

472
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,200
Hello, everybody.

473
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,800
It's Bill Corbett from Riff Trax and Mystery Science Theater here.

474
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:19,360
And I just wanted to tell you how much my life has gotten better since being a guest

475
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,720
on My Brother, My Brother and Me.

476
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,000
Oh, man.

477
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,680
You know, I did not expect this, but I'm just thinking clearer.

478
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,600
I'm feeling better.

479
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,520
I'm feeling vim and vigor.

480
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,120
I suddenly know how to play the oboe.

481
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,520
Where did that come from?

482
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,400
And I smell better.

483
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,880
I, you know, I've gotten remarks on how good I smell.

484
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,000
And before, you know, it was either neutral or those remarks went in the other direction.

485
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,440
I am embarrassed to say, but yeah, I mean, people have said that I smell like something

486
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:03,120
like some subtle combination of honeysuckle and citrus, and I'm loving it.

487
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,760
I don't know how those guys did it, but they did it.

488
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:13,280
And I suspect that that was sort of their, their mojo going on underneath while I was

489
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:20,000
chatting about things that did not seem to be relevant to my bodily funk or lack thereof.

490
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,240
My bodily scent now.

491
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,200
I'm on top of the world.

492
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,920
Thanks, guys.

493
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:33,520
I love My Brother, My Brother and Me and I'd be back to yammer with those guys anytime.

494
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,400
Thanks very much.

495
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,880
Bye.

496
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,720
Hey, my Bim Bam, it's Cameron Esposito.

497
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,200
I'm calling from my Uber helicopter, which I never would have been on had it not been

498
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,600
for my appearance on My Brother, My Brother and Me.

499
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,560
Before being on My Brother, My Brother and Me, I was just a struggling comic living in

500
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,320
a basement owned by a parent of mine.

501
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,160
Now I'm a major celebrity.

502
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,080
I live in the Hollywood sign and I go see Hamilton every day.

503
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,840
Thanks so much, my Bim Bam.

504
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,960
Yo, what's up, my Bim Bam?

505
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,960
It's Staging Screen's Lin-Manuel Miranda.

506
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,240
Before I started listening to my Bim Bam, I was a broke songwriter of some note.

507
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,840
I'd written one musical since then, since I started listening on a weekly basis.

508
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,720
I've since written Eat, Pray, Love and Signature of All Things.

509
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,640
And I'm doing really well.

510
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,560
Married to a Brazilian man.

511
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,520
He loves me very much.

512
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,680
Thank you very much, my Bim Bam.

513
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,720
You changed my life.

514
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,160
Stay cool, babies.

515
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,640
I'll see you on the appreciation page.

516
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,640
Since I appeared as a guest bird on My Brother, My Brother and Me, my life has opened up and

517
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,200
changed in so many incredible, creative ways.

518
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,200
I got a MacArthur Genius Grant and I wrote a highly successful Broadway play about our

519
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,160
founding fathers.

520
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:58,160
And I wrote it in the form of like a rap opera, which is incredible because until I was on

521
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,760
My Brother, My Brother and Me, I didn't even know anything about hip hop.

522
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,880
But it's almost like just talking to the brothers made me a master of that art form.

523
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,480
So I'm really grateful because I just can't even imagine where my career would be without

524
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:10,800
it.

525
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,120
My roommate and I recently moved into a new apartment and used the complex's hot tub

526
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,400
almost every night.

527
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,440
We had expected to meet some of our neighbors this way, but nobody else seems to be interested

528
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,880
in tubbing down.

529
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,280
How do we get people to join us in the Jacuz?

530
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,560
Tub with me in KC, people have Pavlovian responses to things.

531
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:38,320
You see a commercial for Bojangles and a new Bojangles just opened in Huntington and you

532
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,840
think, I have got to get the Bojangles right now.

533
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,480
I've got a bad case of the Bojangles, which sounds like a disorder for the craving of

534
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,000
it, but also the restaurant itself.

535
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,720
It actually sounds like some sort of leg disease.

536
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,080
Some sort of leg, yeah, something that you would get like Jake leg.

537
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,640
I came up too fast from scuba diving and now I've got Bojangles.

538
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,680
I've got Bojangles real bad in my knee joints.

539
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,440
All my angles are boged.

540
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,440
Did you guys see that they had to put up a sign, a traffic sign to direct the Bojangles

541
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,320
traffic in Huntington?

542
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:10,800
So great.

543
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,560
How is that not going to be in every Bojangles commercial ever from now?

544
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,160
This town's got a craving for some chalking.

545
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:26,000
I want to see a fucking Taco Bell quesalupa commercial where it's just a Taco Bell in

546
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,440
Huntington, West Virginia that has just been raised to the ground.

547
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,480
Just savaged.

548
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:40,560
But anyway, I think that the foolproof way to do this is every time I hear the song by

549
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:46,640
Ashkahn, Hot Tubin, I have to get in a hot, like I deeply, it's not a novelty record to

550
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,120
me.

551
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,520
It is like a religion, a siren song for that bubbly water.

552
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,680
Here's my concern with this question about your sperm count.

553
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,960
Yeah, you don't cook your goose.

554
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,400
I don't want to boil my boys.

555
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:07,120
I'm worried that there's nothing less inviting than being invited to a hot tub by stream.

556
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,320
Absolutely.

557
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,560
There's no invitation.

558
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,640
You should more quickly turn down.

559
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,480
I'm just picturing these roommates sitting in a hot tub in an empty courtyard.

560
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,480
Just like, anybody want to get in on this?

561
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,680
I've never, this is very puzzling.

562
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,240
It's a good point.

563
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,000
I've never been in a hot tub and thought, man, I'd love to get a few more ingredients

564
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,120
in this person's soup.

565
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,680
Yeah, I know some strangers drop in.

566
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,240
Yeah, I have a few people I don't know come and see me in this very vulnerable position.

567
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,400
You never get to know people faster than when you're boiled alive with them.

568
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,120
Yeah, well, there's also no good way to segue into, oh, you're going to join us in the hot

569
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,360
tub.

570
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:47,520
Cool.

571
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,320
You're my neighbor, right?

572
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,880
Cool.

573
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,120
I'm in apartment 23B.

574
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,720
Oh, cool.

575
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,520
That's good to hear.

576
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,800
Anyway, are you clean?

577
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,000
Hey, by the way, before you get in, I see a dip to toeing.

578
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Could you just retract that for a second?

579
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,400
And I'm going to run a quick panel on you.

580
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,760
Do you have a clean body?

581
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,800
Excellent.

582
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,280
Excellent.

583
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,080
Join me.

584
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,840
If a sane person sees other people in the hot tub, they have the same person response,

585
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,640
which is, well, that hot tub is in use.

586
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,240
It's currently occupied.

587
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,520
Do you see people peeking through the fence in trunks, just like staring at you longingly?

588
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,120
They're waiting for you to vacate.

589
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,800
That's why there's nothing worse than seeing one person in an eight person hot tub while

590
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,560
eight people are waiting to get in.

591
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:30,800
Yeah.

592
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,200
They're just like, one, two, three, you're done.

593
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,920
I'm literally-

594
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,320
What do you say?

595
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,720
Like, I'd love to- Hey, how are the bubbles tonight?

596
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,840
Would love to get in there with.

597
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,920
Let me just slip into the hot tub with you.

598
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,640
I'm trying to think, I'm trying to think of a honey pot you could build.

599
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,400
If you were in a hot tub and you knew, you had that moment where you saw somebody through

600
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
the fence wearing their trunkies, ready to get in.

601
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,080
I'm trying to think of a way that you could signal, hey, come on into this hot tub.

602
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,120
The water's just fine.

603
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,240
Without it also seeming like you're signaling like, get in this hot tub and let's fuck tonight.

604
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,560
Okay.

605
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,640
Well, then you disqualified what I was going to say with that second half, which was you

606
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,640
just spread your arms and smile.

607
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,400
But that doesn't work because it's definitely like, let's fuck.

608
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,960
How about a big frosty bucket of Bud Light Lime?

609
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,440
Oh, are you talking about fuck beer?

610
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,400
Because that's what that is when you have it next to a hot tub.

611
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,360
Come on in.

612
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,880
Let's get Randy.

613
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,680
What if you could pull the big bucket of Bud Light Lime out of the hot tub?

614
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,680
That's what I got.

615
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,800
Not in the hot Bud Light Lime.

616
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,680
That's the new thing that I'm working on.

617
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,560
Not only is it refreshing, it's good for a sore throat.

618
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,720
Dude, maybe you could take a hot tub in a full business suit.

619
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,400
Because that says three, like I'm looking to engage with other young professionals.

620
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:48,720
You got to have like a laptop or like one of those old like paper roll calculators to

621
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,880
make it look like you are not paying attention to them.

622
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,240
And like, if they get in the hot tub, it is not going to be a big fucking deal because

623
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,120
you're not going to like, you got to be, oh my God, this is it.

624
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,000
This is it.

625
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,400
What is a hot tub, but a hot water filled subway car?

626
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,200
You just got to treat it like a subway where it's like, I'm not going to engage you.

627
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,320
You're not going to engage me.

628
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,280
Just getting this hot water together and let's get to our destination, which is to say,

629
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,400
relaxation station.

630
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,600
But that would literally like, that defeats the whole purpose of this person saying they

631
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,640
want to meet new people.

632
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,400
Well, once they're in, you put the calculator away and you say, all right, let's start doing

633
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,040
this thing.

634
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,120
No, you get everybody in the subway, right?

635
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,680
You get everybody in the hot tub subway, the hot tub way.

636
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:32,160
And then you have a drum, a bucket drum band come in because that's the moment when everybody

637
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,880
on the subway connects with each other and makes eye contact.

638
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,400
And they're like, I also hate this.

639
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,000
Hey guys, my name's Derek.

640
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,240
I came to play your hot tub tonight.

641
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,120
Just asking for donations, whatever you feel comfortable giving.

642
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,680
And everyone at the hot tub way is like, oh, I also hate this.

643
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,640
I also hate this.

644
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,080
Hey guys, my name's Mark.

645
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,760
I hope you're enjoying the hot tub tonight.

646
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,280
Anyways, I do flips.

647
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,280
I do flips so that the whole family can enjoy.

648
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,960
And then what's that coming up from the drain?

649
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,080
It's a flash mob.

650
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,360
They've got a great skip planned.

651
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,160
And then you have to move away because you've accomplished your dreams and it's time to

652
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,440
move on to a bigger goal.

653
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,760
Our troop is called improv everywhere and that includes hot tub sewers, the secret sewer

654
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,920
that's reserved exclusively for hot tub water.

655
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,960
What if you had a roll of name tags next to the hot tub?

656
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,560
So when the person, like you kind of waved them down and then just said, hey, greetings.

657
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,840
Glad you could make it.

658
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,120
This is a mixer I planned.

659
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,040
Justin, take it a step further.

660
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,080
What?

661
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,360
You hire somebody with like a folding table outside the hot tub waiting for people to

662
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,800
come up so they can sign them in and say, who's next for the hot tub experience?

663
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,320
And that, that solves the other problem.

664
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,400
This is a 360 hot tub experience.

665
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,240
Put a big sign on the front that says mandatory hot tub mixer today.

666
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,880
Yeah.

667
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,920
But we also solve the other problem with that because you say, what's your name?

668
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,480
Denise.

669
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,200
Okay, Denise.

670
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,160
Let me just write that down.

671
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,960
Here's your name tag.

672
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,240
By the way, are you clean?

673
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,880
Are you clean?

674
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,160
You have to tell me.

675
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,480
Draw a little frowny face on there if you're dirty and a little smiley face on there if

676
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,040
you're clean.

677
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,800
We're talking a big game right now.

678
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,480
We're talking a big old game.

679
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,880
If you held up a bag or a briefcase with a hundred thousand American dollars in it,

680
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,880
I probably wouldn't get in a hot tub with you.

681
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,240
I'm saying there's nothing you could do.

682
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,160
Well, the money's wet for starters.

683
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,960
Somebody wants that.

684
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,680
Oh, Griffin, you've hit the nail on the head.

685
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,720
You have to act like you don't want them to get in the hot tub.

686
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,400
That's the only time anyone ever gets in a hot tub with me is when I'm like, I hope that

687
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,800
I keep this hot tub all to myself.

688
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,440
Oh, no, it's three middle aged people.

689
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,080
That's a good point.

690
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,800
I wonder when this question after sitting in the hot tub, are they just looking a little

691
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,600
too thirsty?

692
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,640
Are they maybe like a little wanting to get around too much?

693
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,760
Maybe you go the other way and just anytime you see a person just yell like, please, no,

694
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,400
please, no.

695
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,600
Stay away.

696
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,640
I'm dirty.

697
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,840
This is my water.

698
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,120
I would worry that maybe everyone in the apartment complex knows something you don't.

699
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,640
If you're the only people that ever use the hot tub, maybe they're like, that's where

700
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,080
all the raccoons pee.

701
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
Like, holy shit, Travis, yes.

702
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,640
You mean hepatitis canyon?

703
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,360
No, thank you.

704
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,240
I'd rather not.

705
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,680
Wait, you get in that water hole where all those people died that one time?

706
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,840
Chlamydia lagoon?

707
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,400
No, thank you.

708
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,680
No, thank you.

709
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,080
That's the but that's the hot tub time machine.

710
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,240
But the shitty one that takes you into the robot annihilated future.

711
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,280
You don't want to get in that one.

712
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,320
That's not a fun romp.

713
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,600
Well, neither were the movies.

714
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,120
Hey, the second one was dump.

715
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,840
This is my brother.

716
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,520
My brother and me started Justin Griffin and the only person who's seen both hot tub

717
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,560
time machine movies.

718
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,520
It was on a plane.

719
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:48,960
My brother, my brother and me is supported in part by Casper, an online retailer of

720
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,200
premium obsessively engineered mattresses for a fraction of the price.

721
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,240
We have a Casper in our guest room and it is incredibly comfortable.

722
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,560
I think at least one of you guys has slept on it, right?

723
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,480
I think both of us.

724
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,200
Both of us.

725
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,240
Probably at different points.

726
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,840
Yeah, it's a comfortable bed in there, right?

727
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,640
Why I've slept on mattresses all across this great land of ours, Justin.

728
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,080
Travis would know if he'd slept on a bed that I had previously slept on and that's

729
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,120
all I'm going to say about it.

730
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,560
Gross.

731
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,320
They got a risk free trial.

732
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,120
Slime time.

733
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,200
You can try sleeping or sliming on a Casper for 100 days with free delivery and painless

734
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,160
returns.

735
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,560
Mattresses are made in America and they're really, really well priced.

736
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:35,520
We're talking like 500 bucks for a twin mattress, 950 for a king like and that's

737
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,800
the top end 950.

738
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:42,960
It's to be nigh impossible to be in a mattress store and certainly not going to beat the

739
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,600
quality.

740
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,640
And you get to swamp them open in a really fun way.

741
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,040
Swamp?

742
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,520
Yeah.

743
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,160
Yeah, they come all sealed up in a box and then you open them and they unfold like, you

744
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,000
know, those little like plastic things used to drop in water and they got hot and foam

745
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,240
things unfolded from them in the form of a dragon.

746
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,640
That but a mattress.

747
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,800
Our listeners can get $50 towards any mattress by visiting Casper.com slash my brother and

748
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,520
using the promo code my brother.

749
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
Don't throw the mattresses into hot water.

750
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,080
Hey, listen, terms and conditions apply.

751
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,120
The beds are all haunted.

752
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,560
That's why they that's why they named it what they fucking named it.

753
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,880
They try to sneak that shit in and that's not even the fine print.

754
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,320
They put it in the big print and just hope that you don't even notice.

755
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:24,880
I love them.

756
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,600
They've been good to us.

757
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,560
They've been real good to us.

758
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,160
All the beds are haunted.

759
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,000
Casper.com slash my brother.

760
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,400
Got another sponsor here.

761
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,120
Maybe you've heard of them.

762
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,160
Harry's dot com.

763
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:39,440
They sent me a box with a razor and some gel in it and it gave me a gave me a smooth finish.

764
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,000
Should be called not Harry's dot com.

765
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,320
How good is that new razor handle?

766
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,680
It's so comfortable.

767
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,400
It's good as hell.

768
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,760
It's like holding a it's like holding a finely tuned sword.

769
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,200
Did I cut out?

770
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:53,920
Did you guys not?

771
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,800
I said more like not Harry's dot com.

772
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,080
Yeah, and it's a great point Travis and well made.

773
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,320
Griffin, tell me about Harry's.

774
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,560
Well, they supported us in part this week.

775
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,640
Listen, buying razors is the worst fucking thing ever because they put them in in little

776
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,040
Ocean's Eleven safes and you can't get in there.

777
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,320
But you can't get in there because each of the razors cost a hundred thousand dollars.

778
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,000
They cost they cost too much.

779
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,920
That's why two guys started Harry's dot com.

780
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,360
They sell high quality blades that provide a close comfortable shave for half the price

781
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,560
that you're used to.

782
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,080
So I know I said a hundred thousand dollars.

783
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,600
So that would mean these are fifty thousand dollars.

784
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,840
No, they're they're much, much cheaper than that.

785
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,000
These are German engineered five blade cartridges.

786
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,760
You get a close, comfy save.

787
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,920
You get you got a good quality razor.

788
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,280
You get a full refund if you're not happy and you get factory direct prices.

789
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,240
You cut out the middleman.

790
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,560
You say get the fuck out of here, CBS.

791
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,200
Get out of here, Norman Reedus.

792
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,480
What's the New York chain?

793
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,240
No, that was it.

794
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,600
If Norman Reedus tries to sell you some razors.

795
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,920
They ship don't buy from him, scruffy little goon.

796
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,320
They ship these razors right to your door.

797
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,600
You can get a Truman starter set.

798
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,040
It's a good option for new customers.

799
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,720
It's an amazing deal for just fifteen dollars.

800
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,360
You get the razor handle, get some moisturizing shave cream and three of Harry's five blade

801
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,960
German engineered razors.

802
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,200
You give all of our listeners five dollars off your first purchase at Harry's.

803
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,320
That's H A R R Y S dot com and use the promo code my brother.

804
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,800
All one word.

805
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,120
That's Harry's H A R R Y S dot com and use the code my brother.

806
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,160
All one word.

807
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,680
More like not Harry's.

808
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,720
God, Travis.

809
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,840
Cause like cause you have hair and then you shave it off.

810
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,440
Trav, read the personal message.

811
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,000
You got it.

812
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,600
This is to Molly Groupie and it's from Garrett Baird and the message is

813
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,200
Happy birthday, Molly.

814
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,000
You're an awesome cousin and as always, my favorite Facebook friend.

815
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,040
I hope you're enjoying your birthday in snowy Wisconsin.

816
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,960
I already know that I'm your favorite cousin, but I hope this really cements me further

817
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,160
into that status.

818
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,520
Much love, Garrett.

819
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,160
And Trav, what's the requested time frame on this birthday message?

820
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,640
That would be over two months ago, Justin.

821
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,080
Hey, happy birthday, Molly.

822
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,640
Sorry didn't- Garrett didn't get you nothing.

823
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,000
He's trying his best.

824
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,560
The beauty of this, Garrett, is not only have you submitted yourself as the favorite cousin,

825
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,160
you can now fuck up a couple times like by having your message read two months late,

826
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,000
perhaps or by- Totally bomb.

827
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,960
Yeah, just whatever.

828
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,320
Like you can get away with it now because not only did you get Molly a happy birthday

829
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,720
message, you timed it out perfectly so that it was on our special 300th episode.

830
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,880
Yeah, this is going to be such a big app.

831
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,480
I got a message to Jabba J from Maddie.

832
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,480
It says, Hey, my sweet Jabba J.

833
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,760
It's me, your wife.

834
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,480
We've been married for a year and it's great.

835
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,760
I love you so much.

836
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,040
Happy anniversary.

837
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,720
I'm writing this as you're cracking up over Glass Shark for the millionth time.

838
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,720
I think you love Glass Shark more than me.

839
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,000
Sorry this got weirdly confrontational at the end.

840
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,360
Justin just made that part up.

841
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,080
And oh, got this one pretty darn.

842
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,400
Wow, wow.

843
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,760
April 24th is the requested time frame on that.

844
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,840
So just about stuck the landing.

845
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,040
I want you to know that Jabba shouldn't feel bad.

846
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,520
I've listened to Glass Shark so many times.

847
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,800
I may be reaching up towards a million too.

848
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,440
You're not alone.

849
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,880
Remind me, what was that?

850
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,360
Which one?

851
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,200
It was the one where we talked about Scott Bakula.

852
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,160
Oh, okay, thank you.

853
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,960
Does that narrow it down?

854
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,020
Yeah.

855
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,520
When Scott Bakula swam down that pool and ate that gift.

856
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,240
Let's take people inside the show a little bit.

857
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,680
We got a lot of guest spurts on the show this week, which is very exciting for us.

858
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,760
There is one guest spurt that we have reached out to to try to book on our program that

859
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,760
their manager gave us a pass-a-rooney.

860
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,560
Just one strong pass.

861
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,400
Just a strong pass.

862
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,800
There is one human that we have.

863
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,600
We haven't reached out to that many people because I don't know.

864
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,080
There's not a lot of people that we think would be a great fit for this.

865
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,200
There's one person.

866
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,520
I'm not going to say who.

867
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,400
But let's just say it was a polite but hard no.

868
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,360
I think we've had a lot of people that we've reached out to who just didn't even bother

869
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,920
to respond.

870
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,080
This is the first one to just make sure you guys know, go fuck yourselves.

871
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,960
It just said at the end, it just said, oh, no.

872
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,200
And you know, sometimes you get a response from someone's rep and you think, oh, I bet

873
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,280
that even didn't make it across the person's desk.

874
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,920
I bet the rep just said no offhand.

875
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,000
I would like to think that this was a solid no from the person themselves.

876
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,680
Yeah, I think it's a personal.

877
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,320
I like to think this came directly from the desk of...

878
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,640
Let's say, bot-racula.

879
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,800
Let's say, let's say got-dracula.

880
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,480
OK, let's say Scott-bacula Jr.

881
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,760
But maybe let's say bot-scacula.

882
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,840
Like, I just want to say, though, for the record, in case he's listening to this, because

883
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,960
maybe he was just too nervous to come on the show because he's such a big fan, I want to

884
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,840
say it did not disappoint me in the slightest.

885
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,160
I would have been disappointed if he'd agreed to it.

886
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,760
Yeah, you know what?

887
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,840
He's just, he's like big fish.

888
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,600
You know, it's going to take me a while to reel in Scott-bacula, but when I do, there's

889
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,080
like an intense respect.

890
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,640
Then you'll die.

891
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,520
That'll be the last day of your life.

892
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,080
You'll die and then he'll carry you out into the lake.

893
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,720
Yeah, Scott-bacula won't even go see Hamilton because he's worried Lynn will try to get

894
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,520
him to talk to him.

895
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,020
Yeah.

896
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,840
New to Maximum Fun, the Beef and Dairy Network podcast, the number one podcast for those

902
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,720
Beef out.

903
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,560
Here's one from Level 9000.

904
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,840
Yeah, Drew Drew, Drew Davenport.

905
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,400
Thank you, Drew.

906
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,320
It's by Yajuru Answers user, The Mystic, who asks.

907
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,000
What do pilots dream about?

908
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,520
Fucking oh man, I didn't even read this.

909
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:28,400
The top answer from livergirl98 is you would have to ask pilots.

910
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,680
That's fucking great, yeah.

911
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,640
You went to Yajuru Answers, not pilot answers.

912
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,720
What do you guys think pilots dream about?

913
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,840
Well, that's the thing, right?

914
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,440
They get to experience the majesty of flight.

915
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,480
Sorry, can you say that word again?

916
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,160
Yeah, I added like an extra like an umlaut syllable to it.

917
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,480
There was a U in there somewhere.

918
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,800
They get to experience the magic of flying.

919
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,960
You were transferred to Grey Gardens for a second.

920
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,760
They get to experience the magic of flout.

921
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,120
Fly it, mother.

922
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,760
Fly it.

923
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,800
Of floutus.

924
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,120
They dream about like not being in the air and they're like, I'm walking.

925
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,720
That would probably be a wonderful break for them.

926
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,560
Yeah, because you know what I bet?

927
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,960
I get nervous when I drive like on the freeway and I'm going like 60 miles an hour.

928
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,960
I bet like the whole time you're flying a plane, it's nonstop terrifying.

929
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,560
You think?

930
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:28,880
You're probably just tense the whole time because like you know like you're defying gravity.

931
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,040
You're going against everything that is right and natural.

932
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,680
Is that outside the window?

933
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,480
Yeah, it's David Copperfield.

934
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,200
It's David Copperfield.

935
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,080
There he goes again.

936
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,160
There goes my hero.

937
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:40,720
Up to space.

938
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,000
Oh shit, he's not coming down this-

939
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,560
Oh fuck.

940
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,160
Breaker breaker.

941
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,360
Just saw David Copperfield die.

942
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,600
Feeling pretty upset about it.

943
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,480
This is now a truck.

944
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,720
Being a pilot is really an abomination.

945
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,200
Yeah, yeah.

946
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,080
Maybe they just dream of one day being freed from their flight to prison.

947
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,600
What do you mean?

948
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,280
Like they don't have to fly anymore.

949
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,320
They're tired of breaking the laws of man.

950
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,440
Yeah, but it's also like once you've done it, it's so addictive.

951
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,040
The power of rising above the pole.

952
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,960
You're trapped by this big blue bastard and you're just being drawn back to Earth,

953
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,680
but then escaping Earth, but then having to return.

954
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,480
That struggle.

955
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,120
That struggle.

956
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:26,240
That struggle of being free for one moment and knowing you have to return and knowing

957
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,440
that nothing in life will ever please you the way that that moment of breaking the grasp

958
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,200
of this planetary asshole.

959
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,560
The hardest part of being a pilot isn't flying the plane.

960
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,520
It's hiding your utter delight and it all going smoothly and landing safely.

961
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,440
Like you want to hop out and just kiss the ground and rejoice,

962
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,040
but you don't want the passengers to see that.

963
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,560
You don't want to get on the horn and just be like,

964
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,480
hey everybody, really glad that went well.

965
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,640
Can you believe that shit?

966
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,200
Every pilot after they get off a plane, if you actually hang,

967
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,400
everybody gets off the plane as quick as they possibly can because people are monsters.

968
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,280
If you hung out for like a second and you thank the pilot because he just defied the

969
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,560
laws of gravity, you would hear every pilot when they're done flying,

970
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,480
they always say like, never again.

971
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:15,920
That was, I swear to God, I say it every time, that was the last time that was so dangerous.

972
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,200
There's no way.

973
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
I didn't think I'd be able to pull it off that time.

974
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:19,920
I'm not going to lie.

975
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,400
Like I just look, I looked down and suddenly it was like,

976
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,360
I couldn't remember what I was supposed to do.

977
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,680
You know, it was like, there's no way this goes well.

978
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,880
Every time if you're a pilot in DC and you ask people,

979
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,680
so where are you flying to?

980
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,120
They say, New York.

981
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,880
Are you fucking shit?

982
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,840
Are you kidding me?

983
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,480
Seriously, you're going to go up there to get there?

984
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:39,840
Seriously?

985
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,480
Just walk.

986
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,760
Every time a pilot gets told that their flight's going like over the ocean,

987
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,720
they're just like, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

988
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,400
What am I supposed to do when it goes wrong?

989
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,640
We're just like, we're just like chomping boats flavor right now.

990
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,600
That's their game.

991
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,120
We do the sky, they do the sea.

992
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,480
That's always the weirdest part of the in-flight announcement when the pilot tries to talk

993
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,040
everyone into getting off the plane and getting on a cruise ship.

994
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,120
Wouldn't you guys rather?

995
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,600
They have like casinos and like bars and stuff.

996
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,720
That sounds way more fun.

997
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,400
The real answer to this question is it depends on which pilot you're talking about.

998
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,960
Okay, so if you're the co-pilot, you go to sleep every night and dream of one day

999
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,920
just getting that big chair.

1000
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,680
Killing the pilot.

1001
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,520
Killing the pilot and getting that big chair where you finally get to take control.

1002
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,480
If you're a pilot, then you dream of becoming the super pilot,

1003
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,240
the pilot that rides on the top of the plane and is actually steering the whole thing.

1004
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,680
The one that Teen Wolf's up there.

1005
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,480
You wanna get up there, grab the reins, and bring this baby on home.

1006
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,560
A pilot, co-pilot, and super pilot.

1007
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,400
And the super pilot just Teen Wolf's on top the entire flight.

1008
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,440
The super pilot doesn't sleep.

1009
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,280
Doesn't sleep, doesn't need to dream high on cocaine all day.

1010
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,240
No, he just leads the pack of horses that power the plane.

1011
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,360
Do you guys think that pilots, they dream about all this,

1012
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,440
like the sexy shaped clouds that they saw that day?

1013
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,600
I saw one, swear to God, Jeff, looked just like a boob.

1014
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,960
Saw one, Jeff, you're not gonna believe this shit, dude.

1015
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,440
Round.

1016
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,480
Check this shit out, dude.

1017
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,640
Dude, check it out.

1018
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,400
It was round, but then there was like a little hole in the middle of it.

1019
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,400
Jeff, I swear to God, dude.

1020
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,720
Dylan, Dylan, wake up.

1021
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:21,840
Wake up.

1022
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,640
Get your camera.

1023
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,000
Fuck that cloud.

1024
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,640
Dude, two nimbuses came together against a Cirrus.

1025
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,560
A huge hog, dude.

1026
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,120
I fucking like lost my nut, bro.

1027
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,880
Bro, it looked like a huge hog, and I loved it.

1028
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,280
Dude, I saw this huge old hog cloud,

1029
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,840
and you know I'm gonna be dreaming about that tonight.

1030
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,720
They don't teach you that stuff in aviation college.

1031
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,640
Wish I was the fucking super pilot so I could have just like gone face first.

1032
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,200
Just did a swan dive into that big old beautiful cumulo hog.

1033
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,600
If I was a pilot, I would tell everybody my Instagram username

1034
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,880
when the flight took off, and then I'd just keep hitting them with pics the whole flight.

1035
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,680
Hey, got a new one up.

1036
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,120
Let's get those likes going.

1037
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,480
Let's get the faves.

1038
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,280
Here's a question.

1039
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,240
I take a figure drawing class in college where we have to draw nude models.

1040
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,480
Drawing the model no longer feels awkward, with the exception of one model in particular.

1041
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,560
My friends and I have noticed that rather than staring at the wall or an inanimate object,

1042
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,000
she stares directly at each of our eyes as we draw her.

1043
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,680
If we try to look away or break eye contact,

1044
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,120
she'll continue to stare at each of us one by one,

1045
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,240
with her lips upturned in a sort of strange smile.

1046
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,160
Brothers, how can we make these three hour long class periods less uncomfortable?

1047
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,840
That's from nude drawing in New York.

1048
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,800
Holy shit.

1049
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,400
This is exactly what I would do if I were in this scenario.

1050
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,880
And I would just keep shouting,

1051
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,000
Gaze upon me!

1052
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,560
Drink it in!

1053
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:55,120
Yes, this is the human body, and it is all supposed to look like this.

1054
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,560
None of this is weird.

1055
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,720
Your eyes may be tempted to merely flip past my dark materials,

1056
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,320
but please stay.

1057
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,920
Let them feast.

1058
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,040
Let them rip past.

1059
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,240
Fill your corneas with my beauty.

1060
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,560
Drink deep from my fleshy torso.

1061
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,920
We're in this together.

1062
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,680
This moment, you and I, paint, paint like the wind.

1063
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,640
Paint like the wind.

1064
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,440
Two flesh becomes one?

1065
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,240
I love it.

1066
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,320
Millions of years of evolution have led to this moment.

1067
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,360
Let them feast.

1068
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:33,280
My body shall forever be the standard by which you judge beauty.

1069
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,520
Don't let this moment pass by, Derek.

1070
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,720
I would definitely, definitely memorize a class list.

1071
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,400
Oh, for sure.

1072
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,880
Which one of you motherfuckers is Brandon?

1073
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,400
I hear you on the spelling bee in third grade.

1074
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,240
Are you proud of that now?

1075
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,040
Holy shit.

1076
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,640
I just got a fucking great idea.

1077
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,040
You're in a life drawing class, right?

1078
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,880
You're the life drawing person is nude, nude, totally nude

1079
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,720
up in front of the class.

1080
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,480
Okay, great.

1081
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,000
What's the art teacher doing?

1082
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,800
Nothing, right?

1083
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,960
They're saying like, draw this motherfucker.

1084
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,560
I don't know why they don't have clothes on.

1085
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,060
Sorry.

1086
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,360
Do a great job drawing them.

1087
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:18,000
Why don't you make the nude model a teacher?

1088
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,160
But not the art teacher, because they're not gonna have anything to add.

1089
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,120
What if you could go to your nude drawing class

1090
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,360
and that nude drawing person was also teaching you anthropology?

1091
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,080
Oh, double, double learning.

1092
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,040
Double learning.

1093
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,880
So you're like drawing them nude.

1094
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,720
And like when you hear key stuff, you already have a paper and a pen there.

1095
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,360
You're just like taking notes around their figure.

1096
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,600
I like the idea better of the art teacher doing it,

1097
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,440
because then they can be like, now, Brandon, I've scoped out your work.

1098
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,360
And I notice that you tend to skimp out on the butt meat.

1099
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,560
Don't, Brandon.

1100
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,760
It's juicy, Brandon.

1101
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,400
Don't act like it.

1102
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,160
Brandon, look where I'm pointing.

1103
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:58,720
I'm gonna move.

1104
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,360
Guys, everybody stop drawing for a second.

1105
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,560
Brandon, look where I'm pointing.

1106
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,160
Draw that butt.

1107
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,560
Good.

1108
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:04,880
All right.

1109
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,240
I'm back in position.

1110
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,200
I bet it'd be a real power move if the art teacher was walking around

1111
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,680
looking at everyone's drawings of you drawing, you know,

1112
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,040
of everyone drawing the nude model.

1113
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,920
But when they got to yours, you had drawn what you imagined

1114
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,360
the art teacher looks like nude.

1115
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,320
I don't think that's appropriate behavior.

1116
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:26,080
And then you just like look at them and go, I don't know what happened.

1117
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,040
I started with them.

1118
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,160
And then one thing led to another.

1119
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:28,560
You know what?

1120
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,640
I'm going to drop out of college now.

1121
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,440
Now, Brandon, I see that you haven't painted anything

1122
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,560
as much as you have pencil traced Spider-Man from one of your comic books.

1123
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,520
And let me just say, you got it perfect.

1124
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,000
A+.

1125
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,280
You got the goods.

1126
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,320
You got the goods.

1127
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,600
And I do too.

1128
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:46,560
Whip.

1129
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:48,640
That's right.

1130
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,440
You knew all along.

1131
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,960
I really am the real Spider-Man.

1132
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,800
All those movies you see up there, you think those are works of fun fantasy fiction.

1133
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,120
Nope.

1134
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,400
It's me, your art teacher.

1135
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,760
Mrs. Spider-Man.

1136
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,880
Mrs. Naked art teacher, Mrs. Spider-Man.

1137
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,080
I know you would think it should be Spider-

1138
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:04,480
Whatever.

1139
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,840
Don't worry about it.

1140
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,720
This ointment that I rubbed all over my body for a joke that I did 50 minutes ago

1141
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,080
is like irritating.

1142
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,600
My skin feels bad on me.

1143
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,280
Yeah.

1144
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,400
You don't like it, huh?

1145
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,120
I don't like how-

1146
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,960
I thought it would make me feel good.

1147
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,280
The opposite is true.

1148
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,640
Should we do one more Yahoo?

1149
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,120
Yes.

1150
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,360
Okay.

1151
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,040
Let's do a quick one.

1152
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,160
Yes.

1153
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,240
I also have four closers this week.

1154
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,000
I thought this episode 300, let's just have a little pinata there at the end.

1155
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,360
This first one was sent in by Aaron Keys.

1156
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,240
Thank you, Aaron.

1157
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,160
It's by an anonymous Yahoo user.

1158
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,880
Uh, this anonymous user asks, I am looking for hype, clean songs.

1159
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,400
I need an intro song for an event I do with middle schoolers.

1160
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,360
Songs like Dessert, Awesome, by the Black Eyed Peas, The Time Is Now.

1161
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:54,720
They have to be clean songs, not even clean versions of songs, like truly cleans songs.

1162
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,960
Also trying to use current relevant songs.

1163
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,560
So staying away from rock songs, like Seven Nation Army or Crazy Train.

1164
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,640
All suggestions are appreciated.

1165
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,680
Doesn't sound like it.

1166
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,560
Doesn't sound like it.

1167
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,680
Doesn't sound like you appreciate-

1168
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,440
Because I responded to this Crazy Train.

1169
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,720
And you say, get the fuck out of here.

1170
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,600
Get the fuck out of here.

1171
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,880
I told you no.

1172
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,960
What about just the entirety of Wilinium?

1173
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,280
Any- Anything from the will.

1174
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,040
The will you.

1175
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,120
Is it just language?

1176
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,120
Language or I think adult concepts.

1177
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,040
Like a lot of Sugar Ray's music.

1178
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,560
You hear it and you go, this is fun music.

1179
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,000
I'd love to share this with my family.

1180
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,080
But then you hear it and there's adult situations in there.

1181
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,240
Like a one night stand, that's a sex thing.

1182
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,240
Yeah, and the halo I believe is a condom.

1183
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,840
You think it's a condom?

1184
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,200
And that's a prophylactic.

1185
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,560
Why would you have a condom hanging from the corner of your four post bed?

1186
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,400
That's not where the condoms go.

1187
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,760
It sounds like you had a really wild night.

1188
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,480
But I certainly don't want to sing about it in front of my middle school class.

1189
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,440
That's the problem, Griffin.

1190
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,720
You got to get to the bottom of the true meaning of all the songs.

1191
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,320
Maybe there's no wordy dirts.

1192
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:57,200
But maybe they say like, you know, I'm riding on a dragon.

1193
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,200
And you're like, oh, that's heroin, I think.

1194
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,080
Or cocaine.

1195
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,040
Well, and you also have to keep in mind the intent of the artist,

1196
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,480
because you listen to any Sugar Ray music.

1197
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,400
And even the cleanest Sugar Ray songs,

1198
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,400
hard for me to like enjoy the subject matter of it,

1199
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,960
because I know that that day that that song was recorded,

1200
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,560
Mark McGrath probably punched a kid.

1201
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,320
Probably punched a child.

1202
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,880
And it's like, I don't know if I can feel okay about that.

1203
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,920
And this is a fact.

1204
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,800
Every Sugar Ray song is about masturbation.

1205
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,760
Go back and listen.

1206
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,960
I just want to fly, yeah.

1207
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,160
In the rap part, maybe you listen to the chorus

1208
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,000
and you don't listen to the rapping going on behind it.

1209
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,080
But the guy's just like, jerking off all night.

1210
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,720
Yep.

1211
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,320
You know, have you ever heard the phrase,

1212
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,520
I'm going to go Sugar my Ray?

1213
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:38,880
That's why.

1214
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,120
I'm going to go McGrath and my Mark.

1215
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,440
Justin, a clean hype song for you?

1216
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,720
Just something by Raffi, I guess.

1217
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,120
One of the-

1218
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,880
The baby blue gives me fucking pumped, dog.

1219
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,480
Like the hard ones, you know what I mean?

1220
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,440
He's like, especially if I was in Canada,

1221
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,200
if he just like ripped into like,

1222
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,520
if I could get Raffi to do a heavy metal version of C-A-N-A-D-A,

1223
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,200
like I would, I think that that would really get me like ripe

1224
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,080
before battle.

1225
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:06,800
Yeah, man.

1226
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,920
For going into battle.

1227
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,120
What if he did a song called Adult Beluga,

1228
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,000
but it was an all curse word version of Baby Beluga,

1229
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,680
where every, I don't just mean you drop some curses in there.

1230
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,200
I'm saying you replace every noun, every verb,

1231
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,960
every conjunction, and then the one time he says fuck

1232
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,400
in the song Baby Beluga,

1233
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,480
you would just switch that out with another curse word.

1234
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,160
Yeah, you wouldn't switch that one.

1235
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,080
You don't want to mess with the artist's intent too much.

1236
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,920
He definitely meant to say fuck at that one part.

1237
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,760
This big fucking whale, Baby Beluga.

1238
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,600
Can you believe this shit, Baby Beluga?

1239
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,080
It's as big as shit, but it starts little,

1240
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,360
but it's still big.

1241
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,400
I'm just saying comparatively fuck.

1242
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,760
That's two curse words, Travis.

1243
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,480
We explicitly said there's only one curse word.

1244
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,280
There's only one secret curse word.

1245
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,440
Aw, Dick, look at all that plankton.

1246
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,560
He's going to eat it all up.

1247
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,600
We're almost the end of our show,

1248
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,480
but before we close, we have just a few more former guest

1249
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,320
spurts talking about how our show has changed their life.

1250
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,240
So let's hear from now.

1251
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,400
Greetings, brothers and listeners to Brothers,

1252
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,640
and I'm talking about specific brothers.

1253
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,160
Travis, Justin, Griffin, my brothers,

1254
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,120
my brothers and them.

1255
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,160
This is John Hodgman of the Judge John Hodgman podcast

1256
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,720
and once, and I dare hope, future guest pert

1257
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,920
on the My Brother, My Brother and Me podcast.

1258
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,720
Appearing on My Brother, My Brother and Me

1259
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,920
was very important to me because it reminded me

1260
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,200
that I am an only child and I have no brothers

1261
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,080
and am thus incredibly sad.

1262
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:56,320
Sad and wiser still to have bathed in their wisdom.

1263
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:04,720
Also, via them, I managed to meet Lin-Manuel Miranda

1264
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,800
of Hamilton fame and My Brother, My Brothers and Me's fame.

1265
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,080
And that has been a great delight in my life.

1266
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,840
And the confluence of meeting all those brothers

1267
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:23,120
and that one, Lin, inspired me in my new life's work,

1268
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,240
My Brothers, My Brothers and Me, a rap musical,

1269
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,920
which I've already copywritten in Singapore

1270
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,640
so no one can stop me.

1271
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,400
Thanks, guys, for giving me a purpose in life.

1272
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,640
Hey, this is Dan Savage from the Savage Lovecast

1273
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,600
and I just wanna offer my congratulations to everybody,

1274
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,160
to all the brothers at My Brother, My Brother and Me

1275
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,200
on the occasion of your 300th episode.

1276
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,560
And I wanna once again thank you guys

1277
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,520
for having me on your show as a guest

1278
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,600
because my career was really going nowhere

1279
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,800
until that moment.

1280
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,560
Thank you, My Brother, My Brother and Me

1281
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,240
for all you've done for me.

1282
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,120
Hey, this is John Roderick of Seattle's

1283
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,640
The Long Winters Band.

1284
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,840
You know, obviously, to those of you

1285
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:11,200
who are My Brother, My Brother and Me fans,

1286
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,200
the guys a long time ago wrote me

1287
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,680
kinda out of the blue and asked if they could use my song,

1288
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,600
It's a Departure, as the theme song for the podcast.

1289
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,840
And at the time, I had never heard of these ding-a-lings

1290
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,880
and I was like, yeah, okay, kids,

1291
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,040
you can use my song as the theme to your podcast.

1292
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,880
I hope it goes well for you.

1293
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,880
I hope you make it past five episodes.

1294
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,360
Good luck, Godspeed.

1295
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:41,120
And of course, history played out in such a way

1296
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,840
that it was a successful podcast

1297
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,880
and it introduced a lot of people to my music

1298
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,880
and over time, I've grown to be friends

1299
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,520
with the McElroy brothers,

1300
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:58,080
who are lovely, lovely, lovely people.

1301
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,600
Their whole extended family,

1302
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,880
which frankly, sort of roams the earth

1303
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,480
in a way that's vaguely culty, honestly,

1304
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,680
when you see them all together.

1305
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,920
You get that kind of strange feeling

1306
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,080
that it's maybe like one of those hippie families

1307
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,120
that travels around in a old converted school bus

1308
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,840
and I don't know, maybe has some strange

1309
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,240
unorthodox practices, but nonetheless,

1310
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,800
and in fact, even, let me say,

1311
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,280
let me say that that has influenced me as well

1312
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,480
because it made me realize

1313
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,760
that I wanted to be kind of part of a weird hippie cult,

1314
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,440
but I don't have two other brothers.

1315
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,280
So I've started to have to manufacture that in my own life,

1316
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,640
but that's beside the point.

1317
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:47,600
What I want to say is that my brother and me

1318
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:51,440
and the entire, again, weird cult of Max Fun Con

1319
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,760
or the Maximum Fun Network,

1320
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,280
I'm really getting kind of lost here,

1321
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,240
again, because frankly, I'm not sure what they do,

1322
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,440
I've never listened to their podcast,

1323
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,280
but they have been, they've been very influential on me,

1324
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,840
on my career, and I know that a lot of you

1325
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:14,640
have discovered my music as a result of listening to it

1326
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,080
repeatedly over and over and listening to the brothers

1327
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,360
extol my virtues and sing my praises to you.

1328
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,360
I can't think of a more generous group

1329
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,480
of weird West Virginia mountain people,

1330
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,280
and so I would like to thank them and congratulate them

1331
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,040
on their 40 years of service to the podcasting industry.

1332
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,600
Boy, that's all I have to say, except that you should all,

1333
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,560
also listen to my podcast, Roderick on the Line.

1334
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,400
I don't know why you don't already,

1335
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,280
I'm kind of astonished because I feel like my podcast

1336
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,840
should be as big as my brother and me.

1337
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,920
I don't have the two other brothers, maybe that's why.

1338
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:58,160
But so with that, I love you guys, good job,

1339
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,200
thanks for continuing to make me relevant,

1340
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,240
even as I decline into late middle age.

1341
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,880
And good luck, Godspeed, cheers.

1342
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,160
Thank you all, we're at the end of our program now,

1343
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:14,320
episode 300, and I just want to take a moment

1344
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,840
to say a very sincere thank you.

1345
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,680
We've been at this for six years,

1346
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,360
if you can believe that shit,

1347
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,280
and a lot of people told us that this would never work.

1348
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,280
A lot of people try to stand in our way

1349
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,000
and try to mess our show up and like just,

1350
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,080
and like just mess everything up and ruin it for us,

1351
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,040
and they never did because of you fine people listening.

1352
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,760
It's really meant the world to us,

1353
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,280
as a show that started as an excuse for us

1354
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,520
to just like talk to each other more

1355
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,280
because we had to move to separate places.

1356
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,520
It has become kind of an extended family for me,

1357
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:54,320
and I feel really lucky to have you all here

1358
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,640
week in and week out, and even for the bad ones,

1359
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,760
you still find something to like about them,

1360
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,520
and I've always really appreciated that.

1361
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,640
We quite sincerely would not be where we are

1362
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,680
if it weren't for you.

1363
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,520
I mean, word of mouth and you guys liking the show

1364
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,080
and telling people to listen and share it

1365
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,360
has been the most powerful force driving this show,

1366
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:21,920
and I go through the emails every week,

1367
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,200
and I see on Twitter people talking about

1368
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,960
loving the show and liking the show,

1369
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,800
and it means the world to me.

1370
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,400
I put out the call for people to send in

1371
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,200
what's changed in their lives

1372
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,200
since listening to my brother and my brother and me,

1373
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,240
and I got like over 150 responses.

1374
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,440
I edited down a thing that you'll hear later on

1375
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,560
at the end of the show, but I was touched.

1376
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:51,040
Like literally, I teared up just at the response

1377
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,960
and everybody with everything,

1378
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,080
all the nice things you guys said, it meant a lot to me.

1379
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,800
I wasn't able to put all of them in

1380
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:02,480
because I ended up with like a half hour's worth of audio.

1381
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,240
And this has been maybe our most masturbatory episode,

1382
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,880
but that seemed a little, like we don't want to finish.

1383
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,760
You know what I mean?

1384
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,480
Maybe as a thank you, a genuine thank you

1385
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,080
for these people who have changed our lives,

1386
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,920
maybe fewer jerk off jokes.

1387
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,000
We won't talk about the tantric masturbation

1388
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,760
that is 300 episodes.

1389
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:22,720
Yeah, fantastic.

1390
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,360
Yeah, no, seriously, you've changed our lives.

1391
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,640
Thank you, thank you.

1392
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,080
And I will eventually put out maybe like a YouTube video

1393
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,120
or a special audio thing of all the responses I got

1394
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:33,920
because they were all so great.

1395
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,600
I want everyone to be able to hear all of them.

1396
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,520
And thank you to our guest spurts who sounded off.

1397
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,280
We had Lin-Manuel Miranda, we got John Hodgman,

1398
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,320
Elizabeth Gilbert, John Roderick, Dan Savage,

1399
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,560
Cameron Esposito, Bill Corbett.

1400
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,880
We also want to say thank you to Max Fun.

1401
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,800
We joined Max Fun on what, episode 32?

1402
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,000
Yeah, like 268 episodes ago.

1403
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,840
And we would not be where we are if it weren't for Max Fun.

1404
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,320
And we have so many shows on Max Fun now.

1405
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,800
Thank you to Max Fun.

1406
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:10,240
They just added a new show that I am a huge fan of already

1407
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,600
called the Beef and Dairy Network.

1408
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,120
Oh, God, it's so good.

1409
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,200
Listen to episode eight, it'll blow your mind.

1410
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,720
It's my favorite episode.

1411
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,760
I feel like I've learned a lot

1412
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,520
about how cheese and steak get made.

1413
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,640
It's so good, you guys.

1414
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,320
It's a very short show too, which I love.

1415
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,680
Yeah, and it's funny and weird and it's great.

1416
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,800
If you like this show, you can check out

1417

The contact info is there.

1421

1423
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,920
Thanks to John Roderick and The Long Winters

1424
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,640
for the use of our theme song.

1425
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,640
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1426
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,640
I think we're gonna keep it going through volume two,

1427
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,440
just like the fan reaction has been so great.

1428
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,840
So let's keep that tune rocking

1429
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,280
and you can hear it on that album,

1430
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,120
Putting the Days to Bed, go buy it and listen to it.

1431
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,800
Let's wrap this thing up.

1432
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,960
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1433
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,200
Here's a salvo of final yahoos

1434
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,840
because I found four really good final yahoos

1435
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,080
and I didn't want to just trash three of them.

1436
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,720
And stick around afterwards for the whole

1437
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,280
thanks NBNBAM memories thing.

1438
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,520
This one was sent in by Drew Davenport.

1439
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,160
Thank you, Drew.

1440
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,240
It's by yadrewanswersuseranonymous who asks,

1441
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,520
do members of Linkin Park smoke marijuana?

1442
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,880
Drew sent this one in too.

1443
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:19,440
Thank you, Drew.

1444
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,200
It's by yahooanswersuserkurth who says,

1445
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,920
do you think Winona Ryder is bad?

1446
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:27,760
Brooks Oglesby sent this one in.

1447
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,320
Thank you, Brooks.

1448
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,120
It's by yahooanswersusererickkartman who says,

1449
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:35,280
do you think the KFC in heaven will have a bigger menu?

1450
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,600
Final one was sent in by ridinghigh, Zoe Kinski.

1451
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,080
Thank you, Zoe.

1452
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,400
It's by yahooanswersuserkurth who asks,

1453
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,680
can I hire someone to do vape tricks

1454
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,200
at my son's birthday party?

1455
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:57,680
My name is Justin McElroy.

1456
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,880
I'm still Justin McElroy.

1457
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:01,920
I'm Travis McElroy.

1458
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,200
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1459
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,560
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1460
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:19,920
Kiss your dad, squirt on the lips.

1461
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,920
Maximumfun.org.

1462
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,960
Comedy and culture.

1463
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,000
Artist-owned.

1464
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,280
Listener-supported.

1465
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,120
Since I started listening to music,

1466
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,120
I've been listening to music for a long time.

1467
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:31,120
I've been listening to music for a long time.

1468
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,120
I've been listening to music for a long time.

1469
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,840
Since I started listening to my brother, my brother and me.

1470
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,960
Since I started listening.

1471
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,400
Since I started listening.

1472
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,000
Since I started listening.

1473
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:40,960
Since I've started listening.

1474
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,080
Since I started listening.

1475
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:45,120
Since I started listening to my brother, my brother and me.

1476
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:49,280
My commute has gone from miserable to ooh mommy.

1477
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,760
Sales for my haunted doll business have been great.

1478
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,160
I've come to appreciate the F-bomb

1479
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:58,400
and those who use it liberally with relish, style and panache.

1480
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:05,840
I started to figure out that I was very weird in very different ways.

1481
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,600
I laugh a hell of a lot more.

1482
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:11,520
I've discovered I'm not the only one that asks random questions to themselves.

1483
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,600
Things that, if you ever asked anyone else,

1484
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,360
they'd wonder if you've been drinking all day.

1485
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,640
I've discovered the beauty of ASMR.

1486
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,920
I'm at the love of my life.

1487
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,000
We got engaged, we got married,

1488
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,640
and we even drove round trip from Nebraska to Minneapolis

1489
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:28,320
to listen to three goofballs from West Virginia give hilariously bad advice.

1490
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,480
I've started calling my own brothers more.

1491
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,480
We live very different lives in different parts of our country

1492
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,480
and it's kind of hard to keep in contact.

1493
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:41,360
That wasn't really funny, but I hope my German accent makes it funny.

1494
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,720
I can no longer tell my students great job

1495
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,560
without saying it like that or just busting out laughing.

1496
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,960
I now refer to everything in my life as boys.

1497
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,680
I saw a fish a few days ago and I thought, oh, that's a wet boy.

1498
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,320
That's not right, but I love it.

1499
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:00,480
I've learned to use jelly as a tool to climb my way up the social ladder.

1500
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,920
To quote Archimedes,

1501
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,360
give me jelly in a place to stand and I will move the world.

1502
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:09,120
I got my master's degree from college, not university.

1503
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,240
This is America.

1504
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,760
I started saying things like my dude and fish lifters a lot.

1505
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,760
I've achieved notoriety beyond my mildest dreams.

1506
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,960
I make my girlfriend laugh a lot more by quoting the show,

1507
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,000
mostly when I say, ooh, mommy.

1508
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,400
People have stopped sitting next to me on the subway.

1509
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,680
I've graduated high school.

1510
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,440
I broke a Guinness world record.

1511
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,960
I won a national championship.

1512
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,080
I'm halfway done college, and most importantly, I've grown a mustache.

1513
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,440
My nine and seven-year-old daughters have learned words like fuck,

1514
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,520
shit, jizz, dick, hog, and of course, hachi-machi.

1515
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,000
Hey, McElroys, it's your old pal Ira.

1516
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,200
Thanks to MBMB AM, whenever I introduce myself to a stranger as Ira Ray,

1517
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,000
there's a pretty good chance that they'll immediately respond with,

1518
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,400
are you Ira Ray, which wouldn't make any sense in any world other than this one.

1519
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,120
So thanks.

1520
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,800
My housemate Bob Peterson upgraded from a one-horsepower

1521
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:04,960
KitchenAid standing mixer to a 1.5-horsepower KitchenAid standing mixer.

1522
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:10,080
I met the love of my life, an equally weird, if not weirder, partner in crime.

1523
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,400
I just can't stop fucking ghosts.

1524
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,040
I've become a nun.

1525
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,000
I'm pretty sure that's an unrelated development, though.

1526
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,280
I've started to slowly metamorphosize into a beautiful butterfly,

1527
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:24,880
where each segment is a different McElroy brother, and I couldn't be happier about it.

1528
