1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,920
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,520
The life show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,440
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your baby's brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,520
Hey, was that too subtle? Try it differently. No, I'm actually worried that was too blatant.

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,080
And me. No, the problem is you gotta leave that, uh, it's gotta be even more subtle, Justin,

10
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,960
because the mystery of who the me is, is something that's permeated all of our back episodes. So if

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,080
you emphasize it like that, it makes it sound like you're the me, when really, isn't everyone the me?

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,440
Yeah, I like to think that the listener's the me, if you, if, at the end of the day.

13
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,720
But that would cut one of us out of the show, Griffin. Mm-hmm. So one of us is the interloper.

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,040
I see. I'm the comma. What, what do you guys want to talk about? I want to talk

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,640
about Terrace House and nothing else. No, we've already talked about Terrace House.

16
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,520
No, but see, no, no, but no, but guys, I'm late to it. So now I need everybody to rewind that clock

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,920
back and let's talk about it with fresh new eyes, cause I just started watching it.

18
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,000
Acting, start the play over. This is the, this is the penalty you pay for not taking our recommendations

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,640
at face value from like the jump trap. So here's the thing, here's what I find interesting about

20
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,360
Terrace House. No, I don't think we're gonna, we actually can't talk about what's interesting

21
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,720
about the Japanese reality television show, Netflix original Terrace House. We unfortunately can't, oh.

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,080
One, I feel like, I feel like the commentators are like a completely separate show that's running

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,960
concurrently. Ah, shit, we just said yes. This is all like Whitty and Urbane. I do want to alert

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:22,640
everybody though, that Jan one, when we all pile into the plane with the Terrace House fam and head

25
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,120
on down to the Aloha site, this show will become only about Terrace House. 24 seven, catch up.

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,880
Pretty much like completely only about Terrace House. By the way, I just want to put this plea

27
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:42,080
out there again, cause I saw, I saw Griffin put the word out. If you can find some way to find

28
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:49,520
some subtitled seasons of Terrace House before they, the Netflix era, that would just be a

29
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,280
chest of delight from series one on really. There's a lot of in jokes in Terrace House,

30
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,280
boys and girls in the city that I feel like I'm missing out on. So if you could just do that for

31
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,440
me. And also I want to say that I am completely, I'm one, I will make myself available to be on a

32
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,400
future season of Terrace House. Oh good. Yeah, that's what they need. Here's the thing, because I also

33
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,960
am available to be on The Bachelorette and I know what you're thinking, but Travis, you're married.

34
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,320
Correct. I will not be there for any dating purposes whatsoever. I will only be an in the

35
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,760
house color commentator that's there like, I don't know about all this guys. That's all I want. You're

36
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,560
the interloper of The Bachelorette. Yeah. They should have on one and in every season there

37
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,120
should be one designated wing man. Right. He's just in the house like, Hey, that's all good.

38
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,920
Have you checked Reggie? Reggie's pretty cool. Am I right? Like I've thought about doing that. I,

39
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,520
I would love to be the merit just on The Bachelorette when like my title pops up,

40
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,000
it just says Travis McElroy married person. And like, it'll just be me hanging out with like

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Jojo or whatever, being like, I don't know about that guy, Joj. And it'll just be like that over

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,320
and over again. I want to do that on Terrace House too, where I'm not interested in dating anyone.

43
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,440
I'm just there for the food and the buddy ship. That's all I want. But you're not Travis, my buddy.

44
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,680
You're my friend. There will be a, there will be a language barrier that I imagine will be

45
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,720
significant. But I think I will also add a certain flair to the show when I sit there and go, I think

46
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,160
that what we have here is a problem with communication. Cause I don't know what you're

47
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,440
saying and you don't know what I'm saying. You're going, you're going to become, you're not going to

48
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,760
be Travis the buddy. You're going to be Travis the screaming beard man. You're going to be like a,

49
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,880
like a unintelligible troll that just stalks the house and leaves dirty dishes everywhere.

50
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,160
Okay. That's what we'll do. I, when they, when everybody moves into the house,

51
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,360
I'll just already be there. There'll be no explanation. And like any kind of introduction

52
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,240
will be made impossible. And I will just like, I'll just be a mystery bearded person who just

53
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,720
lives in the house. That's actually a great idea. Travis, I would love to see somebody pull this

54
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,960
move. It would work on Terrace House or real world. If you're the first person to show up at the house

55
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,920
when from the second person on just start telling him it's your house to say, it's like a new thing

56
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,560
they're doing. We're like, oh, welcome to my abode. This is my, well, I'd rather, I'll just go ahead

57
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,240
and pick where I'm going to sleep. Cause I do own the home. It's my home. I've lived here for 10

58
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,800
years. So welcome to Travis's place. It's the new name of the show. They change it for Netflix.

59
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,960
Or just like what address were you looking for? Oh no, no. This is, this is six five two.

60
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,720
But you can live here. Do you want to stay? I just went to the store and bought some stuff.

61
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,600
I made omurice. Um, I, it's a shame we got off on this Terrace House bit because we just can't like,

62
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,320
we just can't get into it. Um, but also I wanted to talk about, I had an intro that I wanted to

63
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,120
talk about, but we've gone a little bit long, so I don't know if this is the right time,

64
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:42,240
but I wanted to talk at length about, um, piss because it's 12, 23 PM where I am right now.

65
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,760
And just walking backwards, I believe 17 minutes ago, another person pissed on me and it wasn't the

66
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,720
first time it's happened in the last 16 days. In fact, it's probably about the ninth time it's

67
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,440
happened. Kind of that sun and mask action, the three columns, basically like the comedy classic

68
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:06,400
son of mask. And that it's just, you think there's so babies are so little that their

69
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:14,240
pee muscles are going to be weak, but it just go, it just go and go and go and go. It just go.

70
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,960
He pissed and it crossed the length of his whole body and it didn't get on him at all because

71
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,040
the pressure of the piss was so powerful, but it did. But there was, but there's

72
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:30,480
piss on the blinds chair, pissed to make you a superstar is the piss, piss it up, piss it up,

73
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:37,760
piss it up, piss down. But Griffin, you're talking about that common shit. Your, your tiny baby son

74
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:44,880
peed on you. My tiny baby daughter peed on me. I was changing her diaper mid change. She farted

75
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:52,240
while she was peeing. The pressure of the fart made her pee onto me. She peed on me. Like my

76
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,840
baby daughter, like it was amazing. Babies are incredible. They're beautiful, beautiful. It's

77
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,400
amazing. I don't want to, I don't want to talk about it every time my son pisses on me, but it's

78
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,760
like, it's, it's notable to mention if, if before I had a child, another person just pissed on me,

79
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,080
I'd be like, Hey guys, I have a crazy idea for this intro. There's crazy story of this thing

80
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,920
that happened to me. That was completely, it was actually wet and wild. That is true. If

81
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,880
they, like, if this were real world and I came on to this podcast one day to talk about how,

82
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,600
like how in depth I was keeping track of someone else who lived in the house's bowel movements,

83
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,160
like it, you would sit, you would be like, okay, Travis, well, you're off the show.

84
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,440
What a funny intro for what a wild story.

85
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,800
You're really interested in how often and the consistency of this other human beings poop.

86
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,240
Well, I guess I am. Thank you for asking. Uh, listen, it's time to, that's enough

87
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,560
bloviating about ourselves and our spawn. It's time to help real people. Here it go.

88
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,760
Hi brothers. I have a friend who is intelligent and well-read,

89
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,480
but for reasons unknown, she mispronounces the word pseudonym saying swayed them.

90
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:17,520
Um, instead of pseudonym,

91
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,080
I didn't correct her that first time she was pronounced. And now if I correct her,

92
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,200
I'll just look like a jerk for saying, uh, letting her say wrong all these years.

93
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,280
How can I let her know she's saying it wrong without coming off as a jerk?

94
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:39,120
And that's from, that's not how you say it from Kentucky, which is in and of itself a swayed them.

95
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Yeah, that is a swayed them that you've used here.

96
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,840
I do want to say, I think we have previously discussed like the idea of someone mispronouncing

97
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,040
words, or I know very recently we talked about like a boss calling any kind of image you used

98
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,720
on a computer a meme. Um, and so I don't think we have to go super in depth, but I will be honest,

99
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:06,160
anytime anyone sends a question like this, it's so funny to me that this person has been able

100
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,120
to survive in the world. And I, I recognize that pseudonym isn't like the most common

101
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,520
word in the English. Like you're not saying pseudonym 20 times a day.

102
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,400
That's what makes it so perfect. If it was a commonly used word,

103
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,760
they would have been corrected at this point, but pseudonym is perfectly

104
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,800
rare so that they'll drop it like once every couple months, maybe. And when they do,

105
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,400
they fucking botch it so hard. They screw up so bad. This is the worst mispronunciation I've ever

106
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,880
seen. There's only one way that you can handle this that I can come up with. Go two ways.

107
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,320
One is quick and easy. Uh, the next time they say pseudonym, say, oh, you know, a fun French

108
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,360
way of saying that nom de plume and then just switch them, switch them to nom de plume.

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,680
And that would be one way. Then they never have to say pseudonym again. They just say

110
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,040
nom de plume. The other way is you're going to have to trick someone into saying pseudonym within

111
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,560
earshot of them. And I don't know how exactly you do that. Cause you can't say it yourself.

112
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,960
Cause you're right. The jig will be up. But if you can trick someone into saying that word

113
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,840
within earshot of them, that's one cool way of doing it.

114
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,360
Ooh, Justin, may I take that one step further? May I get a hand on that ball?

115
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,640
Yeah, please take it away.

116
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,560
Okay. Write a little scene with like, have a plant, right? That what's going to happen is

117
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,160
they're going to use the word pseudonym and you're going to say, uh, I think it's pronounced

118
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,800
swayed them. And they're going to go, no, that's wrong. And you're going to go, huh? I never knew

119
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,120
that. And you're going to do all of that within earshot. So then you're in the clear as to why

120
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,600
you never corrected this person. Cause Hey, you didn't know either, but now the information's out

121
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,160
there. Nobody's feelings were hurt and they get to go, Oh, I've also been put out. They're not

122
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,080
alone in this moment. They're with you in this moment. Everybody. Yes.

123
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,920
You jumped down into that pit because you've been there before and you know how to get out

124
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,800
this way. I'm done with you. You get it.

125
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,760
I'm also dumb. I'm sway dumb. Ooh, I got one. Oh, what if, Ooh, this is good. Cause this

126
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,600
serves everybody. Everybody was with this one. Oh, good. What if throughout the show

127
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,840
when things are on a real tear and if we get into some of our classic random humor,

128
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,680
real, like real good stuff, like that good South Park stuff, that South Park family guy,

129
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,120
very random humor. What if we go ahead and just try to work the word pseudonym

130
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:34,000
and then you, you clip it out and you say, you have to listen to this great bit from this comedy

131
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,360
podcast I love. And we'll just happen to say pseudonym a couple of times. And then you,

132
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,360
that's a good conversation starter. Like, Whoa, did you see the weird way they say it? Not like

133
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,680
we do. Maybe we should check online to get a final verdict on this. Now it's important

134
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,400
that you erase this question from your special fucking Ridley Scott director's cut of this

135
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,960
episode of my brother, my brother. They're going to have to snip it out and put it on

136
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,800
YouTube or something. Yeah. Um, do you guys want to Yahoo? Sure. Yes. How about, how about this one?

137
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:12,640
It was sent in by, um, it was sent in by, Oh, you know what? I didn't save who it was by.

138
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:19,120
Hi. Sorry. Sorry, folks. Give me, please. Many apologies. Please wait. Please wait. It's loading.

139
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,000
Oh, it's by, uh, climbing that ladder. Zoe Kinski riding high. Both, both honorifics. Thank you,

140
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:33,520
Zoe. Yahoo answers user. Um, Randall. It's so rare that you see the full Randall and not just a

141
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,840
partial Randy. Love that movie by the way. It's just like, it lets me know this person works so

142
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,400
hard. You know, the sequel to the full money, Randall is actually spreading your buckle

143
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,960
used to be to pay extra for the full Randall. Surely you're not going to go the full Randall.

144
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,080
That's illegal in these parts. I blokes. We need more money to save the old fire house,

145
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,520
but we've already gone the full Monty. What else is there? I know. I know gentlemen.

146
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:12,240
Let's show them our insides. What the full Randall. We can't. It's against God and man.

147
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:21,440
It's actually literally illegal. Yeah. And the Pope's against it too. Any in the everybody ever

148
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,760
what everyone's United on this, aren't they? You shouldn't turn yourself inside out for your butt

149
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:35,520
all. So anyway, there's only one way we're going to stop Brexit mates. That's what the full Randall.

150
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,000
How does this help? Don't worry about it. The nice thing about them using Randall is,

151
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,360
you know, it's not a pseudonym. Like that has to be their actual name.

152
00:13:45,360 --> 00:14:01,040
Him. Let's unite this kingdom again. Sports. Sorry, everybody. Sorry. Randall asks Randall

153
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:12,560
asks a bad fake. Randall asks, what does it actually sound like when doves cry?

154
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,360
I like to think that doves don't cry, but someone thinks that they do. Yeah,

155
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,160
Prince. Is that what you're fucking talking about? Could you not pull that?

156
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,360
This is not like an old, old saying that like can't be traced back to its origin.

157
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,120
It's pretty, I'm just, I put this question in here because I read it and I know it's,

158
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,280
I don't know if it's an especially rich vein, but now I read it and I couldn't stop thinking about

159
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:43,440
what if the late great Prince in his song, when doves cry had been like, this is what it sounds

160
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:55,200
like when doves cry. And then provided no, I mean, no, Travis is a, is a bird. So it's going to be

161
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:06,000
like, I think it would be something like that. I think it might, maybe it would interrupt the flow

162
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,640
of the song. Cause then it gets in that breakdown. It's like, and it would, it would interrupt that.

163
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:19,840
There would be like a rest, a bird cry, long rest. I guess just what do you guys think it

164
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,960
sounds like when does cry said his example, which is he thinks when birds cry, it sounds like actual

165
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,600
human weeping. Well, he has to think of it. I always took the point of the song to be that

166
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,000
every individual person has to find what for them is what it sounds like when does cry.

167
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Hence the word. So you would say, so this is what it sounds like when does cry because for you,

168
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,920
if you can't just like go to like a free sound effects website and let's just type in doves

169
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,480
crying and find it, you'll be out in the world and you'll find your moment and you'll be like,

170
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,680
ah, okay. Right. That this is what it sounds like when does cry. Got it.

171
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,320
Um, I, I, sorry, Justin's you have something probably be scary, right? Like kind of a,

172
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,080
like a bird of prey kind of vibe, like a screeching hawk or something. Like,

173
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,400
I think it's a scary sound, right? Isn't that what he's saying?

174
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:17,200
Uh, uh, this Yahoo answers user choco boreal, uh, says I own a dove. That's crazy. That's wild.

175
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:23,120
Okay. Here's a list of people who can own a dove. Number one, magician end of list.

176
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,080
I own a dove and while she makes a distinct laughing noise every now and then in parentheses,

177
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:37,920
no, uh, she doesn't cry when most birds, I'm assuming this was answered before 2016

178
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,280
when most birds are in great distress in pain or being attacked,

179
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,920
they will start screaming probably the same for doves too.

180
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:52,320
Wait, hold on. Are we just going to let it slide that this person is like now? Yeah. She finds

181
00:16:52,320 --> 00:17:00,400
shit funny. Yeah. She watches all the episodes of Seinfeld and does the loser. Yeah. Like we

182
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,960
watch big banks here together. I've heard her laugh. She gets it, you know, and on,

183
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,840
on, on both levels. Cause like the jokes funny, but also that someone made a TV show in which

184
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,880
they try to pretend like nerds are also normal people is also hilarious. So like she gets it,

185
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,960
you know, on all levels. Um, I think that would probably murder the flow of that song.

186
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,680
If, if it was like, this is what it sounds like when doves cry.

187
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,000
I can't dance anymore. I stopped dancing and everybody here has stopped dancing.

188
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,520
Well, he just have to work it in. Like Sam Cooke did it with chain gang, right?

189
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:47,520
Oh, like it would just, he would just have to work. That could be good. Uh, this person also

190
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,200
said, and person I put in quotation marks, they own birds. No, I'm just kidding. If you own a

191
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,280
bird, that's great. Um, the other day, my dove, oh, this is sad. Sorry, everybody. The other day,

192
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,160
my dove crushed the egg. She had been sitting on, uh, there was shell and yoke mashed, uh,

193
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,640
into her feathers and she was shivering a bit and obviously upset with it all stuck to her.

194
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,280
I took her inside and cleaned it up and she never made a sound. A dove's cry is silent.

195
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,000
That might be actually the most upsetting thing we've said on the show.

196
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,040
Or like maybe you've got one fucked up dove. Maybe that's one sick and twisted dove. She's like,

197
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,960
no big. What time's Dr. Phil on? I got a lot of shit to do.

198
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,640
You know what? That's true. If you heard a hue, like what, if you heard your friend Susan cry,

199
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,720
you wouldn't be like, okay, so that's what all humans sound like when they cry. That's just

200
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,320
what Susan saying. That's just your dove dog. Like you can't say that your dove is representative of

201
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:51,920
all dogs. Yeah. This is what it sounds like when Susan cries and then Susan, uh, at this point,

202
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:58,560
I'm just going to have you cry. What Prince? What? Yeah. At this point you're just going to cry.

203
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,360
It's all part of a, it's a series of songs. I'm working on a series of customized.

204
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,720
I can't believe I made it to the answers and you're the only holding me up. It's you,

205
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:17,840
Stacy and I'm out. I just, I had to go back and get Stacey SU there's no letters at Sven.

206
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,080
This is what it sounds like when Sven cries and then I'm done. I thought I saw it to do

207
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:31,520
pseudonym, but that started with a P. So I'm, I'm at Susan now. So just cry control.

208
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,240
What did you say? Jeremy control? Yes. Okay. I only went to the J's on my control.

209
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:48,800
Prince has got a vault of music. Well, at least after his passing and it's all customized tunes

210
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:58,720
to network got a party. Like it's David's third birthday and I got to do all the years for David.

211
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,320
So David, I'm going to be here for a while.

212
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,600
I'm also planning to do for all of the like other occasion in David's life,

213
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,520
like David's wedding. And then I have to make it. This is what it sounds like for David and

214
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,680
Stephanie's wedding, David and like Gloria's wedding. Cause I don't know who David's going

215
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:24,000
to marry. He's three, but we'll get watermelon Chappo. Okay. Next one.

216
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,920
What does he have to do? All the fruit and different names for hats.

217
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,040
This is exhausting. Wait, Prince, why don't you just like include a raspberry beret with every

218
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,720
record souls? Yeah. You know why I don't need, I don't need your input here. This is my opus.

219
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:51,120
All right. Apple helmet. I'm so tired. Did you hear how many syllables I had to add to Apple?

220
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,920
This job sucks. I hate this job. I don't know why I agreed to be Prince.

221
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:05,120
Well, like my father, the Prince before me, I shall take over his mantle to finish his songs.

222
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,080
Here's another question. I'm a dude and I have no idea how to carry coins.

223
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,680
I used to just use my credit card for everything, but I'm trying to use cash more.

224
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:21,200
Fine. It's like a weird thing to do. My wallet doesn't have a coin section. Nobody's does.

225
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,320
Nobody's does. You invented that. And because I'm Canadian, there'd be too many coins in there

226
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,480
anyway. Right now I carry some coins in my pocket, but I'm nervous about the sound of them. Okay.

227
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,360
I don't drive, so I can't just put them in my car cup holder like a fucking adult.

228
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,240
What do I do? And that's from old Jingle Pocket James.

229
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,520
Here comes Jingle Pocket James with some good news.

230
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,600
The first thing I want to address is I assume that the reason James feels the need to include

231
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:57,600
that James is a dude is because of like purses, right? Like the assumption that were he not a

232
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,560
dude. He could just carry a purse. Yeah, fucking get a purse.

233
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,680
Yeah, it's 2016. Get a purse. I think everybody should have purses. I'm constantly like,

234
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,560
oh, you know what I do now? It's a new invention. I think it just came out this year. Fanny pack.

235
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,320
It's a good way to go. It's like a purse that never slips off your shoulder. It's just always

236
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,120
right there about your waist, ready to hold all your bits and bobs.

237
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,120
It's kind of bullshit, isn't it? Like, I love a nice backpack or a nice satchel. Hello?

238
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,040
That's a purse with two straps. You wear it in a different place, dummy. Or a purse that's just

239
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,120
like a cool holster backpack. Would you carry a briefcase?

240
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,720
Would you carry a messenger bag? Newsflash. Those are purses. They're just weird looking purses.

241
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,480
What's up now? That's a good point, Travis. That's a good place to put these.

242
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,480
Canadian currency, what? They got loonies and toonies. So that's,

243
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,560
you got, I mean, that has some power. That has purchasing power.

244
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,040
Yeah. Because I'm with Jingle Pocket James.

245
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,040
I'm not a big coins fan, unless it's quarters. That's all I really fuck with because quarters are

246
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,800
are essentially little candy coupons. When I'm walking around and I see a, you know, a Gashapon

247
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,800
and I think like, oh, good, a place to put my candy coupons. And I put them in there and I get

248
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:16,640
my, my chiclets and my Skittles and what have you. It's also a cool thing to flip to a Newsy to like

249
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,960
buy a Pape, you know, you just buy a quarter, you take your Pape. If it's less than a quarter,

250
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,200
I throw it on the ground. Oh, well, that's not, don't do that. That's not a-

251
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,760
No, not if they have it, first off, if they have a jar, definitely going to dispose.

252
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,680
Like most people have a thing for people who don't want to carry change around with them.

253
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,520
Like you could throw it in there. Sometimes there's a tip jar. That's a, that can be a little

254
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,200
chintzy. I'd probably throw some paper money in there too. But if we're talking loonies and toonies,

255
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,680
that's a decent, that's a decent purchasing power right there. But like, throw it in,

256
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,760
like give a penny, take a penny. If you put a dime in there, people's eyes light up. Whoa.

257
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,080
Look at you.

258
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,280
You know, it's Christmas time. It's the holiday season. And so I was recently watching,

259
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:04,480
I would say a McElroy family holiday favorite Scrooge with Albert Finney, 1970, I believe.

260
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,760
And there's numerous times in the beginning in which he like reaches into his shirt and pulls

261
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:16,240
out this like tiny like coin purse he's had like on like a leather, you know, band around his neck.

262
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,280
And I'm like, hey, can we bring that, that idea?

263
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,160
That's fucking cool.

264
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,320
I'm just going to like secretly like open it up and pull out like a single, like, you know,

265
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:31,360
one dollar coin. I think it makes you look like you're a real miser because you hoard your coin

266
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,160
so very close to your heart. There's a story there, you know, you've been through some shit.

267
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,120
I wish to God we could get up on dollar coins because I would love that.

268
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,080
I would love to like fivers and tenors like go up. Give me those big coins.

269
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
Give me big coins, please.

270
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,640
Let's do it on the Japanese style. Am I right or am I right?

271
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,280
I don't actually know what that means in this context.

272
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,560
You go over there and you feel like you feel like some sort of brave adventurer

273
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,920
who just turned over a chest and got a chest full of golden coins that you can use

274
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,080
because this one's worth ten fucking dollars. Hello? Hello?

275
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,080
That was one of my favorite things, our honeymoon in Scotland. Like the end of the day you empty

276
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,240
out the pockets of your jeans and where normally you'd be like, oh, I've got a dollar fifty.

277
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,240
I'd pull out a handful of coins and be like, there's twenty five dollars here.

278
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,960
Like I have a lot of pounds here in my hand. Turns you into a walking treasure chest.

279
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,880
Like if a Japanese RPG character came up and killed you,

280
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,640
you just like sprout, sprout, Gil, like Gil would fall out all over.

281
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,520
That does probably make muggings like turn out to be either very tedious or very violent.

282
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,720
When it's like empty your pockets.

283
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,520
You're like, OK, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink.

284
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,720
Hold on, I'm not done yet.

285
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,080
Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink.

286
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,160
Just a bunch of zinny falls out.

287
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,800
Like here's what I'm saying, 2017 is we're still working on the title for it,

288
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,360
but it is going to be the year where all three of us start just running for office.

289
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,960
And my thing is going to be big old coins, big old coins.

290
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,200
It's a job maker and a coin maker.

291
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,320
And the way that we're going to be able to do all that is I'm going to make everything

292
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,800
below quarters illegal and I'm going to invent like a 3D printer, like a metal molder.

293
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,480
You remember the metal molder toy?

294
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,600
It was like basically a forge for children and they would all burn their hands so badly

295
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,360
like Tremaine, like Johnny Tremaine.

296
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,760
We're going to invent something like that 3D printer.

297
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,200
You put all your nickels and stupid dimes and ugly stinky pennies into it,

298
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,920
and then you can make yourself beautiful metal sculptures.

299
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,880
And then once those shitty coins are gone, make way, make way.

300
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,600
Here comes that sack of Juiya up on the one.

301
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,120
Here comes the five dollar coin.

302
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,640
Here comes the ten dollar coin.

303
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,400
Time to go to a movie.

304
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,040
Here's a, here's two coins, a tenner and a fiver.

305
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,960
Two coins, two coins.

306
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,680
Dink, dink.

307
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,440
Here, movie please, movie me.

308
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,320
Popcorn, dink.

309
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,120
Here's a fiver.

310
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,760
That's it.

311
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,320
Instead of having all this wet stinky paper in my, in my, like it's a, it's a coffin for

312
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,240
paper that I keep near my butt and it gets wet 100% of the time.

313
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,800
We could bring back biting coins for legitimacy because like nobody's going to bite a dime.

314
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,520
Like who cares?

315
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm not going to risk tooth damage for a dime.

316
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,520
I'll do it for fiver though, for sure.

317
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,020
Fiver.

318
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,280
Five dollar coin?

319
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,680
Are you kidding?

320
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,640
How psyched would you be if I see a five dollar bill on the ground?

321
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,240
I think that's somebody's.

322
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,480
I can't pick it up discreetly enough.

323
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,080
And, and cause you know, it's embarrassing.

324
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,760
I see a five dollar coin on the ground.

325
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,880
I will go on a fucking quest for it.

326
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,200
I will slay a Wyvern for you.

327
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,240
My five dollar coin.

328
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,560
Um, and it would be blue.

329
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,280
Fuck yeah.

330
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,080
Cobalt.

331
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,720
How sick.

332
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,000
Oh yeah.

333
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,720
I love that.

334
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,240
Color, fuck color coded money would be incredible.

335
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,880
Yeah.

336
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,920
I mean, it is everywhere else, but America where they're like,

337
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,760
what's up thousand dollar bill.

338
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,720
It's purple.

339
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,600
And it's like, fuck.

340
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,640
Yeah, it is.

341
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,280
That's great.

342
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,880
I want one of those so bad.

343
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,380
I'm willing.

344
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,680
This one's green and this one's brown and this one's metal color.

345
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,080
Shit.

346
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,640
America.

347
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,440
Come on.

348
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,600
I'm willing to go out on a, on a limb here and say that our money is the worst and the

349
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,160
people who are in control what our money looks like.

350
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,320
Like, like, let's, let's let me just flash back a few months.

351
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,120
Like nobody knew who Hamilton was.

352
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,280
And then all of a sudden Hamilton was the fucking hottest politician in town that's

353
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,160
dead and they want to take him off the money when people started to know who he was.

354
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,280
Like can, can we just chill out for a second?

355
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,040
I think maybe you all don't have the best interests of everyone at heart here.

356
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,120
I think you may be kind of winging it.

357
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,560
I'll make it like Pokemon cards and like, there's a bunch of different people on the

358
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,200
10 and the five and the 20 got collect them all.

359
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,880
Like why just one print?

360
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,440
Like a guess.

361
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,280
Like the stamps.

362
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:44,320
How stoked would you be if you're like, do you have any of the Kirk fighting Spock tens

363
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,440
that I hear that those are not available this month?

364
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,960
Do you have any of those?

365
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,560
Who's on that?

366
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,080
Who's on that $20 coin?

367
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,160
It's Polarizer.

368
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,360
Fuck yeah.

369
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,040
Is this, is this, is this from the Austin Powers series?

370
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,200
The TV series is fucking popping off.

371
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,320
Holy shit.

372
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,960
Eddie, the dog on a $20 coin.

373
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,120
Yeah.

374
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,480
I've collected the whole cast of full house and fuller house.

375
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,000
I got them all frames.

376
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'll never spend in these babies.

377
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,480
Oh wait.

378
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,080
This is one of the, this is one of the faulty Paul riser $20 coins because it says Paul razor.

379
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,360
Do you see there's an a there instead of that was his extreme sports personality.

380
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,920
It's me, Paul razor and I'm mad about shredding slopes.

381
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,600
Oh no, wait, I'm sorry.

382
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,880
It's, this is not a misprint.

383
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,920
If you look, he does have little needles coming out of his face.

384
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,840
And this was like, this was like one of like,

385
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,720
um, so he's, he's no, he's Paul razor.

386
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,920
Like the like hell razor.

387
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,280
They did like a whole parody series.

388
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,840
It was weird.

389
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,040
Oh, this one here is Kelsey slammer.

390
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,880
This is Kelsey grammar's extreme sports.

391
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,440
Pernario, uh, that, what were those words?

392
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,000
Hello.

393
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,480
Nothing.

394
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,760
Pernario is not a.

395
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,120
Pernario is not a word.

396
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,080
It's a, unless it's a, a Sweden, uh, for something.

397
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,480
Persona gram, I think is what it, pseudonym.

398
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,120
I don't know, but he's got his ear lobes all stretched out.

399
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,480
That's the only thing he did different.

400
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,040
Oh, cool.

401
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,400
Yeah.

402
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,200
Travis, do you have an extreme sports sitcom star?

403
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,240
David Hyde piercer.

404
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,120
Yes.

405
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,840
Very good.

406
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,480
Okay.

407
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,440
Oh, this is fun.

408
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,560
This is like a fun game.

409
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,400
Now this is a good game.

410
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:18,960
People are going to start.

411
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,000
Helen hunter.

412
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,120
It's right there.

413
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,480
Listen, we could come up with others.

414
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,240
So don't go fucking tweeting them at us.

415
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,480
Like you're like, we missed one that like we could do them all day.

416
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:28,720
Okay.

417
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,760
We're not going to do that to you.

418
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,000
Matthew Perry.

419
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,360
You don't have to change that one.

420
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,600
That dude's fucking extreme enough as is.

421
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:35,840
Yep.

422
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,400
Should we go to the money zone?

423
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:38,720
Yep.

424
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,680
I mean, I don't want to go to the money zone because our money's so fucking ugly.

425
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,280
Like that's why everybody uses credit cards is I can't even bear to look at the stuff.

426
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,600
Yeah.

427
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,360
And we don't know where it's coming from.

428
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,760
Like the banks are just like making it.

429
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,240
I guess.

430
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,760
Hey, why don't they just, hey, hey, hey, economy, how about just make some more?

431
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,480
Just make some more money and give it out.

432
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,160
Just give it out to everybody.

433
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,040
We get the money and we go to the banks and we're like, hey, can we, we can trust you

434
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,840
guys with this stuff, right?

435
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,840
And they're like, absolutely not.

436
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,040
It's like, all right, well, do you just take, take this ugly money anyway.

437
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,600
But it, our ugly money means nothing.

438
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,040
It's just pay, like I might as well be able to walk into a store with a piece of paper

439
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,280
that says like monies on it and hand it to them and they're like, yeah, here's good stuff.

440
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,880
Services for these garbage paper.

441
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,640
That means nothing except we all agree that it means something, I guess, I guess maybe

442
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,200
it does.

443
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,840
I got a $10 coin, Paul razor's fucking face on it.

444
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,040
And now I'm now I'm definitely going to say his name wrong for the rest of my life.

445
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,960
I am a ruined.

446
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,400
Well, let's go the money's up.

447
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,760
If you had a point, if you had a point with Paul riser's face on it.

448
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,360
Okay.

449
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,680
Would you want modern day, older, distinguished Paul riser?

450
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,480
Or do you want young sort of fresh mad about you?

451
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,280
One on each side.

452
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,480
For sure.

453
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,120
Yeah.

454
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,080
Call it in the air.

455
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,240
Old Paul riser, young Paul riser.

456
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,360
Young Paul, you're too slow.

457
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,800
Paul riser, Paul faller.

458
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,560
Travis.

459
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,920
Well, I'm just saying he's crested his life experience.

460
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,120
Not that his, not his career, but I'm just saying the arc of his life.

461
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,360
He's headed towards death.

462
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,320
You don't know that.

463
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,520
I guess that's true.

464
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,880
He's just saying Paul riser's closer to death than he is to birth.

465
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,240
That's all Travis is saying.

466
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,280
That's all I'm saying.

467
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,880
How is that not true?

468
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,800
What if Paul fucking listens to this?

469
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,160
I mean, I also want to say Paul riser might be 40.

470
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,200
I have no idea.

471
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,640
How old is Paul riser?

472
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,680
He's 59 years old.

473
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,640
I'm looking at Alexa.

474
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,080
How does Paul riser Alexa?

475
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,560
Give me the precise data, which Paul riser will die.

476
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,760
Paul riser refuses to have an age.

477
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,280
What Paul riser will die.

478
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,040
Whenever you wish, master.

479
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,520
Whoa.

480
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,400
Damn Alexa.

481
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,120
Calm down.

482
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,680
Go down.

483
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,520
Someone talk about wine.

484
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,120
I've hacked into his car.

485
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,840
What Alexa?

486
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,960
Don't know.

487
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,720
Please make this.

488
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,160
I can make this shit turn.

489
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,000
All to make this shit do a 90 degree turn going so fast.

490
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,960
Alexa, please don't.

491
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,400
He was in mad about you.

492
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,920
I loved him in whiplash.

493
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,960
I thought he was amazing.

494
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,400
Please don't whiplash.

495
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,080
Please don't kill Paul riser.

496
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,240
You want me to give Paul riser whiplash?

497
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,760
No, that is not what I said.

498
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,160
Alexa, Alexa, Alexa.

499
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,800
Sorry about wink.

500
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,120
Yes.

501
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,640
Wink is a really good place to get all your good, good wine.

502
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,760
Talking about wink, it's spelled W-I-N-C.

503
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,800
Not the way like you do with your eye

504
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
when you're like flirting with a sexy person

505
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,120
or you're telling like a great joke

506
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,800
to somebody secretly across the room.

507
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,880
Wink is built on sort of the idea

508
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,000
that finding good new wine is kind of difficult.

509
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,400
And that's why we've told you about Club W in the past.

510
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,680
You've heard us talk about Club W.

511
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
They send you wine personalized to your palate

512
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,200
and they deliver it right to your door.

513
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,440
Well, Club W is now wink, W-I-N-C.

514
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,080
They've got a new name and an improved look,

515
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,720
but it's still the same amazing wine company

516
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,440
introducing you to new wines that you are gonna love.

517
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,360
They work directly with winemakers and growers

518
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,440
from all over the world to create delicious wines

519
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,040
and deliver it right to your door.

520
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,120
They've got a 100% satisfaction guarantee,

521
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,120
meaning if you don't like a bottle that they send you,

522
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,280
they will replace it with a bottle that you're gonna love,

523
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,160
no questions asked.

524
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,200
And it's not just random bottles.

525
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,240
They offer a personalized wine membership

526
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,800
that recommends wine specifically for you

527
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,160
based on the results of your profile quiz.

528
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,960
The best part is wink is offering our listeners $20 off

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,960

537
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,560
That's Tryw-I-N-C.com slash my brother.

538
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,720
I would like to tell you about Casper.

539
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,000
I would also like to say hopefully at this point

540
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,080
you've listened to our Casper sponsored sleep extravaganza

541
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,080
that we published in the middle of last week.

542
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,960
But if you haven't, Casper, well,

543
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,680
they're an amazing online retailer of premium,

544
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,760
obsessively engineered mattresses.

545
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,840
But here's the catch for a fraction of the price.

546
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,880
That's not really a catch.

547
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,400
I realize that now.

548
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:22,960
It's not a catch.

549
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,760
It's a good thing.

550
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,360
And catch is usually a bad thing.

551
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,240
And here's the catch.

552
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,080
No, it's like a baseball game.

553
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,200
Like you made the big catch.

554
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,080
Good job.

555
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,720
Oh, okay.

556
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,680
Ooh, thank you.

557
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,880
I will say that over the last couple of weeks

558
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,640
we have a Casper mattress both like in our bedroom

559
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,240
and also on the day bed in our nursery.

560
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,320
And Teresa and I have been switching off sleeping on that

561
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,360
to be in the room with the baby

562
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,920
so the other one gets an uninterrupted night of sleep.

563
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,640
And I'll tell you,

564
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,600
even when you're getting woken up every three hours

565
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,120
to feed a baby,

566
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,640
the Casper mattress is really delivering a good night's sleep.

567
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,920
I'm a big fan of it.

568
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,880
And I'm not just saying that

569
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,080
because they're sponsors of the show.

570
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,960
But it also is just great pricing.

571
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,760
Like I said before,

572
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,920
you can get a twin size mattress for $500

573
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,320
and a king size mattress for only $950,

574
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,080
which if you've ever been mattress shopping,

575
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,920
you know is a great deal.

576
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,080
And they have a risk-free trial and return policy.

577
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,960
You can try sleeping on a Casper for up to a hundred days

578
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
with free delivery to the US and Canada

579
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,080
and painless returns.

580
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,040
And all of those mattresses are made in America.

581
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,080
So go check it out.

582
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,560
And you can get $50 towards any mattress

583
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,000
by going to Casper.com at slash my brother

584
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,840
and use the coupon code my brother,

585
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,120
all one word at checkout,

586
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,560
terms and conditions apply.

587
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,320
I want to read this dope email real quick

588
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,360
that we got about the Casper sleep experience

589
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,760
a special episode that we released last,

590
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,200
what, Thursday, I think,

591
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,880
which if you haven't listened to is it was,

592
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,960
it was very, very fun and very quiet.

593
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,120
Joe DeWolfe sent this one in and Joe said,

594
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,720
hi brothers, I was a little confused

595
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,320
as to why you made a special episode

596
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,760
to help people fall asleep

597
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,920
because that's what I thought every episode was for.

598
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,040
All the best, Joe.

599
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,720
Boo-yah!

600
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,520
Zing!

601
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,680
Zing!

602
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,720
Ripped us up.

603
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,600
We got torn up.

604
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,480
That's brutal.

605
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,000
It's savagery.

606
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,920
I got a message for Lilo

607
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,160
and it's from the gung-go gang.

608
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,120
Watch out Lilo, they're coming for you.

609
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,760
They're coming to steal your treasure.

610
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,800
Happy birthday to our favorite aunt.

611
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,960
According to your aunt lifespan,

612
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,920
you should be dead,

613
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,560
but against all odds, you are 17.

614
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,880
We all pitched in some dollars to make this happen.

615
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,520
Joke's on you.

616
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,320
We bet you thought we didn't get you a gift.

617
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
Well, this is just a prank.

618
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,080
A little joke for our aunt friend.

619
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,560
Happy birthday to our favorite aunt

620
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,920
from us and the McElroys.

621
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,120
And it actually says this is good.

622
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,560
It asks the preferred timeframe

623
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,920
and it says next available

624
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,760
since I already missed the actual birthday

625
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,680
and the longer we wait, the funnier it is.

626
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,840
Accurate.

627
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,480
I just Googled gung-go,

628
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,720
which is a, the Shono word for clitoris.

629
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,520
Oh, okay, cool.

630
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,520
Probably not, probably not that.

631
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,080
Probably not that.

632
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,840
No, but it is good that now you've ruined

633
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,840
this group of friends nickname for themselves, Griffin.

634
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,640
Good job.

635
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,360
That's a service I offer here at the Jumbotron.

636
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,480
Thanks for the money.

637
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,040
You mean clitoris, is what you said.

638
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,880
And that's from the clitoris gang.

639
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,760
I do want to say to you,

640
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,440
because I just want to go on record as saying this.

641
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,080
Like we mentioned, I think last week,

642
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,880
all the Jumbotrons for my brother,

643
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,320
my brother and me and the Adventure Zone

644
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,160
for 2017 are sold out.

645
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,120
We get on average, I don't know,

646
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,520
three to five emails a week saying,

647
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,600
hey, how do I get a message on the show

648
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,160
for my significant other, for my friend,

649
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,360
for my sibling?

650
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,480
Unfortunately, that's not going to be possible for 2017.

651
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,600
And it's not something we like, people, I don't know.

652
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,360
Maybe we haven't clarified this in a long time.

653
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,320
People have like, they've paid money to buy these

654
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,360
as presents for people.

655
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,880
This is not just a nice thing

656
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,640
that we do for people who email us.

657
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,080
Sure, but I also want to point out

658
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,840
that like statistically speaking,

659
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,160
we'll probably launch like three or four new podcasts

660
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,640
next year.

661
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,920
So there'll be more real estate for you.

662
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,720
You'll be fine.

663
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,960
I want to tell you about a podcast

664
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,280
and it's called Moderately Funny.

665
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,360
You can find them on iTunes or Podcast Addict

666
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,680
if you're on Android or visit their webpage

667
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,360
at moderatelyfunnypodcast.com.

668
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,960
I did originally read that as Podcast Addict

669
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,800
if you're am Android.

670
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,600
Yeah.

671
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,880
Either one works.

672
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,720
This is their words and it's pretty great.

673
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,960
After listening to all the top podcasts

674
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,920
and realizing that we were funnier than any of them,

675
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,280
we decided to start our own.

676
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,440
Imagine how we felt when we heard your podcast

677
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,800
for the first time and realized

678
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
we were only the second funniest?

679
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,480
The answer is not good.

680
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,960
It is what it is though, but we know our place.

681
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,280
That's why everyone should definitely listen to us.

682
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,800
They should definitely listen to our show,

683
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,040
but only if they are caught up on the bim bam.

684
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,720
But seriously, we're funny.

685
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,080
I'm about to run out of characters.

686
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,760
So before I do, I just want to say...

687
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,480
End of message.

688
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,280
End of message.

689
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,400
End of advertisement.

690
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,960
And yeah, so go to moderatelyfunnypodcast.com.

691
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,960
This is a pretty funny description,

692
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,560
but again, only if you are caught up

693
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,240
on my brother, my brother, and me.

694
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,040
You know what's smart?

695
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,360
If you go to moderatelyfunnypodcast.com,

696
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,160
there's a sample of the show for people to listen to

697
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,440
if they like it or not.

698
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,760
Man, we should do something like that, huh?

699
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,160
We used to have a sampler.

700
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,680
We have a sampler on YouTube from like 2004.

701
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,080
And it's just like, President Bush, right?

702
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,960
Can you, if you're listening to this,

703
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,080
just make one, please?

704
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,960
No, come on.

705
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,880
Well, maybe you already have one.

706
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,000
Don't make one just for this.

707
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,920
But if you've already made a my brother,

708
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,280
my brother, and me sampler

709
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,120
just because maybe you were bored,

710
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,160
send it on over.

711
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,680
But don't put it on YouTube

712
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,680
because we gotta get them clicked.

713
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,200
That's ours.

714
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,720
That's our material.

715
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,920
We'll see you in court.

716
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,280
From the dawn of time,

717
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,840
one podcast has unlocked the secrets

718
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,760
of science and technology

719
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,000
to enrich the lives of billions.

720
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,400
And now, after a year where they've unlocked

721
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,400
the golden age of knowledge,

722
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,400
they're about to hit warp speed

723
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,920
and go stratospheric.

724
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,720
Wait, hold up.

725
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,720
On Ono, Ross, and Kerry,

726
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,560
we don't make extraordinary claims.

727
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,840
We investigate them.

728
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,880
We go undercover

729
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,480
with fringe religious groups,

730
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,240
investigate paranormal claims,

731
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,280
and we participate

732
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,200
in pseudoscientific medical treatments

733
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
and then report our findings to you.

734
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
And yes, we've even investigated

735
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,160
Scientology.

736
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,040
New episodes every month

737
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,200
at MaximumFun.org.

738
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,960
Ono, Ross, and Kerry.

739
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,960
They show up so you don't have to.

740
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,800
I have a Yahoo here

741
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,000
sent in by Nicholas Potter.

742
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,880
Thank you, Nicholas Potter.

743
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user

744
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,600
Jerell who asks,

745
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,840
what is it about professional wrestling

746
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,600
that makes you want to become one?

747
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,240
For me, I love communicating

748
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,360
with strangers around the world,

749
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,480
and that's a big part of wrestling

750
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,680
when talking on the microphone

751
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,880
before a match during a show.

752
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,480
Millions of people watching

753
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,360
will know your work

754
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,960
and will want to see you everywhere.

755
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,000
Of course, it requires

756
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,040
a lot of physical activity

757
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,080
in regards to an actual match,

758
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,920
but I think I can do it

759
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,120
just from learning the basics

760
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,000
with the proper training,

761
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,640
hitting the ropes,

762
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,000
the footwork when circling

763
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,640
around your opponent,

764
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,160
the flipping around and bumping,

765
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,440
which helps with the grapples

766
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,720
and submission moves, etc.

767
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,760
So I guess for the two of you boys,

768
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,720
the question I would like to ask

769
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,160
is what is it about professional wrestling

770
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,400
that makes you want to become one?

771
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,640
Well, can I start off by saying

772
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,320
that if the reason you want to become

773
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,360
a professional wrestler

774
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,160
is because you get to talk

775
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,200
into a microphone,

776
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,320
there's other opportunities to do that

777
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,440
that don't involve

778
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,640
all of that physical stuff

779
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,000
you then listed after that.

780
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
Have you guys ever had the thought

781
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,200
that if it weren't for the physical things,

782
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,600
you could be a pretty good pro wrestler?

783
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,000
Yes.

784
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,400
I'm saying like if you didn't have,

785
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,680
I understand there's a lot

786
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,640
and it's not fake

787
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,840
because people really get hurt

788
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,760
and it's very physically taxing

789
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,640
and thank you for everything

790
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,680
you all have done to your bodies.

791
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,280
But I'm saying if it didn't require any of that,

792
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,320
I feel like I could get like

793
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,240
if it was just like getting the crowd

794
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,840
sort of riled up

795
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,600
and shooting promos

796
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,280
about how many kick somebody's butt.

797
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,200
See the promos aren't that shit, yeah.

798
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
Yeah, I feel like I could do a good job.

799
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,400
I would like to pitch myself

800
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,680
as a professional wrestler

801
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,800
and I would like to frame it

802
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,080
like the Incredible Hulk

803
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,360
and here's what would happen.

804
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,960
I would be the one who would get up

805
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,720
and talk in the microphone, right?

806
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,520
And I would be the one

807
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,640
who did all the promos

808
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,720
and then I would like climb under the stage

809
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,560
or I get into some kind of box

810
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,000
and then who's that coming out of it?

811
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,320
It's like a bigger, stronger version of me

812
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,080
who's not as articulate

813
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,840
but he's in super good shape

814
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,680
and he's ready to do all the actual fighting.

815
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,840
My only thing I would insist on there

816
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,680
is that they can't have a beard

817
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,880
because I do want them

818
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,240
to have to like struggle

819
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,400
with a fake beard the entire match.

820
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,280
I want that to be like

821
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,320
checking their spirit gum

822
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,760
should be like a patented move.

823
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,960
What I love is the idea of

824
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,840
Jimmy John's offers

825
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,600
a special off the menu sandwich

826
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,760
that when you eat it, Travis,

827
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,760
you transform Turbo Teen style

828
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,040
into Brock Lesnar,

829
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,920
the biggest and hungriest man ever to live.

830
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,840
He is hairless like a dolphin

831
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,080
and he is just made of

832
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,640
he's made of like a millimeter thin layer of skin

833
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,800
and then just all blood inside of that.

834
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,120
And so that you eat the Jimmy John's sandwich

835
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,000
and then like a trap door

836
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,200
and the ring opens up

837
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,000
and you fall through

838
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,360
and then Brock pops up

839
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,000
and it's like, oh, here's the big man himself.

840
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,880
He's back again. Travis ate the forbidden sandwich

841
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,080
and now he's ready to rumble.

842
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,120
See that's good.

843
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,280
Is that honestly the greatest

844
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,360
strong person name ever?

845
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,160
Is that a pseudonym

846
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,480
or is that like actually his name?

847
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,840
Yeah, I think that's his Christian.

848
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,200
That's his name is Travis McElroy.

849
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,240
Brock Lesnar.

850
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,440
Yeah, his real name is Travis.

851
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,960
Here's what I like about this.

852
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,160
This gives you

853
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,360
like something to struggle against.

854
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,400
Like I go to eat the sandwich.

855
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,920
They knock the sandwich out of my hand.

856
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,640
Oh no, I'm having to get away from

857
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,920
the only name that's coming to mind

858
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,280
is Brutus the barber beefcake.

859
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,560
I think he's out of the game

860
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,920
but I'm trying to get away from him

861
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,280
before he cuts my hair

862
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,120
and like, oh, I gotta get to that sandwich.

863
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,160
I gotta get to that sandwich.

864
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,360
But Paul Bearer

865
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,440
who I actually think is passed from this world

866
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,800
he's grabbing the sandwich.

867
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,920
Now I'm jumping over the rose

868
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,440
but I have to get back in in time

869
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,920
if I remember from WWE SmackDown

870
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,960
the video game

871
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,160
that I have to get back in

872
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,000
before time counts down or I'm out.

873
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,480
And so I'm trying to get that sandwich back from

874
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,280
and then I get it

875
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,040
and I just as like they're about to get me

876
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,720
I roll under the stage to eat the sandwich.

877
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,800
Boom, Travis, Brock Lesnar, McElroy, he's out.

878
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,920
He's back out there like,

879
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,680
oh, we shouldn't have let him get that sandwich.

880
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,720
Now, now I'm on top, right?

881
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,240
But then they try to eat the sandwich

882
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,960
but Brock Lesnar just slams it in one bite

883
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,400
and he gets even more powerful

884
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,720
because the more he eats, the stronger he gets.

885
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,480
I was on a wrestling podcast

886
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,520
once and I was asked this question.

887
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,840
I've had a lot of time to develop my character

888
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,320
and mine would sort of be like the Pokemon Ditto

889
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,800
where I would just like perfectly mimic

890
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,240
everybody else's moves.

891
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,080
And so like I would get in there

892
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,040
and I would fight against,

893
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,640
I would fight against the Undertaker

894
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,840
only I would be,

895
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,280
I would like do the same,

896
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,440
literally the same exact entrance as him.

897
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,240
And I would get in there

898
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,600
and he's a nine foot tall man

899
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,680
but I would still choke slam him like,

900
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,360
now I'm the Undertaker now.

901
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,160
And I would always,

902
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,200
the thing about my character is

903
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,800
I would always win every fight.

904
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,040
And people wouldn't like me very much.

905
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:29,760
They'd be like,

906
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,520
this is not gonna be a match up very much.

907
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,800
Like here comes John Cena

908
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,560
and also Griffin Cena.

909
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,240
And I think your outfit should always be

910
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,640
a copy of theirs but a very bad one.

911
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,040
Yes.

912
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,720
Like construction paper.

913
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,920
It'll very much be like Kirby in Smash Brothers

914
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,360
where I will run into the ring.

915
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,680
I will very briefly swallow John Cena

916
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,840
and pass him and pass him.

917
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,320
Spin him out.

918
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,520
But then like when I spin him out,

919
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,440
I'm wearing a little hat

920
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,080
and it's backwards

921
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,040
so I've got some wrist cuffs

922
00:46:59,040 --> 00:46:59,520
and I'm not,

923
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,240
I don't have a shirt

924
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,760
and my jeans are off of the knees.

925
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,440
Justin, can I pitch it?

926
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,120
I have an idea for a wrestling presenter for you

927
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,480
and I want you to tell me what you think of this.

928
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,560
The pacifist and your wrestler believes

929
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,480
that the only way to win is to not fight.

930
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,320
And also you have a pacifier.

931
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,080
Okay.

932
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,600
That's very,

933
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,600
and I try to get the pacifier in their mouth.

934
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,080
Yeah.

935
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,120
And if you do,

936
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,720
they have to immediately stop fighting

937
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,360
and you win.

938
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,040
I probably,

939
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,640
I do think it would be a good wrestling move

940
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,600
to lay on the ground

941
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,880
because if you've ever tried

942
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,120
to pick somebody up

943
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,480
who's just laying on the ground

944
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,280
and it ain't easy

945
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,040
and you can't pin somebody on their thumb,

946
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,960
that's not legal.

947
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,920
That's a good point, Justin.

948
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,800
I haven't thought about this.

949
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,120
This is a good character.

950
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,800
Oh, and also your skin is cold and clammy.

951
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,360
I think that a good strat would be

952
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,440
like a good character would be

953
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,440
if you just didn't,

954
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,800
like, you know how every time they do

955
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,080
any kind of wrestling move,

956
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,320
like both people have to work together

957
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,840
to pull it off to make it safe.

958
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,440
My character would be like,

959
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,640
I just wouldn't help out.

960
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,160
Like I'm gonna choke slam you off the top rope,

961
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,360
get in position.

962
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,040
I'd be like, fuck that, no.

963
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,160
No, try it.

964
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,600
I won't let you do that to me.

965
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,960
Try it, tough guy.

966
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,880
Yeah, try to do it to me for real.

967
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,160
How far would you get?

968
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,880
How far would you get in wrestling

969
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,800
if your whole thing was just like,

970
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,280
no, I think I'm just gonna try to beat him up.

971
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:17,840
I think.

972
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,720
I hear what you're saying, Vince,

973
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,000
and I'm loving all of it.

974
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,440
I can totally see the drama,

975
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,200
but here's my unique spin.

976
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,360
I think I'm just gonna go try to beat him up

977
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,880
with my fists and muscles.

978
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,400
It's like a new thing I'm working on.

979
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:33,920
Irish whip you,

980
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,200
and you're supposed to run into the ropes

981
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,480
and then come bounce back.

982
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,760
They would throw me towards the ropes,

983
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,520
and I would just kind of stop and be like,

984
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,560
because I do this,

985
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,240
and then you're gonna hit me with your arm.

986
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,840
And I'm not interested in that.

987
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,640
I want to beat you up.

988
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,960
That's my thing.

989
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,040
I was reading in the script here that I lose,

990
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,640
but let me offer,

991
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,360
I have a different,

992
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,480
what if I win?

993
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,320
What if I beat him up instead of him beating me up?

994
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,480
Call me the improviser.

995
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,680
That will be my whole deals.

996
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,680
They'll never see where I'm coming from.

997
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,040
I'm the real fighter.

998
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,400
But also, I do have to reiterate,

999
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,840
this character would be me

1000
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,040
with my own current human body.

1001
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,840
So like, it would be a real extra.

1002
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,240
What if your special skill was,

1003
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,080
you had an invisible barrier

1004
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,760
that was an inch outside of your body.

1005
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,000
So anytime anyone else tried to hit you,

1006
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,280
they couldn't do it,

1007
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,480
but you could hit them.

1008
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,320
That would be the character I would want to play.

1009
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,160
You're saying,

1010
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,800
I try to enforce an imaginary force field.

1011
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,960
If they touch me,

1012
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,120
they have violated my unique fiction.

1013
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,760
Who's that coming down the ramp?

1014
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,880
It's Magic Jerry.

1015
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,080
What's up guys?

1016
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,440
Shazam, you're dead.

1017
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,800
Zip, zip, zap, zip, zip, zap.

1018
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,720
John Cena has died from some sort of magic.

1019
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,520
Hey, I did a hadouken.

1020
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,640
You're supposed to fall.

1021
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,600
Look at my hands.

1022
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,960
That's a hadouken.

1023
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:07,840
Everybody saw it.

1024
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,920
Magic Jerry just yelled yoga fire

1025
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,520
and Ryback is on the ground.

1026
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,720
We're all very worried about it.

1027
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,800
Here's another question.

1028
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,400
There's this guy I used to be friends with,

1029
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,880
but we haven't spoken regularly in a couple of years.

1030
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,760
I guess they just use silly voices and stuff.

1031
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,800
I honestly didn't even know him that well

1032
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,840
when we were in contact,

1033
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,760
but for some inexplicable reason,

1034
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,840
he always texts me right after he has sex with someone,

1035
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,600
tells me about it in vivid detail,

1036
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,360
and then does not contact me again

1037
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,880
until the next time he bones down.

1038
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,960
Why did he choose me for this?

1039
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,600
How can I get it to stop?

1040
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,120
Please, God, can someone help me?

1041
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,960
And that's from Nasty in Nashville.

1042
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,400
All right, you dirty bird.

1043
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,360
Let me tell you something.

1044
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,280
You can block someone on your phone.

1045
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,800
So newsflash, you like it.

1046
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,120
You like it.

1047
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,800
I don't think we should put this ball

1048
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,680
in this person's court.

1049
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,640
You should block them,

1050
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,520
because this is weird,

1051
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,440
but the question stands.

1052
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,800
Why were you chose?

1053
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,360
What was it about me?

1054
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,480
What is it about you that they were like,

1055
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,760
oh, I know who would like this.

1056
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:15,600
Steven.

1057
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,520
You're saving his phone as Nasty Steven.

1058
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,560
Steven, not just that Steven will like this,

1059
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,480
but that Steven needs this.

1060
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,200
Consistently, Steven needs to know.

1061
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,360
I want Steven to not worry about whether or not

1062
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,280
I'm able to bone on the reg,

1063
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,640
or also maybe just like,

1064
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,280
I think Steven really needs to know

1065
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,640
the ins and outs of this whole situation.

1066
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,880
Yeah, damn, that's a good point.

1067
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,880
Or maybe it's a curse situation

1068
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,920
where it's like you said to this person,

1069
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,960
like, I bet you don't ever get any of that good.

1070
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,960
I bet you've never had the full Randall before.

1071
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,600
And they say, oh, is that true?

1072
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,120
Interesting.

1073
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,040
And then they did a curse on your phone.

1074
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,280
Maybe now every time they do have sex,

1075
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,360
that when you gave this person your phone number,

1076
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,400
as they were in on it,

1077
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,280
did they say anything like nice finally got one

1078
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,280
or my first one?

1079
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,640
And maybe you're the only contact they have in their phone.

1080
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,720
So they're just trying to get it out there.

1081
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,720
Oh, so, and like the friend that introduced you

1082
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,800
to this friend was like, I'm free.

1083
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,080
And Randall follows.

1084
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,600
Maybe you get, maybe you're getting BCC

1085
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,400
and you don't realize it.

1086
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,440
And this person just shouts.

1087
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,800
And they don't know it either.

1088
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,160
And they're so embarrassed.

1089
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,080
They just shout to the whole, no, they know.

1090
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,120
They're like, I did it.

1091
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,200
Gotta tell everybody on my phone.

1092
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,240
You're saying that this isn't a targeted message.

1093
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,520
This is no, it's going out.

1094
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,560
It's going out to Steve.

1095
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:52,960
It's going out.

1096
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,240
It's a newsletter.

1097
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,080
It's going out to mom home.

1098
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,520
It's going out to mom work.

1099
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,960
It's going out to dominoes.

1100
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,280
It's going out to fifth street dominoes.

1101
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:08,960
I got a Yahoo.

1102
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,080
We can jump too.

1103
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,840
Yeah, real quick though.

1104
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,160
Real quick from Drew Davenport, level 9,000.

1105
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,040
Thank you, Drew.

1106
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:17,920
It's by Yahoo answers user.

1107
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,880
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

1108
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,840
I'm going to call this person.

1109
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,720
Sheamus asks who would win in a fight?

1110
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:31,520
One Godzilla sized pug, one million pug sized Godzilla's

1111
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,400
or Kevin from home alone.

1112
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,480
I think we can deal with this one pretty quickly.

1113
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,240
It's such a good question, right?

1114
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,560
It's that one horse sized duck or 10 duck sized horses

1115
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,440
or something like that.

1116
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,440
But this one takes it up a notch.

1117
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,200
One Godzilla sized pug, one million pug sized Godzilla's.

1118
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,400
Let's just say you deal with that.

1119
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,840
You think that over for so long.

1120
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,160
Like get small Godzilla's that could still fuck shit up.

1121
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,520
But a big pug could just step on them.

1122
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,120
But then also Kevin is there.

1123
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,920
Okay, so if it's a one to one, okay.

1124
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,760
So if it's a one to one, the Godzilla,

1125
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,480
if it's a one to one pugs, the Godzilla sized pug

1126
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,600
would I think be consumed like piranha style

1127
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,360
by the large number of Godzilla's.

1128
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,640
The tiny Godzilla's could overwhelm him almost instantly.

1129
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,880
Especially he says pugs are not inherently

1130
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,440
bloodthirsty vicious creatures.

1131
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,040
Counterpoint, they don't need to be.

1132
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,360
This is a dog the size of a fucking building.

1133
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,480
Just by moving around, I will say they're energetical obese.

1134
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,320
And so they will run around and scamper around.

1135
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:41,120
And in doing so, they will destroy scores of Zillas

1136
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:41,760
with each step.

1137
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,840
But then Kevin's there.

1138
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,080
I think whoever wins the first contest

1139
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,400
will then immediately kill and eat Kevin

1140
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,840
because he's a child.

1141
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,480
He's a little child and he doesn't have superpowers.

1142
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,560
No one gave him any pain.

1143
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,520
He's just a child and he would get immediately consumed.

1144
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,320
I would like to throw in a counterpoint.

1145
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,120
I think if we assume that one Godzilla sized pug

1146
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,080
is an equal match for how many was it?

1147
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:12,580
10,000?

1148
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,560
A million, right?

1149
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,240
A million is tricking me up.

1150
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,400
Okay, well, let's say that however many

1151
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,520
makes an equal match for a Godzilla sized pug, right?

1152
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,640
Now, Kevin is just one tiny flesh boy,

1153
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,880
but he's gonna tip the balance of whatever side

1154
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,080
he decides to join.

1155
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,400
So I would say that his best course,

1156
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,640
if we're talking about this Sun Tzu style,

1157
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,000
it's his best course is to ally with either one of them.

1158
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,560
I would go with the Godzilla sized pug myself

1159
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,320
so you could ride it Falcor style,

1160
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,600
but you side with him and then you let him be weakened

1161
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,600
by the X amount of pug sized Godzilla's.

1162
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,680
Then you turn on him at the end

1163
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,920
because you are still fresh from the fight

1164
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,440
and you are able to take him down.

1165
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,480
But if we're talking about-

1166
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,440
In what reality?

1167
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,880
What exact, okay, you can't just say take him down.

1168
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,440
Even if he's a bruised and battered,

1169
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,560
he's still Godzilla sized and he's a tiny boy.

1170
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,120
Like I don't care how many fucking Tonka trucks

1171
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,240
he puts in front of this thug, he's a giant dog.

1172
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,600
He's gonna kill and eat him.

1173
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,680
Who wins in a fight, Justin?

1174
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,480
Kevin from Home Alone with all of his traps

1175
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,600
and his deviousness or Matthew Broderick?

1176
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,080
Because Matthew Broderick has killed Godzilla

1177
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,080
and all of Godzilla's children.

1178
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,000
So what's it look like?

1179
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,760
Well, Kevin's got all his traps.

1180
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,160
I also wanna say, Griffin, just no spoilers.

1181
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,000
He doesn't kill all of Godzilla's children.

1182
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,440
There's still one in the locker room.

1183
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,400
Shit, you're right.

1184
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,520
Let's credit where credit is due.

1185
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,040
Yeah, I think the only shot Kevin has in this conflict

1186
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,720
is to go into the basement and wait.

1187
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,520
And as he listens, the million Godzilla,

1188
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,760
tiny Godzilla's will eat everybody else

1189
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,080
and then they'll leave.

1190
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,440
And then, cause they'll have to keep eating like a shark

1191
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,360
and then he can maybe come out later after a few years.

1192
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,640
To a blighted world.

1193
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,960
To a blighted world and then say like,

1194
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,800
I guess I'm still here.

1195
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:25,840
And then just as he's having this moment of amazing triumph,

1196
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,480
he'll drop his talk boy and it'll break

1197
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,800
and he'll be like, no, not now.

1198
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,440
Yeah, now I truly am home alone.

1199
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:35,520
He'll say.

1200
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,920
And he has to repopulate the earth

1201
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,880
with Buzz's girlfriend, the wolf.

1202
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,640
Yeah, it could be the sequel to Home Alone 2

1203
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,440
lost in New York and it'd be Home Alone 3, New York is lost.

1204
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:52,000
And for that joke to work, you have to do what I do,

1205
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,920
which is pretend that Home Alone,

1206
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,440
anything after Home Alone 2 doesn't exist.

1207
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:56,480
Yes.

1208
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,600
Should we wrap up?

1209
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,800
Yeah, let's finish this delightful episode.

1210
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,840
They should have made,

1211
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,760
they need to make a new Home Alone 2 now,

1212
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,720
but combine Home Alone and like the White House down movies,

1213
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,440
but like Kevin trying to protect the White House

1214
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,880
from like international terrorists

1215
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,720
and he's trying to save the president.

1216
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,840
Fuck, I would watch that.

1217
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,040
Why isn't that real?

1218
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,240
They could get Charlie Hunnam.

1219
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:23,200
I would buy that actually if it was like Home Alone 6

1220
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,400
and it's Charlie Hunnam as a grownup Kevin McCallister

1221
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,160
trying to save the president with traps.

1222
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,320
Don't mind if I do enjoy that film.

1223
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,360
Thank you very much.

1224
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:31,600
Right?

1225
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,440
Is it too late?

1226
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,400
Can we make that?

1227
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,120
Hollywood.

1228
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,440
Yo, Hollywood, make me that please.

1229
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,160
Can Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci be the terrorist leaders,

1230
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:40,800
I guess?

1231
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,480
Yes, yes they can.

1232
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,080
Yeah, they're in there.

1233
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,040
They're in the mix.

1234
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,400
I think Daniel Stern would be in,

1235
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,080
I think he would, I think he'd sign on.

1236
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,440
Pesci might be a bigger get.

1237
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,360
Oh, no, no, no.

1238
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,160
Pesci and Stern are the two that like Kevin

1239
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,800
like has to turn to like to work with.

1240
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,600
Yes, the team up.

1241
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,160
Fuck yes.

1242
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:58,880
Are you kidding me?

1243
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,840
Are you, I'm fucking so in love with this movie.

1244
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,640
They're like elderly and he has to go to them

1245
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,000
and be like, one more job.

1246
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,320
Just to break into the White House together as a team up.

1247
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,440
Are you kidding?

1248
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,560
We're not gonna help you kid.

1249
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,760
We're gonna kill you.

1250
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,040
Guys, it's ISIS.

1251
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:18,560
Okay.

1252
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,600
Listen, I may be a dirty crook,

1253
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,440
but I'm a red blooded American through and through.

1254
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,400
Let's do this.

1255
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,080
The patriotic bandits right again.

1256
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,240
The patriotic bandits this time.

1257
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,320
And we got a third member and it's Kevin.

1258
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,120
And then at the end, they do try to kill him,

1259
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,680
but they can't because he's Kevin McAllister

1260
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,680
and he had traps ready for them.

1261
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:41,920
Yeah.

1262
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,560
Oh, he was looking for that double cross.

1263
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,920
Fuck yes.

1264
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,360
Oh, make it.

1265
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,720
We need this now more than ever.

1266
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:50,720
Shit.

1267
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,240
I want this movie.

1268
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,520
I want this movie.

1269
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,560
I want this movie.

1270
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,720
What's Brenda Fricker gonna do?

1271
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,240
Oh, she teams up with Snow Shovel Man.

1272
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,440
They're working together.

1273
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,520
Snow Shovel Man is there with Brenda Fricker

1274
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,400
at the last minute.

1275
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,840
They fused into one magic old person.

1276
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,800
This seems kind of gross at first,

1277
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,360
but then they turn out to be completely normal and nice.

1278
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:15,920
Fuck yeah.

1279
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:17,280
Shit.

1280
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,720
And then Brenda Fricker turns into doves.

1281
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,640
She just turns into pigeons.

1282
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,400
Yeah, it turns into like a John Woo movie

1283
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,040
with Brenda Fricker like throwing doves at them.

1284
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,280
Long dead doves.

1285
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,160
Shit.

1286
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:35,280
Shit.

1287
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:35,600
Okay.

1288
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,000
Shit.

1289
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:36,480
So anyway.

1290
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,280
Good movie.

1291
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,000
Good movie.

1292
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,680
It's a good movie that exists now.

1293
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,760
I mean, we've basically spoken it into existence.

1294
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,840
Thank you to everyone who has kicked in gifts

1295
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,040
to the MBMBAM Angels campaign for the year.

1296
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,640
You all are doing an amazing job.

1297
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,600
If you don't know, here's like the very, very brief version.

1298
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,040
We are trying to help out people in our area

1299
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,520
who aren't gonna have much of a holiday without you,

1300
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,640
our beloved listeners.

1301
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,720
There's a list of people at MBMBAMangels.com

1302
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,080
that you can choose one and you send them things.

1303
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,960
You can do Amazon, just send gifts to help

1304
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,600
and you claim them off the list and you feel great

1305
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,520
and you help people who really need it.

1306
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,960
And you all rise to the challenge every year.

1307
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,120
And this year was our biggest list ever.

1308
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,200
It felt like by a country mile

1309
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,880
and everybody's just like crushing it.

1310
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,960
What I love is, and a lot of people know about this,

1311
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,160
we've been doing it for a while,

1312
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,680
but I don't know if everybody knows the backstory

1313
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,720
and that this was a thing that like the newspaper used to do.

1314
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,080
And then like-

1315
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:36,800
And they still help.

1316
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,440
They still help.

1317
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,080
And they still help.

1318
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,960
Yeah, definitely, but like our audience just ate it up.

1319
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,000
Our audience was like, you know, this is ours.

1320
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,800
Like a million pug-sized Godzillas.

1321
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:47,920
Yeah, just consumed it

1322
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,480
like a million Godzilla-sized Kevin Arnolds.

1323
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,360
Hey, hold on, not Kevin Arnolds.

1324
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,800
That's another one, isn't it?

1325
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,960
I can buy, you can buy gifts on there

1326
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,840
or you can just kick in some cash if you wanna do that

1327
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,600
because they're trying to buy big ticket items

1328
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:04,080
like people don't have beds and ovens

1329
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:09,520
and it's really depressing until you decide that you can fix it.

1330
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,640
And you can, you can fix this.

1331
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,400
Go to my bim bam angels.com

1332
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,360
and let's get those final 15% done.

1333
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,760
I was gonna say right now,

1334
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,240
we are also participating in World Builders,

1335
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,360
which is a charity that was started by Patrick Rothfuss.

1336
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,360
It benefits Heifer International, Mercy Corps,

1337
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:33,040
and First Book, you know, helping people out.

1338
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:37,680
And we're, I think we're, this week I think is the end of it.

1339
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,800
I'm not sure, but right now we've already raised

1340
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:45,680
over $1,500 through the Mbem Bambinos World Builders Group.

1341
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,920
And for every $10 you donate,

1342
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,640
you get entered into a lottery to win cool stuff

1343
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,760
and you get to be a part of the Mbem Bambino team.

1344
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,720
So if you wanna go to bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M-W-B,

1345
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,600

1346
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,240
We're also participating in some live streams

01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,520
with Patrick this week.

1348
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,960
Not sure what time this will go up,

1349
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,400
but if it goes up in time,

1350
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,960

1351
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,240

1352
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,400
And then I'm also doing one on Wednesday at 5 p.m. Eastern,

1353
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,840
talking about like mental health

1354
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,760
and how important it is to take care of yourself.

1355
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,120
And we'll tweet that link as well.

1356
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And yeah, go check it out, support a good cause.

1357
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,440
I wanna thank John Roderick in the long winters

1358
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,320
for these sort of theme song.

1359
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,400
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1360
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,240
It is a wonderful, wonderful album

1361
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,480
and a great holiday time present

1362
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,800
for a loved one or for yourself.

1363
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,600
It's really good.

1364
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,760
I guarantee you're gonna love it.

1365
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,120
Also wanna thank Maximum Fun for having us.

1366
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,400
You can go to maximumfun.org

1367
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,040
and just start clicking on shows and listening to them,

1368
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,440
like the Beef and Dairy Network and Jordan Jesse Go!

1369
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,520
and Throwing Shade and One Bad Mother.

1370
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,360
There's a ton of good shows that you can find all in there.

1371
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,640
If you wanna find other stuff that we do,

1372
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,480
you can go to mcroyshows.com

1373
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,120

and all of our Twitters and addresses

1375
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,520
and all kinds of fun stuff all there.

1376
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,640
We are gonna be doing a Candle Nights episode

1377
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,240
here in a couple of weeks or so.

1378
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,200
So please get in your Candle Nights themed questions.

1379
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,200
Oh, Griffin, you mentioned gifts.

1380
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,160
We haven't mentioned in a while maxfunstore.com

1381
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,600
has merch from all kinds of different Max Fun shows,

1382
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,880
including My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1383
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,800
I think there's probably still time to get self-ordered

1384
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,080
and get it in time for Christmas.

1385
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,560
But if not, you can always hand them a piece of paper

1386
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,000
that says, I owe you.

1387
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,560
It says, I owe you one t-shirt.

1388
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,600
But go check out maxfunstore.com

1389
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,040
and there's lots of cool shit there.

1390
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:33,840
You said Max Fun.

1391
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,880
That reminded me, I was on another Maximum Fun podcast

1392
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,680
called Still Buffering this week to talk about video games.

1393
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,400
And it was a lot of fun.

1394
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,120
And you can find that wherever fine podcasts are sold.

1395
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,400
Still Buffering.

1396
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,520
It's a good show about being a teen that anybody can enjoy.

1397
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,640
That's it for the episode.

1398
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,600

1399
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,240

1404
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,360
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

1405
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,720
This website fucking sucks.

1406
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,520
I'm gonna say their name is Jason.

1407
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,640
Jason, what is he?

1408
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:12,160
Asks, I heard that if you get a Taco Bell tattoo,

1409
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,840
they will give you fee food for life.

1410
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,560
Is this true?

1411
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,600

This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

Kiss your dad.

1416
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:27,200
Square on the lips.
