1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:51,440
Ladies and gentlemen, after taking a week off to finish our groundbreaking work on the Herman

6
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,440
Cain campaign, we return to you, my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era

7
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:05,200
with heavy hearts today. We drove that bitch until the wheels fell off, right? Somebody put a penny

8
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,080
on the track, and that penny was common sense, and it knocked us clean up. That penny is called

9
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,400
sexual harassment allegations, and allegations of a long-term affair, and that penny, it took the

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,280
cane tray and cleaned off the tracks. Is that really? Where did we go wrong, Travis? Griffin,

11
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,480
where did we go wrong? I just can't believe that something that minute ended our nation's most

12
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:36,400
beautiful dream. Something as small as a 13-year-long illicit affair. Yeah, that's only

13
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:44,560
an affair that is as old as a seventh grader. You know, if we looked at time in its completeness,

14
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:52,720
13 years? Not that much. Consider the fullness of time, Huffington Post. Give it a thought. Give it

15
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:01,280
a once-over. Give it a once-over, you jerks. You know, I told my children that they would live to

16
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:10,000
see a day when a black, unqualified man could be president of this country, and you are ruining-

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,440
you are making me a liar to my non-existent children. I told my 13-year-old love child

18
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,640
that he would get to see his daddy in the White House. And mommy won to walk across that stage

19
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,960
as mommy, too, clapped inconspicuously from the crowd. I promised him that, sir.

20
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,080
Guys. That's a lot of America. You ruined it.

21
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,360
Well, hey. This, of course, is an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother

22
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,080
and campaign manager, Justin McElroy. I am your middlest brother and intern,

23
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,320
Travis McElroy. And I am Griffin McElroy, the charming and witty press secretary.

24
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,000
Hey, I saw you and Danny Kankanen in the back of the room.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,920
Oh, we were smoochin'.

26
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,600
Smoochin'? Do not approve.

27
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,440
I'd smooch his beard clean off.

28
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,200
Hey, where's your beard, Timothy Busfield? Go ahead and smooch it off again.

29
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,400
Smooch it off. Give me a sweet goldfish, you sweet, sweet bearded man.

30
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,480
So, brothers, I really like this girl, and she likes me. However,

31
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,480
she is two to three inches taller than me. Is this a deal breaker? That's from Compact

32
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,640
in Kentucky.

33
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,920
Why are you so small?

34
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,720
Why are you so small?

35
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,600
Why are you so tiny?

36
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,360
Why are you so little?

37
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,000
Hey, little guy.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,440
You know, two to three inches? Are you shitting me?

39
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:31,920
Yeah.

40
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,000
We just wasted three months of our life trying to get Herman Cain elected president,

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and you're worried about two to three inches?

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,640
Now, if it was two to three feet, yeah, it's a deal breaker. She's like nine feet tall.

43
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,320
Right. She's a big, friendly giant.

44
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,880
I'm dating Mandy the Giant, and that was the closest female version of Andrea.

45
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,560
As I said, you mean Mondre?

46
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,840
Andrea. Damn it.

47
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,560
Damn it.

48
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,120
Yeah.

49
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,840
Here's the thing. What I like about this kind of worry is if this was a girl,

50
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,760
and she was saying, I like this guy, but he's two to three inches taller than me,

51
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,840
everyone would be like, that's stupid. What are you talking about?

52
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,600
I think it's a little bit sexist.

53
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,840
Is it sexist or is it scientifically proven that men are a little bit taller than women, Travis?

54
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,400
Just a little bit. Not a lot. Just a little bit. And not all women.

55
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,680
I know women who are taller than me.

56
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,080
Griffin, I did read your paper titled Women Be Short, and I thought that was really interesting.

57
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:31,280
Well, it's not. They got those tiny little robin bones like a robin bird has.

58
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,360
Travis, I wanted to ask you something about Herman Cain real quick before I return to the question.

59
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,960
You're not so great with keeping up on politics, right?

60
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,280
You are sometimes out of the loop as far as that stuff goes.

61
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:53,120
Travis, are you aware that in his final speech suspending his campaign,

62
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,280
and I promise we will return to this question in just a moment,

63
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,920
are you aware that in his final campaign speech he quoted the Pokemon movie?

64
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,800
And not just quoted the Pokemon movie, but specifically cited,

65
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,360
I believe these words came from the Pokemon movie.

66
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,480
Life can be a challenge. Life could seem impossible. It's never easy when there's so much on the line.

67
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,720
Are you kidding me?

68
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,760
No, I'm not.

69
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,760
No, okay. I want you guys to know I was in no way invested in his campaign,

70
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,720
but only now when he's gone do I realize what I missed.

71
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,240
Yeah, you don't. Don't it always seem to go?

72
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,640
Hey, paradise, and quoted Pokemon.

73
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,800
Somebody tweeted about him like he wasn't having affairs.

74
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,320
He was just trying to catch them all.

75
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,400
Yeah, that makes sense now.

76
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,400
Guys, we have to go back.

77
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,000
So anyway,

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,520
We have to go back.

79
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,560
We have to go back to the train.

80
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,200
I'm gonna have to wait till 2016 to get that beautiful motherfucker back on the stage and

81
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,760
just know it.

82
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,440
Damn it.

83
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,720
Is there any other things that he can run for in the meantime?

84
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,760
Yeah, we could use a new mayor.

85
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,920
Of all cities, can he just be the across the board mayor?

86
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,720
The super mayor.

87
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,640
I have a problem.

88
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,440
My super mayor is two to three inches taller than me.

89
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,560
And made of metal.

90
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,920
And made of metal and has missile fingers.

91
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,080
Okay, you guys might tell me if I'm out of line here.

92
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,680
I feel like this two to three inch taller problem is only a problem depending on how old they are.

93
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,160
Is it?

94
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,520
If they're in high school versus like 26, 27.

95
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,760
High schoolers don't know how to use the internet to email though.

96
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,840
That is true.

97
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,200
They don't learn that till college.

98
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,080
Yeah, they're not allowed.

99
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,520
Hey, why don't you know?

100
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,640
If you're so hung up on this, why don't you know exactly how much the difference is?

101
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,160
2.4 inches taller than me.

102
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,400
If you're on a metric system, you could do that.

103
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,640
Yeah.

104
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,120
Right.

105
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,720
God damn our stupid inch system.

106
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,360
I know.

107
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,480
But the thing is I feel like maybe if she's taller than him,

108
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,840
he's worried that he'll catch some flack from other students and other bullies and whatnot.

109
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,840
She's so big that she'll absorb all the flack for him.

110
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,400
Oh, I see.

111
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,040
Right.

112
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,480
She can take that flack.

113
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Leave tiny boyfriend alone.

114
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
Maybe they're both super tall.

115
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,640
And one of them is less super tall than the other.

116
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,240
She's seven foot five and I'm only seven foot two.

117
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,640
Right.

118
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,680
I'm afraid her parents are going to try to dunk on me.

119
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,920
That was not a deal breaker.

120
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,600
To answer the question, not a deal breaker.

121
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,200
If you're so concerned about it, then why don't you buy some man pumps?

122
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,120
Yeah, man pumps are available.

123
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,360
Slap some man pumps on that bitch and then height problem solved.

124
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,840
No joke.

125
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,040
Cowboy boots will give you like another inch and a half to two inches.

126
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,720
Look, you're halfway there.

127
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,680
Now put a nice spiky stiletto on your cowboy boot and you'll be five inches taller.

128
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,960
And a 10 gallon hat.

129
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,560
Get yourself a 10 gallon hat.

130
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,680
That's the look right there.

131
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,520
You got to get yourself a cowboy ugly boot and a coyote ugly.

132
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:15,840
Fuck.

133
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,240
You got to find yourself an ugly cowboy.

134
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,160
You got to find an ugly cowboy and ride him to save a horse.

135
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,720
Big and rich.

136
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,000
Big and rich.

137
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,560
Hey, in August, I moved into a house with three friends from college.

138
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,560
While I was out one day, my roommates decorated the house without asking me.

139
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,320
I hate the art they hung up on the walls.

140
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,280
Here's the rub.

141
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,320
The art was all done by my roommate's girlfriend of five years.

142
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,160
There's no way I can broach the subject without coming off like a complete asshole.

143
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,840
What do I do?

144
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,520
That's from Irkt in Indiana.

145
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,920
You hire someone to rob your house.

146
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,040
Oh my God, Travis.

147
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,920
That's brilliant.

148
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:00,880
Thank you.

149
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:08,480
It's a art thief with great taste, apparently, because he stole all of Janie's paintings of

150
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,200
her dog and her dog's friends' dogs.

151
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,480
The other option is, I think, equally as good.

152
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,360
And that is you hire someone to dress as an art collector and sweep into the room in their

153
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,480
half cape and beret and say, I'll take them.

154
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,720
Yeah.

155
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,800
That's going to require some-

156
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,920
As the cigarette dangles from the long cigarette holder with their tiny mustache.

157
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,800
Speaking of cigarettes-

158
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,680
An eye patch.

159
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,160
Speaking of cigarettes, maybe burn the apartment down.

160
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,640
Hey.

161
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,760
That's another solution.

162
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,800
Why don't you speak up and talk to your rude ass roommate who decorated?

163
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,640
Yeah, I just put some paintings in your room.

164
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,520
Is that cool?

165
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,480
It's absolutely not.

166
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
It is absolutely not cool.

167
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,600
These paintings are not cool with me.

168
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,320
I don't feel like an asshole because he's the fucking guy who made all the Martha Stewart

169
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,640
decisions without asking you, and that's the best part of a house, is that you get to decorate

170
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,840
and make it your own.

171
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,280
You didn't make it your own, though.

172
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,040
You made it Jeff's.

173
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,920
Jeff was the asshole first, and now you are completely within your right to be like, hey,

174
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,400
this decoration choice, we tried it out for a while.

175
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,760
I don't think it's working.

176
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,840
My friends who come over, they don't like it, and we want to switch it out for something

177
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,200
else and see how that works.

178
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,240
Is this art violently sexual?

179
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,480
Like really, really-

180
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,680
This is all boobs.

181
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,640
Aggressively sexual.

182
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,840
Boobs everywhere.

183
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,320
Yeah.

184
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,820
Yeah.

185
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,120
Why don't you get your own art that is in fact violently sexual and hang it up?

186
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,720
Say, I don't know, I'm just trying this out too.

187
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,240
This is my painting and it's five dogs playing poker.

188
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,840
Also, they have giant boners.

189
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,340
Yeah.

190
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:46,100
You need to have this conversation with your roommate.

191
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,060
That's option one.

192
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,020
You talk to him about it.

193
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,900
Option two, guy comes in and buys them.

194
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,180
Option three, burn it down.

195
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,500
Option four, thief, art thief.

196
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah.

197
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,140
I think the other one is you just suffer.

198
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,940
Just eat it.

199
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,860
You know, so often we rush to fix the little things that

200
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,580
plague us, but it's like you don't appreciate breathing until you try to hold your breath.

201
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,080
Yeah.

202
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,580
Why don't you just try living with something you hate for a while and then it'd be such

203
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,460
a refreshing change when you finally get out of it.

204
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:24,900
But is it possible that our listener here, say his name is Stephen, that these paintings

205
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:30,260
just say like, Stephen's a dick and they're just like, patients of Stephen with a knife

206
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,900
in his head.

207
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,100
This is absolutely-

208
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,860
Patients of Stephen with a knife in his head.

209
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,820
This is an apple, but the apple is saying, fuck you, Stephen.

210
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,320
Yeah.

211
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,060
I do not think that is...

212
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,220
Oh, and then the roommate and his girlfriend are just standing there going, what do you

213
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,500
think, Stephen?

214
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:53,220
I believe this is from her 2011 Stephen Sucks Dick collection.

215
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:59,140
This magnum opus is titled, Fuck Off, Stephen, You're a Jerk.

216
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,580
And that's it.

217
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,700
That's the end of the painting.

218
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,940
It ends on ellipses because it's art.

219
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,580
Is this that big of a deal?

220
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,660
I feel like I don't even notice art most of the time.

221
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,860
I don't think it's that big of a deal, but I can see where this would be the kind of

222
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,580
thing that just kind of eats at you and just like you come home from a hard day at work

223
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,460
and suddenly you look up and there's that stupid ass painting.

224
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,060
It's like, here's one more thing I don't need.

225
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,500
I can see where it would be a tiny thing that just bugs at you.

226
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,900
But if it's like two werewolves sucking each other off, then you are going to notice it

227
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,180
every time you walk into the house.

228
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,780
You're going to be embarrassed to bring people.

229
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,900
I'm saying this is...

230
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,300
We're definitely dealing with an aggressively sexual lycanthropic art situation.

231
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,780
Maybe it's...

232
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,340
It's Taylor Lautner.

233
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:58,100
He's man from the waist up, werewolf from the waist down, from the waist out, he is

234
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,900
all boner, extending on the Y axis.

235
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,340
Oh, God.

236
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,420
Maybe you just one day when they're out, you redecorate and be like, oh, I thought this

237
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,700
was the thing we were doing, man.

238
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,700
Just taking turns redecorating every couple months.

239
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,060
I thought it was my month to have some shitty paintings.

240
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,940
Sorry, Jenny.

241
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,660
I didn't mean that.

242
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,580
No offense.

243
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,940
I didn't mean shitty, Jenny.

244
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,580
Griffin, do you have a...

245
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,860
Maybe they are shitty paintings.

246
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,340
Maybe that's her medium, is human fecal matter.

247
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,500
There's so many ways for this art to be bad art.

248
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,060
Get out of here, bad art.

249
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:30,980
I have a Yahoo.

250
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,740
This Yahoo was sent in by Atiana Kuriana.

251
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,540
Thank you, Atiana.

252
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:42,580
It's by Yahoo Answers user Allison, who asks, any good Facebook statuses?

253
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,180
I know this sounds tacky, but I haven't updated my status in a while.

254
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,620
And do any of you have any good statuses that will get a lot of likes?

255
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,300
They have to be appropriate for a teenage girl

256
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,220
because my mom gets on Facebook like every day.

257
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,260
Any funny, meaningful, meaningless, or cool statuses?

258
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,500
All answers greatly appreciated.

259
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:02,900
Thank you.

260
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,020
I don't want to live in this world anymore.

261
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,860
That's what the status should be?

262
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,380
No, that's what the title of my autobiography is.

263
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:15,880
Okay.

264
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,700
Do you know that they just bumped up the Facebook status limit?

265
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,260
Uh, the amount of characters you can use to 63,000.

266
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,940
That's important.

267
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,620
Sometimes people make fucking manifest.

268
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,180
Sometimes people write novellas and post them on the Facebook.

269
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,700
63,000.

270
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:31,940
Yeah.

271
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,860
And then they tag you in it and you're not in it till the end.

272
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,360
Yeah.

273
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,180
And you read that whole dumb thing.

274
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,140
I just read about your whole fucking Christmas trip to Target.

275
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,980
Thanks for wasting my entire life.

276
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,660
Yeah.

277
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,740
Why did you even tell everybody about that?

278
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,060
How?

279
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,020
Who has this much time?

280
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,260
You know, when I last updated my status update?

281
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,340
When I want people to know that I did something cool.

282
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,260
That's the only time that you should ever update your status or Twitter or anything.

283
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,140
If you're doing something cooler than somebody else might be doing that exact second,

284
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,860
that's when you tweet.

285
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,260
Or you're making something good for dinner.

286
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,540
For half of my status updates, just say, check out this thing I did.

287
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,900
That's basically it.

288
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,100
I made this.

289
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,940
I made this thing.

290
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,020
Okay, and as much as I hate people that are just like, I went to the store today.

291
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:20,500
What I really hate is those ones that are like, you know, a true friend will do this,

292
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,580
but a dear friend, and I'm just like, fuck you.

293
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,220
You know, that's people that don't actually have friends.

294
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,540
Can you give me an example of what you mean, Travis?

295
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,060
Oh, you're gonna have to give me a second.

296
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,260
I love an example too.

297
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,060
I would love this.

298
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,340
You're gonna have to give me a second.

299
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,220
No, no, no.

300
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,540
I would love it just like straight off the dome freestyle.

301
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,460
I don't know.

302
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,580
Oh, God, give me a fuck.

303
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,980
So like a true friend will drive you to the airport.

304
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,460
A dear friend will fly the plane.

305
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,700
A good guy will get you flowers.

306
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,020
The right guy will eat them for you.

307
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,060
I don't know.

308
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,580
Eat these flowers.

309
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,460
Prove you love me.

310
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,660
Eat these rhododendrons.

311
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,220
Prove your love and eat the rhododendrons.

312
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,180
Eat them, David.

313
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,540
Bite the rose.

314
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,180
Bite the rose, David.

315
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,300
Bite the rose, David.

316
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:10,980
Guys.

317
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,780
Gingerly.

318
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:19,220
She needs a real knock them out of the park Facebook status

319
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,180
update that's gonna win her all kinds of awards.

320
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,700
So basically what's gonna get her like the Nobel Peace Prize

321
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,460
for Facebook status messages.

322
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:27,860
Yeah.

323
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,060
Here, I'll give you an example.

324
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,340
Dwight suggested another day, another food stamp.

325
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,500
I don't understand, Dwight.

326
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,020
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

327
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,060
Can you explain?

328
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,260
Uh, no, I can't.

329
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,900
Cause he didn't.

330
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,620
Wouldn't it be nice if iPods could detect your mood and make

331
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,660
a playlist for it?

332
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,260
Oh man.

333
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,340
That's so now that's so now and so hip kids care about.

334
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,180
No, that would be terrifying.

335
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,700
All about playlists and moods.

336
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,540
When I fall down a flight of stairs, I'm not worried about

337
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,580
if I'm hurt.

338
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,020
I'm worried if anybody saw.

339
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,020
Wow.

340
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,100
Post-it that shit yourself.

341
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,460
Yeah, these fucking snuff film videographer guy.

342
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,860
How often are you falling downstairs that you're thinking

343
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,820
about this this much?

344
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,900
When I fall down stairs, I think I wish I could start falling

345
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,260
down these damn stairs.

346
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,940
I wish my legs worked better.

347
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,980
I think I really got to put that light bulb back in.

348
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,420
Damn these Crisco stairs.

349
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,260
Wait a minute.

350
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:30,500
What?

351
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,020
You know, it's made out of lard.

352
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,220
They're made out of their stairs made from lard now.

353
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:37,620
Well, not.

354
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,780
I mean, not primarily, but that's just like the finishing

355
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,420
coat.

356
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:40,980
Oh, my God.

357
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,100
They put a coat you wrote.

358
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,220
You mean they pledge them.

359
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,620
They use the pledge and then they Crisco them.

360
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,660
Then they lard them.

361
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,340
Do you live in the home alone house?

362
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:48,820
Is that what?

363
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,700
Damn you, Kevin.

364
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,260
They tie some fucking paint on the thing.

365
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,940
Poor turpentine slipped on these micro machines.

366
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,660
I feel like a pretty good sass update would be the wet band

367
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,300
is right again.

368
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,140
I want to make that my status update right now.

369
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,780
I want my status update to be, you know, that old pigeon lady

370
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,420
ain't so bad.

371
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,620
What if our dreams are just blurred memories

372
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,660
of our previous lives?

373
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:14,660
What?

374
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,820
These are all coming to us from Yahoo Answers user

375
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,900
Los Pumas, who really turned out about 60 of these.

376
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,260
Okay.

377
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,220
I would like to think that this is basically like the new guy

378
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,860
who writes the music for jingles kind of thing where he just

379
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,460
sits and goes, okay, let me think.

380
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,940
When I fall down the stairs.

381
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,060
Yeah, good start.

382
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,020
Fall down the stairs.

383
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,220
I hope no one's looking.

384
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,780
Yes, I love it when Ron Weasley say bloody hell smiley face.

385
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,940
Is that from the same guy?

386
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,180
Yeah.

387
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,900
Is he just copying all of his status messages?

388
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,980
I think so.

389
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,140
Dear parents, just because it's your house doesn't mean it's

390
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,340
not my privacy.

391
00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:03,940
Sincerely, teens, is this guy 45 teens?

392
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,500
Guess what?

393
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,100
It does mean that it means it.

394
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,420
It means it all over.

395
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:10,900
Teens.

396
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,660
That's our new sign off for my brother.

397
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,620
My brother and me.

398
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,220
Kiss your dad's green lips is gone.

399
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,180
Teens is in.

400
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,020
Oh my God.

401
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,900
There's websites that generate Facebook statuses for you.

402
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,020
Oh, no, that's teens.

403
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,980
Now I have a virus.

404
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,660
Teens.

405
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,300
Now maybe.

406
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,500
Hey mom, get off my back.

407
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,260
Teens.

408
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,900
And you gotta put teens at the end is important.

409
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,220
I think you got to sign off all your Facebook messages.

410
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,180
The teens.

411
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,420
Well, why don't you just put up some lyrics from your favorite?

412
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,020
My chemical romance jacket.

413
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,340
My jacket chemicals.

414
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,420
My jacket of romance.

415
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,060
My jacket of many colors.

416
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,580
I don't know.

417
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,540
This used to be a consideration of mine when I was on LiveJournal.

418
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,820
This is so long gone.

419
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,180
Trying to think of things to say that people would enjoy.

420
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:15,540
You know, I straight up know why I remember being on LiveJournal and putting so much thought

421
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,940
into what emotion I was feeling at that moment.

422
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,100
So I knew what smiley face to pick at the end of it.

423
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,540
I always wanted to be exotic.

424
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,660
A terrible pile.

425
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,340
You're a mess.

426
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,220
You're both messes.

427
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,380
I don't do that anymore now.

428
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,100
I just keep all of those emoticons locked up inside my heart.

429
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,660
You'll never know.

430
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,820
You'll never know what I'm feeling right now.

431
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,700
People are like, what are you feeling?

432
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,580
I'm like, that's mine.

433
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,300
That's mine.

434
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:37,860
I feel quick.

435
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,060
Oh, but shut it.

436
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,420
It's my secret feeling.

437
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,460
I was raised Baptist.

438
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,620
So if I don't know what emotions I'm feeling at any given moment, I don't see why everybody

439
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,420
else gets to.

440
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,140
I barely even have the words to tell people I'm happy.

441
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,020
I stifle all that stuff and then later I turn them into jokes.

442
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,620
I turn them into sandwiches.

443
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:04,740
My heart is like a mine where I put the sadness and then out comes the chuckle by them.

444
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,140
Oh boy.

445
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,060
Good show today, I think.

446
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,100
It's going really well.

447
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,620
Really, really crushing.

448
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,100
Teens.

449
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,740
Really?

450
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,140
Teens.

451
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,180
Christmas is coming.

452
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,500
The goose is getting fast.

453
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:28,100
And I have presents for my boyfriend and everyone in my family except my middle-est sister.

454
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,820
Wow.

455
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,460
People are, guys, are you, how's your Christmas shopping going?

456
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,620
Are you like, are you?

457
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,300
God's honest, haven't even started.

458
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:35,780
Nor I.

459
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,100
Okay.

460
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,140
I got that Amazon Prime.

461
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,860
I could do that shit on the 23rd and Christmas would be saved.

462
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,500
I'm thinking just making ashtrays for everyone.

463
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,140
Don't do that.

464
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,780
I want shit.

465
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,780
Make me an ashtray.

466
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,100
Yeah.

467
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,820
Teens.

468
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,300
Teens.

469
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,060
Go read it.

470
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:58,980
My middle-est sister, we aren't close and she's a listener, so I plan on an awkward holiday season.

471
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,380
No.

472
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,980
Says we aren't close and we don't spend time together more than once a month,

473
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:08,020
so it's difficult for me to decide on my own what she might like or find useful.

474
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,020
I've asked her to list a few things she might like, but she hasn't offered any suggestions.

475
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,900
What can I get my sister that she'll appreciate in case she doesn't tell me what she'd like in

476
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,500
time to get it shipped by Christmas?

477
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,140
That's from Christmas Confounded in Carolina.

478
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Are you fucking kidding?

479
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,500
You've consulted the three people who know your sister less than you.

480
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,100
We don't know her.

481
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,580
What you know.

482
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,620
If you're worried about someone getting a gift, anyone could suggest it was like,

483
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,940
this is safe for everyone and anyone would like this.

484
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,540
It's so obvious that that is what you did.

485
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,300
Like, I got you some soap.

486
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,580
Here's a slap chop.

487
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,300
Like, thanks.

488
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,420
Thank you.

489
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,020
Thank you, I guess.

490
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,740
I guess you were watching TV and saw it.

491
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,740
Maybe get her a webcam and say, I want the two of us to be better connected.

492
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,020
Oh, Justin.

493
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,820
Slam dunk.

494
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,340
I don't want.

495
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,420
But maybe she doesn't like her.

496
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,940
So let's operate on that too.

497
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:09,140
Okay, so you could get her a something of the month club membership.

498
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,140
Like, if she likes cheese or wine or something, chocolates.

499
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,180
But see, that, once again, is just such a generic gift that says like,

500
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,020
hey, I didn't know what else to get you.

501
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:27,380
Well, not if they know that, like, we got Sidney's dad a beer of the month club because he likes beer.

502
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,260
If it's something like, they're a big coffee drinker and they're really into coffee,

503
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,100
and then going with a gourmet coffee of the month club, you know, might be a great way to go.

504
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,020
Yeah, or if they're a raging alcoholic, get them the beer of the month club.

505
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:45,380
You know, a lot of people have a coffee grinder that's not really good for them.

506
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,020
Maybe get them a nice burr grinder.

507
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,540
That's what you want.

508
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,500
And some fresh coffee from your local coffisserie.

509
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,060
What about, what's that Scentsy shit that you guys are always talking about?

510
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,220
Scentsy, man.

511
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:05,700
Scentsy is a great present, actually, because you get a warm worm, you get some wafers.

512
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,100
Some wafers. Right now I'm melting, what do I got in there?

513
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,140
Christmas cottage.

514
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,780
No, no, no, it's the holidays, Griffin, please.

515
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,500
It's the holidays.

516
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,220
Sorry.

517
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:21,860
I got Christmas cottage up in there, and later I think I'm going to swap in Festival of Trees.

518
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,220
This is whatever you want.

519
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:23,860
It's really nice.

520
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,340
You could also get her some kind of decorative dagger.

521
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,340
Okay, so you're saying let's go to the local Excalibur,

522
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:37,060
and let's buy her maybe a pewter dragon statue with fake-

523
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,420
It's just been a while since I mentioned sexual edge, and business is really fucked up.

524
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,540
Oh, God, no.

525
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,820
Are we getting that Scentsy money yet?

526
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,900
Are we getting that Scentsy endorsement money?

527
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,900
You guys know we got that Genesis Today hook.

528
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,380
You know I got two big bags of Genesis Today swag here waiting for you.

529
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,900
Oh, good.

530
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,220
Yeah.

531
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,580
Oh, so you've got it, definitely.

532
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,380
We've got the Genesis Today super fruit gummies.

533
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,460
You've got the clicky pins, and the pins that you can pull out the information sheet.

534
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,180
No, no, no.

535
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,300
These are all edible.

536
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,740
We're talking about omega-3 fatty acid vitamin C chewables.

537
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,140
We're talking about fucking super fruit immunity-boosting gummies.

538
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,820
So when you say you got bags, though, do you mean you just have grocery bags full of pills?

539
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,020
Two Genesis Today branded canvas bags.

540
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,940
Just filled with pills.

541
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,780
It's full of health, is what it is.

542
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:37,540
Do you have anything in there that's like chock full of B12, another sort of B5?

543
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,860
I have a fucking acai chew with 2,000% acai daily value.

544
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,180
I just really need to set my energy free.

545
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,680
My kidneys!

546
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,020
You know that's how men just get their powers.

547
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,820
You'll feel all the tissues in your body loosen and then tighten.

548
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,900
Where did that come from?

549
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,940
It's the acai.

550
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,820
Can you just hand your sister like a $50 bill?

551
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,100
I don't know you very well, so here's some money.

552
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,780
Hey, you know what everybody likes?

553
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,500
Money.

554
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,140
Don't rate me.

555
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,740
Starbucks gift card's always nice.

556
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,700
No, it's not.

557
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,780
You get to go there, get a burr grinder.

558
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,340
Here's the thing.

559
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,660
The best thing you could do, so you asked your sister what she would like,

560
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,100
and you're waiting on a list back from her, maybe ask around to other places.

561
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:31,060
You know, ask your parents, ask your other siblings, what are you getting her?

562
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:38,500
Maybe you can do a tandem gift where they're getting her a new set of something,

563
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,580
so you get a complimentary set of something.

564
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,140
It's Christmas, and the point is that just get her something you think she would like,

565
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,140
and I'm sure it'll be great.

566
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,700
Travis, she doesn't know her very well.

567
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,900
You didn't listen to the core conceit of this question.

568
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,340
So then you have to go off of your own judgment and say like,

569
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,980
I think she would like this because I would like it.

570
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,700
Can you steal something from her and then return it?

571
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,420
Get her something that's already in her house,

572
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,140
which will have doubles, but at least you'll know it's something she likes.

573
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,100
Yeah.

574
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,820
That's not a good idea.

575
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,100
That's a stupid idea.

576
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,740
Stupid.

577
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,020
Unless it's something that's awesome to have doubles of.

578
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,100
Oh, right.

579
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,940
Like a picture of two werewolves fucking.

580
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,380
Or two lonely werewolves put the pictures next to each other,

581
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,580
cut out the sides of the frames,

582
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,260
wait for the magic pictures,

583
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,060
wait for the werewolf sex to happen.

584
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,260
Wait for the two werewolves to have sex in each other's paintings.

585
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,420
Wait for the Harry Potter magic painting crossover werewolf fuck.

586
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,020
Get her something really terrible,

587
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,180
and then you'll be giving her the best gift you can give anyone,

588
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,540
which is the right to complain about the shitty gift you got them all year.

589
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,180
Yeah.

590
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,620
And you'll be giving everyone else the present of

591
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,740
knowing that their present to anyone else wasn't the worst thing.

592
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:02,980
Yeah.

593
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,340
Fall on this grenade for her.

594
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,700
Get them nothing.

595
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,180
And then when she goes back and talks to the girls around at the steno pool,

596
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,140
she could say,

597
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,900
oh, and my younger sister, she's a real peach.

598
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,260
Guess what she got me?

599
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,860
Did a big box of diddly squat.

600
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,380
Yeah, just give her an empty box.

601
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,820
And when she opens it, say,

602
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,740
you should've gotten me that list quicker, huh?

603
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:24,980
Yeah.

604
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,420
Christmas morning is the perfect time to be vindictive.

605
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:28,660
I've always said that.

606
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,820
Yeah, let's turn Christmas lesson into an object lesson.

607
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,220
What about a box with a note in it that says,

608
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,580
I wish I knew you better.

609
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,460
That's the real gift is getting a note.

610
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,860
Get her a gift certificate for one sister.

611
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,100
Yeah.

612
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,140
Or like 20 free phone calls.

613
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,380
Yeah.

614
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,660
Well, you'd have to go-

615
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,060
But to her, you gotta clarify,

616
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,820
you're not like paying her long distance bill.

617
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,980
That would get awkward.

618
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,580
Don't get her anything.

619
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,820
She should've been better contact.

620
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,260
Just don't show up to Christmas.

621
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,580
Christmas is the time where,

622
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,460
when it started a long time ago,

623
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,100
the wise men gave Jesus those really nice gifts,

624
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,700
even though he was a baby and he couldn't give them shit.

625
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,100
Yeah.

626
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,500
So-

627
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,980
Nor can you do it, like what are you doing giving frankincense

628
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,020
to a baby?

629
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,340
Yeah.

630
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,940
Babies eat that and it will kill them.

631
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,500
It kills them instantly.

632
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,780
The toxics to a baby.

633
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,780
But what they were doing was they were making Jesus

634
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,860
feel guilty from the very start.

635
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,260
They wanted him to feel indebted to them.

636
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,100
So he would, they didn't know how it was gonna work

637
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,060
with the cross and whatnot.

638
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,980
But it did have a pretty epic payoff, I would say.

639
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,220
Well, they didn't know how it was all gonna work.

640
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,140
So they thought, well, we want this guy in our pocket.

641
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,700
That's a scene that they usually cut out of that story

642
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,980
where the wise men show back up 33 years later and say like,

643
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,620
hey, remember when we gave you that stuff?

644
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,100
Yeah, we're gonna have to call in that favor.

645
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,700
They all got together beforehand.

646
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,940
They say, Daryl, I like this kid.

647
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,260
Yeah.

648
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,780
I want juice with this kid.

649
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,740
It must've been tricky.

650
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,580
Baby Jesus don't come with the rule book.

651
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,980
You don't know how all that stuff operates,

652
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,820
the heavenly salvation.

653
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,940
Baby Jesus is like the suit from Greatest American Hero.

654
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,460
Nobody knew how it was gonna go down.

655
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,900
Yeah, but it happened.

656
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,180
But it happened.

657
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,060
But the wise men, the reason they got him such nice gifts

658
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:17,060
is so they could feel superior to Jesus for a little while.

659
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,500
And then he would be indebted to them

660
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,620
and Jesus would feel guilty.

661
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,380
I mean, he didn't have those emotions at the beginning.

662
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,300
He was just a baby, but he would feel guilty later

663
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,060
about the nice gifts that he didn't return.

664
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:25,380
Actually-

665
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,620
Is there any parallel we can draw between Jesus

666
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,900
and the suit from Condor Man?

667
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,860
I do not think so, Travis.

668
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,140
I do not know what you're talking about is the problem for me.

669
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,820
If my problem is I have no idea what you're talking about.

670
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,260
I can't get into a riff about where Travis explains

671
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,500
the film Condor Man.

672
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,820
I can't, I don't think it's a great fit for our show.

673
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,860
Can I talk about the car and a van?

674
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,580
Can we talk about literally anything else?

675
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:50,820
Okay.

676
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,540
Sure, of course.

677
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,020
God, Christmas gifts are the pits for people

678
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,460
you don't know very well, huh?

679
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:57,700
Yeah.

680
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,900
It's just the worst.

681
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,620
Why don't you give a preemptive gift,

682
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,380
call her and say you don't have to get me anything

683
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,420
and I'm not gonna get you anything

684
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,940
and let's just not worry about it.

685
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,300
Cause that would be the best gift anybody could get.

686
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,420
Oh, just cancel it out?

687
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,020
Yeah, say like, listen, I don't like you, you don't like me.

688
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,340
No gifts this year.

689
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,940
Tell her that you bought her a goat

690
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,700
through Heifer International

691
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,940
and she's like, doesn't that usually come with a certificate?

692
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,420
You'd be like, no, no, no, no, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

693
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:22,820
It's cool.

694
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,940
There's a special goat.

695
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,260
It's cool.

696
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,180
Tell them to use that certificate overhead

697
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,420
to donate to the family so they can have some porridge.

698
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,660
And if all else fails, go on ThinkGeek

699
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,020
and get her something awesome.

700
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,900
Okay, boom.

701
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,820
And that's what ThinkGeek exists for.

702
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,340
It exists for like getting her some sweet ass

703
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,700
astronaut ice cream or something.

704
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,100
Yeah, everybody loves astronaut ice cream.

705
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,100
When they 12.

706
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,540
Good one, good thing.

707
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,180
My new burn is called When They 12.

708
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,620
Yeah, it's sort of a riff on teens.

709
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,660
Yeah, teens, teens, preteens.

710
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,220
Don't go trying to change,

711
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,980
we just gave birth to this meme

712
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:05,620
and you're trying to fucking chop it and screw it.

713
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,180
In no way am I trying to chop and screw teens.

714
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,460
If you want a show that is not like our show,

715
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,060
that does not make terrible things like that happen

716
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,780
with their mouths,

717
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,660
boy, have we got a recommendation for you.

718
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:32,580
Hello there, my name is Graham Clark.

719
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,780
And I'm Dave Shumka.

720
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,020
And together we host a podcast called

721
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,620
Stop Podcasting Yourself.

722
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,180
This is a file that you download from the internet

723
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,020
and then you listen to it in your pod.

724
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,460
What's that about, you ask?

725
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,900
Well, who are you to ask?

726
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,020
Who do you think you are?

727
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,020
Yeah, get lost, bozo.

728
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,820
We're a couple of stand up comedians in Vancouver,

729
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,420
British Columbia, Canada.

730
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,060
And every week we bring a guest on the show.

731
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,340
Sometimes they're Canadian,

732
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,620
sometimes they're not,

733
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,980
sometimes they're a ghost.

734
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,260
It's like you're sitting in on a friendly afternoon chat.

735
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,060
Plus we're Canadian, so you get a tax break.

736
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,940
You can find us on iTunes or online at maximumfun.org.

737
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,540
Celebrities.

738
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,940
Who needs them?

739
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,220
Who needs them?

740
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,340
We do, desperately.

741
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:20,660
Yes.

742
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,380
Yes.

743
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,860
I am so excited about this celebrity.

744
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,260
Yeah, this is a really big one for us.

745
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:33,540
We ask our, every week we start the show off with the hit song

746
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,300
It's a Departure from the Long Winners.

747
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,900
And we know that so many of you have gotten into the Long Winners

748
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,540
as a result of, well, us, our personal influence.

749
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,340
You're welcome.

750
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:42,900
You're welcome.

751
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,380
But this week we actually have a celebrity question

752
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,620
from Mr. John Roderick of the Long Winters.

753
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,180
Hello, my brother, my brother and me brothers.

754
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,500
This is John Roderick calling.

755
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,700
And my question for you is,

756
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,940
I want to learn to be an eBay retailer.

757
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,100
I have a lot of junk that I've collected

758
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,540
because I'm a collector.

759
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,500
And now I'm looking around my house

760
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,180
and I'm realizing that I'm not, I've crossed the line

761
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,980
from being a collector to being a crazy person

762
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,100
in a house full of crap.

763
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,860
And so what better way to unload the crap than to go on eBay?

764
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,060
But I can't stand being on eBay whenever I'm there.

765
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,340
It just confuses me.

766
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,060
And it doesn't fill me with delight

767
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,580
like being in a room full of crap does.

768
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,740
So what I'm trying to do is transition

769
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,300
from being a crazy person in a room full of crap

770
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,380
to a wealthy person in an empty room.

771
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,140
And I think eBay might be the way,

772
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,820
but I don't have the first idea how to begin.

773
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,100
So any suggestion or advice for me?

774
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,580
Thanks so much, homies.

775
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,740
Thank you, John Roderick, for that question.

776
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,660
You have gotten to us just in time

777
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,220
in time because you were about to make

778
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,980
a terrible, terrible mistake.

779
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,700
You almost did it.

780
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,460
Almost made a mistake.

781
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,420
I was so close.

782
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,140
Here's the thing.

783
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:27,460
No one puts you on TV for reasonably getting rid of your stuff.

784
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,980
Yeah, yeah.

785
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,620
I'm glad we're on the same page here, Justin.

786
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,260
Yeah, you gotta lean into it.

787
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,180
You know that promo, you know that digital ink,

788
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,300
that TV ink of getting on the hit show Hoarders

789
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,900
is going to be great for your band.

790
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,580
It's going to be great for your image.

791
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,700
Well, not only that-

792
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,540
Hold on, one second.

793
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,300
I'm not exactly sure it'll be great for your image.

794
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,420
Not sure-

795
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,220
What the fuck?

796
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,780
People kept, people talked about that fucker

797
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,860
from the Libertines for like two years

798
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,100
just because he had such terrible drug addiction.

799
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,620
You don't think people are going to chat up

800
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,260
the lead singer of a hit indie rock band

801
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,700
who is also a Hoarder?

802
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:03,860
Hey-

803
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,660
I feel like Hoarders is like just a hair's breadth

804
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,420
separated from MTV Cribs.

805
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:09,780
Maybe-

806
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,220
It's just like MTV Cribs

807
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,820
if they just had a bunch of shit around their house.

808
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,500
Oh my God, is that hair important?

809
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,860
Oh my God.

810
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,060
Yeah.

811
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,140
Nobody's going to want to be the guy who's like

812
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,420
people come up to on the street and it's like,

813
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,020
hey, I saw you on Hoarders.

814
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,900
Your house looks like fucking Scrooge McDuck's vault

815
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,980
if Scrooge McDuck were a homeless person.

816
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,220
And-

817
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,500
But your albums rule.

818
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,660
Your albums are great is the thing.

819
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,460
Your albums are so-

820
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,900
Think about, think about,

821
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,900
you never see the headline in the paper

822
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,380
for a hit indie rocker killed by a mountain of air.

823
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:39,620
Yeah.

824
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:43,220
It's gotta be old newspaper or shoe boxes

825
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,900
filled with toenail clippings.

826
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,700
Pile of 45 gramophones topples on.

827
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,860
The number one thing is you can't-

828
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,220
and this is the mistake that so many Hoarders make,

829
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,900
which by the way,

830
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,580
we are definitely, definitely leaning

831
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,620
towards you becoming a Hoarder.

832
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,180
You can't go organic.

833
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,580
You got to keep the organics out of it

834
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,060
because then you're a dirty, dirty, it's dirty.

835
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,540
Yeah.

836
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:07,940
Then you're-

837
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,420
Shameful.

838
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,580
Then you got a compost home and nobody wants that.

839
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,940
Right. Nobody wants that.

840
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,100
You're gonna find decomposed cats

841
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:19,460
and old containers of yogurt.

842
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,660
It's terrible.

843
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,700
Do you think that there is a style of hoarding

844
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,940
you could do that would actually be awesome?

845
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,780
Like I hoard old Nintendo Power magazines.

846
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,580
Oh my God, yes.

847
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:31,860
Yeah.

848
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,540
But what he's saying, I think,

849
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,780
is that like that does make you a collector.

850
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,420
What he's saying is that if you collect enough things,

851
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,500
you're a Hoarder.

852
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,620
Well, doesn't that just mean

853
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,060
it's time to move into a bigger house?

854
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,340
No, it doesn't mean that.

855
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,300
You're saying it's all relative.

856
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,340
You're saying if you have 20,000 square feet

857
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,300
and you fill it with a thousand square feet

858
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,780
of old newspaper clippings and coupons from the 1970s,

859
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,060
you're no longer a Hoarder.

860
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,620
You are just an eccentric person with a large house.

861
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,180
Exactly.

862
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:05,140
If you're like, and this is my room for Perfect Strangers memorabilia,

863
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,700
then, you know, you're not a weirdo.

864
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,980
But if you're like, this is my house,

865
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,900
which is floor to ceiling covered

866
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,060
with Perfect Strangers memorabilia,

867
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,860
you got a problem.

868
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,020
Now you've stumbled onto a hit new idea,

869
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,940
what you like to call a museum.

870
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,300
Like you're creating more problems.

871
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,180
Then you got overhead.

872
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,180
You have to get special tax classification.

873
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,060
Oh, what about this?

874
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,420
Oh, when someone's like, you're a Hoarder,

875
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,060
say, no, no, no, I'm working on an art installation.

876
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,620
Yeah.

877
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,260
Ooh.

878
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,460
I mean, it's kind of hard.

879
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,060
I think we're being a little myopic

880
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,340
by just focusing on Hoarders.

881
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,020
I feel like there's other reality TV shows

882
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,060
that we can use to help John get rid of his stuff

883
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,780
and make some money off of it.

884
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,500
Like, I'm thinking there's the triumvirate, right?

885
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,780
You got Pawn Stars.

886
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,740
Drop that shit on them.

887
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,940
They'll give you Mad Skrilla.

888
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,540
That is their catchphrase.

889
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:53,140
You got American Pickers.

890
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,420
Call it the American Pickers, guys.

891
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,460
They'll just swoop in and give you fair trade for your stuff.

892
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,940
And, of course, Hail Billy Hand Fishing.

893
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:07,060
There's fucking storage wars.

894
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,020
You got storage wars.

895
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,460
Just put all your shit in a storage unit

896
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,100
and then go delinquent on the payments and then it's gone.

897
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,460
You don't get any money for it.

898
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,340
But your stuff gets on TV

899
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,100
and you get to watch your memories picked over

900
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,540
by heartless, heartless men.

901
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,900
And you could go on LA Ink

902
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,660
and get tattoos of all the stuff you have.

903
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,020
You could go on Real Housewives

904
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,940
and marry a sweet, beautiful woman.

905
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,500
Think about that.

906
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,460
Think about that, John.

907
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,660
You could be the one guy with the beard who was a hoarder

908
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,620
and married the one from Sweet Housewives of Atlanta.

909
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,540
And then was on Ace of Cakes.

910
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,980
He was on Ace of Cakes.

911
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,380
We wanted to celebrate you decided to be a hoarder.

912
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,300
I want a cake that's just covered in shit.

913
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,300
Sweet Housewives of Biloxi this week.

914
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,660
It was great.

915
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,300
Those sweet, sweet women marry John Roderick.

916
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,620
All of them.

917
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,740
And then they were on Sister Wives.

918
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,660
Did you see Sister Wives this week?

919
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,260
Cody, he's out.

920
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:56,820
Cody's out.

921
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,860
John Roderick's in.

922
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,380
He just, he just swooped in.

923
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,740
It was the world's biggest divorce.

924
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,700
It was like the quickening.

925
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,460
He just swooped in and he got a bunch of wives

926
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,660
and like 35 kids.

927
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,500
Oh, he's hoarding kids.

928
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,460
He's hoarding kids.

929
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,100
My house is floor to ceiling covered with kids.

930
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,820
There's spawn everywhere.

931
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,300
Now, listen.

932
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,020
Now, listen, John.

933
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,940
If you want to put kids on eBay.

934
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,020
It's going to go fast.

935
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,140
We're going to talk about this.

936
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,180
I got to, I know a guy.

937
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,060
Let's talk, talk to my guy, Rico.

938
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,260
If you have to take care of me.

939
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,860
If you have to use eBay, the trick is,

940
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,780
as somebody who used eBay once to,

941
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,140
I think I bought a DVD.

942
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,460
And then the second time was I sold some Pokemon cards

943
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,460
and they asked me to pay a fee for selling shit.

944
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,500
And I was like, no.

945
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,460
And I got banned from eBay forever.

946
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,420
But you got to make it seem like a place.

947
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,860
Your space, your sales space has to seem like a place where

948
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,620
it seems like you're not trying to fuck the user

949
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,060
right through their pants.

950
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,220
You got to make it seem like a safe space for them.

951
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,980
Like you are actually going to give them the things

952
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,780
that they want.

953
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,340
And you know what?

954
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,100
Why not use your name on there?

955
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,260
People can think you're not selling old newspaper clippings.

956
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,940
You're selling rock memorabilia.

957
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:03,540
Right.

958
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,980
It's all rock memorabilia.

959
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,620
Everything you own is rock memorabilia.

960
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,700
Whatever you do, be careful that if you take a picture

961
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,620
of something that is shiny and reflective,

962
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,700
that you are dressed in that reflection.

963
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,180
Or not.

964
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:12,340
Yeah.

965
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:12,980
You don't want to become an,

966
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,620
everybody's into something different.

967
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,180
That picture is not a rock memorabilia.

968
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,100
Hey, is that a picture of a werewolf in the background?

969
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,580
What is it doing to him?

970
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,780
I'll take it.

971
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,420
I'll take it.

972
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,980
I'll take that one and its brother next door.

973
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,260
Hey, I'm a 25 year old male.

974
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,180
At work, I share a small office with two lovely young ladies

975
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,660
about my age, both of whom are close friends of mine

976
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,540
that I adore.

977
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,780
But the amount of girl talk and estrogen in the room

978
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,860
can quickly become overwhelming.

979
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,660
Unfortunately, there aren't really any dudes at work

980
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,700
that I can nerd out with.

981
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,820
I need a dude outlet.

982
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,980
What can I do to get the old testosterone pumping at work?

983
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,980
That's from smothered in the south.

984
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,660
Okay, here's, this is where I'm going to

985
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,500
completely go outside of what you asked

986
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,540
and say that basically this would be like

987
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,660
if in World War II, an American soldier was like,

988
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,660
I'm stuck with all these Germans all day

989
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,740
listening to all their plans and secrets.

990
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,380
You are behind enemy lines collecting information.

991
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,660
For the rest of us.

992
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,540
Yes.

993
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,540
Find out what they're talking about

994
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,380
and what is going on in there.

995
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,220
I don't, did you guys even know

996
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,220
that they have a thing called a brood pouch?

997
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,780
This is all new information.

998
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,340
Do you know where the brood pouch is?

999
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,820
It's also possible the women are feeding you misinformation.

1000
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,700
Which is actually one of their names.

1001
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,260
The jelly that I've been producing from my brood pouch

1002
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,060
has been really opaque lately.

1003
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,940
I'm worried.

1004
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,220
Oh, Travis, don't get it.

1005
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,820
It's a natural, beautiful part of life.

1006
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,540
The brood pouch is beautiful, natural.

1007
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,940
Now, for actual helpful information,

1008
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,420
is it possible that there's like a crossover thing

1009
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,780
where like you can talk about James Bond?

1010
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:58,340
No, no, Travis, there's nothing that both men and women

1011
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,140
like at the same time.

1012
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,980
Don't be ridiculous.

1013
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,460
Oh wait, there's a billion things.

1014
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,580
Top Chef for one.

1015
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,500
Just to pick one of the things.

1016
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,060
Just to pick one of the hundred-drillion things

1017
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,900
that there are that men and women like together.

1018
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,660
Yeah, and if I'm correct, a trillion is a trillion trillion

1019
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,460
if I'm not mistaken.

1020
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,140
All the trillions that there could possibly be.

1021
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,220
It's a number only girls know about, so you can't.

1022
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,780
Men are from Mars, guys.

1023
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,500
Sports, ladies like sports too sometimes.

1024
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,860
How about Top Chef?

1025
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,980
Just talk about Top Chef.

1026
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,020
That can last you like an entire day's worth of conversation.

1027
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,500
How about like any movies ever?

1028
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,020
Movies are good.

1029
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,380
Well, not any movie.

1030
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:43,940
Yeah.

1031
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,500
Some movies girls aren't allowed to see and vice versa.

1032
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,220
That's true.

1033
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:51,060
I've been trying to see Fry Green Tomatoes for 15 years now.

1034
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,180
I would love to see Love Actually,

1035
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,700
but I can't get my passport cleared.

1036
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,180
I'm imagining Sally Field just runs in and is like,

1037
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,900
no, slaps it out of your hand.

1038
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,940
Excuse me, ladies.

1039
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,860
I hate to interrupt our conversation,

1040
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:04,020
but I believe a boy has entered the room

1041
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,620
where our film is airing.

1042
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,140
She breaks the fourth wall like Zack Morris.

1043
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,060
Time out.

1044
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,260
Time out, Sissy Spacek, who may or may not be in this film.

1045
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,060
Calm down, woman from Jurassic Park.

1046
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,380
Ladies, just so you know,

1047
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:33,860
Jurassic Park is a movie with dinosaurs and Laura Dern in it.

1048
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,700
Sorry, ladies.

1049
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,260
I didn't-

1050
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,620
It's so good.

1051
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,100
I wish you could see it.

1052
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,300
I wish you guys could see it.

1053
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,300
I feel like it would really bridge a lot of gaps.

1054
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:43,800
Right.

1055
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,340
Hey, guys, let's tear down these walls, huh?

1056
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:51,940
I sort of like what I imagine how Stella got her groove back.

1057
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,820
I wouldn't know, guys.

1058
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,540
I wouldn't know.

1059
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,420
I'm guessing, but-

1060
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,860
I'm hoping that whatever comes after Blu-ray has a feature

1061
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,540
where if you're watching Fry Green Tomatoes

1062
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,660
and a man walks into the room,

1063
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,060
just like Kathy Bates just looks into the camera

1064
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,460
and just stops talking mid-sentence until-

1065
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,820
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1066
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,320
He's here.

1067
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,500
Pretend you're paused.

1068
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,820
Fee-fi-foo-fuck.

1069
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,500
Wait, Travis.

1070
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,660
Someone make me some buffalo wings.

1071
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,260
Guys, don't be mean to Kathy Bates.

1072
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,060
She doesn't need it.

1073
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,780
She's doing her best out there.

1074
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,060
Her show just got canceled.

1075
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:31,940
Yeah.

1076
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:32,820
Oh.

1077
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:33,780
Oh, misery.

1078
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,260
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

1079
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:36,980
Yes, please.

1080
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,500
I would like that very much.

1081
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,060
This one was sent in by Galiayali.

1082
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:41,780
Thank you, Gali.

1083
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,020
It's by yahooanswersuser.

1084
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,060
It's just a bunch of Es and Ws and Gs.

1085
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:49,540
Who asks?

1086
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,700
When a girl wears flip-flops,

1087
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,500
why do I stare at her feet so I can get a glimpse of her soles?

1088
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,000
What?

1089
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,020
Excuse me?

1090
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,860
When a girl wears flip-flops,

1091
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,660
why do I stare at her feet so I can get a glimpse of her soles?

1092
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,860
It's almost like he answers the question in the question a little bit,

1093
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,980
but he just doesn't understand why he's able to answer it.

1094
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,940
Why is it that when a woman wears a flip-flops,

1095
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,300
I'm such a dirty foot bird?

1096
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:19,800
Yeah.

1097
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:21,640
A what?

1098
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,180
A dirty bird.

1099
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,140
A dirty foot bird.

1100
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,100
Travis is really, really on a Kathy Bates kick right now.

1101
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,300
He's doing his impression of her from the film, the hit film,

1102
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,340
He's doing his impression of her from the film, the hit film, Misery.

1103
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,140
Is Kathy Bates a dirty foot bird in Misery?

1104
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,980
Yeah, she's a real nasty.

1105
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,180
That's why she- yeah.

1106
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,620
It's- is this person just now coming to terms with the fact

1107
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,380
that he's a dirty birdie?

1108
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,140
I don't know.

1109
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,300
He's a real dirty Gus.

1110
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:50,900
Here's the thing.

1111
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,700
There are so many things in this world that, you know,

1112
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,820
I'm not necessarily into, but I don't judge other people for.

1113
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,340
I don't get the foot thing.

1114
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:58,980
I don't get the foot thing.

1115
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,620
Like at all.

1116
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:04,980
I mean, I mean, do you want me to show my hand right now?

1117
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,940
You want me to show my cards?

1118
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:08,580
Just lay them on.

1119
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,500
Yeah, I'm afraid, Griffin.

1120
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,420
Yeah, show your cards, I guess, or something.

1121
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,780
Something about a delicate arch.

1122
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,660
Uh, well, okay, let's not talk about-

1123
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,580
No, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

1124
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,180
No, no, shut, shut, listen, listen, listen.

1125
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:20,980
Okay, okay, okay.

1126
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,780
The line between heel and ball.

1127
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,540
That delicate arch.

1128
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:25,860
Okay.

1129
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,660
Okay.

1130
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,780
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1131
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,100
You know.

1132
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,460
Wait.

1133
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,660
What about those toesies?

1134
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:31,540
No.

1135
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:31,780
Okay.

1136
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:33,620
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1137
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,340
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1138
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:34,660
Wait.

1139
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,060
Oh, okay.

1140
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,740
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1141
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,180
What about that arch?

1142
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:38,500
No.

1143
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,140
Okay.

1144
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,580
Well, you don't actually have a thing.

1145
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,420
What about that soft padding on there?

1146
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,380
No, you're just getting quieter and that's making it worse.

1147
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,300
It's making it much worse for me personally.

1148
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,980
All right, so the quiet, you don't-

1149
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:49,860
How about that arch?

1150
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,620
Nope, nope, no, no.

1151
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:51,860
No.

1152
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:52,020
Okay.

1153
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:52,980
No, no, no.

1154
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,220
No.

1155
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,700
Now you sound like one of the kings of comedy.

1156
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:59,140
And I don't appreciate that.

1157
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,820
Not on my show.

1158
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,420
Do you think this guy actually does not know why he's doing these things?

1159
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,820
Or do you think he does know and he just wants to tell the internet about it?

1160
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,500
Maybe he just feels like he's possessed by a foot demon or something.

1161
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,220
That's possible.

1162
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,460
There is that, well, that's what it is.

1163
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,500
I am Podtrax King of Feet.

1164
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,100
Podtrax King of Feet.

1165
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,980
Have you heard that new Podtrax?

1166
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,100
My brother, my brother and me.

1167
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:28,740
It's like a podcast, but it's got lots of feet.

1168
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,180
Is there any way we can get around this man having a fetish?

1169
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,300
Maybe he just wants to be a podiatrist.

1170
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,740
Maybe he's got a secret podiatry.

1171
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,740
No, maybe he is a podiatrist.

1172
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,780
He's just very forgetful.

1173
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,700
Maybe all podiatrists are nasty, nasty, dirty birds.

1174
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,300
I think he's got a double fetish, like a lot of these Yahoo Answers people.

1175
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,580
It's not just that he's in a feat.

1176
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,980
You can be into whatever you're into.

1177
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:57,700
But by definition, you keep it locked away in your heart and never tell anyone.

1178
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,700
But these people have a double fetish where they have to be into something

1179
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:05,060
that is outside the mainstream and they have to tell people about it.

1180
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:12,020
So you're saying he's in the feat and he has like his other fetishes telling people about it?

1181
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:12,820
Exactly.

1182
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,540
That he's in the feat.

1183
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:18,660
I, as somebody who works on the internet and has seen the worst that it absolutely has to offer,

1184
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,700
I'm going to go ahead and say that a foot fetish is not outside the mainstream.

1185
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,740
I'm going to say a foot fetish is actually pretty milquetoast at this point.

1186
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,860
No, but here's, okay, I can agree.

1187
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,580
If you're saying, here's the thing that makes me more uncomfortable.

1188
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:34,580
If your thing is cut off feet fetish, I only like feet,

1189
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,980
but what's not on the rest of the body is the only thing.

1190
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,340
I'm into half foot fetish.

1191
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,300
Yeah, right.

1192
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,220
This is what bothers me more.

1193
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,100
Do you know when you get caught checking out a girl's butt or something?

1194
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:44,580
No.

1195
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:48,580
Imagine if you got caught checking out her feet.

1196
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:50,820
No, because you can bite that off.

1197
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,340
You can be like, I like your shoes.

1198
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,100
You like your delicate arch.

1199
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,140
I like that delicate arch.

1200
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,700
But I think in that circumstance, everyone knows what's up.

1201
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,180
It's like, were you just peeping my toes?

1202
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:00,660
No.

1203
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,820
Why are you looking at girls' butts, Travis?

1204
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,500
Well, God, you're a dirty guy.

1205
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:06,580
Treat them like a lady.

1206
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,260
Because I'm a podiatrist.

1207
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:14,500
Podiatrists, of course, are notoriously nasty.

1208
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,740
Well, I was going to say I was a butterist, but that's not a thing.

1209
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:21,060
No, it is not, unless you work at a bakery.

1210
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,060
It's a high rising job.

1211
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,180
We have to end this show.

1212
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:24,660
Well, hold on.

1213
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,140
I want to hear-

1214
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,740
Wait, there's one last thing we have to do.

1215
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,300
If we have time.

1216
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,420
Do we have time?

1217
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,620
I think we have time.

1218
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,340
No, we don't.

1219
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:30,900
We really don't.

1220
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,540
Well, here's the thing.

1221
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:32,740
We don't have time.

1222
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,980
You don't, you do not, do you seriously not have time?

1223
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,420
Do we have time?

1224
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:38,740
We got all month.

1225
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,940
Can we make it quick?

1226
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,700
But here's the thing is that it's the first show in the month of December.

1227
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:48,500
And if we don't do it, then people aren't going to know that it's bingo's birthday month.

1228
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,500
Oh, what?

1229
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,980
People aren't going to know that it's operation Santa Paws.

1230
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:54,900
Excuse me?

1231
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:58,580
Do you know what I mean?

1232
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,540
Like, if we don't-

1233
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:02,660
Is that P-A-W-S or P-A-U-S-E?

1234
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:09,060
If people don't know that it's national drunk and drug driving 3D prevention month, then

1235
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:12,980
like, how are they going to know not to do whatever that thing means not to do to it?

1236
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:19,940
What is national 3D drunk and drug driving prevention?

1237
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,020
It's like the drunk guys coming right at me.

1238
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:22,900
Let's explore it.

1239
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:23,780
Let's explore this.

1240
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,100
Okay.

1241
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:28,180
National drunk and drugged driving 3D prevention month.

1242
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,740
You have to have some other background.

1243
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,700
Are the 3Ds drunk, drugged, and driving?

1244
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,020
Yeah.

1245
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:42,900
I feel like you can't, you can't say the three words that it is and then say that

1246
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:43,860
thing after it.

1247
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:47,940
Possibly, the two concepts are completely unrelated.

1248
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:51,220
So it's like, hey, don't go see Avatar.

1249
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:56,180
But if you absolutely have to, don't be drunk in the car when you go to do it.

1250
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,580
Get drunk there.

1251
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,300
Get drunk.

1252
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,900
Hey, Hugo, cut it out.

1253
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,780
This is another one that we could do.

1254
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:09,380
Our country is plagued with 3D movies that are also full of drunk and drug drivers.

1255
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:09,880
Yeah.

1256
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,700
Yeah, like Drive Angry.

1257
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,340
You see that?

1258
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:12,840
Yeah.

1259
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:17,100
Drunk King Jack Daniels the whole time, flying through the screen, reckless abandon.

1260
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:17,420
Man, Smurfs?

1261
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,220
Fornicating.

1262
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,340
Smurfs was family fun.

1263
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,180
I can't follow you down that.

1264
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,500
I mean, it's fun for the whole family.

1265
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,300
It was.

1266
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:26,940
You're right, Justin.

1267
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:33,020
It was like watching two whole families get hit by a truck that was driven by a drunk driver in 3D.

1268
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,700
We got to prevent it from happening.

1269
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,780
Neil Patrick Harris, what are you doing, Neil?

1270
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:38,460
You're better than that.

1271
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,380
Neil, better than that.

1272
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,140
I loved you in that movie about Cheech and Chong.

1273
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,180
Yeah, so good.

1274
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,340
You mean Cheech and Chong today.

1275
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,420
Cheech and Chong now.

1276
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:55,820
Cheech and Chong Back Up and Smoke 3D, Neil Patrick Harris.

1277
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,460
I mean, is there a warning about drunk, drug, and driving that we can dispense to people?

1278
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,020
Obviously, don't drink and drive, you goof.

1279
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:05,260
But like, and don't drug and drive.

1280
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:13,340
I, here's the thing, at this point in the course of humanity, who doesn't know not to do that?

1281
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,580
Yeah.

1282
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,580
Like, who's sitting there going, oh, that's a, that's a bad thing to do?

1283
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:24,940
Like, I think we're past the point of awareness now to like, just try to stamp out forgetfulness.

1284
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,580
Yeah.

1285
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:33,260
If someone hands you some fucking, a big dime bag of drug sauce and a fucking copy of Spy Kids 4D,

1286
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,740
you gotta slap both out of their hands, and you gotta say-

1287
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,340
What, no, Griffin, I gotta stop you there.

1288
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:37,900
Okay, sorry.

1289
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,220
This doesn't say anything about 4D.

1290
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,380
The fourth dimension is, the fourth dimension is smell.

1291
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:45,420
Yeah.

1292
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:51,260
Right, technically speaking, you don't want, yeah, at this point, you're just, uh, you're just

1293
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:55,500
piling on guilt, because people know they're not supposed to drunk, drunk drive.

1294
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,900
And you know what I don't need when I'm trying to drive drunk?

1295
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,380
What's that?

1296
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,540
Guilt to distraction.

1297
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:06,860
I need, I need total focus.

1298
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:14,140
I need complete focus, and I don't need the echo of some nagging that I got about it to be

1299
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,500
reverberating around my mind.

1300
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,300
I already feel super bad, because I'm super drunk.

1301
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,540
Yeah, yeah, I've had enough about it.

1302
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,820
In a bad place.

1303
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:26,060
I just think, I just think National Drunk and Drunk Driving 3D Prevention Month, I think that

1304
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:32,620
you, I think it's wrong to try and piggyback your own issues onto drunk driving.

1305
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:37,340
Like, you can't be like, it's National Drunk Driving and No Gay Marriage Prevention Month.

1306
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:40,140
Like, you can't, you can't, you'll be like, yeah, boo.

1307
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,900
Wait, wait, what was the other thing?

1308
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,420
Wait, what, what did you say?

1309
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,100
Did you slip in?

1310
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,380
Yeah.

1311
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:50,300
We are Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and gays, and gay people.

1312
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:50,860
Wait, hold on.

1313
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,780
Boo, don't drink and drive.

1314
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:57,340
Did you say Mothers, did you say Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Four Clubbing Seals?

1315
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,220
What kind of organization is that?

1316
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,820
Your acronym is whack.

1317
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:02,380
It's MAD.

1318
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,900
MAD Ack Cups.

1319
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,060
MAD Acks.

1320
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,940
Hey, I want to hear Griffin's last question.

1321
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,420
But first, super quick housekeeping stuff.

1322
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:17,580
We are doing a live performance of this very show, not this one.

1323
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,180
It won't be a stage reading of this.

1324
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:25,100
It'll be another episode of this on December 11th at the Blue Theater in Austin.

1325
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,900
You can get tickets, you can look at our Twitter feed for the link.

1326
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:34,060
You can go to mbnbam.com, and there's something there, right, Tudor?

1327
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:34,560
Maybe.

1328
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:36,620
Maybe.

1329
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,100
You just gotta-

1330
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:37,580
Poke around.

1331
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,580
You gotta know that the theater is behind-

1332
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,140
Yes, there is.

1333
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:40,780
If you go to-

1334
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,620
It's behind another building.

1335
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,660
You gotta keep an eye out for it.

1336
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:44,780
It's giant, and it's blue.

1337
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,300
But you gotta look.

1338
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,100
You're gonna drive into a lot, and you're gonna think, this isn't a thing you'll

1339
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,220
see a big blue building.

1340
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,020
And that's when you'll know.

1341
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,340
Just park anywhere and come inside.

1342
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,620
We sold out of our 9 o'clock show.

1343
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:01,260
We have less than 30 tickets left for our 7 p.m. show.

1344
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,980
And if you go to mbnbam.com, you can find the link there.

1345
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,660
We expect that, I mean, with any luck, we'll sell all those tickets

1346
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,660
before the show launches.

1347
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,780
And the 7 and 9 o'clock shows will be completely different.

1348
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:21,660
So if you want to come to both, we'd love to have you at both.

1349
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,380
I think everybody's gotten a chance to get tickets who wants them.

1350
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,260
So you won't be really edging anybody out.

1351
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:32,140
And kind of the same memo as past live shows, if you're gonna be at the show,

1352
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:36,700
and you'd like to have a question answered, make sure that when you email the question,

1353
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:41,100
let us know that you're going to be at the live show and which one you're going to be at.

1354
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,460
Whether you're gonna be at the 7 or the 9.

1355
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,100
Yeah, please do that.

1356
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,340
This is the first time we've ever tried to do two shows in one day.

1357
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,940
So we are going to need as much content.

1358
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,460
Same for Yahoo Answers too.

1359
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:52,380
If you can just send in like a bunch of those this week, I would be eternally grateful.

1360
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:59,260
And if you live in Austin and can think of a bar that we could basically occupy

1361
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,940
after both shows and like hang out for a bit, let me know.

1362
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:03,740
I know that there's-

1363
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,740
After the, he means after the 9 o'clock show.

1364
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:06,620
Yeah, so like-

1365
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,740
After both shows are over.

1366
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,100
Yeah, like 1030 or something like that.

1367
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:13,100
And 7 o'clock people will expect you to come back out and hang out.

1368
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:17,020
Yeah, so just sit outside the theater and wait for us for a while.

1369
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,380
We'll pick up a ticket for the 9 o'clock.

1370
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,100
Yep.

1371
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,140
They're going to be completely different.

1372
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,300
Some of us are going to be the same.

1373
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,620
And if we could fucking manage that, that would be amazing.

1374
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,620
Your second show will be the first show, but backwards.

1375
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:32,060
We'll just have to cut out all of our references to the time that we wrote into the first show.

1376
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,260
Also, we're going to have our posters with us.

1377
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:39,500
So make sure you bring some cash money if you'd like to pick up one of those.

1378
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:39,980
They're going to be-

1379
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,580
Well, what, at 10?

1380
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:41,980
Yep.

1381
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:42,780
10 bucks?

1382
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:43,980
Yeah, bring 10 bucks with you.

1383
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:44,540
Get it-

1384
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,940
Make sure you get it signed if you are interested in that sort of thing.

1385
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:49,100
And also, I shaved my mustache.

1386
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,140
I know I said I was going to keep it for the live show, but it was too gross.

1387
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,900
I have a giant beard.

1388
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:54,220
Travis is-

1389
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:54,940
The biggest beard.

1390
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,460
Travis is going to go full Grizzly Adams.

00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:59,820
I'm looking at a fucking Joseph Gordon-Levitt situation over here.

1392
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,420
Smooth, smooth face.

1393
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:07,660
As always, thank you to John Roderick of the Long Winters for both his question this week

1394
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:10,300
and for letting us use his music.

1395
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:17,660
And thank you for people talking about our show on Twitter using the MBMBAM hashtag.

1396
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,500
I should play me.

1397
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,060
Babylonian doing a lot there.

1398
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:30,940
Our dear friend Ash Nobasu from New Zealand was wondering if we would be returning this week.

1399
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:35,820
DMZilla, as always, complimenting our good friend Bob Ball.

1400
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:40,540
Nerdishow, we helped to make their 16-hour drive survivable this week.

1401
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:41,340
Viva La Betty.

1402
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:41,900
Everybody.

1403
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:43,020
We really appreciate it.

1404
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:43,740
Thanks, everybody.

1405
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:47,020
I can't wait to see you guys next week.

1406
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,980
It's going to be so great.

1407
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,580
Yeah, it's going to be a lot of fun.

1408
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,780
So yeah, Griffin, hit it.

1409
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,540
This final question was sent in by Gali Ayali.

1410
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,100
Thanks, Gali.

1411
00:58:55,100 --> 00:59:01,180
It's by Yahoo Answers user TheHotDogBun, who asks,

1412
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:04,780
Bobby Vernier ate my French bread pizza and I am still angry?

1413
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,660
I'm Justin McElroy.

1414
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,540
I'm Travis McElroy.

1415
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:11,820
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1416
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,180
He's been my brother, my brother and me.

1417
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:13,980
Kiss your dad.

1418
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,020
Square on the lips.

1419
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:33,420
Keep your heart, three stacks, keep your heart, hey, keep your heart, three stacks, keep your heart, man, these girls are smart, three stacks, these girls are smart, play your part.
