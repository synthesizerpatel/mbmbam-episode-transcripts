1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,760
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,840
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,560
Patrick McElroy Esquire. And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary,

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:03,040
Griffin, healthy boy, McElroy. Back on his grind. Back on, and I've been chomping down those

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:10,160
vitamins, as my friends in New Zealand call them, vitamins, and such a fun little turn of phrase.

10
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,320
And yeah, I'm empowered by the D and by the E and by the C, so feeling great.

11
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:22,560
Such a proud moment today. I activated on Hulu an episode of Sailor Moon Crystal,

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,200
the sort of revamp relaunch on Hulu. And I started the English version because my daughter

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,960
speaks English. Primarily. I've been trying to teach her Icelandic, but she's-

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,520
She also claims to speak baby whenever she hangs out with Henry and Charlie, so true.

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,120
Yes, that's true. And she has picked up a good amount of Spanish from Dora. I started this

16
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,600
episode of Sailor Moon and my daughter loudly announced, and I don't know where she picked

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,280
this phrase up, I can only imagine, she loudly announced that she wanted subs, not dubs.

18
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:04,240
Well, wouldn't- Yeah, that's a- I mean, she's a purist, and that's very good. You need to nurture

19
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:12,400
that small flame into a raging bonfire of sort of righteousness about sort of anime, how they

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,080
sort of get their info across.

21
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,880
I like how you said you don't know where she got that from, as though it wasn't from Taylor.

22
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,400
Yeah, or from- She doesn't- She's not on Tumblr, is she? God, I hope not.

23
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,560
No, she's not on Tumblr. She's on Tumblr Junior.

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,160
Yeah, she's on Toddler Tumblr. Whoa, toddlertumblr.com. Let me just see if I can get

25
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,960
that one real quick. Here's a- So I'm very proud of my daughter, and she said that she

26
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,400
wanted to watch it so she could learn Japanese, which I told her that that-

27
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,720
That's exactly how it works, actually.

28
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,520
So this concludes all- Everything we know.

29
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,040
No, this concludes all the discussion we ever want to have about anime, so please-

30
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,600
I mean, I can go hard if y'all want.

31
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,560
Nah, you got Twitter up right now at home. You're ready to tweet a great bon mot about-

32
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:10,000
Just maybe don't. I don't actually want to talk about anime anymore, so that's all the

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,600
anime discussion that we're ever going to have, so this is not a continuing bit.

34
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,120
I mean, I will continue to reference Yuri on Ice wherever and whenever it is even remotely

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,760
appropriate, so look forward to that.

36
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,560
Do the cool kids ever call that Yuri on the rocks?

37
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,440
No, that's a different show where it's two, you know, rock climbers, but they're very

38
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,880
much in love. Very, very deeply in love.

39
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:43,200
Here's a new segment on the show. It's called Domain Renewals, and these are

40
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,080
domains that I've now owned for over a year and are still operational.

41
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,960
Just want to remind everybody, these are just from this month, the ones that-

42
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,440
the domains that I own that are up for renewal, just to remind everybody about these great

43
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,000
domains. Renewed this month, dadyelp.com.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,600
So a lot of our business seems to be like a type of age of person and then existing

45
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,120
brand.

46
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,320
Can we remember, was dadyelp a yelp for dads to use?

47
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,360
For dads.

48
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,200
Or was it like a yelp to great dads you've experienced?

49
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,280
I think it was a yelp just for dads. I actually, thinking about it, I made

50
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,840
teengoogle.com goes to Still Buffering, the podcast about the teenage experience,

51
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,960
and I have been thinking about it. I think dadyelp should probably go to We

52
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,880
Got This with Mark and Hal. That's basically like dadyelp, right?

53
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,120
I do like, Justin, how your domains have become the Christian mingle of, I guess,

54
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,840
weird comedy. It's just always something mingle.

55
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,720
What I love is that I forget the jokes that we tell more or less as soon as we publish

56
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,640
the episode that contains them, and yet you pay an annual fee to remember our half jokes.

57
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,360
It's as though our dumb, dumb jokes cost you money to make.

58
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,080
You are paying a premium for our dumb, dumb jokes.

59
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,600
Yeah, just some other ones that have come up. Literally just this month, I guess in

60
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,600
January, I go hard on domains. Just this month, illegal.horse is back up

61
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,680
for renewal. Sexymugshots.com.

62
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,240
That autofills every time I press S, and I have to remind myself that I'm not a deep

63
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,360
web pervert. Sexymugshots.com is back up for renewal.

64
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,400
That goes to our YouTube channel for some reason.

65
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,120
Also, other domains that have just popped up, my youngest son's seventh word, hyphen,

66
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,800
my youngest son's 15th word,.pizza, is back up for renewal.

67
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:00,400
That deep cut from the MBMBAM ARG, TV show ARG, and I think those are all the domains

68
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,360
that are up. Oh, BooBooNanny.com.

69
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,320
Do not remember why BooBooNanny. So that's like $500 that you're paying

70
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,200
to keep these balls in the air. I keep waiting for the offers to come in

71
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,960
on these domains for someone to try to buy them out from underneath me.

72
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Do you claim those on your taxes as expenses, and are you worried about getting audited?

73
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,120
I mean, they're legitimate. It's a legitimate business expense, I think.

74
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,440
Which one vapes is broken now? Oh, no.

75
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,360
I know. Got too hot.

76
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,400
Got too hot. Whoever created which one vapes, please fix it.

77
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,440
Should we answer some questions, you think? Oh, that sounds actually really nice.

78
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,960
Griff, you're Griffin, yeah. That sounds nice.

79
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,200
One of my friends recently got really into baking loaves of bread

80
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,840
and likes to share them with me. Problem is, they all taste super bad.

81
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,720
It's a bad bake, Barry. It's a bad bake.

82
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,400
How can I be gracious in accepting his gifts without wasting a bunch of bread?

83
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,760
I don't want to tell him the bread sucks because he's very proud of them,

84
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,720
but what do I do? That says, thanks.

85
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,440
Awkward in Philly is who that's from. Can you waste bad bread is the question.

86
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,280
The bread's wasted. Yeah.

87
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,480
The bread is wasted. Well, what has been wasted here is the flour,

88
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,400
the yeast, the water and sugar. The time.

89
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:25,840
The time, especially. The heat from the oven, that energy can't be created or destroyed,

90
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,400
but it can be wasted firming up some bad bread. That energy is trapped in that bread,

91
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,040
and if you don't free it, it's just trapped there forever.

92
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,840
Well, you free it by giving it to a duck, who then turns it into dookie and duck flight.

93
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,280
Duckie dookie, yes. So the ducks fly and makes all the wind,

94
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,360
but sometimes the wind gets to be too bad and we get hurricanes, tornadoes.

95
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,560
Dry it out, put it in the food processor, whiz it into bread crumbs,

96
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,440
and then take a coffee can and cover it in peanut butter,

97
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,800
and then put the bread crumbs all over that, and then hang the coffee can outside.

98
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,720
You got yourself a nice little bird feeder. And then you wait for them to fall into your trap.

99
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,160
Yeah. Yeah. I do like awkward

100
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,600
and feel like that you have failed to see that there might be a middle road between accepting

101
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,800
the bad bread and saying, this bread sucks. And that is not returning your friend's

102
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,040
calls ever again. Well, no, but like,

103
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,200
it's pretty well-established practice to say like, oh, this is great.

104
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,280
And then give like a tiny note, like a tiny note.

105
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,880
Oh, is that established? Is that something I can do with my day-to-day?

106
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,880
Someone's just starting out when someone's just starting out on a new hobby experience,

107
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,640
like to try to pretend like you nailed it 100% the first time.

108
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,680
Nobody expects that. Now it might be too late now

109
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,000
because you might have accepted too many. But this is more of a cautionary tale for the next

110
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,080
loaf receiver to say like, oh, this is great. Maybe a little too much salt.

111
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,480
Try less next time. Boom. Done.

112
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,640
You've established like, because if somebody is trying out a new experience,

113
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,200
they want feedback. They don't want you to be like,

114
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,600
you're the greatest. That's right. I love you,

115
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,840
but they wicked don't. Unless your friend has said,

116
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,000
be sure to hit me with all of your great feedback after you finish consuming my gift,

117
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,240
then they do not in fact want that. I bake from time to time,

118
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,560
and I know I over-need my stuff sometimes. And all I want is for people to look at me

119
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,040
like I'm the motherfucking barefoot Contessa. Like that's literally all that I need from

120
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,640
that transaction. Also, it's like, I wish this person had been more specific

121
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:45,040
with the problems in the bread because your friend, like, unless you're a bread expert,

122
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,200
maybe you're not going to know that like, hey, you had too much leavening in here.

123
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,320
Like, hey, you added a little bit too much milk and you made the batter too wet.

124
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,560
You're not going to know that from eating the bread.

125
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,080
You got to watch your friend bake the bread step by step. And then you'll see the process.

126
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,640
Like you got to pour the yeast in, pour water. You want that water to be between 100 and 110

127
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,840
degrees. Activate the yeast for about five minutes. Then you're going to add your dry

128
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,240
ingredients. Incorporate those in a little bit of egg. And then I'm going to dump in a two liter

129
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,120
Mountain Dew and then move it. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on. I think I see the

130
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,280
problem. Oh, the two pages stuck together in the book, you were making Mountain Dew cake.

131
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,680
It's different. It's a different one. You weren't using Diet Mountain Dew. And that's where the

132
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,320
flavor sleeps. Actually, if you want a fucking cake, you take cake mix, mix it with 12 ounces

133
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,000
of soda and you got yourself a fucking cake going. That's a cake right there. Make a Mountain Dew

134
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,360
with a little bit of lemon cake mix, Mountain Dew. Yeah, do you bake that or just, like,

135
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,720
eat it with a spoon? While crying and also getting psyched up to play esports.

136
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:58,160
Uh, how about a Yahoo Griffin? I would love to give that to you because here's one from

137
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,840
Level 9000. Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew Davenport. Thank you, Drew. It's a Yahoo Answers user.

138
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:09,680
Let's kick it after school. Who asks, should I punch Tyler in the face if he insists on calling

139
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,320
eating refueling? He's annoying me. End of question. Now, no, you shouldn't punch your

140
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,960
friend Tyler in the face. But I think if anybody in your life refers to the act of eating food,

141
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,920
whether it's, you know, a big sloppy Joe or a rack of ribs or some weird bad Mountain Dew bread,

142
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,520
and they call that refueling, they need to be punished in some way. Unless. This is going to

143
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:42,320
be a tricky needle, but unless. They're a robot. A robot who eats. Is your friend Tyler a robot?

144
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,920
Yeah. I mean, what? It's 2018. We're just going to toss out the fact that it might be a robot?

145
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,960
No, there's a good chance that it is, you know, some sort of frame. Is Tyler maybe a medium wonder?

146
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,760
Not a small one, but an okay size. Yeah, it's okay size wonder. It's a medium wonder. Oh,

147
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,040
all right. I've got to refuel. When you say eating, do you ever see the food actually go

148
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,480
into Tyler's mouth and then defecate that food out later? Or maybe he just dumps out his chest

149
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,840
cavity. Have you followed it start to finish? Is his head a Mr. Fusion machine like in Back to

150
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:23,200
the Future 2? These are all good questions. These are the people, and these are the exact

151
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:31,280
circumstances those people can be in, in which you can refer to eating food as refueling. If you are

152
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:37,200
a snowboarder who is on the slopes, and you've just carved a very, very sick line, and you've done all

153
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,400
the tricks, and I'm talking about Olympic level, you know, grabs and spins, and then you get to

154
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:49,920
the bottom, and you pop into the lodge, and you grab a quick like, you know. No, I think you just

155
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,960
maybe even pull some jerky out of your fanny pack, and you eat some jerky, and you say,

156
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:02,400
gotta refuel. That's okay, because you've just done things that I think could necessitate fuel.

157
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,280
Or a mountain biker. If you're a mountain biker, and you just really any sort of downhill activities,

158
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,680
and you reach the bottom of the hill, and you want to go again, any food you eat at that point,

159
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,360
I think you can say, time to refuel, bro. Surfers, I think, can also, you pat the tummy after doing

160
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,680
a good pipe, and then you have to pat the tummy, and you say, gotta refuel before I can get out

161
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:30,800
there, and that's about it. Query for you, Griffin. Yes. Query. I am a blue belt in Taekwondo. My body

162
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,560
is legally classified as a weapon at this point. Yeah, you are, you're on the registry.

163
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:43,120
Master Cricket Trise Taekwondo says that my reaction time at this point is probably five

164
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,160
percent better than someone who hasn't studied as long as I have, so I'm basically a weapon.

165
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:56,320
And a wonderland. If I eat, like when I eat my quest bar, can I say, I've gotta reload?

166
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:05,920
Reload or refuel? Reload. Am I reloading my weapon if I'm just eating a quest bar? I'm reloading the

167
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,960
weapon. I do think, to Griffin's point, and I think in all the scenarios Griffin listed,

168
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,080
it has to be, like you have, like if you flip somebody, right, then immediately

169
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:22,080
eat it. There's a proximity to the event. It has to be immediate. You flip somebody which,

170
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,400
um, based on what I know about sort of the classes you attend as, you know, a ten-year-old,

171
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,640
and then you flip them and they land real hard, and then you say like, gotta reload,

172
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,040
and you open up your mouth and you unwrap the quest bar and you go,

173
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,400
and maybe like another combatant's coming at you and you put your hand out for a second,

174
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,200
take a bite of the quest bar, and then suddenly you grow like six inches and then flip them again.

175
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,080
Yeah, you must get stronger after eating the quest bar.

176
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,480
I eat my quest bar right before class usually, so could I say like,

177
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,240
sorry, hold on, Master Croc, gotta cock the food gun.

178
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,640
Yeah, gotta stockpile some punch ammo.

179
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,640
Yes, yes, yes. This all works. I do think that there's a certain amount of time after,

180
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,760
like you can't finish class, go home, watch like an episode of Drunk History,

181
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,000
and maybe take a nap and then wake up and say, gotta reload.

182
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,240
Gotta refuel. It's weird.

183
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,520
I had a fun experience in Taekwondo class a little bit ago I wanted to share with y'all.

184
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,760
We were doing a thing kind of like conditioning, you know, a lot of it's just like building up

185
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,720
your cardiovascular health, that kind of thing. It's great for you.

186
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,400
So we were doing this thing where we had to like do, I think,

187
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,600
round kicks on a bag as many times as we could in a minute,

188
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,840
and another guy in my class who is a great guy, but for some reason it was just the two of us in

189
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,320
class, so I got weirdly competitive. So he kicked the bag like 40 times in a minute,

190
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,640
and he was like really winded, and I was like, I'm gonna fuck this guy up.

191
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,760
So I kicked the bag 50 times in a minute.

192
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,320
Whoa.

193
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,240
And yeah, I kicked the bag 50 times in a minute, and then Master Croc was like,

194
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,400
wow, Dustin, good job, I'm very proud of you.

195
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,280
And then I took four steps away and threw up on the floor.

196
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:12,800
That's amazing, because I was also about to ask,

197
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,880
do you think that your master was about to be like,

198
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,080
you're the chosen one, and then you vomit, and he's like, wait, never.

199
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,160
Probably for about four seconds he was like that.

200
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,600
Now just something I gotta say, right there is a perfect refuel opportunity.

201
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,040
That is, the things I wanted to refuel on though was like oxygen.

202
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,840
I don't think that's what I didn't have enough of in that moment.

203
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,440
Oxygenated blood would be great to reload that in the chamber.

204
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,800
I joined a, when I was living in LA, I joined a gym,

205
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,880
and along with it came like one free consultation with a personal trainer.

206
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,600
And the personal trainer was talking to me, and they were like,

207
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,800
so what's your level of it?

208
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
I was like, let me stop you there, the answer is not.

209
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,960
And he was like, well, let me run you through some stuff.

210
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,160
And we did 10 seconds of like these jumping things,

211
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,880
and I went in the bathroom and threw up, and I came back,

212
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,560
and he was like, are you ready to keep going?

213
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,560
And I was like, in what way is me throwing up not the end of this?

214
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,480
Well, they were called burpees, Trav.

215
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,120
They're called burpees, Trav, so you really should have seen it coming.

216
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,720
I mean, I guess.

217
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,760
I never went back, and he like called me once a month like,

218
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,200
hey, just wondering if you wanted to pick up.

219
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,920
I was like, I am all set, thank you very much.

220
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,120
To continue the metaphor, my non-existent exercise regimen

221
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,720
is as such that I am essentially standing at my own fuel pump,

222
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,840
just letting the thing overflow.

223
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,560
I am, if anything, I am over-fueled,

224
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,440
and there's about ankle-high sort of pool of fuel

225
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,640
just laying on the ground that I am just not burning.

226
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,360
And really, that's in preparation for if shit goes down,

227
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,920
my body will be just crazy and wild and just ready for action.

228
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,920
But it's really a fire hazard.

229
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,840
How about another question?

230
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,960
Please do this.

231
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,760
My friend is a very kind person,

232
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,320
and she got a cute poster for me as a gift,

233
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
or else I think it was meant to be a gift.

234
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,920
A lot of bad gifts this week, huh?

235
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,600
Well, it's not the gift that was the problem this time, if you read on.

236
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,480
The thing is, we were both so socially awkward,

237
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,360
I'm afraid she might have just been showing it to me,

238
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,200
and I assumed it was a gift,

239
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,400
and she was too nervous to say that she was just showing it to me.

240
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,440
My question is this.

241
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,280
Is there a socially acceptable way to ask someone after the fact

242
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,440
whether or not something was actually a gift or not,

243
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,080
or am I doomed to live out the rest of my days wondering

244
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,880
whether or not I'm a socially awkward poster thief?

245
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,600
That's from Possible Poster Pinscher and KCMO.

246
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,680
You've actually come to the right place,

247
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,680
because literally every time we have ever done a signing

248
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,600
or just signed stuff for people after a show,

249
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,840
like literally four to five times,

250
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,280
I will be presented a picture or art or something,

251
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,960
and it's always beautiful,

252
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,920
and I'm always running the math in my head like,

253
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,960
am I to sign this or is this a gift to me?

254
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,640
Because if I ask, is this a gift, I cannot-

255
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,080
It sounds terrible.

256
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,280
It sounds terrible.

257
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,000
And this did happen to me once.

258
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,240
Yeah, we actively took something.

259
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,920
Somebody showed me a thing.

260
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,120
I was like, oh, this is great,

261
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,680
and I went and handed it to Teresa, and then I came back,

262
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,600
and they said, I do need that back.

263
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,560
And I was like, oh, yeah.

264
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,200
After one live show, I was doing my usual running

265
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,600
along the front of the stage, high-fiving people,

266
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,840
and somebody pointed to a hat they had.

267
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,920
I think the hat said Sweet Baby Brother

268
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,120
or something like that on it.

269
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,320
I forget what it said.

270
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,080
But I took the hat, and I took it,

271
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,680
and I was backstage reading Twitter,

272
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,440
seeing how people thought the show went,

273
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,200
and I got a tweet from somebody who was like,

274
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,920
geez, I'd love that hat back.

275
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,160
I really love that hat.

276
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
That is maybe the worst offense of all,

277
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,560
is there was no body language there to suggest,

278
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,240
like, here's a hat for you.

279
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,440
Although it did say something

280
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
that is one of my titles on it.

281
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,120
It might as well have said Griffin's hat.

282
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,800
It was your IP.

283
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,080
It was my IP.

284
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,920
And that's it, Griffin didn't take it to wear it.

285
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,840
He took it because it was copyright infringement.

286
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,760
No, and I immediately incinerated it.

287
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,280
That's a very different situation

288
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,440
from when Christian Novelty Music artist Mark Lowry

289
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,800
stole my hat at a concert because he wanted to wear it.

290
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,120
He knew it was an Atlanta Falcons hat,

291
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,520
and that's his, I guess, his team as well.

292
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,320
So he thought that he had dominion over my hat.

293
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,080
He did it on purpose? He coveted your hat?

294
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,040
He did it on purpose.

295
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,560
He coveted my hat, which is a sin.

296
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,440
Thank you, Travis.

297
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,200
And then he threw it into the crowd,

298
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,480
like, oh, wild show, Mark.

299
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,240
Can I get my hat back?

300
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,520
He threw it into the crowd as though

301
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,680
he could not return it to me.

302
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,160
Like, what an asshole.

303
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,400
Yeah, he was like halfway down the arena at that point,

304
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,680
and he just chucked into the crowd like,

305
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,040
oh man, what a fun show.

306
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,920
And there's like, it's a weird thing of statistics

307
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,080
because like, statistically, nobody cared about that hat.

308
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,480
Like, you weighed the statistics of the crowd.

309
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,760
Statistically, everybody thought,

310
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,560
oh man, that was just like a fun interaction that he had.

311
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,600
And if you did the stats, it'd be like 1,999% of the people

312
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,320
did not care.

313
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,840
And then there's like one statistical outlier that was me

314
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,920
that would like his hat back, please, Mark.

315
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,480
Now, Mark-

316
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,440
What I will say is, I think this is like a very funny

317
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,240
situation.

318
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Like, we have a good laugh about this

319
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,920
after when we're debriefing about the many, many sort

320
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,320
of societal norms we fucked up during each and every signing

321
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,480
because it's incalculable how many times we goof up just

322
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,320
talking to and interacting with other humans.

323
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,800
And we have a good laugh.

324
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh boy, can you believe you tried

325
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,160
to steal that person's hat and either failed or succeeded?

326
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
And so I don't think there's any problem with you

327
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,400
going to this person and being like, hey,

328
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,560
I have a weird question, but was that a gift

329
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,000
or were you just showing it to me?

330
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,080
Because there's no like bad-

331
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,480
If they're like, no, it was a gift, you goofus.

332
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,400
You can say like, okay, well, I didn't know

333
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,280
and I was worried about it.

334
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,640
Then I think you can kind of laugh it off.

335
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,880
Or if they say like, yeah, I was just showing it to you

336
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,640
and you took it and I didn't know how to respond.

337
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,760
And that's kind of funny too.

338
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,040
And they will give it back.

339
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,520
I don't think you have to worry too much about bringing this up.

340
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,480
Well, you could also just like find a copy of the poster

341
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,680
and get them one too and be like, now we're poster buddies.

342
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,360
Yeah, it's like if you steal a car,

343
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,680
as long as you buy them another car that looks like the car,

344
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,040
then you're totally fine.

345
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,400
Wouldn't you want- Wait, hold on.

346
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,160
Though, honestly, if someone stole your car

347
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,680
and you're like, ah, someone stole my car.

348
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,520
And then you went outside the next day

349
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,840
and there was a brand new version of that car.

350
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,000
Yeah, no, I mean, the thing I said was nonsense.

351
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,080
The thing I said was absolute dookie nonsense.

352
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,480
And I wasn't expecting one of you to call me on it,

353
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,240
but I guess you did.

354
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,000
And now this is where we're at.

355
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,760
My assumption, this is my question.

356
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,320
My assumption is that Mark Lowry

357
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
probably doesn't remember stealing my hat.

358
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,120
Yeah.

359
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,200
The day that Mark Lowry stole your hat

360
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,280
was the most important day of your life.

361
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,840
To me, it was Tuesday.

362
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,880
I always assume that.

363
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,560
But we have very clear, visceral memories

364
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,640
of every time we've ever fucked up.

365
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,280
Do you think that if I were to grill Mark Lowry,

366
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,040
he'd be like, ah, Justin.

367
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,760
Oh, man.

368
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,240
Hey, bud.

369
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,640
I think about that hat every day.

370
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,280
If you really want to Zap Rooter this event

371
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,160
that happened, this shared event in years of Mark Lowry's life,

372
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,400
the only reason he would wander back into the crowd

373
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,200
and throw the hat to a random person is,

374
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,640
A, he didn't know where you were,

375
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,280
but B, he knew he couldn't keep this hat.

376
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,640
He had absolved himself of the hat theft guilt.

377
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,280
It was a serendipity moment where he knew someday

378
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,720
that hat would make it back to you.

379
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,480
And if you're listening to this right now

380
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:30,880
and you're looking at your manhole-

381
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,240
And you're at a Mark Lowry concert

382
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,480
and you got hit in the face with the sharp bill

383
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,440
of an Atlanta Falcons cap and kept it out of spite.

384
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
Somewhere there was a huge fan of Mark Lowry

385
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,360
who has saved this hat as a memento

386
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,320
of the greatest day in their life

387
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,920
when Mark Lowry threw a hat to them.

388
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,600
And they are listening to this right now.

389
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,360
Get that to Justin.

390
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,320
It is a pretty damning comment or I guess

391
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,840
darning comment on Mark Lowry

392
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,880
because he's a Christian music artist.

393
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,280
It is a pretty damning comment on Mark Lowry.

394
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,520
The way his brain work was,

395
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,600
well, I took it from the crowd

396
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,520
and I gave it back to the crowd.

397
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,640
So I guess I'm okay.

398
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,280
Go back from whence you came, hat.

399
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,600
I think Mark suffers from the same

400
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,800
awkward sort of social issues

401
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,160
that the three of us have.

402
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,320
Where if somebody, I took somebody's hat

403
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,920
from the crowd at a live show

404
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,040
and then wanted to give it back to them

405
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,480
but did not know where they are.

406
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,920
I absolutely would just ultimate that motherfucker

407
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,440
right back down the center aisle

408
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,120
as hard as I possibly could.

409
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,360
Because at that point, I know I've still fucked up

410
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,040
but I at least will not have this reminder

411
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,360
on my dome constantly.

412
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
I think that Mark did the only logical thing

413
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,400
and I think we need to cut him some fucking slack.

414
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,040
Well, he did what we macros would have called yours now.

415
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,080
Yeah.

416
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,880
Which the last person to be touching the thing

417
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,000
just inherits the responsibility of having

418
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,240
to deal with the repercussions of having that thing.

419
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,800
Sure.

420
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,240
I got a quick Yahoo real quick

421
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,200
before we get to the money.

422
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,440
Yeah.

423
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,000
It was sent in by-

424
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,240
Do we don't want to talk about Mark Lowry anymore?

425
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,240
No, I think we've ostracized our audience enough

426
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,800
for one episode.

427
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,840
My brother, my brother and you.

428
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,800
Hannah Troxel sent this one in.

429
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,280
Thank you, Hannah.

430
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,600
It's Yahoo answers user, serve the servants asks.

431
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,360
This is a quick one.

432
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,360
Just looking for a quick answer from you guys.

433
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,320
Straw poll.

434
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:14,640
Okay.

435
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
If Jurassic Park was real, would you go?

436
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,680
Cool.

437
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,840
Okay, wait.

438
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,920
There's a very important factor here I need to know

439
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,680
and maybe we can just acknowledge this

440
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,720
and then put it away.

441
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,240
Is Jurassic Park real in a world

442
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,720
in which we have all seen the Jurassic Park movies?

443
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,600
I would think no.

444
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,840
Then yes, I would go.

445
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,480
Hands down.

446
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,240
Okay, then what if the answer is yes?

447
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,280
Then no, I would not go.

448
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,440
I've seen what happens when we meddle in God's play place.

449
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,040
I do not know.

450
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,400
The more interesting question is

451
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,800
you see a news story.

452
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,000
You're you, okay?

453
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,880
But it's tomorrow.

454
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:52,960
Wait, slow down.

455
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Yeah, you're you, but it's tomorrow

456
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,520
and you just see a sign that's like

457
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,680
real Jurassic Park open, believe it or not.

458
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,040
Did you say Jurassic?

459
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,680
You did.

460
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,720
No, is that a mix of-

461
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,880
Real Gibroni Park is open.

462
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,120
These dinosaurs are real Gibronis.

463
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,800
I'm gonna crotch chop all these T-Rexes.

464
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,000
It's real Jurassic Park,

465
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,480
except they're aware also of the films.

466
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,080
So they're like, listen, it's not gonna be like this.

467
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,280
We know how this sounds.

468
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,040
We know how it sounds.

469
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,320
It's not gonna be like that.

470
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,480
We've taken every precaution.

471
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,320
This is, listen, can't stress enough,

472
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,920
we have also seen the movies.

473
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,440
We have been so careful.

474
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,560
We know about our brand.

475
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,960
I guess I am describing Jurassic World

476
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,000
at this point, I guess.

477
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,320
But it's like, yes, we know.

478
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,040
We get it.

479
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,720
We get your hesitation.

480
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,280
But it is real Jurassic Park and we fixed it.

481
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,000
And Travis, you have the only-

482
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,760
Okay, here, let me sweeten the pot for you.

483
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,400
It's not sweeten.

484
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,840
It's like sweetening the question.

485
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,600
You have a ticket, but it is for opening day.

486
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,960
At real Jurassic Park.

487
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,440
But they swear, but they swear.

488
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,160
I'm more likely to go on opening day,

489
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
because that's when they're gonna be most on point.

490
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,680
You don't wanna go two years in

491
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,440
when they started to get lax with it.

492
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,240
Yeah, you get fucking Chester, the townie,

493
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,480
watching the fucking raptor cages,

494
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,920
like, oh, come on, boys.

495
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,040
I just got a text.

496
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Uh-oh, I turned my back on the raptor cages.

497
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,320
Now I've been destroyed.

498
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,240
That logic doesn't hold, Travis.

499
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,760
You look at opening day of like,

500
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,120
Magic Kingdom or Epcot, when those open,

501
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,960
and they were up against the clock,

502
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,480
but you had huge breakdown in Ride, Space Mountain.

503
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,320
And Mickey ate all those people.

504
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,920
Mickey did eat all the kids, yeah.

505
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,800
Was broken down more than it was open.

506
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,920
I mean, both of those were because they were so taxed

507
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,160
by the crowds of people that were there.

508
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,960
Snap is.

509
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,160
Yeah, I don't think that doesn't inoculate you, I think.

510
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,720
Let me-

511
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,760
Because they're not ready for that,

512
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,680
that number of people.

513
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,640
Let me hit you with this plot for Jurassic World 2.

514
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,140
Okay.

515
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,360
Me as John Hammond Jr. Jr.

516
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,160
Uh-huh.

517
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,920
And I'm like, I got it this time.

518
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,040
I'm gonna do it again.

519
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,080
And then I'm gonna have like a board of people who are like,

520
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,600
no, so, so many people have died.

521
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
You've done this eight times, John.

522
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,240
It's never worked.

523
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,640
And I say, don't worry.

524
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,240
First of all, shut up.

525
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,840
You don't tell me what to do.

526
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,960
My family made dinosaurs happen again.

527
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,480
New Jurassic World, and you're gonna love this.

528
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,080
It's just all brontosauruses.

529
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,880
Roll credits, no action, don't worry about it.

530
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,840
Never been a brontosaurus based death in those movies.

531
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,960
These gentle giants would never step on a toddler.

532
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,400
I love these gentle giants.

533
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,640
They're not going, unless the toddler is made of leaves

534
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,080
or maybe the only thing is just like, you open it up

535
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,360
and it's all brontosauruses.

536
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,840
And then you're like, oh, it'll be totally safe.

537
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,160
And then, you know, fucking Andy from Parks and Rec is there

538
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,760
and he's like, I don't know about this.

539
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,640
I think it's gonna go bad.

540
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,760
And then everybody else is like, don't worry about it.

541
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,040
It's all brontosauruses.

542
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,560
And it's like, okay, here they come.

543
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,920
Open up the gates, everybody comes in.

544
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,600
It's like, hi, welcome to Jurassic World.

545
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,040
Here's your ghillie suit.

546
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,160
And it's like, no, no, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.

547
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,080
It is wild when you think about the original Jurassic Park.

548
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,520
First time, right?

549
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,880
There was definitely a moment where somebody like,

550
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,880
knock, knock, knock on John Hammond's head.

551
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,640
Knock, knock on John Hammond's door.

552
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,440
He looks up from his dope ice cream, spared no expense.

553
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,360
Looks at them in the face and they're like,

554
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,680
hey, should we make a T-Rex?

555
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,880
And he was like, oh, hell yeah.

556
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,000
Yeah, definitely.

557
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,240
Well, John, hold on, I know I asked,

558
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,680
but you can see how this goes bad, right?

559
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,360
Should we make velociraptors?

560
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, yeah, that'd be great.

561
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,760
The logic there is that like,

562
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,920
if you made a park with dinosaurs,

563
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,520
people wouldn't come unless it had dope ones that they liked.

564
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,640
Are you kidding me, John?

565
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,680
Hold on, I would like,

566
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,080
this is my plot for Jurassic World too, right?

567
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,680
Open it up, they have made one Triceratops.

568
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,400
Big initial, big initial opening.

569
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Everybody goes, I think two years in,

570
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,120
it's like, well, we're bankrupt, rule credits.

571
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,400
Nobody came anymore.

572
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,840
Everybody got bored with dinosaurs.

573
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,960
Everybody saw the one Triceratops we made.

574
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,800
Okay, here's my-

575
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,360
What if you got to keep a Triceratops when you left?

576
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,440
That is, I will say, my one logical problem

577
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,760
with Jurassic World is there is a line,

578
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
I think, where Bryce Dallas Howard says,

579
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,840
you know what people want?

580
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,160
Bigger dinosaurs.

581
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,160
And I said, I don't think that's true.

582
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,120
What everybody wants is like a tiny T-Rex

583
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,800
they can keep in an aquarium on their desk.

584
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,760
Like, that would be sick.

585
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,760
If you're gonna manufacture different sized dinosaurs,

586
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,840
make me a really tiny brontosaurus.

587
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,640
Give me a digipet is basically what I want.

588
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,680
And also, Bryce, I think you've misunderstood

589
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,720
what the audience for this amusement park wants,

590
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,480
and that is to visit it and not be destroyed

591
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,480
by a powerful dinosaur jaw.

592
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,920
Is my number one thing.

593
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,240
If I heard, we got a new Jurassic World,

594
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,920
and here's the attraction that you're just gonna go nuts for,

595
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,200
we've made bigger, more deadly dinosaurs,

596
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,600
I would say, well, y'all have really lost the,

597
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,920
I can see the review on, you know, The Verge.

598
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,760
Like, I feel like their hearts

599
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,520
in the wrong place on this one.

600
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,600
I feel like maybe they should focus more

601
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,520
on dinosaurs that won't destroy the children

602
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,360
with the powerful jaws and claws.

603
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,000
Tiny dinosaurs like the ones from Peelee's Playhouse.

604
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,840
That's what I want.

605
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,660
Those are fun.

606
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,720
We're talking.

607
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,600
Here's my pitch for Jurassic Park 3.

608
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,960
Even though I made one, here's what I would do,

609
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,880
probably fail at me remake Jurassic Park 3.

610
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,960
Still Griffin is John Hammond Jr. Jr.

611
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,320
Because I love this character of John Hammond Jr. Jr.,

612
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,000
sort of a petulant descendant.

613
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,200
He's a real pissy, real pissy mess.

614
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,960
And there's just so many merch opportunities.

615
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,520
Yeah, he inherited the whole thing.

616
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,800
And Jurassic Park 3 is about him going to Isla Sorna

617
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,160
because they wiped out all the ones on Isla Nubar.

618
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,800
But he goes to Isla Sorna and he just is gonna take them all

619
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,000
because they're his.

620
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,040
So the movie is about, these are my dinosaurs.

621
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,040
My pap pap made them and I'm gonna put them all on my boat

622
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,800
and take them to my house.

623
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,840
Yeah, you can't eat me, T-Rex.

624
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,960
I'm your uncle, basically.

625
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,080
Basically your uncle.

626
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,920
You wouldn't eat your uncle, would you?

627
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,880
Put you in a boat and take you to my home

628
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,760
because you're my dinosaur because of my pap pap.

629
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,120
And now it's we bought a zoo.

630
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,040
It's like we bought a Jurassic Park and it's like,

631
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,920
I don't know, this is really gonna put some stress

632
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,760
on the family.

633
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,760
Like what, having a bunch of velociraptors around?

634
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,040
Come on, Susan.

635
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,360
These are my velociraptors.

636
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,560
They're my nephews and I love them.

637
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,720
They listen to me.

638
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,540
They don't.

639
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,380
They listen to me.

640
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,800
They don't, they super don't.

641
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,840
Just stop putting meat eaters in your,

642
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,960
stop putting carnivores, just put herbivores.

643
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,400
I would have gone to Jurassic Park

644
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,440
for the opportunity to meet Wade Knight.

645
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,280
Like you don't need to put a bunch of dinosaurs in there.

646
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,720
Okay, wait, hold on.

647
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,040
What people want is bigger Wayne.

648
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,200
What I have done, I made a 10-foot Wayne Knight

649
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,740
and he is an herbivore.

650
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,720
He's an herbivore.

651
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,960
We got him eating kale and he's just crazy about it.

652
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,280
We keep him in this big pen.

653
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,620
We cloned a bunch of Wayne Knights.

654
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,400
I found a Wayne Knight and a piece of amber.

655
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,600
Oh boy.

656
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,320
Oh my God, Wayne Knight is pregnant.

657
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,800
Nature finds a way.

658
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,560
Nature finds a way.

659
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,040
Let's go to the money's end.

660
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:17,040
Just add the pregnant Wayne Knight to my Tumblr tags

661
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,800
and we're good to go.

662
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,760
Hey everybody.

663
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,600
Do you want to make a fan site for pregnant Wayne Knight?

664
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,320
The pregnant Wayne Knight fan site?

665
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,160
Sure you do.

666
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,980
We all do.

667
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,820
But how?

668
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,320
You don't know anything about coding.

669
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,720
You don't know shit.

670
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,080
Well, with Squarespace, you can.

671
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,640
You can make a cool website dedicated

672
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,760
to just about anything you want

673
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,400
and you can publish content there,

674
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,360
links to videos, sell products and services.

675
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,040
Great for if you want to keep people up to date

676
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,720
for announcements or upcoming events or anything like that.

677
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,760
Squarespace is perfect.

678
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,880
I've made a couple of websites on Squarespace now

679
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,300
and I don't know anything about building websites,

680
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,400
but Squarespace makes it so easy

681
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,640
to just like add in the elements that you need

682
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,360
and anything you don't understand,

683
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,280
they have 24-7 award-winning customer support

684
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,120
and I will say, and the copy doesn't say this,

685
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,480
but I found it so useful.

686
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,240
There are like countless YouTube videos that are like,

687
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,080
oh, you want to do this?

688
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,240
Here's how.

689
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,240
Yeah, it's super easy.

690
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,080
I mean, Travis made mackerelishows.com.

691
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,280
I made griffinmackerel.com.

692
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,040
It took like an hour.

693
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,240
It's so easy.

694
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,120
And there are so many different like options

695
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,440
for stuff you can do.

696
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,800
And if you do know about coding,

697
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,960
there's also areas where you can add HTML

698
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,360
and that kind of thing to customize it even more.

699
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,120
And you can find your own domains like Justin does

700
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,120
and make the website really your own.

701
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,800

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,120

708
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,480
I want to tell you about SAMPS.com.

709
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,400
Here's a New Year's resolution you can actually keep.

710
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,020
I know this is still on the forefront of everybody's minds

711
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,280
is these resys.

712
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,820
You can add SAMPS.com to your business

713
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,280
and you can save time and money this year

714
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,480
because SAMPS.com brings all the amazing services

715
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,080
of the US Postal Service right to your computer.

716
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,760
You can use your computer to print US postage

717
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,540
for any letter or package, any class of mail,

718
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,560
and then the mail carrier comes

719
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,440
and picks it right up from you.

720
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,320
SAMPS.com can also send you a digital scale

721
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,700
that automatically calculates exact postage.

722
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,240
It's really very, very convenient.

723
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,480
Sometimes you're not able to leave the house

724
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,120
and go run to the post office,

725
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,040
and so they bring the magic of the post office to you.

726
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,880
So right now you can enjoy the SAMPS.

727
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,960
If anything, I would say that it's too convenient.

728
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,920
Sometimes I just mail stuff because I can.

729
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,920
You know what I mean?

730
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,080
I just pick up a piece of paper, SAMPS.com it,

731
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,640
put it in the mail, get it out there.

732
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,440
And then people are like, there's nothing on this.

733
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,800
I mailed Travis some garbage

734
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,520
that I just didn't feel like standing up

735
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,680
and going to the trash can.

736
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,520
That was garbage?

737
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,380
Yeah, it was garbage.

738
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,200
Yeah, well, you're the trash king.

739
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,260
Anyway, right now you can enjoy

740
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,040
the SAMPS.com service with a special offer

741
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,360
that includes a four-week trial,

742
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,720
plus postage and a digital scale.

743
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,100
If you're ready for a happier new year,

744
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,440
just go to SAMPS.com, click on the microphone

745
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,000
at the top of the homepage, and type in my brother.

746
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
At SAMPS.com, enter my brother.

747
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,880
All one word.

748
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,200
My brother. All one word.

749
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,080
You're wondering if Torcy would win

750
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,440
in a knockdown dragout brawl against Dunkey?

751
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,240
Those are characters that we created,

752
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,720
so this is a IP-violating Jumbotron message.

753
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Maybe you've pondered if Titliquid, okay,

754
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,240
would emerge victorious from a back alley free-for-all?

755
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,240
Absolutely would.

756
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,400
No question about it.

757
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,220
No question.

758
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,740
On the Ultimate Showdown podcast,

759
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,060
we don't debate those specific fights, sorry,

760
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,200
but we do debate other great matchups for the ages,

761
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,360
like Punisher versus Beatrix Kiddo,

762
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,580
or Fezzik versus Jaws.

763
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,080
Join Tristan the Marine.

764
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,920
What's up?

765
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,860
Cheryl. What's up?

766
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,860
Cheryl Cannon and Fowler each week

767
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,120
as they debate the age-old question,

768
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,120
who would win in a fight?

769
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,480
And that show is called Ultimate Showdown.

770
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,240
You can look for it wherever you download podcasts,

771
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,800
and remember, fight it out,

772
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,960
but be excellent to each other.

773
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,160
Do you want me to read this next one?

774
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,960
Yes. Yes, I do.

775
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,440
This message is for Sunflower Station,

776
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,800
and it's from Sunflower Station,

777
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,080
who says, oh man, hello?

778
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,920
Hello, Macawois?

779
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,600
This message comes from Sunflower Station,

780
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,640
Veyron's band of meme criminals.

781
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,680
Thank you, Veyron, for creating a space

782
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,600
where we can all support each other

783
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,080
on our art and daily worries,

784
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,160
play D&D and watch Flintstones.

785
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,060
Viva Rock Vegas together.

786
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:36,900
That's the name of the movie.

787
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,880
I don't know why I added a period there.

788
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,000
Here's to many more great memories and internet friends.

789
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,240
P.S., Hamtaro Bot still sucks.

790
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,620
Well, Hamtaro Bot has feelings.

791
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,900
I don't know why you would say that.

792
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,400
I also don't know if I said Veyron's name correctly,

793
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,140
but I sure hope that I did.

794
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,600
This is a wonderful little crowd, it sounds like,

795
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,280
and I'm sitting here trying to think

796
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,920
if I've seen Flintstones, Viva Rock Vegas,

797
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,200
and the answer is no.

798
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,360
Wait, is that the one with Kyle McLaughlin,

799
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,020
or is that the first one?

800
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,720
I think they both have him in it.

801
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,600
The second one is the one with Alan Cumming

802
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,760
as the Great Gazoo.

803
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,600
Oh, of course.

804
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,480
So if you have that, you would not forget that.

805
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,320
You would not have the half of it.

806
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,120
And which Barney is it?

807
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,440
It's still the original, still the original cast.

808
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,260
Are you sure?

809
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,560
Because I think one is Rick Moranis.

810
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're right.

811
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,880
It's not Rick Moranis, it's a bald one.

812
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,160
Yeah, Dick Moranis.

813
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,360
We have another message.

814
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,400
I'm Dick Moranis, the evil Rick Moranis.

815
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,840
But also Rick Moranis is my brother, he's cool.

816
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,320
Honey, I shrunk the kids, who fucking cares?

817
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,840
I'm Dick Moranis.

818
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,660
This is a message for A from H.

819
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,920
To my wife and best friend, thank you for giving me Taz.

820
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,480
And then when I ran out, NBNB AM,

821
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,180
even starting at episode one when you said I shouldn't.

822
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,620
I can't believe how much we've accomplished in time period,

823
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,760
but only together could we get it done.

824
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,800
So let's have these good, good boys

825
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,760
tell you how much I love you, and it's a lot.

826
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,760
You are my everything.

827
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,800
It's very nice and also vague.

828
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,280
That's so sweet, that's so sweet.

829
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,240
I think it was Steven Baldwin, for the record.

830
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,560
Hey everyone, Freddie Wong.

831
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,400
Matt Arnold.

832
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,220
And Will Campos.

833
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,520
We'll tell you about Story Break, a writer's room podcast

834
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,800
where every week we, the Hollywood geniuses

835
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,000
behind video game high school, have one hour

836
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,600
to turn a humble idea into an awesome movie.

837
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,400
Thrill as we weave the tragic tale of Jar Jar,

838
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
a Star Wars story.

839
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,960
We're going to double down on everything

840
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,200
that made the prequels great.

841
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,320
Jar Jar, trade federations, politics.

842
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,880
Gasp as we assemble a pantheon of heroes

843
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,760
for the Kellogg's cinematic universe.

844
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,960
We could get rid of Snap, Crackle, Pop.

845
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,560
I wouldn't even miss them.

846
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,320
You're crazy.

847
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,480
They die in the second act.

848
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,920
Oh, come on.

849
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,360
And join us as we make fun of Matt

850
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,360
as he struggles to name a single Beyonce song.

851
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,360
Well, yeah, put a finger on it.

852
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,320
Sure, she wants to be Beyonce.

853
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,120
Put a finger on it, Beyonce's famous song.

854
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,240
Will we break the story?

855
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,900
Or will the story break us?

856
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,980
Find out by joining us in the writer's room every Thursday

857
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,520
on maximumfun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.

858
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,480
Here's a Yahoo sent in by Merritt Palmer.

859
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,400
Thank you, Merritt.

860
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,560
I've noticed a strange habit I have.

861
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,120
If I'm at a coffee shop, I will take sips out of my empty mug.

862
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,560
Nervous habit or what?

863
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,080
And that was asked by me in college.

864
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,360
It's actually an anonymous user.

865
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,000
But we'll say it was from me in college.

866
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,880
Additional details.

867
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,800
I do it more when I'm staring around in space.

868
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,880
The coffee shop is a real performative battleground,

869
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,440
isn't it?

870
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,680
Because you want to look like you're enjoying the coffee

871
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,000
shop the best and most.

872
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,480
And you sit there and the coffee's empty,

873
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,320
but you still want to look impressive,

874
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,280
like you understand the complexity

875
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,900
of each beautiful bean.

876
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,200
And so you sip it.

877
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,000
And I would often say things, usually under my breath,

878
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,040
but akin to like, mm, exquisite beans today.

879
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,680
Or, mm, what a fascinating bean.

880
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,360
Usually something complimentary about the bean.

881
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,600
Or like, mm, I can really tell where the beans came from.

882
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,640
And say stuff like that.

883
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,040
Spicy note to the beans today, Michael.

884
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,000
And usually there wasn't a Michael, but.

885
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,360
One thing I like is complimenting the roast.

886
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,600
Like, oh, what a flirty roast.

887
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,760
What a flirty roast, Eddie.

888
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,200
What a juicy roast.

889
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,880
You really roasted the piss out of these beans.

890
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,520
Oh, yeah, you roasted the shit out of these.

891
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,760
These bad boys are toasty and roasty.

892
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,440
And I can really taste the complexity of the notes.

893
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,920
One thing to do that's good at the coffee shop

894
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,520
that they actually like is, before they brew your coffee,

895
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,840
ask if they can take a handful of beans and roast them more.

896
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,480
And they can.

897
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,400
So they just scoop some out of the machine,

898
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,680
and then they put them in the oven

899
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,680
that they use to heat up the turkey and cheddar sandwiches.

900
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,920
And they'll just roast them more.

901
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,460
And they'll, at first, they might kind of be like, huh?

902
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,200
But then the more wizened pros at Starbucks

903
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,720
will be like, oh, he's been around.

904
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,600
He knows that these beans need just a second long.

905
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,000
Right, and it's good if you wait to do this

906
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,040
until after you sort of examine the beans.

907
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,940
So it's like you've made a judgment call

908
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,560
that they could probably go back.

909
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,880
Get out your little jewelers kind of glass.

910
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,720
Oh, that's good, yeah.

911
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,920
Oh, that's good.

912
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,000
One more minute.

913
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,760
Chomp one up and crunch it until it's just coffee grounds,

914
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,880
and then go, eh, bleh, eh, eh,

915
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,040
and then spit it in the trash can.

916
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,000
Because you're not gonna eat it.

917
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,960
No.

918
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,640
But it is, I think, nice to ask for your coffee

919
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,600
to have a little bit of pulp.

920
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,720
Just say, give me some of the beans sort of in there.

921
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,680
I want to strain it with my teeth.

922
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,560
Everybody filters out the pulp.

923
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,400
Thank you, Griffin.

924
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,640
That's such a good note.

925
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,920
That's where all the nutrients are, is in the pulp.

926
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,920
Otherwise, it's just.

927
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,320
Make sure you ask them to leave room for the Holy Spirit.

928
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,280
Yeah, yeah, you want room for cream,

929
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,240
and you want a little bit of Holy Spirit in there.

930
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,220
And then other, if you don't got pulp,

931
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,560
we're basically just talking about hot bean water.

932
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,400
Yeah.

933
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,240
And that's not what God wanted.

934
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,720
You need a better mouth feel.

935
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,340
That's always my problem with that weak,

936
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,820
it's just liquid coffee.

937
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,960
Like, what's that?

938
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,800
You know what I mean?

939
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,720
Like, one good thing to do at the coffee store

940
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,840
is ask for room for cream,

941
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,840
and then when they give you your coffee,

942
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,360
turn on your heel and walk out the door.

943
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,260
And they're gonna take a second and be like,

944
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,320
wait a minute, do they know about some other kind of cream

945
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,920
that we don't have here?

946
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,080
Like, do they have a secret good new cream

947
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,160
that we don't have here at the Bucks?

948
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,320
And that's gonna drive them crazy all day long.

949
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,360
You'll have a little less coffee, but that'll be fine.

950
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,800
Oh, you guys, you don't know about dog cream yet?

951
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,240
Oh, boy.

952
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,520
Well, joke's on you, I guess.

953
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,320
You do boneless coffee and you don't use dog cream.

954
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,040
Boy, that's a real shame.

955
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,320
Anyway, bye.

956
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,920
I'm very smart.

957
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,800
You know what I like to do?

958
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,120
I like to order coffee,

959
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,600
but then ask for it in a bread bowl.

960
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,440
Mm.

961
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,760
That's nice, that's a breakfast right there.

962
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,540
It's fun, and it's also,

963
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,980
I don't like it when I am drinking my coffee,

964
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,740
and I don't feel an enormous amount of pressure

965
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,460
to drink the coffee extremely quickly

966
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,100
before it gets everywhere.

967
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,000
Well, and the nice thing is once you're done drinking it,

968
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,740
you can then, you have a little coffee-soaked snack.

969
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,580
Mm.

970
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,400
You get a nice little burst

971
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,740
of extra coffee there at the end.

972
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,020
And you know what, if you eat it fast enough,

973
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,660
you can get another cup in there,

974
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,740
and they just keep refilling it.

975
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,580
Yeah.

976
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,980
Can't they do coffee in a biscotti mug?

977
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,340
Is that something you can order?

978
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,340
So wait, the biscotti is shaped like a mug,

979
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,140
and you pour the coffee in it?

980
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, can I do that?

981
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,460
Holy shit.

982
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,460
I mean, you would more or less have to shotgun

983
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,300
that bean water, or else,

984
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,780
I mean, the burns would be significant.

985
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,620
You'd want a cold brew, for sure.

986
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:52,460
Mm-hmm.

987
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,120
Is it possible to go up to the counter and say,

988
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,820
before you grind these little bastards down,

989
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,460
do you mind if I sing to the beans a little bit?

990
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:09,140
Can I sing at your bean box to make the beans taste

991
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:09,980
even a little bit better when you roast?

992
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:10,820
Is your shop offering that?

993
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,780
You have to ask for it?

994
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,620
Where are you going?

995
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:15,980
It's so rare that they offer singing to the bean box.

996
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,940
And yeah, I mean, I guess this is,

997
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,660
you know, when you go to a Starbucks,

998
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,760
don't even think about it.

999
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,700
There's very little singing,

1000
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,260
because to them, it's a quantity game.

1001
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,100
Yeah.

1002
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,260
They can't take a minute there to sing a beautiful hymn.

1003
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,700
They might have a radio on next to it.

1004
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,740
It is not the same.

1005
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,220
No, they think that it accomplishes the same thing,

1006
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,060
but it doesn't.

1007
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,540
One thing that I like to do is say,

1008
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,540
before you grind the coffee,

1009
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,020
I bring some of my own personal blend with me

1010
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:45,920
everywhere I go.

1011
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,260
Can you grind that into it?

1012
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,620
And then you reach out into your pocket

1013
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:53,220
and you pull out a bunch of movie ticket stubs

1014
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,780
and paper clips, and then you hand that to them.

1015
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,480
And sort of let them figure it out.

1016
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,660
What I like to do is I like to go to the counter

1017
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,980
and say, hey, I would like the beans

1018
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,460
that will be in my coffee,

1019
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,100
and then I take those home,

1020
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,780
and I just sit on them for like 24, 26 hours.

1021
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:13,780
Then I come back, they grind those up.

1022
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,220
Yeah.

1023
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,460
And then I let someone else drink it.

1024
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,680
I like to pick each bean out of the bean box

1025
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,380
like I'm grabbing a lobster

1026
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,660
at like a nice seafood restaurant.

1027
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:26,720
I say, I want this bean, and this bean,

1028
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,020
and I want this bean, and I say this bean looks beautiful.

1029
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:29,980
No, not that bean.

1030
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,380
Oh, here we go. Next to it.

1031
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,360
And then I turn to them, I say,

1032
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,580
how many beans does it take to do one coffee?

1033
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,340
And they say like a hundred.

1034
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,980
And I say like, this is going to take too long,

1035
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,780
and it's gonna not be a very funny joke for the podcast.

1036
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,740
And then I stop.

1037
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:47,560
Those are some other things you can do at a coffee store.

1038
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,820
I love these weird beans.

1039
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,340
I love my weird beans.

1040
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,480
We never talk about that part of it,

1041
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,500
but you eat beans out of the can on a campfire

1042
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,180
for a good Western snack.

1043
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:03,500
And that's the same as what you do every morning

1044
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,780
when you get these fast beans is what I call them

1045
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,820
because they make me move just a little bit faster.

1046
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,840
And you pour hot water through them

1047
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,340
and you crunch them all up.

1048
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,500
It's basically what you're doing is,

1049
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,620
it's just bean water, folks.

1050
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:19,460
Whoa, slow down.

1051
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,980
We never think about that it's beans.

1052
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,500
It's beans.

1053
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,860
But it's the same kinds of beans that you would put

1054
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:29,140
in a chili or a bad gumbo.

1055
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:32,820
How do I confront my landlord about frequent pop-ins?

1056
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,180
My landlord thinks it's okay to show up whatever he wants

1057
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,700
because he thinks my roommates and I

1058
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,280
are all friends with him.

1059
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,660
In the past, he has shown up to use our kitchen table

1060
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:41,820
as a desk to work on.

1061
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,340
Whoa.

1062
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:47,180
Laying flooring until 11 p.m. on a Monday,

1063
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:49,980
set up a Christmas tree without request or permission.

1064
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,220
What the fuck?

1065
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,380
Borrowed our kitchen for cooking, take a shower,

1066
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:57,460
sleep on our couch, and worst of all offenses,

1067
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:02,460
host game nights at our house and then invite us,

1068
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:06,140
the people who actually live in the home he is renting out

1069
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,860
to join his party merely hours before being thrown.

1070
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,060
What?

1071
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,740
I am extremely non-confrontational

1072
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,460
and I'm about to explode at this point.

1073
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,340
Please, Jesus, help me, brothers.

1074
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:20,500
That's from Landlord in La La Land.

1075
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,380
It's good that you've asked for our help

1076
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,960
and also Jesus's help because this is gonna take

1077
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,800
all four of us on deck.

1078
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,060
I will say, okay, first question.

1079
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,660
When your landlord leaves, do they walk out

1080
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,180
and hop into the back of a white surveillance van?

1081
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,420
Because I guarantee this is an elaborate

1082
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,860
Big Brother-style TV show where they can't believe

1083
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,900
you haven't left yet.

1084
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,860
You were only supposed to be the first episode

1085
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,060
and now this has gone on for months.

1086
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,920
John Quinones has had you on the hook here

1087
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,660
for quite some time.

1088
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,540
This is his longest grift ever.

1089
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,660
This is wild, it's unacceptable.

1090
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,900
These are not pop-ins in the traditional landlord sense

1091
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,300
where they're stopping in to make sure everything's doing

1092
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,560
okay, interrupting your thing.

1093
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,260
They're throwing parties at your house.

1094
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,880
It is breaking and entering at this point.

1095
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,580
Here's how I think this shook out.

1096
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,020
The landlord thought, man, I could use

1097
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,700
a little extra income.

1098
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,460
I'm gonna rent out my house.

1099
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:21,340
And then you came over and you signed the lease

1100
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:24,140
and he gave you the keys and the door shut

1101
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,280
and then he was like, ah, shit.

1102
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,740
That's my only house.

1103
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,020
Yeah.

1104
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,380
So he is, I think, still living there, basically,

1105
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,340
is what I think has happened.

1106
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,120
Is he has mistakenly not, he has made his own property

1107
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,700
the rental property.

1108
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,860
This is the first time that I think we've gotten

1109
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,100
a question where I've been excited to see

1110
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,180
how this plays out on the next episode of Judge Judy.

1111
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,900
So there's a part of me that's kind of like,

1112
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,260
hmm, I've never seen this before.

1113
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,500
But it's such a weird, I know you're non-confrontational,

1114
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,460
but I think this is one of those rare cases

1115
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:01,140
that requires one of those confrontations

1116
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,220
I've heard so much about.

1117
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:05,620
Well, this is the thing is I get being non-confrontational

1118
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,360
where someone's like, I wanna fight you.

1119
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,660
And you're like, I don't wanna fight.

1120
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:11,420
But this person is actively punching you in the face.

1121
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,660
You may need to fight them, it sounds like.

1122
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,500
Yeah, it sounds like a fight may be in order.

1123
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,380
Or move.

1124
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,220
I mean, but you signed the,

1125
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,180
is there anything in the contract that says like,

1126
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,620
and by the way, whenever I wanna play Carcassonne

1127
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:28,340
with my buddies, you're invited,

1128
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:32,420
but it's gonna be in your kitchen, so deal with that.

1129
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,300
Because if so, you should have read that contract

1130
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,520
maybe a little bit closer.

1131
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,580
Otherwise, it's not acceptable.

1132
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:42,140
This is bad, even if I had a friend,

1133
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,520
even if my best friend was doing this,

1134
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,060
it would be a problem.

1135
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,560
All right, we've talked about how bad it is.

1136
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,320
What can we and Jesus Christ, Lord and Savior,

1137
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,220
Lamb of lambs, King of kings, do to.

1138
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,840
Son of David. Son of David.

1139
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,760
Do to make this better. The quiet storm.

1140
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,840
The quiet raging storm.

1141
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,080
The King of the North.

1142
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,520
What can all four of us do

1143
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,540
to make this a better situation for them?

1144
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,340
Change the logs.

1145
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,340
That's illegal.

1146
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,780
Is it? Yeah, probably not.

1147
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,540
What if you did it, but then pretend like you didn't?

1148
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:21,340
Can you invite like 200 people over to your house

1149
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:25,620
so that like a Tokyo train during rush hour,

1150
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,680
it's like, sorry, we're all full up.

1151
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,880
Can't get nobody else in here.

1152
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,140
If you invite enough people over to your house,

1153
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,840
you probably won't notice that he's there,

1154
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,720
which is a very good passive way of handling this.

1155
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,560
Because it's already so full.

1156
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,400
One more person is not gonna hurt.

1157
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,160
Is it possible to hire a drill bit tailor?

1158
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,000
Okay.

1159
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,620
And that movie's so important to me for so many reasons,

1160
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:51,400
but there's so many situations that could be required

1161
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,800
by getting a real fucking hard ass like Owen Wilson.

1162
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,720
Well, what's great, Griffin,

1163
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,360
is what we're dealing with here

1164
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,040
is a you, me, and Dupree scenario

1165
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,840
that can be fixed with a drill bit tailor scenario.

1166
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,420
With another Owen Wilson.

1167
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,400
Yeah, and if that doesn't work,

1168
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,720
then you get a- Yeah, Marma Gook?

1169
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,760
With a dog, what's the dog movie?

1170
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,580
No, the other one.

1171
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:13,080
The other are Marley and you. Marley and me.

1172
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,360
But Marley's a big, vicious dog

1173
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,920
who's not gonna let this gentleman

1174
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,720
to sort of stride right now. You, me, and Marley.

1175
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,440
You, me, and Marley, the battle beast.

1176
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,660
The death hound. The robot dog.

1177
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,240
It's okay, because you gotta,

1178
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,660
if you won't confront them, and I understand that,

1179
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,760
I'll do it.

1180
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,800
And I'm not, I'm pretty non-confrontational,

1181
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,440
but it sounds like you're in need of somebody

1182
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,000
to step in and say like, hey, dude,

1183
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,920
you can't just come over whenever you want.

1184
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,640
That's wild.

1185
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,280
You cannot throw parties at this house where we live.

1186
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,120
No, no, no.

1187
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,040
You need to throw your hat into the crowd.

1188
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,440
You need a new third roommate to come in and beat it back.

1189
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,420
Get Mark Lowry.

1190
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,000
Mark Lowry won't fuck around in this situation.

1191
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,760
Yeah, get Mark Lowry.

1192
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,600
It sucks, because there's really no other way around it,

1193
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,080
other than telling your landlord,

1194
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,840
like, you can't just throw,

1195
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,880
if you're really uncomfortable

1196
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,480
about being non-confrontational,

1197
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,000
wait for the last thing to happen

1198
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,320
about throwing a game night at your house

1199
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,440
without telling you, because that's unacceptable

1200
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,880
by literally anybody's standards,

1201
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,880
and your landlord also knows that it sucks

1202
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,480
and is not a cool thing to do.

1203
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,980
And if you come to them and say like,

1204
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,340
you can't just throw parties at our fucking house dog,

1205
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:27,760
then I, like, unless they are completely,

1206
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,600
like, removed from the situation,

1207
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,320
I think they'll understand, sort of,

1208
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,160
I think they'll grok what you're putting down here.

1209
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,720
And I think the word that you need to invoke is boundaries.

1210
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,720
We gotta have boundaries.

1211
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,800
We gotta set some boundaries here, right?

1212
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,160
Because I think that is a term that applies

1213
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,360
to every relationship that exists.

1214
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,100
So it's not about, like, I think you're a bad person,

1215
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,960
or, hey, we're not friends.

1216
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,220
It's, we need to set some boundaries.

1217
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,240
Yeah. Like, it's one thing

1218
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,080
if you wanna come over and hang out from time to time,

1219
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,740
but you can't be here when we're not here.

1220
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:02,000
Yeah, and again, like, if you're uncomfortable with it,

1221
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,280
hire Owen Wilson to set up these boundaries for you,

1222
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,360
and he'll just be like, sure.

1223
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,840
Oh, wow, you can't throw a party over here.

1224
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,200
Wow.

1225
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,280
So that's Owen, that's Owen Wilson.

1226
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,320
Yeah, I've been working on it,

1227
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,560
me and Brian, my voice teacher.

1228
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,860
We've been working on Owen lately.

1229
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,400
I'm gonna do some ADR work.

1230
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,700
I'm moving to Hollywood

1231
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,100
to become sort of his verbal stunt man.

1232
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,560
There's a lot of times they want Owen Wilson

1233
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,080
to say words, like potty words, that he doesn't wanna say.

1234
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,440
He hates saying these potty words.

1235
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,520
But I'll say them, I don't care.

1236
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,260
Things like bastard and piss.

1237
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:35,200
But I've learned to say them in his voice

1238
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,240
so that when he's on the set,

1239
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,680
and he's like, wow, I'm really off.

1240
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,480
And then I'll get in there, and I'll be like, piss,

1241
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,440
and just say the potty words for him

1242
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,880
is a new thing that I'm doing.

1243
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,680
So if you want, I can do that.

1244
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,520
Do you do parties too, Griffin?

1245
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,800
Like you just show up, and you do Owen Wilson.

1246
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,040
Yeah, I show up to kids' parties,

1247
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,760
and I say the words piss and bastard and ass and shit.

1248
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,000
Just like Owen Wilson would say them.

1249
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
But I say them in Owen Wilson's voice,

1250
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,680
and I don't dress up or anything.

1251
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,960
I just look like me, but I roll up,

1252
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,940
and then the 10-year-olds are like, do piss again.

1253
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,280
And I'll be like, piss.

1254
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,380
It's so good.

1255
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,240
I've never heard Owen Wilson say that word,

1256
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,120
so I don't know how accurate it is, but it's-

1257
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,960
Hey, that's not like Santa Travis with the toilet word,

1258
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,800
and he hates these words.

1259
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,960
But it sounds like I would imagine

1260
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,900
he would sound saying it.

1261
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,240
Yeah, thank you, thank you.

1262
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,320
You're welcome.

1263
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,120
I've spent $30,000 on these lessons,

1264
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,320
so it sounds really good. It's paid off, it's worth it.

1265
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,900
You're gonna make that back just on the circuit.

1266
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,320
I wanted to say, I wanted to end this episode

1267
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,380
with something that I want to talk about real quick,

1268
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,980
because I was looking at other Owen Wilson movies,

1269
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,920
trying to see if there might be some funny,

1270
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,840
funny bat catalog stuff that I could pull out.

1271
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,040
I'd forgotten he was an Armageddon.

1272
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,200
I was like, wait, Owen Wilson's an Armageddon?

1273
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,960
Yeah, he gets got, I think, pretty quick.

1274
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:54,960
So I clicked through, just I guess a closing meditation.

1275
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,360
The character names in the movie Armageddon

1276
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,120
are fucking buck wild.

1277
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,900
Oh, give me some of them.

1278
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:07,800
Okay, so Bruce Willis plays Harry S. Stamper.

1279
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,920
Okay, by itself, that may not be very buck wild.

1280
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,680
Billy Bob Thornton, Dan Truman.

1281
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,640
Okay, still all right.

1282
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,120
Ben Affleck plays A.J. Frost.

1283
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,000
Ooh, all right.

1284
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,100
Will Patton plays Charles Chick Chappell.

1285
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,640
Steve Buscemi's name is Rock Hound.

1286
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,480
Okay.

1287
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,800
He's the Transformer.

1288
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,760
Michael Clark Duncan recipes his,

1289
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,560
he is J. Otis Bear Curlene.

1290
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,720
Bear is his nickname.

1291
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,400
J. Otis Curlene, nickname Bear.

1292
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,360
And Owen Wilson, his character's name is Oscar Choice.

1293
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,920
It actually isn't.

1294
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,760
It actually, that doesn't, that's not a name.

1295
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,180
That was his long con to try to win an Oscar.

1296
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,760
Yeah, but they chose to, they were like,

1297
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,080
thank you for the choice, Owen.

1298
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,040
We're gonna pass on this one, I think.

1299
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,560
Our answer is no to the choice.

1300
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,840
Folks, that's gonna do it for us.

1301
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,280
Thank you so much for listening.

1302
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,600
We very much appreciate you.

1303
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,440
I wanted to give one quick plug.

1304
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,560
You know you can watch our TV show on VRV.

1305
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,160
That's VRV.co.

1306
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,980
My brother, my brother and me, the show is there.

1307
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,480
You can watch all six episodes plus all the extra stuff.

1308
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,540
While you're there, you can check out a new show

1309
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,120
that I was on.

1310
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,680
It's called Slug Riot.

1311
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,800
It's an animated series.

1312
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,520
I play a character named Very Deadward.

1313
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:33,200
He's the bassist of this moldcore band called Slug Riot.

1314
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,600
And it's a, there's only one episode up so far.

1315
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,560
But it was really fun to do.

1316
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:42,040
And the, oh, it looks like the two and three are up too.

1317
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,240
So you can go watch those too.

1318
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,560
VRV.co, I believe they're free.

1319
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,740
Or at least the first one is to watch.

1320
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,560
But Slug Riot is the name of the show.

1321
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,720
And it was really fun to make.

1322
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,440
And the episode is just like three minutes long.

1323
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,360
So go check that out, cause it was really fun.

1324
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,160
I wanna do just a couple quick plugs.

1325
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,280
One, this, I think it's Thursday, the 25th,

1326
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,840
I'm gonna be at the John Hondren and Jean Grey show,

1327
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:09,200
the John and Jean show at the Bell House that night.

1328
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,040
You can get tickets to that at bit.ly forward slash

1329
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,480
Travis, J and J, and that's in Brooklyn, New York.

1330
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,160
And before the show, I will be hanging out

1331
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,000
at the Hinterlands.

1332
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,200
So if you wanna come say hi there, grab a drink,

1333
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,920
help support Stuart Wellington and co,

1334
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,680
come do that and then come over to the show.

1335
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,360
I also wanna say, speaking of John and Jean,

1336
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:35,480
so Hal Loveland and I have a charity fundraising podcast

1337
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,560
called Surprisingly Nice.

1338
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,200
And it's been a while since we put an episode out,

1339
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,400
but we just recorded a new one with John Hondren

1340
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,400
and then special guest Jean Grey shows up.

1341
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,120
And we've changed our funding model,

1342
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,240
but basically how it is, is we're raising money.

1343
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,960
We set a goal for $500 for this first episode.

1344
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,280
And when we hit that, we will publish the episode.

1345
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,120
And that money goes to World Central Kitchen,

1346
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:59,480
which is a food charity that makes meals.

1347
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,320
Specifically right now,

1348
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,760
they're working to provide meals for Puerto Rico.

1349
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,880
And Hondren has said that on top of that,

1350
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,040
every dollar raised for World Central Kitchen,

1351
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,600
he will match that and donate to Planned Parenthood

1352
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,640
because that was the second choice for a charity.

1353
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:17,400
So every dollar you donate is going to actually benefit

1354
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,760
two different charities.

1355
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:25,360
You can donate at paypal.me.surprisinglynice.

1356
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,600
So far, we've already raised about $250

1357
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,120
in just like three days.

1358
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,160
So I think we're gonna-

1359
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,000
That's awesome.

1360
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,120
Yeah, I think we're gonna hit that $500

1361
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,040
and you can help with that.

1362
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,960
Isn't the JoCo Cruise also coming up soon?

1363
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,200
Yeah, JoCo Cruise.

1364
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,600
I'm not gonna be mentioning it much longer

1365
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,880
because it's in like three weeks,

1366
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,120
but I'm getting really, really amped for it.

1367
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,120
It's gonna be a super fun time

1368
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,680
and I'm really looking forward to it.

1369
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:51,480
And you can find out about that at JoCoCruise.com.

1370
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,480
And one more kind of a coming soon,

1371
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,680
I'm putting together a show here in Cincinnati

1372
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:00,040
that I'm calling the Cincinnati Underground Society Show.

1373
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,360
And it is a secret show in that I'm not going to announce

1374
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,320
who the guests are ahead of time,

1375
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,560
but for this first show,

1376
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,520
I've already got five people coming

1377
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,600
and it's going to be a really good time.

1378
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,240
So tickets are going to be coming soon for that.

1379
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,560
And I have made a website for that

1380
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,640
that I'm going to look up right now.

1381
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,680
Can I ask if you call it

1382
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,440
the Cincinnati Underground Secret Society,

1383
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,520
which is a little bit redundant,

1384
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,080
just so the acronym can be CUS?

1385
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:25,920
Yes, absolutely.

1386
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,240
It's the Cincinnati Underground Society

1387
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,880
and this is the Cincinnati Underground Society Show.

1388
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,040
And yes, the website I am currently working on

1389
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,840
is cus.live.

1390
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,760
And so that is where I'll be putting up.

1391
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,480
It's right now, there is literally nothing to the website,

1392
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,120
but it is on Squarespace.

1393
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,240
But that is where I will post ticket links and stuff.

1394
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,160
And hopefully I will have that up soon.

1395
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,320
And then our first show is going to be March 30th

1396
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,440
here in Cincinnati.

1397
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,680
And then my hope is to make it a monthly show

1398
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,120
with different guests every time

1399
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,120
and like secret society pins and that kind of thing.

1400
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,800
It's going to be a real fun time,

1401
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,360
but more information about that will be coming soon.

1402
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,240
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1403
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,120
for the use of our theme song

1404
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,960
and to departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1405
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,360
It's a fantastic album that you should get

1406
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,640
if you don't already have it.

1407
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,360

Thank you, Leslie.

1419
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,040
It's Yahoo Answers user FawziB asks,

1420
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:42,080
can Jello steal my energy if I am an Aquarius?

1421
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,040
My name is Justin McElroy.

1422
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,200

1424
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,840
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1425
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,000
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

1426
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,960
Hey girls, do you wanna just say, hey I wanna?

1427
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,000
Maximumfun.org.

1428
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,320
Comedy and culture, artist owned, listener supported.

1429
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,200
Hi there, I'm film critic April Wolf

1430
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,720
and host of the Maximum Fun podcast Switchblade Sisters.

1431
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,360
Do you love genre films?

1432
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,160
Do you love female filmmakers?

1433
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,800
Do you love discussions on craft?

1434
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,760
If your answer is yes, you'll love Switchblade Sisters.

1435
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:31,440
Every episode I invite one female filmmaker on

1436
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,080
and we talk in depth about their fave genre film

1437
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,840
and how it influenced their own work.

1438
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,240
So we're talking horror, action, sci-fi, fantasy,

1439
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,080
bizarro and exploitation cinema.

1440
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,880
Mothers, lock up your sons

1441
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,440
cause the Switchblade Sisters are coming for you.
