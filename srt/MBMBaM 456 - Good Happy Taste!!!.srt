1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:45,920
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,760
me and the advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,800
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis the McElroy.

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,640
But I don't want to record a podcast. But I don't want to record a podcast today.

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, I see.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,760
It's my birthday. I don't want to record a podcast today.

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,560
It's Griffin's birthday, except you're getting all the presents.

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,320
I want cakes and creams.

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,880
Oh no, not this again.

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,640
I want cakes and creams. I want candies and streamers and sticky, sticky toffee, not a podcast.

15
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,280
Every year, and I'm sure you all have noticed it because we've been doing My Brother,

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,720
My Brother, Me for about 18 years now. Every year on his birthday,

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,880
Griffin becomes little lord birthday and it's a whole thing. He's done it literally since he was

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,480
born. He came out of the womb doing it, which was very troubling for everyone.

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,600
And it's all about how it's his birthday and he wants candies and cakes and creams.

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,920
Where are my Shetland ponies, daddy?

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,360
And he needs the Shetland ponies.

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,640
And call him daddy.

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,240
I can't play with the Shetland ponies if I'm doing a podcast, daddy.

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,560
And he never wants to do a podcast.

25
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,760
I remember, I think he was six years old when he first started saying,

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,320
I don't want to do the podcast, which was confusing.

27
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,080
He was the first, historically speaking, is the first use of the term.

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,400
Yes.

29
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,320
Podcast was amended by Griffin when he was six and not wanting to do one.

30
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,800
Did the two of you even bring cakes and creams?

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,920
I sent you a birthday present. Did you get it?

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,280
I've not received a present from you, but the fact that you've said it's not cakes or creams.

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,840
It might be.

34
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,160
I sent a bottle of sparkling apple juice to your house. Did you get it?

35
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,840
Fuck, that's funny.

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,920
It's funny.

37
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,880
You guys like SNL? That's what I call SNL.

38
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,240
Yeah, that shit's good.

39
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,520
Oh, you snapped Griffin out of it with your super funny joke. Good job, Justin.

40
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,680
It was less a joke, more of a reference to an obscure SNL bit.

41
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,880
Yeah. I'm back. Yeah, I'm ready to do this one.

42
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,800
I mean, it wasn't a joke. I would rather not be.

43
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,640
I'd rather not be doing it. I'd rather be, you know.

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,440
What have you got? Let's talk about the gifts. Gifts so far. What have you got?

45
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,200
I got a bottle of water with a screw top lid from our business manager, Amanda,

46
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,520
because during the last tour she watched me twice open up the lid that has a little hidden straw

47
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,160
in it of my Contigo after being on an airplane with it, and it blasted me fully in the face like

48
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,600
a clown's flower. Stranger saw me do this and so did Amanda, so she got me one that's a little more

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,960
foolproof than that. What else? Daddy got me a Spider-Man statue, and then I just noticed that

50
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,320
Justin, you and Sydney have gone in together on a, I believe, a classroom.

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,840
Yes.

52
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,760
You got me a classroom, and I don't know where. It says a gift of a new classroom,

53
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,880
and I don't know what I'm supposed to teach in OIC.

54
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,560
You actually don't. This is the great thing. It's a classroom in the Sudan somewhere teaching

55
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,960
impoverished children stuff, and you don't have to do anything. You just can bask in the reflected

56
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,040
glow of knowing that there's good in the world happening in your name.

57
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,960
That is nice, but Gervin, can I tell you what I got you? It should have been delivered,

58
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,560
I believe, like the 14th or 15th. Did I send it to the wrong house again? I might have. I was

59
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,360
about to ask you your address, and then I remembered we were recording a podcast for

60
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,440
Public Assumption. Do you want to know what it is? Sure. It's a bidet. Oh, Trev.

61
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,840
Yeah. Shouldn't have.

62
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,040
So it's like Justin got you that really nice classroom thing that helps other people,

63
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,800
and I got something nice for your butt.

64
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,440
That's great because the world has problems, and I love gifts like Justin's because it helps

65
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:37,040
cater to those problems, but I'm also having a problem, and it's just my blighted bung has just

66
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,440
been a real issue for me lately, and I'm really happy for the immediate sort of salve that my

67
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,400
favorite brother Travis has provided for me.

68
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,560
Excellent. But Justin, yours is very nice. I like how it helps people or whatever.

69
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,400
Justin, let me say this. If you want to one-up him, because now we've got to fight our hands,

70
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,520
and this is always how I got the best presents growing up. If you want to one-up him,

71
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,760
may I suggest Cakes and Creams? Cakes and Creams. I should have thought of that.

72
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,400
No, you can do both. It's an add-on. It's a DLC for the Sudanese classroom.

73
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,320
Yeah, that way everybody wins with that one. With that one, everybody wins.

74
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,080
I get something, they get something.

75
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,160
So anyway, folks, thanks so much for listening to our podcast. We're excited to get going.

76
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,760
Happy birthday to you, Griffin. So excited.

77
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,080
32 is the backwards Michael Jordan number.

78
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,240
Boop, boop, boop, boop. Huge. Huge. That's a massive milestone.

79
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,360
Okay, here's a question. I'll be attending a Billy Joel concert,

80
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,920
which is also his 70th birthday celebration.

81
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,360
What if he tries to stop the concerts? Will they bring him Cakes and Creams?

82
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,520
That sounds like something he would actually do.

83
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,520
Should I bring a gift? No. How do I get it to him? You can't.

84
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,360
What do I buy? What do you buy for the piano man who has everything?

85
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,280
And that's from Unsure on the Upper West Side.

86
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,440
It's Billy's birthday and that you get the present this year

87
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,760
because Billy is bringing to you all of his great hits of the 50s and 60s and today.

88
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,520
What's the spirit of the 50s and 60s? It's still rocking on him.

89
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,640
The spirit of 50s and 60s through the lens of 80s just probably really coked up in us.

90
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,320
Yeah. Let me ask you guys this. If you had the chance to get Billy Joel something, what would it be?

91
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,200
Tombstone.

92
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,760
It's irreverent. It's an irreverent humor that I like to do, my own twisted South Park humor.

93
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,120
It is irreverent.

94
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,680
I think I would get him the chance to switch places with me for one day.

95
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,040
Ah, Prince and Pop are that shit.

96
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,960
Yeah, take the pressure off him. Let me be the piano man for one day

97
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,840
and he can just be a man without all the pressure, without all the piano pressure.

98
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,960
Travis has just texted asking for my address just to update everybody.

99
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,760
That was just a private thing. I was trying to send you a birthday birthday.

100
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,440
Here's what you could do. Okay, let me hit you with this.

101
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:22,240
Sit him down in a comfortable chair in front of a piano and then you sit down at a different angle

102
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,840
and then you turn the piano towards yourself and you say, no, no, no, Billy, allow me.

103
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,760
And then you play a version of We Didn't Start the Fire that encompasses all of his

104
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:40,880
and then everything that happened in the 30 years since We Didn't Start the Fire.

105
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,920
Oh, gosh, and you think you would appreciate that?

106
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,240
I think it's like, I want you to know, Billy, that you didn't start the fire,

107
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,560
but I'm taking the fire. I'm picking up your torch and I'm going to carry it on for you

108
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,720
and I'll continue to update this song that you seem unwilling to.

109
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,800
Title it, I Will Finish the Fire.

110
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,200
I Will Complete the Fire for Willie Joel.

111
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,800
Now, did you just call him Willie Joel? His friends call him Willie Joel.

112
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,800
Willie Joel Pianoman.

113
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:20,080
I would bet a million doll hairs that this is not the first time we've talked about an updated

114
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,360
We Didn't Start the Fire.

115
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,560
I'm almost certain, yeah, almost certain.

116
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,120
It is the first time, though, that I'm thinking critically about the song

117
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:32,720
We Didn't Start the Fire and it's pretty shit, huh?

118
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,240
It's not, if you think about Billy Joel sitting down at the old desk and saying like,

119
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,840
shit sucks right now, shit's getting really wild and people need me, Willie Joe Pianoman,

120
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,800
to really crack out a dinger for them that's going to help them soothe their soul

121
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,160
and give them some artistic nourishment that addresses the issues of our time.

122
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,920
I am going to write this song that is all about, A, passing the buck.

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,720
We didn't do it.

124
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,240
And then also, in lieu of having a message to the song,

125
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,600
I'm just going to say I'm going to flip through some microfiche at my local library

126
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,520
and just write down the words of things that I see there.

127
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,880
He did kind of write it like an eighth grader doing like a report on something

128
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,480
he didn't really read but just kind of read the back cover like, you know, Berlin Wall, JFK.

129
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,000
Leonard Bernstein.

130
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,720
I think he was a dude, he was there.

131
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,520
Yeah, I am a little sad.

132
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,760
I'm happy for his 70th birthday.

133
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Huge congratulations, Billy.

134
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,040
It is a little sad though that we're in the last few weeks of him being 69.

135
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,440
And we haven't really used it enough, I would say.

136
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,520
I would say we have not taken advantage of the fact that he is 69.

137
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,000
We didn't even talk about it, it feels like.

138
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,720
We could have referenced it so much more.

139
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,520
It is the law that when you are 69, you have to do it that particular maneuver more often.

140
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,520
So I bet he really knows how to just wail on that harmonica if you know what I'm talking about.

141
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,040
Aw, Griffin.

142
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,920
Come on, Griffin.

143
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,200
It's still Billy Joel.

144
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
Sir Billy Joel, he deserves our respect.

145
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,480
Have you ever noticed how Piano Man starts with the harmonica solo?

146
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,080
Do y'all ever think about that?

147
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,160
I think about that every time that goddamn song starts.

148
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,080
How about a yahoo?

149
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,200
I wish Billy Joel was funnier.

150
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
Wait, as a person or as a topic?

151
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,440
As a topic.

152
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,760
I feel like Billy Joel is so buckwild in all his endeavors that he deflects.

153
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,800
You try to make fun of Billy Joel as we have valiantly attempted for the past five minutes,

154
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,000
and then Billy Joel's like,

155
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,880
oh, good joke, check this out, it's the video for River of Dreams.

156
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,960
I did this one on me.

157
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,520
So what do you have in the fucking tank?

158
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,640
You have nothing.

159
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,840
I am bulletproof.

160
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,200
So here's a yahoo that was sent in by Jack.

161
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,760
Thanks, Jack.

162
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,120
It's yahoo answers user Bobby.

163
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,840
Bobby asks, if I'm a 14 year old, that's a wild way to say it.

164
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,880
I guess it's yahoo answers, so it has to be in the form of a question.

165
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:26,560
Question, if I am a 14 year old and my family has a guinea pig, is he my brother or son?

166
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:34,480
If I'm a 14 year old and my family has a guinea pig, is he my brother or son?

167
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,080
Is it possible he's your Belvedere?

168
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,000
No, obviously, obviously no.

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,600
Update, I understand that technically he is neither since I am not a guinea pig.

170
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,760
I think we're talking about structurally in the caste system of the family.

171
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:59,920
You're drawing the family tree from which branch does, you know, little Bingbing Dangle.

172
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,080
Wait, who's Bingbing Dangle?

173
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,080
The guinea pig.

174
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
His name is Bingbing Dangle?

175
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,800
Yes.

176
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,160
What a great name.

177
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,960
Where's he at?

178
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,760
Where does he live?

179
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,880
Is he a son or a brother to the 14 year old?

180
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,600
He might be the 14 year old's dad.

181
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,120
All right.

182
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,400
I'm saying why do we assume that he's equal or less than?

183
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,640
It's your brother.

184
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,360
It's your brother.

185
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,320
This is your new brother.

186
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,520
I'm gonna stick with you answer to the guinea pig now.

187
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,120
But if I'm the one that picked him out of the pet land or whatever,

188
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,800
I don't know if they do guinea pigs at your local shelter,

189
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,680
but if they do, obviously that's the ideal scenario.

190
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Um, I'm pretty sure they sell these bad guys, these bad guys at Target.

191
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,440
But if you're the one that picked him out from the Target lineup

192
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,160
after shopping through Isaac Mizrahi's new collection,

193
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,000
I think you're the father of this pig.

194
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,400
Hello, I'm Isaac Mizrahi and these are my new gerbils.

195
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,480
I'm selling them exclusively at Target.

196
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,080
It's an Isaac Mizrahi branded line of guinea pigs.

197
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,960
These rats are huge and they are colorful and they're,

198
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,160
they're gonna awaken the goddess within you.

199
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,160
I'm so proud of my new guinea pigs, exclusively at Target.

200
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,960
You look like you could use a really soft rat.

201
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Here, try one of my chinchillas.

202
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,840
Try one of these socially acceptable rats.

203
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,160
Um, yeah, this is the first time somebody sees a frat rat, right?

204
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,720
Yeah.

205
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,120
They think, oh, it's a long one.

206
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,320
Big old rat, gonna put it on my shoulders.

207
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,280
I don't see why that was what we jumped to.

208
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,600
That seems wild to me that we would make a pet from the ferret.

209
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,880
A capybara, I would just go run and throw myself in the river

210
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,920
I would drift away until I found a new home

211
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,840
that this big, big rat didn't live in.

212
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,320
I think that if you bring a guinea pig home, he's a roommate.

213
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,400
I think that he has his space where he's in charge, right?

214
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,200
Like, if you go in there and you're eating his food,

215
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,880
he's going to be really mad at you.

216
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,000
And if he was eating your food, you'd be really mad at him.

217
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,120
And that's not something you would say about a son or a brother.

218
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,720
If Griffin and Justin looked in the refrigerator,

219
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,200
I wouldn't be like, they shouldn't be in the refrigerator.

220
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,120
But if the guinea pig was in the refrigerator,

221
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,880
I'd be like, hey, that's my stuff, Brian.

222
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,000
Actually, if I got in Charles' refrigerator,

223
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,760
he would probably tell me to get out of his refrigerator.

224
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,160
That's true.

225
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,600
I watched the Punky Brewster episode.

226
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,640
I know it's not safe to play in the refrigerator.

227
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,480
Well, I didn't have a safety concern in mind,

228
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,440
but of course, yes.

229
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,120
Well, yeah, that's fine.

230
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,560
I cannot tell you the number of times I've gone downstairs

231
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,360
from my office to get a nice cold can of LaCroix

232
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,960
from the refrigerator and open it up

233
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,200
and had to fish my dang oldest brother out of there.

234
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,120
Was there a time when you couldn't open a refrigerator

235
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,920
from the inside?

236
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,200
Yeah, yeah.

237
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,080
Yes, absolutely.

238
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,880
That's a problem?

239
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,960
It's not an ongoing problem.

240
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,880
It just seems unlikely.

241
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,160
Okay, let's talk about this.

242
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,240
There is an episode of Punky Brewster

243
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,280
where a child is imprisoned in a refrigerator.

244
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,920
And I think it isn't covered,

245
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,240
but this must be a very weak child.

246
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,320
I cannot fathom how you could get stuck in a refrigerator.

247
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,520
Right, do they lock?

248
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,720
Is that a thing where you were afraid of the meat getting out?

249
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,760
No, they had those metal latches that would shut

250
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,720
and would hold the door shut and they were only on the outside.

251
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,440
So they'd have to remove the doors off these old refrigerators

252
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,840
so dumb kids couldn't like crawl inside of them at the city dump.

253
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,600
And then the good thing about that is ready to go

254
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,240
hot and fresh coffin just like right there, I guess.

255
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,320
And that's not ideal, obviously.

256
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,840
But on the subject of if it is an ongoing concern,

257
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,440
that would be wild knowing what I just said out loud.

258
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,160
If Mr. Frigidaire like had people coming up to him,

259
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,040
like, dog, you got to do something.

260
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,200
The kids are climbing into, they're playing Fortnite

261
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,160
and then going to take what they call dumpster breaks

262
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,440
and they're climbing in the fridges

263
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,480
and they are just getting just wrecked out there.

264
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,240
And Mr. Frigidaire is not hearing that like,

265
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,780
yes.

266
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,600
Okay, so I've looked into this just to clarify,

267
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,120
because we all have a vivid memory of this very special episode.

268
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,040
The message of which was don't go in a refrigerator

269
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,480
because you could get locked in, okay?

270
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,440
This used to happen back when,

271
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,320
because it used to be that you could only open from the outside.

272
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,440
And then they made a law in 1956

273
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,280
that you had to use the magnetic thing instead of a latch, right?

274
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,640
So this punky Brewster episode released in the 80s

275
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,920
was about the dangers of playing in antique refrigerators.

276
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,600
That is like, hey, all the AIDS crisis was like in full bloom.

277
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,280
Yeah, we had lots of stuff.

278
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,520
Kids getting stuck in fridges.

279
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,680
They was always stuck.

280
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,600
Sorry, I'm just trying to think of how to update

281
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,560
we didn't start the fire.

282
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,200
Well, Trev, I don't think he does it in the chorus.

283
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,360
I don't think he swaps out the chorus.

284
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,240
It's like, let's really dig into the Berlin Wall.

285
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,560
If I'm being honest, I couldn't remember how the verses go.

286
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,840
It's just, it bothers me that it was a very special episode

287
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,120
that I'm pretty sure I watched,

288
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,600
but maybe I just know about because I exist in the world

289
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,760
and I hear people talk about things sometimes.

290
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,160
And that has stuck with me more than most lessons

291
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,680
I learned in schools is that don't play in refrigerators.

292
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,560
You get stuck in them, which is apparently a concern

293
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,920
that not even my dad had to worry about when he was five.

294
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,440
So why do I know it so well?

295
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,480
Okay, that's it.

296
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,320
You can look at, there's an article in Mental Floss

297
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,480
if you want to know more about this very special episode

298
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,520
that you're probably, I would imagine 98% of our audience

299
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,720
is completely in the dark on.

300
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,040
But hey, here we go.

301
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,120
We're getting on their case.

302
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120
We're talking about the dangers of a 30-year-old thing.

303
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,200
And here we are talking about a 30-year-old

304
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,880
episode of television for comedy's sake.

305
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,520
So moving on.

306
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,560
Oh my God, you're right.

307
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,280
I work in a hip-

308
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,720
This podcast is a refrigerator

309
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
that I've been trapped inside of for nine years.

310
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,000
I work in a quote, hip office park

311
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,280
and we share our parking lot with another hip company.

312
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,480
They have their own coffee shop.

313
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,480
In that parking lot, we also share a basketball hoop.

314
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,400
A few weeks ago, we got a company-wide message

315
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,360
that we needed to, quote,

316
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,080
be respectful regarding the basketball hoop.

317
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,280
Nothing further was said.

318
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,880
Two weeks later, we get a second message

319
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,360
saying that we were banned from using the hoop

320
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,480
due to an incident.

321
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,800
No one in my office is talking about it

322
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,560
and I'm too scared to ask for fear of discovering

323
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,560
some dark secret, what the incident was

324
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,840
and why we were banned.

325
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,200
The most I got from someone was,

326
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,360
ooh, someone was a bad boy.

327
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,960
How do I go about discovering the truth?

328
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,240
Is it worth the risk?

329
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,120
This is from Detective Hoops in Hotlanta.

330
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
First, ooh, someone was a bad boy

331
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,560
is not a piece of information

332
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,800
but probably just a guess or observation.

333
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,680
Like no one's ever like walked into a police office

334
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,440
and then like a detective will say,

335
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,400
what happened?

336
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,360
And the detective's like,

337
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,080
well, seems like somebody was a bad boy.

338
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,960
What? No.

339
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,800
You really cracked this one wide open, man.

340
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,800
Someone was taking it to the-

341
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,440
I mean, we are all agreed here.

342
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,560
Someone was refusing to fake the funk on a nasty dunk

343
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,000
and they were taking it to the hole.

344
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,200
Yes, they were doing some disrespectful dunks.

345
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,200
The other possibility is that they were doing nasty dunks

346
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,880
but when it came time for the funk to happen,

347
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,760
they were kind of phoning it in.

348
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,120
They were kind of thinking off.

349
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,200
And so it doesn't, you guys are assuming

350
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,160
that somebody went boom shakalaka, the glass explode.

351
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,760
I'm saying that maybe they were disrespecting the hoop

352
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,840
by which I mean, they were doing super bad at basketball

353
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,360
and embarrassing the sport itself, embarrassing the hoop.

354
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,880
Like they would go to dunk

355
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,640
but it was more just like they were barely

356
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,320
like getting to the rim, you know?

357
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,520
Like they're kind of rolling the ball

358
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,040
off their fingers to get it in.

359
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,240
And people were like, no, you can't do that.

360
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,960
You're disrespecting the God of hoops.

361
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,880
That was an impotent dunk, Jeremy.

362
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,960
The folks over here-

363
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,760
The folks over here-

364
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,640
Funkier dunks.

365
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,800
The folks over here at Slick Beans,

366
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,480
the folks over here at Cool Coffee,

367
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,640
they get nine feet high.

368
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,200
They're so rad.

369
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,600
Slick Beans is the name of the company

370
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,240
but then Cool Coffee is the shop they have.

371
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,200
Not related at all.

372
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,800
Slick Beans does not handle actually any beans of any kind.

373
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,160
It's just the name of the business.

374
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,240
You're embarrassing us in front of Slick Beans.

375
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,360
You're banned from the hoop.

376
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,000
Everyone is.

377
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,720
But I was trying my best.

378
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,960
Maybe someone is playing a very high-minded game of D,

379
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,480
of basketball day.

380
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,280
Oh, I see.

381
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,840
You're telling the other company that you're such a play

382
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,400
that they-

383
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,480
This is like high-level-

384
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
There's like the zone defense.

385
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,600
There's like sort of man-to-man sort of that defense.

386
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,760
And then there's like emailing the opposing team

387
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,000
to tell them that they're not welcome anywhere near the hoop.

388
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,960
There's small business on small business defense, yeah.

389
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,760
Uh-huh, yeah.

390
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,280
That's our hoop.

391
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,040
And we are formal-

392
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,560
It's just taunting.

393
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,360
We're just formally letting you all know that

394
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,240
due to some disrespectful dunks,

395
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,600
you are not allowed anywhere near our home,

396
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,040
which is the hoop.

397
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,160
You were dunking, but you didn't wash your hands first.

398
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,120
And we saw that.

399
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,640
So no, thank you.

400
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,440
I don't wanna dunk with no-

401
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,640
The ball was teetering on the rim

402
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,600
and you burped and blew on it to push the ball into it.

403
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,560
No, thank you.

404
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,320
I don't wanna dunk with no pee ball.

405
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,480
We saw Derek come out of the bathroom

406
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,120
without washing his hands and then go straight

407
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,520
to the parking lot and start dribbling.

408
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,800
No, thank you.

409
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,520
For all we know, he's already dribbled twice.

410
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,320
Yeah.

411
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,160
Maybe one company, like whoever,

412
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,440
the TJ Maxx staff challenged-

413
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,880
That's a pretty hit business, Justin.

414
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,000
That's a hit business.

415
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,720
The TJ Maxx staff challenged Cool Beans

416
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,280
to a basketball showdown.

417
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,360
And then they told them that that was their hoop

418
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,120
and then that the other team didn't have a hoop

419
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,400
because there was only one hoop.

420
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,680
So the only hoop available was the Cool Beans hoop.

421
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,800
So then the score just got absolutely astronomically

422
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,760
out of reach and there was no more basketball

423
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,400
out because of that.

424
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,360
And another possibility is that in an attempt

425
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,120
to get a leg up on the slick beans,

426
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,280
some select members of your staff,

427
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,960
your coworkers, your cohorts,

428
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,240
did go out and steal the basketball energy

429
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,640
from Muggsy Bulgs and Charles Barkley

430
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,320
and Michael Jordan, although he's playing baseball.

431
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,560
So like, does he even still have it?

432
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,760
And Sylvester Stallone, I mean Sylvester the cat.

433
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,520
And Sylvester Stallone.

434
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,120
He voiced Sylvester the cat.

435
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,000
He's just known, he's got big,

436
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
hey, listen, Sly, fucking Rocky,

437
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,360
he's got huge muscles.

438
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,880
That's gotta help you jump, yeah?

439
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,600
Well, is it?

440
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,920
Actually, I was gonna say he didn't do any jumping,

441
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,080
but he jumps up and down when he gets to the top

442
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,760
of the steps and it's pretty good.

443
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,080
It's got big muscles on his legs to push the earth away

444
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,520
to get up to the hoop, so.

445
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,960
Is it a problem that none of us have even theorized

446
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,720
about Flubber at this point?

447
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,360
Oh shit.

448
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,240
Should Flubber have been brought up before now?

449
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:32,080
Maybe the hip company is like a Flubber company.

450
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,440
It's a new Flubber company.

451
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,480
It's a new, the new Flubber company they call it.

452
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,360
I'm so sick of it being so,

453
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,480
this market is flooded with Flubber companies.

454
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,800
There's just like a new one every day.

455
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,440
They're doing it.

456
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,640
This is a new take.

457
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,080
It's like organic fair trade Flubber.

458
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,360
Farm to table Flubber.

459
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,040
Keto genic Flubber.

460
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,240
Basketball shoe Flubber.

461
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,680
To avoid FDA prying eyes,

462
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,160
they have to call their company something else

463
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,680
as a front and so they do Apple.

464
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,520
And that's how,

465
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,200
that's what they've actually been this whole time.

466
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,880
Yeah, so I've got a whole dossier

467
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,720
and I've sent it to Justin and Travis

468
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,200
many, many times before about how Apple does Flubber.

469
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,280
I'm gonna crack it open soon, bud.

470
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,840
I promise.

471
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,280
For your birthday, maybe that's our.

472
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,520
Is it possible that you work for the Harlem Globetrotters?

473
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,060
Huh.

474
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,040
I mean, they have to have a storefront somewhere.

475
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,760
You can't be a business without a storefront legally.

476
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,480
I do.

477
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,960
I'm going to step in here though and say

478
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:43,280
I cannot think of a conglomeration

479
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,600
that altogether throughout the history of time

480
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,560
has been more disrespectful to the basketball hoop

481
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,880
and the game itself and the people they play it.

482
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,440
They will climb up on ladders and they will dunk,

483
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,200
you know, confetti into the audience

484
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,680
while another person scores a three from the concession stand.

485
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,320
That is hugely disrespectful to this game.

486
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,120
It's cheating.

487
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,680
Yes.

488
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,720
It is cheating.

489
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,000
How come no one has called the Harlem Globetrotters

490
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,680
on their flagrant cheating?

491
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,120
They do a basketball jump over like five kids

492
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,600
and I just, I didn't see my friend Michael Jordan

493
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,840
doing that during his big game,

494
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,560
the sixth game of the series that he did so well in.

495
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,840
So I don't know.

496
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,560
One time I saw a Harlem Globetrotter

497
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,720
put the ball under his jersey

498
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,240
and then pretend he was pregnant and walk with it.

499
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,080
The junior.

500
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,680
And at no point did anyone say you're not dribbling.

501
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,680
You can't put the ball under your shirt.

502
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,880
They just let him do it.

503
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,040
But then he said, oh, aren't I?

504
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,440
And then his water broke and then they brought out a bed

505
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,280
and then over the next 12 hours,

506
00:25:53,280 --> 00:26:02,480
he pushed that basketball valiantly, slowly, bravely.

507
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,520
No epidural.

508
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,400
No epidural, just raw dogging it.

509
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,600
There was an epiduncle.

510
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,160
Which is of course a basketball doula.

511
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Yeah, and so it's just no juice, just raw dogging it.

512
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,360
And then when it did come out, it was a three pointer.

513
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,720
Extremely disrespectful display.

514
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,520
Extremely disrespectful, but also beautiful.

515
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,200
But also it was beautiful.

516
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,640
It was beautiful, beautiful.

517
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,960
Yeah, it was beautiful little slice of life

518
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,360
and it's the circle of life and that's great,

519
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,720
but you got placent on the basketball

520
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,920
and that's disrespectful because that one's cashed.

521
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,240
I don't mean to be, I'm not a brood.

522
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,480
I've seen the majesty of this process IRL firsthand

523
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,760
with my own special brood.

524
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,560
But if you get placent on a basketball, boy.

525
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Because the little bumps on there, forget about it.

526
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,760
That one's done.

527
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,840
You know the Harlem Globetrotters play against?

528
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,480
The Washington Generals.

529
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,960
Yeah, well now here I am thinking this.

530
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,520
Does Flover have a placenta component in it?

531
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,840
That's why you're supposed to save the placenta

532
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,440
because they need it for Flover.

533
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:24,800
So they will pay top dollar for some fresh placenta.

534
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,320
Hey, quick.

535
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,400
It's just placenta and cornstarch really.

536
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,880
You can DIY.

537
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,360
I watch a lot of YouTube videos.

538
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,480
DIY Flover.

539
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,440
Now you're gonna need some fresh placenta.

540
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,520
Nothing freeze-dried, no powdered.

541
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,880
I'm talking about fresh, just fresh out the Harlem Globetrotter.

542
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,680
Just right out.

543
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,520
You know, on any other show,

544
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,880
on any other episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me,

545
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,840
the news that the Washington Generals have their own website

546
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,640
touting what a great season they're gonna have

547
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,760
and their all-new roster would be worth discussing.

548
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,920
But I don't even know if it's...

549
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,320
Okay, it is worth mentioning this.

550
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,840
Oh man, this is gonna be a basketball-themed episode

551
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,880
of My Brother, My Brother, Me

552
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,360
because we are going to have to discuss this currently.

553
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,600
I want everyone to just join me over here at this webpage.

554
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,200
If you're at home and you want to see

555
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
what my brothers are about to laugh at,

556
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,240
go to washingtongenerals.com forward slash Cager.

557
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,520
That's C-A-G-E-R.

558
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,920
You're gonna meet Cager, the Globetrotter's biggest nightmare.

559
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,720
Oh my god.

560
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:49,680
Yeah, this image is a very tall man in a black hoodie

561
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,160
with arms open in almost sort of a biblical pose

562
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:00,160
and he's most notably wearing a sort of black basketball mask.

563
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,640
There's a quote here from Cager.

564
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,440
We're like edging into Munch Squad territory.

565
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,400
Quote, I don't like the way the Globetrotters

566
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,040
are always joking around and laughing on the court.

567
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,200
Basketball a serious business, says Cager with a scowl.

568
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,240
I am ready to release the beast

569
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,280
and show how basketball is supposed to be played.

570
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,920
I'm going to wreck some rims and wreck some dreams.

571
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,720
Hold on, Cager.

572
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,840
Hold on there, Cager.

573
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,880
Pump the brakes there, Cager,

574
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,080
because I'm all about you showing the Harlem Globetrotters

575
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,920
that the way that they treat the basketball

576
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,160
and the sport is somewhat disrespectful,

577
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,760
but you got to leave those rims for the next generation.

578
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,320
So I appreciate where you're coming from,

579
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,280
but you need to not become the thing

580
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,520
that you are trying to fight in this world.

581
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,720
Now it says here in this Cager article

582
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,120
that he can drill shots from the four point line

583
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,000
introduced by the Globetrotters in 2016.

584
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,520
So the Globetrotters are just like,

585
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,480
hey, from now on this line, you get four points.

586
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,160
It's disrespectful in ways that I couldn't even imagine.

587
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,960
Meanwhile, the Washington generals say,

588
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,880
okay, we have a seven foot guy.

589
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,720
We brought a giant in a black rask and he's fighting for us.

590
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,360
And there is a quote here from the coach of that team,

591
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,600
which is maybe the most thankless position in all of sport.

592
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,200
Quote, we might even sneak a six player on the court

593
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,720
when Cager is in the game.

594
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,640
The guy can just hide behind Cager

595
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,000
and the rest will never see him.

596
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,160
Now I don't fucking care who wins.

597
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,240
Let them destroy each other and I'll mop up whoever's left.

598
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,480
You can't sink to their level, Cager.

599
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,560
Cager closes with this.

600
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,680
He menses no words when asked about his objective.

601
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,560
My main purpose in life is to get the generals

602
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,280
that elusive win and wipe the smiles

603
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,760
off the faces of the Globetrotters.

604
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,640
Y'all, I looked it up just to find out

605
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,240
that Washington generals have beaten

606
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,560
the Harlem Globetrotters at least three times.

607
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,600
Oh my God.

608
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,920
In 1954, 1958, and 1971.

609
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,920
I mean, it has to be a revolt

610
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,000
from one of the Washington generals

611
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,600
who was summarily fired after that,

612
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,200
but this is a way to fucking go out.

613
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,440
Like, oh no, oh no, he's got a ladder.

614
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:24,720
Swish!

615
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,320
What are you fucking doing, Ronnie?

616
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,040
What are you fucking doing, Ronnie?

617
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,040
I don't want to be there though on the day

618
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,120
when Cager does get his elusive dream

619
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,680
of destroying the Harlem Globetrotters

620
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,720
because he wins that game.

621
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,920
They come back the next day.

622
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,520
Globetrotters are like, guess what?

623
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
We've all got Civil War sabers.

624
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,680
We all took a vote on basketball rules

625
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,600
and now we've all got swords.

626
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,640
We voted that it's legal on the court to kill Cager.

627
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,720
Yeah, if I can cut Cager's whole head off,

628
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,920
I get 20 points.

629
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,120
We're dangling Cager's beloved uncle

630
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,560
from a rope from the rafters of the stadium.

631
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:03,040
And if the Generals win, we'll drop and kill his uncle.

632
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,600
And that's a new basketball rule we came up with.

633
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,200
And the NBA sees the NBA.

634
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,720
Tickets are starting to slow down.

635
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,040
Tickets to the Harlem Globetrotters games

636
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,000
are just going through the roof,

637
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,400
so now the NBA's got to start dangling uncles.

638
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,000
Oh, gosh.

639
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,120
Should we go to the Money Zone?

640
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:28,800
Yeah, yeah, let's go.

641
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,360
Oh my God, we have a new sponsor.

642
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,680
I'm so extremely excited to talk about Postmates.

643
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,320
Okay, so who do you ask to bring you something

644
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,680
when you don't want to leave the house?

645
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,000
You could ask your friends, but how many of those can you call?

646
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,480
Griffin will drive up from Austin, no problem.

647
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,560
No more of that relying on brotherly affection.

648
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,320
Just use Postmates.

649
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,920
Oh, it's no problem.

650
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,920
I know it's no problem for you, Griffin,

651
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,520
but it is your birthday, so if you need a day off,

652
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,560
here's Postmates.

653
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,960
It's your personal food delivery, grocery delivery,

654
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,440
whatever you could think of, delivery service 24-7.

655
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,640
You don't have to go to the store.

656
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,040
You can just download the app for iOS and Android for free,

657
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,000
browse local restaurants, and track your delivery.

658
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,360
They're the largest on-demand network in the known universe

659
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,480
with more than 25,000 partner merchants.

660
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
For a limited time, Postmates is giving our listeners

661
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,120

662
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,320

664
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,200
I love Postmates.

665
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,920
You know what I love Postmates is when we're on tour

666
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,600
and I don't know the area very well,

667
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,920
so if you're traveling and you just need something

668
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,640
and you don't know how far away that something is

669
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,920
or where the place is or whatever, Postmates

670
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,000
is like a fantastic option for that.

671
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,040
Yeah, I apologize for laughing in the middle of that.

672
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,000
That was a time release, half hour long delay

673
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,120
from me realizing that my brother Travis

674
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,400
had essentially sent a bidet to a stranger here in Austin,

675
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,160
and I enjoy that very much.

676
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,560
Again, get the app right now and then use the code MYBROTHER

677
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,840
and get $100 of free delivery credit for your first seven days

678
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,120
when you download the Postmates app.

679
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,200
Get anything you need anytime you need it,

680
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,480
download Postmates and save with code MYBROTHER.

681
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,560
I would like to tell you about Bull and Branch.

682
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,600
Bull and Branch, sheets, towels, what do you need?

683
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,800
What do you need?

684
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,240
Go to Bull and Branch.

685
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,520
I just did a big old round of laundry

686
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,760
and I had, this is not a joke

687
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,440
because I notice things like this, gosh darn it.

688
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,680
I was folding some Bull and Branch towels

689
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,480
and I thought these still feel brand new

690
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,720
even though I've had them for like a year.

691
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,440
And that's just a testament to the quality

692
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,800
that Bull and Branch brings

693
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,000
because they use 100% pure organic cotton

694
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,600
and it's signature soft sheets that start out luxurious

695
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,160
and only get softer over time, which I can 100% vouch for.

696
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,560
And Bull and Branch products have thousands of five-star reviews.

697
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,160
It's incredible.

698
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,480
I'm a big fan, highly recommend.

699
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
People are at the heart of everything they do

700
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,400
from farmers who grow their organic cotton

701
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,320
to the people who sleep on their feet at night.

702
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,760
All right.

703
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
And they offer a no risk 30-day trial

704
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,440
and free shipping in the US.

705
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,720

711
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,560
The Greatest Generation is a Star Trek podcast

712
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,200
that de-stigmatizes the very idea of having a Star Trek podcast.

713
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,200
We're Ben and Adam, the hosts of The Greatest Generation

714
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,040
and the technology we've developed is that

715
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,000
nobody knows what you're playing in your earbuds.

716
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,720
You know, with legalization, it's easier than ever

717
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,160
to find out what's in your buds.

718
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,200
But we suggest that you legally find The Greatest Generation

719
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,360
wherever you download your podcasts.

720
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,240
We'll send it to you in a discreet, unmarked package

721
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,280
and nobody has to know but us.

722
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,040
That's The Greatest Generation,

723
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,320
the Star Trek podcast that you didn't know you needed

724
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,160
yet makes you feel like you belong.

725
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,120
So y'all want another yahoo?

726
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,360
I felt that one.

727
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,440
Yes, Griff and I would like another yahoo.

728
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,080
All right, this yahoo was sent in by Graham Robach.

729
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,720
Thank you, Graham.

730
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,320
Oh, and well, I love-

731
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,840
Stone asks, and this one's really fucking funny.

732
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,000
This one's really gonna bust guts and nuts

733
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,520
in the audience tonight.

734
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,200
This one's gonna bust a nut?

735
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,480
It's guts and nuts.

736
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,840
This one is so funny, it would lay low even the big man, Cager.

737
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:03,840
Oh, Korn's here.

738
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,120
I want a munch.

739
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,600
Welcome to Munch Squad, the podcast within a podcast

740
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:21,520
that I feel like is in its twilight years.

741
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,240
I feel like, and not to be sad, and there's still plenty

742
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,200
of Munch Squad on the horizon,

743
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,360
but I feel like we're probably rounding the bin

744
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,880
on people being so buck wild.

745
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,520
I'm not gonna say it has anything to do with Munch Squad,

746
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,160
but I'm not gonna say that I did not kill

747
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,600
this particular golden goose.

748
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,920
But we've still got a few left in us

749
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,680
and I just wanna bring it home strong.

750
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,000
I do wanna give everybody real quick

751
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,080
a quick Munch Squad Jr. with the update.

752
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,160
Welcome to the family.

753
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,600
Carl's Jr. testing a CBD burger in Denver on 420.

754
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,600
First ever quick service restaurants

755
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,840
to introduce CBD infused item.

756
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,320
It's named the Rocky Mountain High Cheeseburger Delight.

757
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,800
And that is the CBD there.

758
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,800
It features two charbroil patties

759
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,000
with the signature Santa Fe sauce infused with CBD.

760
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,720
Pickled jalapenos, pepper jack cheese,

761
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,040
and crisp cut fries right on there

762
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,720
to give the burger the extra crunch.

763
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,960
That's easily the weirdest part of the whole burger,

764
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,280
I would say.

765
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,720
That's the weirdest part of it.

766
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,520
Listen to this.

767
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,200
The new menu item will be available

768
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,480
at 4050 Colorado Boulevard, Denver on April 20th.

769
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,080
Yes, that's right, 420.

770
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,760
Beginning at 6 a.m.

771
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,640
Hey, hey, how's the morning going?

772
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,160
Pretty good.

773
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,880
I just ate a weed hamburger at 630 a.m.

774
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,800
So I feel like the day's off to a good start.

775
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,880
But that's not what I want to talk about today.

776
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,000
I want to, I got big news from DQ.

777
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,400
They've just unveiled a new tagline.

778
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,960
Oh no, that's the worst,

779
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,440
that's the worst thing they could have been unveiling.

780
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,640
Yeah, they're unveiling a new tagline.

781
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,200
Here it comes.

782
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:01,600
You ready?

783
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,840
Happy take good.

784
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,960
Oh my God, it's already really great.

785
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,720
Happy tastes good.

786
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,600
Huh, happy tastes good.

787
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,320
Good happy taste.

788
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,600
I guess daddy like was taken.

789
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,640
So now we got it.

790
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,600
Happy tastes good.

791
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,360
The cakes and creams taste happy and good.

792
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,760
Happy tastes good.

793
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,720
Good taste?

794
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,200
No, happy tastes good, end of slogan.

795
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,160
Happy tastes good.

796
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,840
With fresh deals, sweet new treats and crave worthy eats

797
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,440
that make any meal feel like an indulgence because it is.

798
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,840
I mean, folks, you're eating a Dairy Queen.

799
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,520
It is an indulgence of a sort.

800
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,600
It is reinforcing that it's a smile above the rest

801
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,800
and a destination for happy moments and memories

802
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,880
and diarrhea later presumably to celebrate happy tastes good.

803
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,600
It's great every time.

804
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,200
What a great sentence.

805
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,080
Someone was paid for, there's new Sunday toppings

806
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:13,280
like rich Choco Chunks, crunchy praline pieces and smooth.

807
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,360
I swear to God, it's called this smooth midnight fudge.

808
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,840
Oh my God.

809
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:25,360
A little bit of that midnight fudge, a midnight fudge.

810
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,600
So they got a deal.

811
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,080
And Maria Hockenson, who's this something there,

812
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,800
says, we love being at the center of our fans'

813
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,080
happiest memories.

814
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,160
The center of my happiest memory?

815
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,480
Why, it's a meal at Dairy Queen.

816
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,640
Whether it's toasting to a team win, celebrating a birthday

817
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,360
or simply treating yourself to make the every day

818
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,560
just a little more special.

819
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,760
Fuck, man.

820
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,040
I just thought of somebody that tried to make a boring day

821
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,360
more special by eating a Dairy Queen

822
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,920
and it's the most depressing thing I've ever heard

823
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,480
in my entire life, but happy tastes good.

824
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,760
It's about the joyful moments you experience

825
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
when you visit one of our restaurants

826
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,480
from the first bite to the last spoonful.

827
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,240
The last spoonful here is either the last spoonful

828
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,120
of your food or the last spoonful before you realize

829
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,880
that you only have the one human body

830
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,120
and what are you doing to it and you have to go.

831
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,880
Now here's the wildest part about this release.

832
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,360
To prove the DQ brand really is in the business of happy.

833
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,680
ADQ, that's American Dairy Queen Network, I guess,

834
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,440
commissioned a national consumer survey, which found that.

835
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,760
Okay, by the way, if you want to preserve numbers

836
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,240
as something that, and statistics as something

837
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,480
of a constant in your life that you rely on

838
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,800
to become more informed or that you find any use

839
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,160
or value in them, please stop listening now

840
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,240
because Dairy Queen is about to strip that away.

841
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,800
69% of the people surveyed believe that

842
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,720
having a Blizzard treat is a happier way

843
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,360
to start the summer than activities

844
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,320
such as taking a road trip, 43%,

845
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:09,440
wearing shorts, 40%, or cannonballing into a pool, 29%.

846
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,880
Oh my God.

847
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,920
What was the structure of the question asked?

848
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,600
What is the structure of that fucking question?

849
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,600
Because one, I added all your numbers and you're fucked.

850
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,400
It's all fucked straight to death.

851
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,760
Okay, that's all fucked.

852
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,280
69% of people believe that having a Blizzard treat

853
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,360
is a happier way to start the summer

854
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,200
than wearing shorts.

855
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,640
Did you just ask people like,

856
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,200
would you rather have some ice cream

857
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,840
or put on some shorts right now?

858
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,920
What would be a happier start to your summer?

859
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,160
Eating ice cream in slacks or wearing shorts?

860
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,000
I imagine they only asked 10 people.

861
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,560
What's a better way to start your summer?

862
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,800
Eating a cool, refreshing Blizzard treat

863
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,280
at Dairy Queen's, smiles taste good,

864
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,160
or wearing some fucking shorts?

865
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,760
Is that a good way to start your summer?

866
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,880
And four people went shorts, I guess,

867
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,680
and the other six people went rightly so.

868
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,680
What the fuck are you talking about?

869
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,880
Time to pull on my shorts.

870
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,240
Ah, it's June 23rd, let's go.

871
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,320
You can't put on shorts.

872
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,560
Okay, these people who said,

873
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,160
okay, of all those, I think the best start

874
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,840
is cannonballing into a pool.

875
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,320
Cool, are you doing that in slacks?

876
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,960
Are you wearing jeans and cannonballing into the pool?

877
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,240
No, you're not.

878
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,200
Maybe they literally held up a Blizzard

879
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,560
and said, do you wanna eat this?

880
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,000
And then they held up a pair of shorts

881
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,160
and said, or do you wanna put on my shorts?

882
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,720
And we were like, I guess I'll eat the Blizzard.

883
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,600
I thought so.

884
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,400
Do you wanna take off your clothes right now

885
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,280
in front of everyone here in Times Square

886
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,480
and put on these shorts?

887
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,440
Or would you rather have this refreshing Blizzard treat

888
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,400
and guess what?

889
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,760
I'm gonna one up that shit.

890
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,400
It's covered in smooth midnight fudge.

891
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,840
Can I do neither?

892
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,680
All right, how about you eat this or I push you into a pool?

893
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,120
Please don't do that.

894
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,200
Or I'm gonna put you in the trunk of this car

895
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,880
and drive you across the country.

896
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,480
Please don't do that.

897
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,540
I'm not done.

898
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,080
Okay, listen.

899
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,960
56% said dipping a DQ chicken strip into sauce

900
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,440
feels like a group hug for your taste buds.

901
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:23,940
Wow.

902
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,600
No, they didn't.

903
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,680
They checked a box next to that sentence

904
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,280
that Dairy Queen wrote.

905
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,760
Yeah, but that means that 44% of the people

906
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,240
just stared at the question asker in silence.

907
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,000
Like, what could that mean?

908
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,500
What?

909
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,160
What could that possibly mean?

910
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,760
Trump is president.

911
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,280
What are you talking about?

912
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,280
There's real things.

913
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,360
Real things going on in the world.

914
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,120
You're wasting my time.

915
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,960
What on earth are you talking about?

916
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,480
The last statistic they have here.

917
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,720
53% said a trip to a DQ location

918
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,960
is as happy as finding $20 in your pocket.

919
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,460
Wrong.

920
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,880
What on earth could that mean?

921
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,160
If you find the $20, you could go to Dairy Queen with it.

922
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:12,720
Yeah.

923
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,760
What on earth?

924
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,320
What on earth do you mean?

925
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,640
The cycle begins anew.

926
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,240
History repeats itself.

927
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:21,760
Apparently.

928
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,760
How about a Yahoo?

929
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,160
Yeah, please.

930
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,280
This one's sent in by Graham Robock.

931
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,760
Thank you, Graham.

932
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,920
It's from Yahoo Answers user Stone, who asks,

933
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,120
spiders in my house?

934
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,480
How get rid of?

935
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,000
Like Minecraft?

936
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,520
Spiders in my house?

937
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,560
How get rid of?

938
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,560
Like Minecraft?

939
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,480
You're gonna have to bring your house down.

940
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,440
Well, I mean, maybe that's what Yahoo Answers user Jehera

941
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,240
meant when they responded, put torches.

942
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,360
End of comment.

943
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:55,860
Okay.

944
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,360
I like efficiency and language.

945
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,880
You can figure out what they mean from that.

946
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,920
Just put torches.

947
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,480
Put torches.

948
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,760
Put torches around them.

949
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,800
No spider.

950
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,360
On them?

951
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:05,860
Near them?

952
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:11,940
Um, so I have a whole bunch of these little, uh, these little

953
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:16,420
creepo, creepozoids in my house, and they want to catch me up

954
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,540
in their net and suck me dry, so I do want to get rid of them

955
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,780
like, but I do want to do it like Minecraft.

956
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,820
I've been, I've been honing the...

957
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:29,220
I, okay, I don't think that this person, just, I mean, it's

958
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,980
all phrased very strangely.

959
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:34,260
I don't think this person is necessarily saying, I want to

960
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,700
get rid of spiders in my real home in the same fashion that

961
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:40,900
I dispose of these little bastards in the game Minecraft.

962
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,260
You don't think that's it, Justin?

963
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,180
Because that's exactly how your boy took it.

964
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:44,980
That's hit at me.

965
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,860
That's how it hit me too.

966
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:50,180
No, I think this person is saying, I think the like Minecraft

967
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:53,780
here is meant to indicate, ah, I should have clarified when

968
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,220
I began the question.

969
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:58,020
This is written regards to the video game Minecraft.

970
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,500
No, Justin, I'm sorry.

971
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,340
I'm going to put my foot down here and say that they're

972
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:05,220
saying, I would like to get rid of the spiders in my house

973
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,060
like I do in Minecraft.

974
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:07,380
Yeah.

975
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,460
So if you don't have anything fucking helpful to say, go

976
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,540
record a Sawbones or something, okay?

977
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,300
Because Travis and I are dialed in here.

978
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,700
You got two out of three brothers telling you that this

979
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,500
person wants to Minecraft these spiders.

980
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,860
And I'm here to tell you, you find out where the spiders are

981
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:25,220
and then you go to where that is and you punch the fuck out of

982
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,540
the cube that they live in until that part of your house

983
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,420
explodes.

984
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:28,740
Yes.

985
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:29,860
That's it.

986
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,140
But I mean, that's one of many ways to do it.

987
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,660
What else are you going to do?

988
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,540
I guess you could carry around, I don't know, like bricks or

989
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,740
like cinder blocks or something and like stack them on top of

990
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,300
the spider.

991
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,060
Does that work in Minecraft?

992
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,540
It does.

993
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,060
Yeah, that'll goosh them up real good.

994
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,540
And then you can take that and you can build a spider guts

995
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:53,220
wall out of it for your, for a void house for a weirdo who

996
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,860
wants to live in like an HR gig or sort of nightmare zone.

997
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,980
Well, here's some things to keep in mind.

998
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,500
Apparently the spider is a neutral mob.

999
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:08,420
That means that it will only attack you during the day in

1000
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:12,820
survival mode if you attack it first, but it will always attack

1001
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,820
you at night in survival mode.

1002
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:15,780
They get moon horny.

1003
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:21,220
Is this an option to just avoid them during the day and just

1004
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:25,300
sort of like stay closed up in your spider free room through

1005
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,100
the evening?

1006
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:26,900
Is that possible?

1007
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,700
You don't even have to be.

1008
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,260
Yeah, you can.

1009
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,020
You don't even have to avoid them during the day.

1010
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,900
It sounds like like you guys can like chill in the house and

1011
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,340
like go out and talk and they can give you sex advice like

1012
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,540
Joe's apartment.

1013
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:43,460
And then after that, but then you're like, yeah, we are

1014
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,900
fucking crushing it.

1015
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,700
So the spiders are like, yeah, you got to hit it from the back.

1016
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,540
And then you're like, oh shit, guys, it's, it's six 42.

1017
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,060
I better go board myself up.

1018
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,580
And they're like, yeah, man, get to it.

1019
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,460
You know how we get.

1020
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:02,820
Boy, I wish I hadn't conjured the specter of Joe's apartment.

1021
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,820
It's just there, isn't it?

1022
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,540
It's just there.

1023
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:06,580
It's just there.

1024
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,700
It's in my mouth.

1025
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:13,220
Jerry O'Connell hovers above your computer now, hoping you'll

1026
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:16,260
reference him two more times and bring the remake to life.

1027
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,060
So that's one option.

1028
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,460
I hate my book club.

1029
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:25,060
Oh, I thought it'd be cool, but it sucks.

1030
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,580
I've been in it for six months, though, and it's a really small

1031
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,900
club, so I feel bad about bouncing, especially because

1032
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,220
they talked about how grateful they are that I've joined.

1033
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,780
Any advice on the best way to leave without looking like a

1034
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,420
dick?

1035
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,980
What excuse can I give other than I don't like your company

1036
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:41,940
or opinions.

1037
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,220
We only meet every six to eight weeks, so I'm really busy.

1038
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,180
Seems unbelievable.

1039
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,540
That's from looking to leave in LA.

1040
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:53,300
This book club must be the absolute pits.

1041
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,300
If in six months, that means you've met at most, what, like

1042
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:58,820
five times?

1043
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,020
Yeah, four and a half times.

1044
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,260
And you're like, I can't anymore.

1045
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:05,540
If I had an obligation that required me to only remember it

1046
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,900
every two months, that would be heaven.

1047
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:18,500
Can you start inviting a lot of dope ballers to your book club?

1048
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:24,260
And it's in, like, a lot of real hip cats, and you get them

1049
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:30,100
to come to the book club and just sort of dilute the shares

1050
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,060
of the terrible people until it's a cool book club.

1051
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,300
Is that a devoting out situation?

1052
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:35,700
I don't know.

1053
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,740
I've never been in a book club.

1054
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,540
I see.

1055
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,940
That's good.

1056
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:44,180
You could also just kind of dip, and that's my jam, is that

1057
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:47,620
if you are doing something you don't like doing, you dip on

1058
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:51,300
it because best case scenario, they don't actually care that

1059
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,820
much that you took off.

1060
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:57,060
And worst case scenario is not really a problem anymore

1061
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,420
because you dip, didn't you?

1062
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,580
You dip and you have more time to do cool stuff and hang out

1063
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,860
with people you enjoy.

1064
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,180
Oh, and when they call to check on you, you just say, like,

1065
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,460
I finished the book.

1066
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,420
I finished the book.

1067
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,700
So I thought we were all working together to try and get

1068
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,500
through War and Peace, and I beat it.

1069
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,300
I beat the boss.

1070
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,460
So I don't need your help anymore, guys.

1071
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,700
Yeah, we're done, right?

1072
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,100
And then act very confused.

1073
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:25,860
And then, I don't know, tell them another book club invited

1074
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,380
you over and you liked the book.

1075
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,500
They were reading better.

1076
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,660
Oh, that's good.

1077
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,700
It has nothing to do about them.

1078
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,020
You've just always wanted to read Animal Farm.

1079
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,820
And so you had to go.

1080
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:40,100
Yeah, I am distrustful of a person that can't come up with

1081
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:44,180
a great lie every six to eight weeks because I can crank out

1082
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:44,980
a bad boy.

1083
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,820
I mean, I'm doing this on the daily.

1084
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,820
Can't come up with the excuses to not do things.

1085
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,260
I think it is suspicious that you can't cook one up every

1086
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,820
six to eight weeks because I could definitely come up with

1087
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,940
shit I am doing if I was only called to do that every

1088
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,300
couple of months.

1089
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:04,580
You could also come dressed up with a sheet with eye holes

1090
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,980
cut out in it and you walk in and they're like, why are you

1091
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:07,540
dressed like that?

1092
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,060
You'd be like, it's time for me to be honest.

1093
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:13,060
The whole time I thought it was boo club and I came here the

1094
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,620
first time thinking it was boo club and I was too embarrassed

1095
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,980
to say anything about it.

1096
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:22,660
But I'm here now and I'm just a guy in a ghost costume standing

1097
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:26,180
before a group of people whose opinions I don't respect saying,

1098
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,500
do you want to transform this into a boo club?

1099
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,100
Because if not, I'm gonzo.

1100
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,740
Maybe you guys will have better opinions about ghosts and

1101
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:35,700
paranormal stuff.

1102
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,140
I love your company.

1103
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,740
I can't stand reading and I also love fighting.

1104
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,140
So I want to turn this into a fight club.

1105
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,540
And is that an option that's even on the table that we can

1106
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,020
talk about?

1107
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:48,980
Because I would love that.

1108
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,700
Who wants to destroy something beautiful with me?

1109
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,820
Come on, let's do it.

1110
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,020
Let's start with the book club.

1111
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,060
Not see any hands?

1112
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,020
Shoot.

1113
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,060
Shoot.

1114
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,900
Shoot, okay.

1115
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,940
I'm going to start a fight club outside.

1116
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,260
Anyone who wants to join me, I will be on the porch during

1117
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,460
your book club meetings.

1118
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,020
Who's still doing book clubs?

1119
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,540
Like who's still, if you really want to bounce some ideas off

1120
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:17,540
the meaning of this shit, like hack into some accelerated

1121
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,740
reader tests and take those online and then get good points

1122
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,420
that you can spend at Pizza Hut or whatever.

1123
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:23,620
Something.

1124
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,020
Something.

1125
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,140
Something.

1126
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,020
Just call the author.

1127
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,060
Did I get it right?

1128
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,100
You got it right.

1129
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:28,500
Awesome.

1130
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,180
Thank you.

1131
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,300
Thank you, Mr. Salinger.

1132
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,100
Sorry to bother you.

1133
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,900
Sorry to bother you.

1134
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:33,540
That's okay.

1135
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,580
No one ever talks to me.

1136
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,540
I'm so lonely.

1137
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,020
Why doesn't anyone ever want to talk to me?

1138
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:42,340
What's the catcher about difficulties of childhood youth?

1139
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,180
I was drunk when I wrote it.

1140
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,780
Yes, I think so.

1141
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,140
Yes, you got it right.

1142
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:48,900
Hey, do you want to hear?

1143
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,540
I've got the first few chapters of Catcher 2 done.

1144
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,940
Do you want to hear the picture in their eye?

1145
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,100
Hi, you actually got it better than me.

1146
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,860
You knew better than what I thought.

1147
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:58,420
You've got it.

1148
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,780
I'm passing it down to you now.

1149
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,220
Now you're the Salinger.

1150
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,380
And he takes off his ring and he turns into bones.

1151
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,100
What's really sad is I know you're not a skeleton,

1152
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,900
but the first thing I thought is like Emily Deschanel from Bones.

1153
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,580
Ah, Trav.

1154
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:13,700
That doesn't make any sense.

1155
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,540
I know, but I'm a real character.

1156
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:15,780
Yeah.

1157
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,740
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1158
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,940
My brother, my brother, main advice show for the modern era.

1159
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,820
Yeah, we hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1160
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,780
Sorry about all the very obscure references this time.

1161
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,340
And a lot of placenta talk there for a while.

1162
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,460
A lot of placenta talk.

1163
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,740
Just some recommended reading for this week's episode.

1164
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,580
You can Google Billy Joel and Google...

1165
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,820
Cager, the Washington General's monster.

1166
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,220
Joe's Apartment, which was a...

1167
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:48,820
Mental Floss article about that Punky Brewster episode.

1168
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:52,980
Joe's Apartment was a movie based on...

1169
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:54,740
What was it?

1170
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:55,540
Like a...

1171
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,980
Like sketches, sketches.

1172
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,020
Like a skit.

1173
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,580
It's a short...

1174
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:06,660
It's like between show, like commercial basically on MTV.

1175
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,380
It's wild.

1176
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:07,620
Okay.

1177
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,500
But it is a movie.

1178
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,380
They also did.

1179
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,380
Roger Ebert wrote at the time,

1180
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,220
Joe's Apartment would be a very bad comedy

1181
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,340
even without the roaches.

1182
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,300
Wow.

1183
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:15,940
Okay.

1184
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,060
That's wild.

1185
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,540
Really tying their arms behind him there.

1186
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,380
Right.

1187
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,020
It wouldn't make much sense, I would guess.

1188
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,220
It would leave more room for O'Connell to stretch his wings.

1189
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,980
To really get out there and strut his stuff.

1190
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,060
His acting wings.

1191
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,420
We have new...

1192
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,500
I don't know if we talked about it, but we have...

1193
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,660
We mentioned it last time, but now they're on sale.

1194
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:43,460
We have a ton of shows that have gone on sale recently.

1195
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:47,140
My knowledge of like, see, I'm going to look at that

1196
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:52,820
to tell you all how those shows are doing.

1197
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:53,860
Hold on one second.

1198
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,360
Okay.

1199
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:59,300
We're going to be in Cleveland, Cincinnati, Nashville,

1200
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:04,100
Indianapolis, Atlanta, Orlando, Washington DC, Pittsburgh,

1201
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,540
Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Chicago, and Minneapolis.

1202
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:11,620
You can find all those at bit.ly forward slash become the monster.

1203
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:14,420
Because it is the become the monster tour.

1204
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:16,500
I know some of those have already sold out.

1205
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:21,540
I'm pretty sure, don't quote me on this, Pittsburgh and Brooklyn

1206
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:26,260
and maybe Minneapolis have sold out already.

1207
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:30,500

however you do, unless you don't, and that's okay too.

1229
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:26,180
It's not preferable.

1230
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,940
Do you all want the final Yahoo?

1231
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:28,340
Of course.

Thank you, Mike.

1235
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:39,060
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Eva, who does ask, how do people in pie factories

1236
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:44,340
know which box or wrapper to put on a pie if they can't see what's inside of it?

1237
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:44,820
Yes.

1238
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,660
Damn, that's good.

1239
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,740
My name's Justin Macaroy.

Kiss your dad.

1244
00:57:53,940 --> 00:58:03,540
School wear on the lips.

1246
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,020

00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,540
Hello, this is Amy Mann and I'm Ted Leo.

1250
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,340
And we have a podcast called The Art of Process.

1251
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:27,860
We've been lucky enough over the past year to talk to some of our friends and acquaintances

1252
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:31,220
from across the creative spectrum to find out how they actually work.

1253
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:34,500
So I have to write material that makes sense and makes people laugh.

1254
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,860
I also have to think about what I'm saying to people.

1255
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:40,260
If I kick your ass, I'll make you famous.

1256
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,700
The fight to get LGBTQ representation in the show.

1257
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:47,140
We weirdly don't know as many musicians as you would expect.

1258
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,780
I really just became a political speechwriter by accident.

1259
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,140
Realizing that I have accidentally pulled my pants down.

1260
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:58,260
