1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you change your mind on the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take your chance on me If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If you got no place to go when you're feeling down If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Finally, just ten days in, the year can start. It's my brother and my brother and me, the advice show for the modern era.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Finally kicking off 2011, a belated start to the year.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
New Year's Eve is technically, well, yesterday. Today is New Year's Day. It's time for New Year.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We're on a different calendar than most people.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah, that Gregorian shit is bullshit.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No, no, no, no. We're on the Gregory Hines calendar.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What's that mean?

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Gregory Hines came to me tap dancing in a dream. It was him and the other gentleman with the braids.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Ben Farine?

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Ben Farine. No, yes. Ben Farine and Gregory Hines came to me in a dream and they said,

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Son, New Year's starts on the date your people currently refer to as January 10th.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I mean, it's a dream.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You gotta do what happens in a dream. Everyone knows that.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah, especially if Gregory Hines is up in the mix.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If Gregory Hines comes in, his charm cannot be contained by the ethereal realm.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
His first show in 2011 started out really weird.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
A weird my brother and my brother and me. What will they say?

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So let's get into it. My name is Justin McElroy.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm Travis McElroy.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And we're going to take your questions and turn them into wisdom.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You're welcome.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're welcome in advance.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Should we apologize for skipping a week?

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You know what my New Year's resolution is?

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Tell me.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
No more apologizing.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No more apologizing. Live without apologies and think of all the time you'll save that you could be doing nice things.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I know.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I know a lot of people trying to make it up to them. Here we go.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What are some ways to get my shit right in the New Year?

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is appropriate other than the usual get fit or quit smoking or quit being cripply anti-social.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Also, what are some tips to stick with it and accomplish set goals instead of burning out halfway through February?

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, lethargic Leviticus.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I have a great answer for that.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hit me.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't set specific goals.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Set large general goals like this year, I am going to take better care of myself.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This year, I am going to be more outgoing.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This year, I am going to be more adult.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So that way, oh, you can look back over the course of the year and say, you know, all in all, I did pretty good.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If you set something specific like this year, I'm going to run every day.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, then it only takes one day that you've broken that that resolution.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What if you did like a contract with allowances, right?

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So you could say, I'm going to run every day with allowance to skip one day every four days.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And then you don't have to do it.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But if you do do it, then you can keep like the whole thing isn't isn't forfeit.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah, that's the thing.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You got to remember, this is a self-imposed restriction.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Like there's no, you know, there's no like body of government over your resolution.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So you're going to fail.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No, that's legally binding.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Travis, legally binding.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh, God.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, I know.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What do you think state legislators do all day?

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They don't they don't write laws.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's up to the big boys.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
State legislators, they take people's new year's resolutions and they turn them into law law that that person has to then abide by.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's like you've never seen schoolhouse rock.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Try to keep up.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I feel cool.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm doing a new thing this year where I I make it's called an incremental resolution.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I just resolve to make things a little better.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And what you do is each day you make one less shitty choice than you did yesterday.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So like today, today, yesterday, I ate like crap, but I rode my exercise bike today.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I didn't ride the exercise bike.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So I had some granola for breakfast.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's like nice.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You built.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So you have a policy of canceling yourself out.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
My policy is.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's pretty good.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If you want to be back to point zero at the end of the year, like just above you.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I just want to hover around the same baseline.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What if you made a resolution to ride your bike once this year?

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think through happenstance, you'll end up on a bike like even maybe in some sort of wacky escape scenario where you're like going through a big pile of watermelons, you know, leaping over it to escape.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The feds are trying to chase you down for writing that fake blank check for a million dollars to yourself because that goon hit your bike with a car.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So I think what you're saying is also this year, 2011, your resolutions either need to be really general or incredibly minutely specific.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Right, right.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This year I wear a red sock.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I've been eating a multivitamin every morning with my breakfast, which is now a banana and a plain bagel with cream cheese and a glass of orange juice and one multivitamin.

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And I have to say, I feel like a million bucks.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't I don't eat super healthy, so it's like a supplementary vitamin for like people like me who, you know, maybe can't can't climb all the steps of the food pyramid.

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
They get hung up at the bottom and they jump right up to sugars and fats to build their home there.

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And I gotta say, I feel great.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I feel more limber.

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
My bones don't ache as much anymore.

96
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The scurvy is cleaned up.

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm growing a beard now, too.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's got a nice sheen on my cheeks.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I would almost bet that's not true.

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I've resolved this year my my New Year's resolution.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And it's something I mean, I've gotten complaints about it mostly in my workplace, in my personal life.

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And so I've decided it's time to finally take care of it.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And I'm going to I'm going to try to cut back or stop altogether on trying to throw it off to ludicrous.

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That is so important.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You know, we tend to rely on that, I think, in our modern day society.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Our listeners don't don't don't get this because I edit the show with I go I have to go through with a fine tooth comb to get all the times you try to throw it off to ludicrous.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah. And it's really like two or three times every minute.

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah. I'm just like, Luda.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah. And then the show just grinds to a halt.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You point to the side, but like, we can't see you.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah. We don't know what you're doing.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And he just looks at me and goes, not this time.

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, God, it's frustrating.

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The straw that broke the camel's back. You have to like think that ludicrous is somewhere like remotely feeling you like he remotely feels you trying to trying to get.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You've got to see him like nodding nodding his head like he's into the beat and he's ready to jump in there.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah. That straw that broke the camel's back was Travis tried that move in the boudoir in the bedroom.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah. And it was.

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yeah. You don't want to try that with your lady.

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So let's get another question.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I think we've I think we've answered that one pretty well.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I if I try to talk to my best friend about serious stuff like goals or college job, etc.

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He just evades the questions and doesn't produce any opinion.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
How do I get him to acknowledge life beyond games, anime, Internet and pop culture?

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Help brothers. We could use your love.

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Concerned hipster.

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Hmm. This is the most exciting time to be alive ever, I think, and we have the luxury of not worrying so much about the day to day.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You know, there are people in third world countries who would love to be able to sit around and worry about games and anime and Internet and pop culture.

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Maybe you just embrace it.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, I I have a couple of friends where I know that that friendship is based on.

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We watch all the same TV shows and have read all the same books.

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I mean, I don't need to constantly be hanging out with people going.

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So what about that war in Iraq?

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Like you could sometimes just talk about the Simpsons like that's completely OK.

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:41,000
In fact, I find that people who try so hard to like force those conversations down my throat are typically not my good friends are typically the people that I I, you know, that yell things at me from park benches.

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah. So I think what you need to do is maybe just kind of take stock of what kind of friendship is this?

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And maybe you guys just don't have that.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm having a terrible day kind of relationship.

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Maybe you just have I saw an awesome episode of Blank last night.

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let's talk about it.

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah, maybe you're his sometimes friend who he likes to talk about those things with.

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And maybe he has another friend that he talks about serious stuff with and you you should have that, too.

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Also, like, that's not really stuff, especially as you get older and and your your social dynamic starts to change, I don't think friends are like the people you always want to talk to about that stuff.

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Like dump that stuff on your on your on your loved one, you know, your friends, your friends.

144
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You should be all about partying down, getting totally crazy.

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Mm hmm. Getting get bananas, you know, to get. What if you just flipped it on him, though? Whoa.

146
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What if you just flipped it? Like, what if you're talking about the latest anime that you guys watched on a man?

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I believe it's on me on a man up here on a mom.

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What if you were watching, you know, one of your cartoons and like you just say all of a sudden you're just like an enemy.

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I hate you both so much. Yahoo Answers.

150
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We're your enemies now, right? Enemies. Yes.

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But hey, it's the first Yahoo answer of the new year.

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This is a cinema by Cal. I'm not going to go on until both of you stop.

153
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sorry, Griffin. I'm sorry. Please go on. I know this game.

154
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yahoo Answers user Mr. Lizard needs to know. Are you pronouncing that right?

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yep. I think it's I know because there's a picture of a lizard company.

156
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He asks, Do I need to wear pants under my snuggie blanket when I wear it to work on casual Friday?

157
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The infomercial shows druid like people wearing them to sporting events and around a campfire, but it's not clear what to wear underneath.

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Also, any ideas to accessorize the snuggie? I have access to a bedazzler.

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Well, yes, obviously, that's a step that you should take.

160
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
They send a free one with your snuggie. Hey, why don't you bedazzle? You're just gonna be around the house.

161
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah. Yeah. It would be irresponsible for you not to bedazzle that shit.

162
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah. I think I think snuggies should be like vampires in that if they touch sunlight, they should burst into flames instantly.

163
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
They should. You should never wear a snuggie out of the house ever, ever, ever, ever.

164
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If you do that, you're done. Like, that's it. You're done.

165
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Unless unless you get invited to a party that specifically is listed as snuggie formal.

166
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Like a snuggie party. I could get down with that. Yeah, like a snuggie party.

167
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Sometimes, like, I get too drunk at a party. I just want to go to sleep.

168
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Snuggies like a bed that you walk around in.

169
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Like, that sounds great. And if you've never been to a snuggie orgy, that shit's awesome.

170
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, man. And it's very safe, too. Yeah, so safe. Because there's no flaps in the front.

171
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Well, there's no flaps. There's actually zero genital to genital contact at all.

172
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
A lot of static electricity, though. A lot of sparks flying.

173
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Which reminds me, if you're looking for the perfect way to accessorize your snuggie, how about dick hole?

174
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
A bedazzled dick hole.

175
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Who's that peeping at you through the window?

176
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh, he looks as snuggly as the snuggie. Get up. I'm not a snuggie for your penis.

177
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
This is a snuggie attached to the...

178
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
See, this is tricky territory because... Hey, does that feel good to you, baby?

179
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It feels tartany, actually. It feels like a tartan. Is there a tartan down there?

180
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Whatever size your snuggie dick hole is, people are going to be able to tell.

181
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Like, they'll be able to eyeball your dick, even when it's not hanging out.

182
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
They can see your snuggie bedazzled dick hole and can just work it out, can figure it out.

183
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So, I don't know. Maybe if you're secure in your...

184
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You could just bedazzle the words, not much, over the penis hole.

185
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Look elsewhere. And you know what the great thing about that is?

186
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
If you turn it around, you're in for the snuggliest bowel movement of your life.

187
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Just get your aim right. Get your line up right. I cannot stress this enough.

188
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Get your line up right, because that will be the end of your snuggie party.

189
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Oh, that snuggie's done. Burn that snuggie.

190
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You should have burned it anyway, because you wore it out of the house.

191
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But now burn it, like, officially now. Definitely now.

192
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I don't know. Maybe it would be... Maybe snuggies are the jam. I've never worn one.

193
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I feel like... I'd be careful playing with fire. You put one of those on.

194
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I like blankets. I know, me too. I like robes.

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You should test it out. Just get a robe and put it on backwards and see...

196
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Just take it for a test drive. You think? Yeah.

197
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Can we stop the show for a second? Let me... Yeah, just go put one on and see...

198
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm doing it right now.

199
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I think that snuggie is, like, moving to your retirement community,

200
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
because once you do it, you're done. That's it.

201
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You're not going to do anything else. That's it. You're done. You're out.

202
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And also, every conversation is always going to end as soon as you say the words,

203
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
you know, I own a snuggie, and nope, you're done. You're out of that conversation.

204
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's a secret shame. You've got to keep it to yourself.

205
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I have been seeing an amazing girl for around a month, Griffin,

206
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and we recently made it official... Now, wait a second.

207
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That is in the email. I swear to God.

208
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
We recently made it official that we are dating.

209
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I really can't say enough good things about her, how she makes me feel.

210
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I know she loves... She feels the same way,

211
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and she's often told me that she can see herself falling for me.

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
This is all brand new to me. I've never had this deep of a connection with a woman,

213
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and I find myself wanting to tell her that I love her.

214
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I know after only a month, this isn't the best thing to do,

215
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
and I don't want to scare her off,

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
but I need to get the wisdom of the three brothers on this topic.

217
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What is it okay to say, I love you, to your S.O.?

218
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You guys have fun with this one?

219
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm going to go buy, like, nine or ten snuggies.

220
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This question, nine or ten snuggies, depressed me.

221
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
On a scale of one to ten snuggies.

222
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
How depressed are you?

223
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
This is my girlfriend, Darlene. I made her out of snuggies.

224
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
She's super cuddly, and different colors.

225
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Matt, I am so familiar with your situation right now

226
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
that halfway through your question, I wanted to start Googling you

227
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
and trying to find out how I can contact you to tell you to stop

228
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
the terrible thing you're about to do.

229
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
This is one of those things that, the trick of it,

230
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
the problem of it is, there is no right time.

231
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You got to feel it out, and that shit is hard as shit.

232
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Like, there is no, there's no light bulb,

233
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
or she's not going to look at you and say,

234
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
you should tell me you love me now.

235
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yeah, I'm ready. Give it, hit me with that.

236
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's just not going to happen.

237
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's the kind of thing, as you're stumbling along

238
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
in this darkness of life, you have to figure it out

239
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
on your own, and it's terrifying.

240
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Matt, words are easy.

241
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Words, words, you can open your mouth,

242
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and they slip out, and whatever.

243
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What I would say is, actions are the difficult,

244
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
more meaningful thing.

245
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So don't say the words until you find yourself acting like it.

246
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
When you find yourself putting her before yourself,

247
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
acting in such a way that is, where she is in your mind

248
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
when you're making your decisions,

249
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
that is acting like you love somebody.

250
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And that's the more important thing.

251
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And don't say the words until you find yourself acting that way.

252
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Words are easy.

253
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
We exist in a society that throws around the word love a lot.

254
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I love baseball, I love my friends, I love my dog.

255
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So it is through actions.

256
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Also, I would suggest waiting until it's not that you want to say

257
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I love you, but that you need to say I love you.

258
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That you look at her, and it's like, I can't not say it.

259
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I am so overwhelmed in this moment with feelings for you

260
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
that I have to say this thing.

261
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
God, this is some pussy shit you guys are talking about.

262
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And the emotions are like a big egg in your chest,

263
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and it just breaks open, and the love comes out your mouth.

264
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Griffin has a bad idea of romance and biology.

265
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Griffin's flipped on us, and he's become a love Scrooge.

266
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Just like that.

267
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
He no longer believes in the miracle.

268
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's just BS.

269
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll tell anybody I love them, but I won't say that I'm in love with them,

270
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
because that's a whole other tier.

271
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
That's a whole other tier.

272
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
T-I-E-R-N-T-E-R.

273
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You're shitting on us for semantics, is that what I'm talking about?

274
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's not semantics, that's fucking, that's some shit.

275
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And so that way, when you break up with her, you can say,

276
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
listen, I know how it sounded, but technically,

277
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I never said I was in love with you, so I'm scot-free.

278
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah, you see people making fun of that, but I hear somebody say,

279
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I love you, but I'm not in love with you.

280
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah, totes. That's a different thing.

281
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That's a different thing.

282
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
That's two different things.

283
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's like, I'm hungry and I'm sad.

284
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Those are two different things.

285
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Matt, save it for when you need to rescue the relationship.

286
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Save that card.

287
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There's no reason to just burn that one.

288
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Maybe you made out with one of her friends.

289
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What if you don't fuck that bad?

290
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's bad.

291
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That is one get-out-of-jail-free card

292
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
you do not want to deploy unless you need to.

293
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But it is important that you don't say it like this.

294
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I love you?

295
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That never goes over well.

296
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Don't make it a question.

297
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Another way not to say it.

298
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I love you.

299
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You don't want to make yourself the only person.

300
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That's going to build a dependency.

301
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Don't whisper it, either, if it's your first time.

302
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
If you're going to do it, just do it.

303
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Don't whisper it.

304
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Skywriting.

305
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Don't say it unless you're at a jumbotron.

306
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
If there's a jumbotron on the two of you, then say it.

307
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You're not going to have a choice in the matter

308
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
of what you say to you, and you won't be able to control

309
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
the love and your love output.

310
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Griffin, you're going to be visited by three ghosts tonight.

311
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The first...

312
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
My chains.

313
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
My chains are so big.

314
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Metaphorical and literal.

315
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
He's going to be visited by the ghost

316
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
of John Cusack.

317
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
My name is Mike,

318
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and my wife's name is Darlene.

319
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
She's made of Snuggies.

320
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
She's made of Snuggies.

321
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
She's also Mike and Darlene,

322
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
and her brother's name, Mike.

323
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Wait for it.

324
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
She wants to name our kids Mike and Darlene,

325
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
but I think it's a bad idea.

326
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Am I overreacting?

327
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
He didn't sign it, but I'm going to guess it's Mike.

328
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Hey, Mike.

329
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's a wicked bad idea.

330
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah.

331
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
His full name is Mike Mike Darlene.

332
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Hi, I'm Darlene Micerson.

333
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The third.

334
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
This is my brother, Mike.

335
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
His sister, Darlene.

336
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And our dog, Mark.

337
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah, it's hard

338
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
family reunions.

339
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Somebody says Mike in the whole house just burns down.

340
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What?

341
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Who? What?

342
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
What if every Mike you've ever known

343
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
is in this, like, up in the mix, up in this family?

344
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What if this is like some sort of,

345
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't know, some sort of legacy?

346
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Or a cult.

347
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Griffin, listen.

348
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I know this is weird to say

349
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
at this time.

350
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's the holidays and everything, but I have to tell you something.

351
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Okay.

352
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I saw Mike making out with Darlene.

353
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
No.

354
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
No, no.

355
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
That's either incest or adultery.

356
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
No, I saw Mike making out with Darlene.

357
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Don't do that.

358
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Don't do that.

359
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What are you overreacting?

360
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You are underreacting if you're

361
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
taking the time to write to us instead of

362
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
filing divorce proceedings.

363
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
There's no way.

364
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
There's no way that that conversation doesn't go like this.

365
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Fuck it.

366
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Let's just call him Mike and Darlene.

367
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Like, there's no way it was like a

368
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
coincidence that you came up with those names.

369
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's so much deeper than this because you're assuming that everybody in this situation

370
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
had a choice of what the next

371
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
generation of people's names are going to be, right?

372
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So Mike and Darlene are either the

373
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
parents of Mike or Darlene,

374
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
but whoever that child was

375
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
had to go out in the world and find another person

376
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
named Mike and Darlene that they can marry.

377
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
They're getting a fucking name monopoly.

378
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah.

379
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Do you understand what I'm saying?

380
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah, I've played it.

381
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Listen, guys.

382
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
This is bad, Mike.

383
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
If we can call you Mike.

384
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Why don't you suggest

385
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
naming the boy Darlene and the girl Mike?

386
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I love it.

387
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Tell me that's the only condition under which you'll accept it.

388
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Mike is

389
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
M-Y-K-E

390
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
E

391
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and Darlene

392
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
you spell M-I-K-E.

393
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's pronounced Darlene.

394
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's pronounced Darlene.

395
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
There's a silent Mike

396
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and an invisible

397
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Darlene in there.

398
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You know, silent Mike and invisible Darlene

399
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
are my favorite new rap duo of 2010.

400
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Did you hear their new album?

401
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It was an EP. It was a very limited release, but it was really good.

402
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You could only buy it if your name was Mike or Darlene.

403
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Hey, I have a Yahoo answer.

404
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Hey, in short, Mike, get out.

405
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Go ahead, Griffin.

406
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
This one was sent in by Jenna Dar.

407
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Thank you, Jenna.

408
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user IcedTeaLemonFry.

409
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Who says?

410
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
There's a lot going on there.

411
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Is it dangerous

412
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
to get a hickey

413
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
right above the heart?

414
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
My best friend and I wish to give each other

415
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
a hickey right above where the heart is placed.

416
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Would this cause any sort of damage

417
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
to the blood circulation around there?

418
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Or any type of damage to our bodies?

419
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Sorry if this sounds foolish,

420
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
but I care for them so much

421
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and wouldn't want to place their life in any sort of danger.

422
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I like how they just casually throw out

423
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
the weirdest part of that question.

424
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah.

425
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's just me and my buddy.

426
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
We're just sitting around playing hickey games, you know?

427
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Oh, God.

428
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Hickey tag.

429
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's just some hickeys between friends.

430
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
What?

431
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Listen, I love the idea that you and I have had

432
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
of sucking on each other's chest muscles

433
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
until a hickey develops, but I need to ask

434
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yahoo Answers to see if that's going to do some detrimental harm.

435
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I've got the shivers.

436
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yeah, it's bad, right?

437
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
There's a lot of, like, when you're doing that,

438
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
first of all, don't

439
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
put your mouth there.

440
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Second,

441
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
do you know the proximity of

442
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
my heart to my armpit?

443
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
How many mouths I want down there?

444
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Zero mouths.

445
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah, I don't care.

446
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Boyfriend, girlfriend,

447
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
just keep your mouth away from there. I'm ticklish.

448
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yeah, and just to clear up,

449
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I don't care if these two friends

450
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
are a man and a man, a woman and a woman,

451
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
or a man and a woman.

452
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It doesn't matter. It's creepy as shit.

453
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What are you doing?

454
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
What are you doing? Stop that.

455
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Put it down.

456
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
How is that even an idea that comes up?

457
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Oh, I'm bored. Do you want to watch

458
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
another episode of Daria? No, fuck it.

459
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Just put it right above my heart.

460
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Until a bruise develops.

461
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Do they mean above my heart?

462
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Like, the

463
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
skin that covers the heart?

464
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You mean like, aorta?

465
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Or like, right above?

466
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah, right. The aorta skin.

467
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Hey, iced tea lemon fry. Aorta not do that.

468
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Hey, if there was a top 40

469
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
song

470
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
on the charts called Hickey on My Heart,

471
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
who would have written it? Justin Bieber.

472
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
See, that's where I went to.

473
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Maybe Justin Bieber, maybe Avril Lavigne.

474
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Or maybe like a Toby Keith, because it could be like a country

475
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
standard.

476
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah, maybe John Michael Montgomery

477
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
would write a song called Hickey on My Heart.

478
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yeah, by the way, title of this episode,

479
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
we found it.

480
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
The danger would be

481
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
if sucking on your friend's chest

482
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
until it gave me Hickey didn't kill him.

483
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
That's the only thing that I'm worried about at this point.

484
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And then, secondary danger,

485
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
if anyone noticed.

486
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Yeah.

487
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
What the fuck is that on your chest?

488
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
No, it's okay. I have a matching one, Mom.

489
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Oh, okay. This is my good friend

490
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Douglas. I like him very much.

491
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
We are friends.

492
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
What if the vacuum

493
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
effect, like, pulls a little bit of

494
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
armpit in your mouth? That's like...

495
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
God, that's the...

496
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
What if your aim is off, and you pull

497
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
up, and you got a nipple in your mouth?

498
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh.

499
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Well, now you're married.

500
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I'm not saying that is how it works, Travis.

501
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm not saying, like,

502
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
you rip off their armpit. I'm saying, like,

503
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I don't know what my armpit tastes like, but it can't be great.

504
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Yeah.

505
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It can't be great.

506
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Mine tastes like Lady Secret deodorant.

507
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

508
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's strong enough for a man.

509
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Mine tastes like stump. It's been a rough week.

510
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I don't want to talk about it.

511
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Hey, guys.

512
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I've been dating my girlfriend for almost

513
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
two years now, and I like her a lot.

514
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
However, every time we start to take

515
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
a nap or go to bed, she wants

516
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
to talk instead of going to sleep.

517
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Women. Women.

518
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I do want to stop right here and say

519
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
normally I don't like to answer

520
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
questions from people who are living in

521
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
a sinful situation,

522
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
but I am going to continue for this special case.

523
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
She does the same thing

524
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
in the morning if she wakes

525
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
up before me. I'm pretty sure

526
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
killing her to shut the fuck up would be a bad idea.

527
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Would it?

528
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So I need a good one. You're pretty

529
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
sure? I know communication

530
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
is key to any relationship,

531
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
but sleeping is key to me

532
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
not being an asshole. Thanks,

533
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
sleepy sugar daddy.

534
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Well,

535
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
the bad news is

536
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
you done waited too long.

537
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You've set a precedent now. You should

538
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
have said that right away.

539
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
First time you guys spend the night together, and she wanted to talk

540
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
to you. She was like, no, I go sleepy

541
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
now, but now it's too late.

542
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Now you just got to keep doing it for the

543
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
rest of your life. Unfortunately,

544
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
if she says me go sleepy now, you are

545
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
dating a five-year-old,

546
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and that's a crime.

547
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
That is a crime.

548
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You should be in

549
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
jail for that.

550
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
How about

551
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
just I have a big day tomorrow?

552
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
He's got to have a big day every day, and she

553
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
knows that's not true.

554
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm an astronaut now.

555
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Big news, honey. I'm an astronaut, and I need

556
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
to turn. What about this?

557
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Turn in a little earlier.

558
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Just that way you can talk to her.

559
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Spend some quality time

560
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
there, and then

561
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and then

562
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
you can put something in her drink.

563
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Oh, or you can go with

564
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Travis's method, which is always

565
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
comes up with the worst ideas. Put something

566
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
in a drink. That's a great idea. Travis

567
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
always like he makes like

568
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
antifreeze. You just make a jump to

569
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
felonious like with no provocation.

570
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I am saying antifreeze.

571
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Fucking kill her!

572
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Kill her, bury her in the yard! Yeah, get it!

573
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Sleep it!

574
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Sleep in the yard! Lord of the

575
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Flies! No rules!

576
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Why?

577
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
He's supposed to go to sleep because he's tired.

578
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Hit her with a rock.

579
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Hit her with a rock!

580
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
He tries to run to caveman,

581
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
but he can sleep it.

582
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Okay, caveman.

583
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Listen, sleepy sugar daddy.

584
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
When you're in

585
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
a relationship, you gotta meet her

586
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
halfway. Imagine this email

587
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
that we were to get. What if our next email

588
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
was from Talkative Terry

589
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and she said,

590
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I love my boyfriend so much

591
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and I like to unwind at

592
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
night by talking to him, but every time

593
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I try to tell him about my day and my deepest desires

594
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and my secret fears,

595
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
he goes to sleep.

596
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
That hurts my feelings. How can I deal with that?

597
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
See, you just gotta flip it.

598
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You're in a relationship now, dog. You gotta meet her halfway.

599
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You'll get your sleep. Don't you worry.

600
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Let me give you some real advice that won't land you

601
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
in prison. Sit down to dinner

602
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
with her every night and talk about

603
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
her day then. You know, like,

604
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
make a time when you're not trying to

605
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
sleep to actually speak to her. Talk her

606
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
fucking ear off. Yeah.

607
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Then cut her ear off and sleep it!

608
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Sleep with her ear!

609
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Let me tell you this. Let me tell you this, sleepy

610
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
daddy. Just dump her.

611
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I sleep like a king every night.

612
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I sleep when I want. Like a lonely

613
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
lonely king. The only

614
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
person I sleep with is the

615
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Pizziz application in my phone.

616
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Uh, pillow dampened

617
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
with tears.

618
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Listen, let me

619
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
hit you with another idea.

620
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Turn it on her.

621
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So if she starts talking,

622
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
let her talk herself out and then

623
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
demand that she talk more.

624
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And just keep, like, play chicken with her.

625
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
See who will fold. I guarantee you

626
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
she'll eventually say, listen, I

627
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
have to work tomorrow. I have to

628
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
go to sleep. And then you'll have won.

629
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And she doesn't want to get into that game with you every night.

630
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
She knows. She knows what will happen if she starts

631
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
talking. You'll make her talk all

632
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
night. I think, I haven't

633
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
been in a relationship. That's a risk reward if I ever

634
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
heard it, but good luck. I haven't been in a relationship

635
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
in a long time, but if I remember correctly,

636
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
the secret to a healthy relationship is

637
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
besting. Uh, is

638
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
besting your partner. Yeah. And

639
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
acts like this in a series of physical and mental

640
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
challenges. That's what that's what a relationship

641
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
is. Love is like double dare in more

642
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
ways than one. Because you

643
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
know what? You know what? It's

644
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
messy. Yeah, it is messy.

645
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And sometimes you gotta go elbow deep

646
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
to find the flag.

647
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
What is Mark?

648
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Summers is always there and Mark Summers is always

649
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
there watching in a cheap suit.

650
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Sometimes. Sometimes you get a

651
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
trip. Sometimes you get a trip to Universal

652
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Studios. Sometimes you get gacked.

653
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
No big deal.

654
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
No biggie. Don't worry about it. Past the giant

655
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
waffle. Uh, I'm a Canadian

656
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
and I recently decided to pack my

657
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
bags and move away to America.

658
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But every time I go to the States,

659
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm immediately singled out as being

660
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
the Canadian. Can you give me some

661
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
pointers on how to blend in with my new American

662
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
neighbors? Leaving the beaver,

663
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
eh?

664
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I gotta say something. Tell me.

665
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I think Canadians are like royalty

666
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
in my mind. Anytime I meet someone

667
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and they're like, oh I'm Canadian,

668
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
my opinion of them is

669
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
just so high. I've never met a Canadian that

670
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I didn't like.

671
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Yeah, I think we're past the point in

672
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
society where Canadians are

673
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
made fun of. I think you guys are doing

674
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
okay. Yeah, you're awesome. You guys have

675
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
the best movies, the best games, the best music.

676
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You guys are killing it up there.

677
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And you gave us Rick

678
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Moranis. Yeah.

679
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And you know, it's not the worst thing in the world

680
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
you know,

681
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
you're moving to a new place.

682
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
At least people have

683
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
something to remember you with. Like people

684
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
you'll make an impression on people. You're a Canadian person.

685
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I don't know that many Canadian people. I would

686
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
remember if someone I knew was Canadian. And it's

687
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
a great starter to a conversation.

688
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You know, like someone hears

689
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
you say a boot or a and they're like,

690
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
oh are you Canadian? Oh Travis, that's a

691
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
terrible stereotype. You're racist.

692
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
They don't say a boot? No.

693
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
They don't. Then can I say a boot?

694
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah, you can say. You take it back.

695
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Yay! Yay! You're reclaiming it.

696
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Now burn it and smash it with a

697
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
hammer. Bury it in the lawn.

698
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah, there's someone who singles you

699
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
out as a Canadian.

700
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Give them poison maple syrup

701
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
and then bury them

702
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
in the lawn. Like Travis, that's

703
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I've never said that. You've

704
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
said it all the time.

705
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
We have an important, like a public service

706
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
that I think the three of us should

707
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
stop and talk about.

708
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It is

709
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
a very important month this month.

710
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Which by the way, I think

711
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
we should do this every month. Because every

712
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
month has some level of importance to it.

713
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I don't know. I think we should start out in January

714
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and just talk about and give people

715
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
some helpful tips. I'm sure you guys already know what we're talking

716
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
about. SeriousSam24

717
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
actually clued me into this. Twitter user

718
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
SeriousSam24. Thank you.

719
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It is

720
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
National Bath Safety Month.

721
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh thank Jesus.

722
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yeah, I know. It seems like it was just last month.

723
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But no, it's January. Just like it is

724
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
every year. I

725
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
think that we should stop and maybe talk

726
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
a little bit about bath

727
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
safety and why it's so important.

728
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Justin, I know you have

729
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
a presentation if you'd like to start it off.

730
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Yeah, probably the first time

731
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
that I felt like an old person

732
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
was when I went to Lowe's

733
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and I had to ask

734
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
the person in the vest

735
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
if they could point me to those.

736
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So I said, the strips that help

737
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
you not fall down.

738
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Hey guys,

739
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
don't laugh. Don't laugh. It's not funny.

740
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
When you get to that point, like you get

741
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
to the point where

742
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
you are actively

743
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
considering the possibility that you could fall down

744
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
the tub and hit your head and not

745
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
get back up, you're really

746
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
embracing your own mortality.

747
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Like that feeling of invincible

748
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
thing, that is kaputski.

749
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It's super important. What you're

750
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
saying is, it's very, very important, Justin.

751
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I agree with that. But

752
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
that is technically for

753
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
shower safety month, and that is April.

754
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So everyone knows that

755
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
putting those things down in your bathtub ruins

756
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
it, ruins its capacity for bathing

757
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
because it's like sitting on football cleats

758
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
after that.

759
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You're more worried about those people that still

760
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
shower with electronics sitting around the tub.

761
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Again, shower safety month

762
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
is April. We're talking about

763
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
pools of water that people soak in.

764
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So they bathe with electronics

765
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
sitting around the tub, or they bathe

766
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
whilst

767
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
trying to, I don't know,

768
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
skin carrots or something.

769
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So you would say...

770
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Don't prepare food

771
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
in the bathtub. It's like you guys have

772
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
never given a public service announcement before.

773
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It's like playing poker with my sister's kids. Do you want me

774
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
to do one? Yeah.

775
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Let me do one.

776
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
A hundred people every year

777
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
get sucked down the drain.

778
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Get fucking...

779
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
look sharp.

780
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
See? That's all you needed.

781
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
They can play that. They can syndicate that on the radio.

782
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Oh, okay. Do you want to try again?

783
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Yeah, let me try. I'll give it some...

784
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So this would be like free publicity for us, right?

785
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Yeah, totally.

786
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
In fact, if you even want to say like our names or like the name

787
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
of the show, and then...

788
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Hey,

789
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
you're falling asleep in the bathtub

790
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
and you're probably going to drown.

791
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Wake up!

792
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
My brother, my brother, and me?

793
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Good, good, good, good. Was that good?

794
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Uh-huh. Travis?

795
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You know, it's all fun and games to relax

796
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
in the shower, but always

797
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
be vigilant for bathtub

798
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
sharks. My brother, my brother, and me.

799
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
That's good.

800
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I want to try again.

801
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Edit that last one out. That wasn't good.

802
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I will cut it out. They will cut it out.

803
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
All right. I want to try one.

804
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I don't have...

805
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I don't have a good one.

806
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
God damn it, Justin.

807
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I'm sorry. I thought I had...

808
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
This is so difficult.

809
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Six people just died in the bath because of you.

810
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Yeah.

811
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
They fell asleep because of

812
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
how boring and awful you are.

813
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
All right. Here we go.

814
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
If your fingers are pruney,

815
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
that means it's the sin coming out.

816
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Ask Jesus. I love you.

817
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
My brother, my brother, and me?

818
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
What?

819
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
That's brilliant. You just saved

820
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
some lives. That's good because it's got

821
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
a religious message, but also

822
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
remind people that earthly love is real,

823
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
and it's mine.

824
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
How about this? How about this?

825
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Okay.

826
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
The temperature of your water shouldn't exceed

827
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
115 degrees, or else it'll

828
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
flake the flesh off of your bones.

829
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And your baby's bones.

830
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
My brother, my brother, and me.

831
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Hey, hey, hey.

832
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Don't jerk off in the bathtub.

833
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
That's awful. My brother, my brother, and me.

834
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
That washes down the drain

835
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and goes and mixes with everybody's water.

836
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And then you get somebody

837
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
pregnant and have to pay child support.

838
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
My brother, my brother, and me.

839
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The water you're in right now

840
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
is like zero, zero, zero, zero,

841
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
zero, point, zero, zero, zero percent

842
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
cum.

843
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Have a good bath.

844
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
You'll never be clean again.

845
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
My brother, my brother, and me.

846
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Is that good?

847
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Have we done enough to help you think at this point?

848
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I feel like

849
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
maybe two or three more.

850
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Do you have a Yahoo answer?

851
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I feel like

852
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
we've informed people.

853
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
There's just so much danger.

854
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Bath safety, guys. Get on it.

855
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
This one is sent in by Peter Baumgartner.

856
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Thank you, Peter.

857
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ed, who asks,

858
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Is it possible to use chi

859
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
to make fire?

860
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Is it possible to use your

861
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
chi energy to make fire?

862
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I know it is possible to use chi energy

863
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
to make warmth and to control fire

864
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
pyrokinesis.

865
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
But can you use it to make a little fire

866
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
on, for example, a piece of paper?

867
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
A piece of paper? No.

868
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
No.

869
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
If you're using chi to make fireballs,

870
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and I'm assuming

871
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
he's talking about fireballs.

872
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Well, yes. You can't do it on paper.

873
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
No, not paper.

874
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Whenever I make my chi flames,

875
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I usually just use it

876
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
to heat up food.

877
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Yeah, sure. I use it to light dollar bills

878
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
on fire.

879
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
What do I care? I can shoot mine fire.

880
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah, once you have your mine fire right,

881
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
money is not an ish.

882
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I can't tell you...

883
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I can't tell you the amount of times

884
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I've been sitting around creating warmth

885
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and controlling fire with my chi

886
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
pyrokinesis.

887
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And I've wondered, why can't

888
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I just create this fire?

889
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You know, and I've tried. God knows

890
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I've tried, but then I lose focus on

891
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
controlling the fire and it gets out of hand

892
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and burns down a building.

893
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Did I tell you guys last week? Oh my god.

894
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I was channeling my chi energy

895
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
to make warmth and control fire, pyrokinesis.

896
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
But I was wearing a

897
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Snuggie while I did it, and I almost burned

898
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
to death.

899
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I love that scene in Princess Bride

900
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
where Andre the Giant is wearing

901
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
a flaming Snuggie.

902
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Holy shit!

903
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
He is, right?

904
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
He's like really doing that.

905
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
The holocaust cloak is the world's earliest

906
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Snuggie.

907
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It's like you channeled your chi energy

908
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
to make warmth and summon Andre the Giant's ghost.

909
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Pyrokinesis.

910
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Pyro-con-Andre.

911
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
The most powerful fours on Earth.

912
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Hey.

913
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Geomagnetism.

914
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Hey Ed.

915
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Hey Ed.

916
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Listen, we've all been there.

917
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Right? We've all been there.

918
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I was on safety patrol in elementary school

919
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
and there's nothing to do when you're standing

920
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
on the corner helping kids cross the street.

921
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Except for, I guess, keep those kids alive.

922
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So I would try and move shit with my mind.

923
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Sure. We all did.

924
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
We're all there, but

925
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Ed, it's

926
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
2000 in heaven now.

927
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yeah. Science rules.

928
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Science is cool and like

929
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
we have to rise above this.

930
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Yeah. Get on board with science.

931
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Science says you can't do that as much

932
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
as you'd like to.

933
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm going to take a counterpoint here.

934
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Science says we haven't done it yet.

935
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Okay. Okay. Good.

936
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
People also used to say that

937
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
man couldn't fly and that

938
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
the Earth was flat.

939
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And look what Columbus Daddy flew.

940
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So, yeah.

941
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So there, I mean, there you go.

942
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Ed, listen.

943
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I feel like we've been joking

944
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
for about a year now, but this is serious.

945
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
If you are going

946
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
to channel your chi energy to make warmth

947
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and control fire, pyrokinesis,

948
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
you have

949
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
to, have, have to

950
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
make sure that you do

951
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
not do it in a bathtub.

952
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
My brother made that up to me.

953
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It's so serious, so topical,

954
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
so relevant.

955
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
There were like six or seven callbacks in there.

956
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Yeah. Did you hear them all? It was good.

957
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I'll go back with a crayon and circle them.

958
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
This is from Weathered

959
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
in Cincinnati. He says, I got a corporate

960
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
job downtown

961
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I got a corporate job in downtown Cincinnati

962
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
in July and I'm the youngest guy in the office

963
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
at 25 years old. People I work with

964
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
are all nice, but they're all older and I have

965
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
nothing in common with them. I've tried getting

966
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
interested in them, as Justin has advised me to do in the past,

967
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
but it's hard to connect when I don't have kids

968
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
or a lousy husband slash wife

969
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
to complain about. Also, I'm pretty sure

970
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
everyone thinks I'm a meteorologist

971
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
because all I can think of to talk about is the weather.

972
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Any topics or ways to start

973
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
a better conversation during my lunch hour would be

974
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
much appreciated. Thanks,

975
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Weathered in Cincinnati.

976
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You can just hang out with me.

977
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Just hang out with Travis. I do want to address

978
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
like a serious, like an actual point

979
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
here. You say, I've tried

980
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
getting interested in them, as Justin has advised

981
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
to do in the past, but it's hard to connect

982
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
when I don't have kids or a lousy

983
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
husband slash wife to complain about.

984
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
It's kind of backwards.

985
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You've got it backwards.

986
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
The bit

987
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
about like getting

988
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
interested in other people that we

989
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
harp on here, it's not about

990
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
finding things to talk about yourself

991
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
that you think the person will be interested in.

992
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Yeah, it's not a conversation starter. You actually

993
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
have to do it.

994
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
You have to do it. You have to say,

995
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
there's nothing people love

996
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
more than telling you about something you

997
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
don't know about. You say,

998
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I don't have a

999
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
wife. That must be hard.

1000
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
What is that like?

1001
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And also, you're actually in a really

1002
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
good spot there because people love that

1003
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
and people hate when someone says

1004
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
like, you think you've got it bad.

1005
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Let me tell you how bad. Everybody

1006
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
hates that guy.

1007
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's wonderful to be the guy

1008
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
like, I am a youngling who needs to learn.

1009
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Please teach me. And those

1010
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
people will love you because they think you want to

1011
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
actually listen to their stories all the time.

1012
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Just listen to them. And also,

1013
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I bet you're a fucking cool guy.

1014
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
You seem cool.

1015
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
You seem like a cool guy.

1016
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
They would be interested in you too.

1017
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And the beautiful thing is, as a younger guy,

1018
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
they're going to be interested in living

1019
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
vicariously through you because all

1020
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
of these older people are like,

1021
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Jim went to a crazy club this weekend

1022
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
because they couldn't go to a crazy club.

1023
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
They had a lousy wife, husband, and kids.

1024
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
So as you're talking about doing awesome

1025
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
things, they're like, please tell me more about your awesome things.

1026
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I used to work at Best Buy

1027
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
with a guy named Blanks.

1028
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And everyone called him Blanks

1029
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
because they thought he looked like Billy Blanks

1030
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and I thought that they just didn't know many black people.

1031
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But

1032
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
the highlight of my Sunday

1033
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
used to be hearing about whatever

1034
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
whatever cool

1035
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
club that Blanks had gone to the night

1036
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
before that I didn't know existed.

1037
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And the girl

1038
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
he got down with

1039
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
as he smoked his menthol cigarettes and told me

1040
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
about his conquest, that was a highlight.

1041
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And I didn't have anything in common with him.

1042
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I just liked hearing those stories.

1043
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
It would vicariously be awesome for a little bit.

1044
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Our world is a great big mosaic.

1045
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
People like

1046
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
me and Justin Travis,

1047
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
and people like Blanks, and people like

1048
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
you, Weathered and Scentsy,

1049
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and people like you, the listener.

1050
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And let's just share.

1051
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Let's just share our experiences

1052
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
with each other without reservations.

1053
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Yeah, we don't need to

1054
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
dump your stuff on somebody else. Just listen to their

1055
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
stuff. Yeah.

1056
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I got one more serious one that I want to read

1057
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
just because I love the question.

1058
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
There's so much

1059
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
to like here from, I want to say from

1060
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Cocktain, but I don't think that's right.

1061
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It's C-K-O-T-A-N-E.

1062
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
What is the best way to

1063
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
greet a girl when you first meet her? Is shaking hands

1064
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
awkward? Is it appropriate to give a sideways

1065
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
hug? Context.

1066
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Perhaps like on a first date

1067
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
or a blind date. Recently,

1068
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
my grandmother hooked me up with a date

1069
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
with this girl she met during a Zumba

1070
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
class.

1071
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
What is that?

1072
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You know, Zumba. Zumba, Zumba.

1073
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Go on. Yeah, it's like Brazilian

1074
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
yoga or something. What's your

1075
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
grandmother doing there? I don't know.

1076
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I talked to the girl on Facebook and she

1077
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
was very much interested in meeting up with me to go on a date.

1078
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
How do I greet her in such a way

1079
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
as to give a good lasting impression that

1080
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
will set the tone for the rest of the day? God,

1081
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
that's tough. Cause like you can't. Tongue her.

1082
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
What'd you say?

1083
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Tongue her. Just tongue her?

1084
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Did you say tongue her? Yeah, tongue her.

1085
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Like, tongue kiss her.

1086
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
That's inappropriate. Travis, there

1087
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
are nine or ten different ways that I could take that.

1088
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I think

1089
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I, Sue, that, see this is tough.

1090
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Because if you, if you,

1091
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
if you shake hands, you're setting a weird

1092
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
tone. Yeah, don't shake hands. And definitely

1093
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
don't side hug.

1094
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
You're damned. Here's what you can.

1095
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Alright, I'm going to list off all the things you absolutely

1096
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
cannot do. Okay, hit me.

1097
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Don't do nothing.

1098
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Don't shake your hand. That

1099
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
says a bad tone. Don't hug her.

1100
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Don't kiss her.

1101
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Don't. No high fives. No high

1102
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
fives. No physical contact.

1103
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Whatsoever. So don't not touch her, but don't

1104
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
touch her, whatever you do. Yeah.

1105
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Don't do nothing though. Chest bump. What

1106
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
about a chest bump? That's touch. Don't

1107
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
do that. There's some

1108
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
sensitive stuff up on the top. What about

1109
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
just, the first time you meet her, just

1110
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
slow dance with her.

1111
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Ooh, that's good. Ooh, you know what you should do?

1112
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Zumba her. Just zumba all over.

1113
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
You know, if you

1114
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
do go in for a chest bump though, that's a pretty clear

1115
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
message about what kind of night the girl's going to have.

1116
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
She's not. This is going to be terrible for both

1117
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
of us. Give it. Essentially

1118
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
if you stand across the way, just slap your chest and go,

1119
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
hey bruh, chest bump. Here it comes.

1120
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Chest bump, bruh, chest bump. I'm going to bruise those.

1121
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
You're going to have a bad night.

1122
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I'm not paying.

1123
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I didn't bring any money.

1124
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I stole your wallet when I chest bumped you.

1125
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
You're paying, I guess, by extension.

1126
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Um, so don't

1127
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
do any of those things.

1128
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Don't do anything, but don't do nothing.

1129
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Why don't we bring back kissing her hand?

1130
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
No. God.

1131
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
No? Drop to one day, kiss her hand.

1132
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Make sure you're wearing

1133
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
a fedora

1134
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
and make sure you're within eye

1135
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
range of me so I can come kick the shit out of you.

1136
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Yeah. Dullard.

1137
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
What about pinky swear?

1138
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
How do pinky swear that we're going to be in love?

1139
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Maybe,

1140
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
maybe this is the kind of thing

1141
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
that you should decide with

1142
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
her ahead of time on Facebook.

1143
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
When I see you, what is the proper...

1144
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
How should I touch you?

1145
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Tell me how to touch you.

1146
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
God damn it.

1147
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I want to touch you, right?

1148
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
You know you're

1149
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
wondering about the right moment to say I love you.

1150
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
You found it.

1151
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
This is it, right here.

1152
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
She won't think about what you're doing with your hands.

1153
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I think you want to touch me too.

1154
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Yeah, I think you'd like to touch me.

1155
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I think I would like to touch you.

1156
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
We don't know each other well.

1157
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I want to make sure when I touch you...

1158
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Listen, I can't stress this enough.

1159
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
You really have to type this whole paragraph

1160
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
before you send it.

1161
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Because if you send this piecemeal,

1162
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
there's a good chance you're going to lose her midstream.

1163
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
She's going to see the whole thought

1164
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
and see it through to the end.

1165
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Because if you just open without it touching you...

1166
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
You can't...

1167
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Just send her an email that says

1168
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
could you wear clothing with brightly marked

1169
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
areas where it's okay for me to touch you.

1170
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Just a circle here.

1171
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Can you wear a hyper-colored t-shirt?

1172
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Oh, fuck.

1173
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
You should probably just not go on the date.

1174
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
You should probably just stay home

1175
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
and just translate.

1176
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Not in the bathtub.

1177
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
This is Griffin's last question.

1178
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
But first, a couple quick housekeeping things.

1179
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
We are sorry we missed last week.

1180
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I know a lot of you depend on us

1181
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
for the only good thing that happens to you.

1182
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
It's your bright spot, your sliver

1183
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
in the otherwise gray

1184
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
gray, gray cloud

1185
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
of your Monday. I get it.

1186
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Monday, man. Work week's starting.

1187
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
We're sorry we weren't there for you.

1188
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It won't happen again. It will.

1189
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
NBNBAM.com is the site

1190
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
where you can

1191
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
where you can talk

1192
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
to people. You can ask us

1193
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
questions there. You can see all the different methods.

1194
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
You can ask us questions. There are forums

1195
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
there that are replete

1196
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
with people who share your interest and

1197
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
my brother, my brother and me. We are

1198
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
reordering

1199
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
some of our hoodies

1200
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
because they were so popular

1201
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
and you guys raised a lot of money

1202
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
for Big Brothers Big Sisters. I'm not sure of an exact number yet.

1203
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'll share it when you get it, but you guys

1204
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
did awesome. We actually

1205
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
we have a confession.

1206
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
We actually gave all of that

1207
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
money to the Bathtub Safety Coalition.

1208
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Like Big Brothers Big Sisters,

1209
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
they give out an important service,

1210
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
but they don't stop people from

1211
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
dying in bathtubs.

1212
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Well, I heard they were going to change

1213
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
it to Big Brothers Big Sisters Big Bathtubs.

1214
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Yeah. Oh, God, that's

1215
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
terrible. That's a terrible

1216
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
that's a horrible. That's

1217
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
very, you know, I said that out

1218
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
loud and

1219
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
that's a bad combination of words.

1220
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
You didn't send that one to the old thought

1221
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
factory. Who's in the bathtub?

1222
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Darlene and Mike. I don't want to talk about it.

1223
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
They're both big and they're related.

1224
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
That's all we need to say.

1225
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
They're siblings.

1226
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
But seriously, thank you guys as always

1227
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
for listening. Love to get some

1228
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
more people on board. There's some great ways of doing

1229
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
that. One, just burn a CD,

1230
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
you know, just burn a CD and give it to

1231
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
somebody and say, here, I think you might enjoy

1232
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
this. Also, we love it when people

1233
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
share

1234
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
our quotes. Share

1235
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
NBNBAM quotes with that hashtag

1236
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
NBNBAM and

1237
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
make sure you don't

1238
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
put at NBNBAM at the beginning

1239
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
or else only people who

1240
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
already follow us will see it. So spread

1241
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
it around. Spread

1242
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
the knowledge,

1243
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
the wisdom,

1244
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
the gift, I guess. I'm

1245
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
going to start calling the show The Gift if you guys are

1246
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
cool with that. I'm going to

1247
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
call it The Secret. People are already hooking us

1248
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
up. Kimbo 2042

1249
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
is out there spreading

1250
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
the word. As always, Michael Maney's

1251
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
there. Like an

1252
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
archangel. Like an archangel.

1253
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Pat likes it hot.

1254
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Our boy Pat, you know, he's up in

1255
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
the mix spreading the

1256
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
word. So

1257
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
also, I meant to tell you guys, I

1258
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
had a dream last night

1259
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
that NBNBAM

1260
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
was going to do a live show

1261
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
in my dream.

1262
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Really? It made me very excited.

1263
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And so I

1264
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
personally am resolving that.

1265
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
You woke up this morning and

1266
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
you were pregnant.

1267
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
In nine months, Travis

1268
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
is going to pass a live My Brother, My Brother

1269
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
and Me show from his fertile womb.

1270
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Now, speaking of

1271
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
gatherings, our buddy Rocky Horror

1272
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
who is a DJ

1273
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
is putting the final

1274
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
the finishing touches, I think, as they say

1275
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
in the mixtape world, on the My Brother, My Brother

1276
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
and Me mixtape.

1277
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
And you're going

1278
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
to dig it. I haven't heard

1279
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
it except for a couple tracks, but I think you're really going to

1280
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
enjoy it. There's a new

1281
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
track that he's got on his feed. You can find it on his

1282
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Twitter. It's at Rocky Horror.

1283
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
But he's been talking about doing a

1284
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
release party

1285
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
here in Huntington.

1286
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Ah, shit. Which would be crazy.

1287
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
But if

1288
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
we do that, you're not going to want to miss that

1289
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
because that's going to be loked. You think at the

1290
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Elk Lodge? I'm going to push for the Elk

1291
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Lodge. Or Billy Bob's?

1292
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Yeah, I don't know. Because I know some

1293
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
septuagenarian veterans who would really

1294
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
dig Rocky Horror's vibes. Yeah,

1295
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I think they would. And I think, like if we did

1296
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
that, we would all be there. I would hope.

1297
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I would think we would all get there for that.

1298
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
But, yeah.

1299
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
There's no tease people though.

1300
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It might not happen. It might not happen.

1301
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
It might happen. We'll

1302
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
keep you out of the ground and we'll of course spread the word

1303
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
on Twitter

1304
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
and stuff and

1305
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
the website and things like that. So, Griffin.

1306
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yeah, sure.

1307
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Enough of this garbage. Give me the rest of the stuff.

1308
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
This very final, very

1309
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
last question was sent in by Matty B. Thank you Matty B.

1310
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user

1311
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Lily. And usually I just read the headline

1312
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
of these questions, but I feel like I should read the

1313
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
extra stuff on here too

1314
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
because it ramps up.

1315
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Lily asks,

1316
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
How do you get spaghetti stains

1317
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
out of underwear? I have gotten

1318
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
spaghetti stains in my underwear. My

1319
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
white cotton underwear. I have spaghetti

1320
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
stains in my white cotton underwear.

1321
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Laughing.

1322
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Laughing.

1323
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
What is Justin McElroy?

1324
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin.

1325
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
This has been my brother,

1326
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
my brother, me. Kiss your dad's square

1327
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
on the lips.

1328
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Music.

1329
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It's very important that you don't

1330
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
try to get the stains out

1331
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
by wearing the underwear in the bathtub

1332
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
because that's how you get trench butt.

1333
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Laughing.

1334
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Laughing.

1335
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Luda!

1336
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Laughing.
