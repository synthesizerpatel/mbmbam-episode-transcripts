1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:48,080
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show from the

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,000
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I am your middle-est brother, Travis

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,920
McElroy. And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy, and boys, you know, we're still kind of

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:10,240
in the tough times. Oh, really? Could turn around any minute. It could flip it in a minute, but

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,560
right now we're, oh, by the way, Travis pointed out, it's 420, so blades one for the big dog.

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,200
What are you waiting for? Now let's move on. We're all hurting for communication,

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,600
I think. We're all trying to reach out and touch souls whilst keeping our human bodies six feet

12
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:38,400
apart. And that can be tough. And digital is helping a lot, I would say. A lot of people

13
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,400
are using digital to talk to each other, and I think that that's important. And I just wanted

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,720
to share with you all, this is hot off the presses, this came in about 24 minutes ago

15
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,600
on my phone, and this was a text I got from a West Virginia area code number. So I don't know

16
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,600
who they are, but it's nice to know, you know, we have some of the same background. We both love

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,880
Tudor's Biscuit World, you know, like that's a soul connection right there. Go herd and like

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,440
bleed green and like pepperoni rolls and like Jim Justice, right? So like, I know that we have that

19
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,680
in common. And anyway, they texted me and it looks like 19 friends that also are in the 304 area code

20
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,480
and have sequential phone numbers, which is a fucking wild coincidence, but I feel the soul

21
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,200
connection with all of them. And they did say in this text message, and there is a link here,

22
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:34,640
I haven't clicked on it yet. But the text message says, see my juicy cream pie, and then says PUS

23
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:44,880
dollar sign Y, and online now, and then there's a white mouse emoji, and then a gray mouse face

24
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,880
emoji, and then just a black hole mouse emoji. Now Griffin, are you certain that they're mice

25
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:57,920
and not perhaps cats? No, these are mice for sure, Trav. These are little mice that like the kind

26
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,560
they live in the walls, Trav. And so me and 19 friends, new friends, I would say, because a text

27
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,720
from a stranger is just a friend you haven't made yet. And they do want us to come see the juicy

28
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,920
juicy cream pie PUS dollar sign Y online now. Kind of like Kesha a little bit there. Yeah,

29
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,600
it's putting a fun flare on it. And I have to say, I want to say real quick, I really appreciate

30
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:30,480
them obfuscating the P word, because my daughter could be reading this. Thank you so much for

31
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,640
censoring that. Is there some kind of spam sensor out there, but if they hadn't censored out,

32
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,800
the phone would be like, Oh, and wouldn't allow it through. Well, I got net and I did download

33
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:50,960
net nanny on my iPhone. Keep protect yourself to protect yourself and my chastity. So my favorite

34
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,080
thing about this and the genuine real soul. So if I could step outside the bed, the real soul

35
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,040
connection I feel is with one of these people. I do not know them. They do have a 304 area code

36
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:13,280
number pretty close to mine. They went ahead and they disliked this text. Which basically,

37
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,000
which fills me with joy as if whoever sent that first message is going to see that and be like,

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,840
Oh man, I really thought they would like that one. I really thought that just for them.

39
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,960
I put in the mice and everything. I was going to do a funny bit where like I pretended to

40
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,720
not know what some of the words in the text meant, but then you got to the emoji part and I was

41
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:42,400
literally like lost. I was lost. Why the mice? Why the mice, I guess.

42
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,720
It's like a Cinderella thing. You know what I mean?

43
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,320
These are the mice that stitch the crotchless panties.

44
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,760
But see, you've introduced already a cat kind of imagery.

45
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,120
Yeah, that's true.

46
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,280
And then you introduce mice and I'm getting turned around.

47
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,920
I do just want to say that, and this will be the fourth of it,

48
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:12,320
but if you do say cream pie on your podcast five times, then Apple deletes the whole show.

49
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:20,400
So let's try it. And that worries me because we usually drop one or two of those words together

50
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,120
like per episode, tangentially, not related to this beautiful piece of communication I got from

51
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,480
a new kindred spirit.

52
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,200
So have you thought about writing back Griffin?

53
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,280
No, I didn't.

54
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,400
I didn't think about that.

55
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,080
Maybe I don't think it has to be committal. I think you could write back like,

56
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,440
I'm not interested in clicking the link, but how are you today?

57
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,200
I mean, I can also just text back like what's with the mouse?

58
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,800
Like I understand you and your whole deal, but what's with the mouse emojis though?

59
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,440
Yeah, you know what? I'd like to talk about some digital communication,

60
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,800
unprompted digital communication I received too, because you're so right, Griffin.

61
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,320
It's really important these times.

62
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,920
I touched earlier on how some brands are looking out for us.

63
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,240
First off, let me just say a quick thank you to all the Justin McElroys on earth

64
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,960
that when you want to give someone a fake email address, you give them mine.

65
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,160
I don't know how you keep doing it, but I really appreciate hearing from all the

66
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:24,080
different Justin McElroys all over. And I got an email from Smyrna, Chevrolet,

67
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,160
which is somewhere. I have no idea where, not where I live.

68
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,440
In Smyrna, I imagine.

69
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,520
I would assume it's near Smyrna.

70
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,880
New Smyrna Beach, Florida, I got this email.

71
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,200
And the subject line of the email is just this, our dealership is still open.

72
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,360
So that's a kind of belligerent statement of purpose.

73
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,640
So then right below it starts with this, rest assured, our dealership is open.

74
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,120
And it says, this is what they've gone with for an opener.

75
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,920
Uncertainty is everywhere.

76
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,520
We are certainly ready to assist you.

77
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,080
Cool.

78
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,760
So that is so interesting.

79
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,240
That's badass. God, that makes me feel good.

80
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,120
That really makes me feel like we're about to turn the corner on this whole fucking enterprise.

81
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,120
It's nice to have one foothold in the whole thing, you know?

82
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,720
Like, well, at least new Smyrna, Ford, was there, Chevrolet?

83
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,440
It's a Chevy, Travis. It's got a hemming.

84
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,760
So you know that they're there for you.

85
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,440
And here's a really exciting thing.

86
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,560
If you've been waiting for the exact right time to buy a vehicle and thinking that this is it,

87
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,800
they got a first responder discount through June 30th.

88
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,840
Yeah, it's really nice.

89
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,000
It lists who it's here for, police, fire, EMTs, 911, medical professionals.

90
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,720
So that's cool.

91
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,920
And dentists and optometrists and veterinarians.

92
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,240
Okay.

93
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,160
And exercise and massage techs and chiropractors and dieticians.

94
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,640
Okay.

95
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,640
So first responder dieticians, I have good news for you.

96
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,080
If you've been waiting for the right time to buy a great new Chevrolet vehicle,

97
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,120
your moment has arrived.

98
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,600
And thank you for your service.

99
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,320
I love it when you burst into rooms and just like,

100
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,640
huh, someone's macros are off.

101
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,600
It's an emergency.

102
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,880
Someone's got to up their protein.

103
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,360
I'm here.

104
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,120
Someone needs their spine aligned and I'm the one here to do it.

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,680
First responder dieticians, thank you for everything you've done for us.

106
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,480
Your bravery.

107
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,200
Let's help some people.

108
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,280
I feel like the world needs us now more than ever.

109
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,640
I recently started-

110
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,200
We're kind of like first responders if you think about it.

111
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,440
It says, and others.

112
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,320
I bet if you roll in there and you're like,

113
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,680
I'm a first responding entertainer.

114
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,240
I'm still on the front lines of comedy and I would try to make jokes in this world.

115
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,040
So I would like a discount on a brand new Chevrolet.

116
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,520
Yeah, of course.

117
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,080
That sounds terrible.

118
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,520
Here's a free Chevy.

119
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,880
Here's a free Chevy for you.

120
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,240
Thank you so much for coming in.

121
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,280
You knew we were open.

122
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,080
I did.

123
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,040
Thank you for the email.

124
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,840
I recently started working for a food delivery company where my thank you for your actual

125
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:12,240
service keeping our actual republic functioning where my earnings depend on tips.

126
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,720
Most customers ask that I leave the goods outside their door to avoid physical contact.

127
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,760
Love this.

128
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,600
I totally respect that, but it eliminates that moment of human connection that reminds

129
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,120
them how I'm putting myself at risk so they can have a burrito.

130
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,040
What can I text customers after delivery to remind them to tip me?

131
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,520
That's from doing you a favor, TM.

132
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:38,080
Oh, yeah, I guess that probably clears up the mystery of which service we're talking about.

133
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:48,800
Who is still getting food delivery and not tipping like a mortgage payment?

134
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,080
Yeah, I've seen them out.

135
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,640
It seems like that should be customary.

136
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,440
And you see, you know, have you seen the news reports of people

137
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,560
switching their tips out at the last second after using it?

138
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,840
Oh, come on.

139
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,560
Oh, that's bad.

140
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,760
Oh, you monsters.

141
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,400
Don't do that.

142
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,600
But I do appreciate the text that says, like, hey, I dropped the stuff at your door.

143
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,640
Go get it before the carrion birds do.

144
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,600
And I go outside and without fail, the carrion birds have gotten away with my egg rolls.

145
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,720
Every time?

146
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,240
Every time they just go for the egg rolls.

147
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,840
They don't go for the Mongolian beef.

148
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,920
They mostly focus on the egg rolls.

149
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,520
Is it the spice level, do you think?

150
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,240
Yes, they have very sensitive stomachs.

151
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,480
And I appreciate the text saying like, hey, go get them.

152
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,680
But is there a version of that text that's like, hey, go get them.

153
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,280
And I'm really putting myself at risk.

154
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,520
It looks like your house is covered in pathogens.

155
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,320
What about this?

156
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,120
What about you're waiting for your burrito to arrive and then you hear, is that music?

157
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,080
And you go outside and you open your front door and there is a masked figure

158
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,920
standing in your driveway with a boombox above their head.

159
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,800
And it's just playing, here's your food.

160
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,560
It's time to eat.

161
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,000
Here's your food.

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,120
It's such a treat.

163
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,760
And it's like, wow, that's a lot of service.

164
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,880
I really appreciate that.

165
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,160
I'm going to tip this person.

166
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,520
This fuggie.

167
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,640
Do you realize we're in a world where like actual mass delivery people like come from

168
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,480
the outlands to bring us supplies except they're burritos?

169
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,040
It's weird right now, I think.

170
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,480
I think things are weird.

171
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:20,960
You know what?

172
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,320
You know what needs to make a comeback?

173
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,480
I've just decided based off of, you said hear music, Justin, and it got me thinking.

174
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,000
Like an organ grinder's monkey, right?

175
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,480
Okay.

176
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,160
Because you leave the burrito there, they open the door, there's a monkey.

177
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,080
The monkey tips its little hat, maybe holds its hand out.

178
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,800
You hand him a $10 bill and he scurries back up on the delivery person's shoulder a good

179
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,000
12 feet away.

180
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,160
The monkey can get so sick though, Trav.

181
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,600
Well, yeah, I don't think so.

182
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,480
Monkeys are fairly cold blooded and so I think they're actually pretty good transmission

183
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,520
factors for disease.

184
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,600
So a monkey is not great.

185
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,000
How about an organ grinder's robot?

186
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,200
There's a little Roomba there and the Roomba tips his little hat and then vacuums your

187
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,360
sidewalk back to the delivery person.

188
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,560
That's good.

189
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,920
And you don't even have to do it.

190
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,760
You can just shatter a Roomba on their front porch when you leave their food there and

191
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,360
you text them like, hey, my delivery Roomba died for your duck fat fries.

192
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,240
So just keep that in mind when you hit the old tipperino, huh?

193
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,680
It is a...

194
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,040
I have really been struggling lately with when I get...

195
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,680
This is taking it from the other perspective.

196
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,560
When I do get a food delivery, I'm sitting in the room where...

197
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,240
Almost always sitting in the room that has a clear line of vision to the front door.

198
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,520
Uh-huh, so I have really been struggling with what to do in that.

199
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,560
I really...

200
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,320
I have alternated between like standing behind the door and just like nodding my approval,

201
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,200
I guess, to actively hiding.

202
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,160
That's another one.

203
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,560
Just like getting clear of sight lines.

204
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,840
I worry that even though I do have the like leave on porch message there, I worry if I'm

205
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,720
too close to the door that they'll want to do a handoff and I don't want that.

206
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,800
I don't want that for either of you, yeah.

207
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,800
This is a true thing that happened to me 100% and it sounds, I know, like a scary story,

208
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,840
but it really happened.

209
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,240
We ordered food and we left...

210
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:30,800
The instructions were leave food on porch, but I was taking the garbage cans around front

211
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,880
at the exact time that they pulled up.

212
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,760
So then I just stood in the driveway and said out loud, I'll just wait and let you leave

213
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,640
it on the porch and I stood there.

214
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,880
What was I gonna do?

215
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,480
Go over and get it or say like, you stay there, let me go in the house and pretend like I

216
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,360
wasn't out here.

217
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,040
You wave at them and you say, hey, I'm the neighbor and I'm stealing their garbage cans

218
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,640
and you walk back behind the house.

219
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,080
The three of us are so bad at human contact.

220
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,440
The three of us are so, so, so bad at human contact.

221
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,840
How can we be fucking this up now of all times?

222
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,800
This should be our time to shine.

223
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,280
We should be thriving right now.

224
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,600
I think it, you know why?

225
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,160
I think I'm fucking it up because on some level, I just want to open the door and fucking

226
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,960
chat for a second.

227
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,800
I would love to chat with you.

228
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,080
That is the fucking impulse that I am fighting in my head.

229
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,720
You should see me at the grocery store as they're doing checkout.

230
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,480
I'm not gonna stay any longer than I need to.

231
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,200
And I'm not, I'm gonna keep blind moving.

232
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,160
Everybody here is taking a risk and I want to get everybody home safely.

233
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,360
But while you're scanning those groceries, we are gonna have a little talk.

234
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,920
You and me, I bet our nation's checkout clerks are fucking done.

235
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,400
Okay?

236
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:44,960
I know.

237
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,440
I know.

238
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,560
I've heard all of your wonderful stories.

239
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,280
Okay?

240
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,000
Stop it.

241
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,560
I'm done.

242
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,360
I'm cashed.

243
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:58,400
I, the other day during my like unfortunate but necessary shopping trip said the phrase,

244
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,480
this is a pretty cool plexiglass shield, huh?

245
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,600
When they put that in.

246
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,640
Oh, thanks Travis.

247
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,720
I just needed to communicate to a human being that wasn't in my house.

248
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,360
Did you catch a survivor last night?

249
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,720
I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by The Prospect or Merritt Palmer.

250
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,800
It is from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm gonna say their name is Gerald Me.

251
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,240
It's like Jeremy and Gerald, but they fused like in Dragon Ball Z.

252
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,080
Oh, I thought it was a catchphrase where you'd say like Gerald Me.

253
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,480
Oh, Gerald Me asks-

254
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,760
Hit me with that Gerald.

255
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,800
I prank called Apple and Microsoft.

256
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,760
Will they ever answer my calls again for when I really need them?

257
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,920
Additional details.

258
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,440
Any non-serious answers will be reported for Jpree.

259
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,520
And that's actually a, there's a drop down there and you can click this.

260
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,800
This one's too, this one's, they're cutting up too much in this one.

261
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,040
Please kick them off.

262
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,800
I'm gonna change my Twitter bio to that.

263
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,360
Any non-serious answers will be reported.

264
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,120
If I ask a question on Twitter and give me a non-serious answer, you will be reported.

265
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,680
That's pretty good.

266
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,480
So I did, I prank called Apple and Microsoft.

267
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,840
It was very, very funny.

268
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:16,160
I called them and said that, you know, my phone started to cuss at my parents

269
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,400
in the middle of the night or something funny like that.

270
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,480
And then, but now, but now my phone has started to get very, very hot

271
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,720
and it's only getting hotter and I don't think they're gonna take my calls.

272
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,000
Is that a concern?

273
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,840
Well, it's especially bad if you're like,

274
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,800
oh yeah, my phone started farting all the time.

275
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,080
And then your phone does start farting all the time.

276
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,960
Yeah, sure.

277
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,440
Oh, cause there's no way there's then you're the, you know, the person who cried fart.

278
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,960
And no one's ever gonna believe that.

279
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:50,160
Wouldn't be surprised if that did start happening with all of these crapple devices.

280
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,040
Android for life.

281
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,920
I love them.

282
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,800
I love this little guy and I can play all my emulators on them.

283
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:05,040
I am worried that Apple and Microsoft are gonna take my calls.

284
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,960
Well, especially when you're just calling to chat.

285
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,600
You know what I mean?

286
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,240
I just need to talk to someone.

287
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,000
That's the bigger concern at this point is I'll call Microsoft and be like,

288
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,680
oh, hey, Clippy died.

289
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,840
And then they'll be like, oh, this again?

290
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,040
I'll be like, yeah, I know I called you yesterday to talk about Survivor,

291
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,720
but Clippy is dead and I need to download him again.

292
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,200
So where does he come from?

293
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,320
Where did I get Clippy first?

294
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,480
And can I visit that website a second time?

295
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,920
This is why we need Bonzi Buddy more than ever to try to fill that gap,

296
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,280
but he's nowhere to be found.

297
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,040
I'd love to talk to Bonzi Buddy right now.

298
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,120
I miss Clippy.

299
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,200
We're our nation's chat robots during this time.

300
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,760
Thank you.

301
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,480
Could you chat with people on online somewhere?

302
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,360
Like is there, not chat online, but you know, I know people are doing that.

303
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,400
They'll get me wrong.

304
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,040
But people who-

305
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,440
Wait, where?

306
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,000
If you go to chatroom.com.

307
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,040
Oh, yeah.

308
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,320
Oh, this is all, oh, this is, oh, this is very NSFW.

309
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:04,720
Yeah.

310
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,600
Oh, boy.

311
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,000
I just threw that address out there.

312
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,120
Is it bad?

313
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,520
Let's see.

314
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,320
Hold on, let me look.

315
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,000
My computer stopped responding.

316
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,960
Oh, boy.

317
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,440
I just bought a silencer for a rifle.

318
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,520
I don't even know how I did that.

319
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,880
Don't go to that website.

320
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,160
I don't know what just happened, but it was bad on this podcast.

321
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,200
Travis, I said no.

322
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,000
But it says that attackers might be trying to steal my information.

323
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,080
Don't go to that website.

324
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,360
But now I have to get in.

325
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,200
No, you have to get out.

326
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,280
I have to, Justin, you know what?

327
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,240
I'm going to take the risk.

328
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,200
Let's go in.

329
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,760
Oh, no.

330
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,200
I'm being pulled into the screen.

331
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,360
Now he's in a reboot situation.

332
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,880
Captain, Captain N, the game master.

333
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,160
My brother is Captain N.

334
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,720
And it is me, the real Travis.

335
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,560
I don't think it is.

336
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,720
Can we just stick to one fucking topic for a second?

337
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,040
Yo, this is feeling loosey-goosey this episode.

338
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,080
I like it.

339
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,440
Microsoft and Apple won't take their calls because they did too many prank calls.

340
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,080
Yeah, Microsoft and Apple are my friends.

341
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,600
Do you guys ever have prank calls?

342
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,760
I'm trying to pretend to be computer brother.

343
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,280
No, we did that one.

344
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,000
It was good.

345
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,320
But I feel like we didn't live in it long enough, you know?

346
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,240
How are we going to get the next big thing?

347
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,600
Do you guys ever have prank calls that had real world repercussions that you didn't expect?

348
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
I've never prank called anyone in my entire life.

349
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,080
Come on.

350
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,560
I have a very distinct voice, Justin McElroy.

351
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,120
Oh, sure.

352
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,960
Everybody recognizes you from podcasts.

353
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,280
Right.

354
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,440
I mean, but I've never done it.

355
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,520
I've always been, let's put the tiger on the table and yell at it, a scared little dork.

356
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,080
I was too scared to do it.

357
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,200
I was afraid I would call and they would say, I'm an adult and you're a kid,

358
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,320
and now I'm mad at you, and I would just have to live in that moment forever.

359
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,600
And all the dorms at Marshall had landlines back when I was in college,

360
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,520
and they all had some variety.

361
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,120
I mean, you could guess the numbers because they're all very small variations on each other.

362
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,000
So we would call dorms and do, this is not particularly funny,

363
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,280
but we would do radio calling contests and have them do trivia and stuff like that,

364
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,800
and guess the thing and they get a prize.

365
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,040
And for some reason, some people got really upset about it

366
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,240
and started putting signs up in the dorm,

367
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,480
warning people if you get a call from Rod and Todd in the mornings,

368
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,440
they are not real DJs and you should not disclose any personal information to them.

369
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,200
And I didn't, I never wanted it to go that far, ever, never.

370
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,720
That's not what Rod and Todd are about, honestly.

371
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,520
It's supposed to be a fun time for your morning commute.

372
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,160
It wasn't about fishing for information.

373
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,800
Thank you.

374
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,440
One time I prank called Daniel Whitney.

375
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,360
He's a comedian.

376
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,720
And I called him, and like my thing back then was I did this character

377
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,200
where I'd be like, I talk like this, hey.

378
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,640
And then I would say sometimes like, I would say something offensive

379
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,480
and then I would be like, get her done.

380
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,280
And he stole it and started to call himself Larry the Cable Guy.

381
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,480
Whoa.

382
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,960
And that could have been, guys, that could have been me.

383
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,640
Wow. But I prank called him

384
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,840
and did the get her done thing and he just fucking stole it.

385
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,480
And now he's Larry the Cable Guy and he's in Cars 1, 2, and 3, so.

386
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,600
That could have been you, Griffin.

387
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,360
It could have been me sliding doors.

388
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,240
His real name's Daniel Whitney.

389
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,120
Awesome, awesome.

390
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,880
Hey, let's all go to Larry the Cable Guy's great stand up comedy sets

391
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,080
and just yell like, that was a good one, Daniel.

392
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,920
Great joke, Danny.

393
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,000
Take off the grease paint and show us your real face.

394
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,680
If anybody's still doing sets right now, it's Larry the Cable Guy.

395
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,040
I wonder what he is up to.

396
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,600
I'm going to check on him.

397
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,160
I wonder if he's doing any like Zoom sets, you know?

398
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,520
Like buy a ticket and you can watch.

399
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,640
Oh, I bet his background game is fucking on point.

400
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,200
So funny.

401
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,520
That is good.

402
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,560
It looks like he's in the news four days ago

403
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,320
on how the current comedy landscape, quote, sucks.

404
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,360
Second quote, grow a set and get over it.

405
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,240
So I think he's probably doing all right.

406
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,040
He's doing it.

407
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:17,280
The very first line on his web page is Larry the Cable Guy is back to get her done.

408
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,160
So apparently he stopped doing that one for a while and he's like, dip back in.

409
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,880
I can't wait.

410
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,560
Do you think that they'll put on his tombstone like, got her done?

411
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,840
He'll never die.

412
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,240
My seven-year-old son lost a tooth at the beginning of quarantine

413
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,200
and the tooth fairy had his $7 ready to go and waiting.

414
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,520
He gets his age in dollars per tooth.

415
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,080
Nice.

416
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,800
And when he loses a tooth at 35, cash.

417
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,240
A week into quarantine, he lost another tooth.

418
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,960
I had no cash.

419
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,840
I wanted to stay at home.

420
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,560
I reused the same $7 for tooth number two.

421
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,920
Now he has another seriously loose tooth.

422
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,680
I feel like if I use the same $7 for a third time,

423
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,440
he may notice that the piggy bank, which is partially transparent

424
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,600
and open top cup that used to house cotton candy is not getting any fuller.

425
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,240
Do I tell him the tooth fairy is social distancing and grant him an IOU from the fairy?

426
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,280
Just tell him the truth and tell him I owe him $14 at a later date.

427
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,760
No.

428
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,640
Is there a third option that's from Tooth Fairy Troubles in Tennessee?

429
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,200
Hey, Toby.

430
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,720
Toby, you got Venmo.

431
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,440
Little Toby.

432
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:20,960
It's me.

433
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,720
Hey, it's me the tooth fairy.

434
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,680
You got Venmo.

435
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:32,400
Could you set up a barter system where the tooth fairy leaves a note that says,

436
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,160
hey, banks are closed, wasn't able to get $7,

437
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,640
but here is an unopened Blu-ray copy of the hot girl.

438
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,880
The retail value of which is, I assure you.

439
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,560
I thought you were going deeper.

440
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,680
I thought we were doing like $7 in like beads and shells.

441
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,920
I was taking it all the way back.

442
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,240
I got some shiny rocks from the garden.

443
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,160
There's also a version of this where you say, oh, sure.

444
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:09,680
I could give you $7 or I could give you $20 of what I'm calling mommy script.

445
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,840
And this is, you can exchange this for all kinds of things on the company store.

446
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,600
We got a mug.

447
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,280
We got pencil.

448
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:24,880
Could you talk the son into the idea that if he can just keep it in his head

449
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,920
for a few more months, he'll hit eight.

450
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,600
And that's an investment in his future.

451
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,840
It's basically giving away money to let the tooth come out right now.

452
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,360
Put some super glue in there.

453
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,320
Keep that bad boy cooking for a little bit while longer.

454
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,400
You can convince them to wager $7 in a rigged carnival game of your creation.

455
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,600
Nice.

456
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,920
You're saying, the tooth fairy says you can have everybody now.

457
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,360
You can keep the juice going for a little bit.

458
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,840
Try and knock over this bowling pin with this baseball.

459
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,880
Oh, you didn't do it.

460
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,200
Shit.

461
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,400
Well, maybe next tooth.

462
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,360
Now, do you have a friend?

463
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,960
This is me talking to the son.

464
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,800
Do you have a friend with a loose tooth?

465
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,880
Because if you can get that loose tooth,

466
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,840
now that's when you're making the real money, right?

467
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,680
And then if you can get that friend to collect someone else's loose tooth,

468
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,560
now we're talking.

469
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,120
I'm doing like a multi-level tooth fairy marketing kind of thing.

470
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,000
Is that anything?

471
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,080
I think tooth transaction in these challenging times

472
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,960
is pretty high up on the list of things not to do.

473
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,400
I think I've seen that around.

474
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,360
Okay, what about this?

475
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,880
The kid's seven, right?

476
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,200
Just leave a credit card under their pillow.

477
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,040
They're not going to be able to do anything with it,

478
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,560
but they're going to feel like they just got a lot of money, right?

479
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,360
That's true.

480
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,680
Yeah, it could be even like one of those fake credit cards

481
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,560
that they put in letters to like trick you into opening it.

482
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,880
They don't know.

483
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,600
How dumb are fucking, how fucking dumb are people?

484
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,440
Hey, everybody.

485
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,040
Hey, don't throw that away.

486
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,560
There's a card in there.

487
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,080
That looks like the one I used to buy with using money on it.

488
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,600
That's, you're throwing away money.

489
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,400
It's a card.

490
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,520
Now, the tooth fairy left a note here, son,

491
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,720
and it says that the tooth fairy didn't have $7 to give you,

492
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,960
but the tooth fairy has opened up a line of credit in your name.

493
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,200
And when you hit 18 and your credit age is over 11 years,

494
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,840
you are going to be so grateful.

495
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,480
That's good.

496
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,240
You could also be like, yeah, oh, wow,

497
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,080
the tooth fairy left a little note here saying

498
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,640
that they named a star after you.

499
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,800
It's that one.

500
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,920
It's that one up there.

501
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,360
Says this tooth was no good, didn't count.

502
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,760
This tooth just didn't count.

503
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,080
Oh gosh, it says here your room was too dirty.

504
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,400
They couldn't find a path to your pillow.

505
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,200
Yeah, weird.

506
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,560
Man, eventually they're going to give them

507
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,360
back the $7 they stole for tooth one, yes?

508
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,160
Yes.

509
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,520
Yeah, you have to imagine.

510
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,920
I think the way to go is the tooth fairy is social distancing.

511
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,840
They told me that they will return when everything is,

512
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,560
like you can't go to the store right now anyways, right?

513
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,680
Maybe don't take that attitude.

514
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,640
Not that I'm saying, hey, what do you need this money for?

515
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,760
I think that's great, Trav.

516
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,400
It's a good thing right now to tell your seven-year-old kid

517
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,960
that things are so scary and terrible that magic is dead.

518
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,200
I think that that's, yeah, absolutely.

519
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,320
No, magic is not dead.

520
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,640
Magic is being safe, Justin, as we all should be.

521
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,200
Sure, yeah, absolutely.

522
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,120
Because the opposite side of that is you say,

523
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,280
well, the tooth fairy came and gave you $7,

524
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,920
but because the tooth fairy wasn't practicing

525
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,480
good social distancing, they got sick.

526
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,960
We don't know.

527
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,440
You could also just say, hey, all dentists are closed.

528
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,280
The tooth fairy is busy.

529
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,280
There's just one of them.

530
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,880
They don't have Santa magic.

531
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,400
So like it takes them a bit.

532
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,840
Maybe this is a good opportunity

533
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,000
when your son does notice the money is missing

534
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,720
because they will.

535
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,680
Maybe it's a good opportunity to talk to ask him

536
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,440
about this fucking shitty Fort Knox

537
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,440
that he's constructed to keep his cash safe.

538
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,560
Are you kidding me?

539
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,880
A cut up cotton candy container?

540
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,680
You're seven.

541
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,920
That's job, he's seven.

542
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,080
But like if you're gonna give someone money,

543
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,240
they should at least have something better to put it in

544
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,160
than like just like an old hole.

545
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,560
Oh, this is like a see-through container.

546
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:14,960
Oh, don't misunderstand.

547
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,720
He's begging to be robbed.

548
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,920
Justin, I was saying that six is an appropriate age

549
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,600
for like an old cotton candy.

550
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Seven in wall safe.

551
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,960
What do you do with it?

552
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,760
It's possible that this is one of a series of dead drops

553
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,880
that they have all throughout the neighborhood.

554
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,640
That's where you keep the daily cash,

555
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,560
but you deposit it every night in a safe location.

556
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,720
So you keep some cash on hand

557
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,160
in case you need to do any like day-to-day transactions.

558
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,400
But the real nest egg, well, you'll never find that, mother.

559
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,880
My kids have a perfect system.

560
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,320
They store all their change in a giant pink crayon

561
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,760
that is the loudest, heaviest, worst thing on earth.

562
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,800
And it's a perfect way to keep it safe for me

563
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,200
because if I look at the crayon, I get so angry,

564
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,120
I wanna put my head through a plate glass window.

565
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,440
Yeah.

566
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,880
So it's a perfect system.

567
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,240
That BB has a similar, she has a big soda bottle.

568
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,680
And the idea of ever trying to fish out anything from it.

569
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,760
Yeah, perfect savings.

570
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,880
Yes, it's perfect.

571
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,440
Speaking of saving our pennies

572
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,520
and scraping together what meager earnings we can,

573
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,640
let's take a brief break and head on over to the Money Zone.

574
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:39,680
Hey, you gotta do stamps and you gotta do mail.

575
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,520
Mail is still the big one.

576
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,240
And if you wanna avoid the crowds

577
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,080
by skipping the post office,

578
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,800
you can do everything that you do at the post office

579
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,320
at stamps.com.

580
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,120
You can use your computer to print official US postage,

581
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,600
24 seven, any letter, any package, any class of mail,

582
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,960
anywhere you wanna send it.

583
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,000
And then once your mail's ready,

584
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,240
you just slap that bad boy on there

585
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,480
and leave it out for a mail carrier

586
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,560
or you can schedule a free package pickup

587
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,320
or drop it in a mailbox.

588
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
No human contact required.

589
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,920
It's that simple.

590
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,000
Also, you get great discounts at stamps.com,

591
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,520

and up to 40% off USPS shipping rates.

593
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,280
And it's the best time to be using stamps.com.

594
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,920

00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,400
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage

601
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,440
and type in my brother.

602
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,240
That's stamps.com, enter my brother.

603
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,520
Stay safe, my friends.

604
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,240
They still want that said.

605
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,080
They still want that circulated.

606
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,680
If you weren't,

607
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,480
if you were thinking about doing some naughty stuff out there,

608
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,680
stamps.com begs you to reconsider.

609
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,480
Let me just say this.

610
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,400
Stamps.com if you're listening,

611
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,600
and I bet you are,

612
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,200
stamp safe, my friends.

613
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,000
What do you think about that?

614
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,480
Is that it?

615
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,040
That's good.

616
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,600
Stay stamp safe.

617
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,200
Stay stamp, my friends.

618
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,280
Stay safe, my stamps.

619
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,800
Oops, we didn't mean to put that in the copy of the email.

620
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,800
We were talking to our beautiful stamps again.

621
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,600
Oh, my beautiful stamps.

622
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,280
You stay in the box.

623
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,320
My beautiful stamps.

624
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,640
I know you want to come out of box

625
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,400
and breathe the warm sunshine air,

626
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,840
but you mustn't, my stamps.

627
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,440
Stay safe.

628
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,400
Stay safe, my stamps.

629
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,760
Stay safe in your home.

630
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,200
No one must know about my stamps.

631
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,000
The time has almost come for us to rise to power my stamps,

632
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,720
but not now.

633
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,560
For now, stay safe.

634
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,400
Listen, you've tried round space.

635
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,480
Now try Squarespace.

636
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,840
Round space made shitty websites.

637
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,720
Squarespace makes good websites.

638
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,040
The decision is clear.

639
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,760
Squarespace will showcase your work,

640
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,000
sell products and services of all kind,

641
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,960
promote your physical or online business, and more.

642
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,040
Circle space, round space only does and more.

643
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,360
It won't do any of the rest of that stuff.

644
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,920
Squarespace gives you beautiful customizable templates

645
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,680

646
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,640

free and secure hosting,

649
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,960
and nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

650
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,640
Round space only leaks your personal information.

651
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,840
That's it.

652
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,040
That's all it does.

653
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:32,080

One, two, one, two, three, four.

662
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,320
Hi, everybody.

663
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,440
My name is Justin McElroy.

664
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,240
I'm Sydney McElroy.

665
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,680
We're both doctors and-

666
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,480
Nope, just me.

667
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,440
Okay, well, Sydney's a doctor

668
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,520
and I'm a medical enthusiast

669
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,440
and we create Sawbones,

670
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,040
a marital tour of misguided medicine.

671
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,600
Every week I dig through the annals of medical history

672
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,040
to bring you the wildest, grossest, sometimes dumbest tales

673
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,120
of ways we've tried to treat people throughout history.

674
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,080
And lately we do a lot of modern fake medicine

675
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,920
because everything's a disaster,

676
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,640
but it's slightly less of a disaster every Friday

677
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,000
right here on MaximumFun.org

678
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,960
as we bring you Sawbones,

679
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,960
a marital tour of misguided medicine.

680
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,600
And remember-

681
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,680
Don't drill a hole in your head.

682
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,720
Y'all want a second, Yahoo?

683
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,440
Absolutely.

684
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,920
Okay.

685
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,720
This is usually,

686
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,400
this is the longest we've gone without a segment,

687
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,160
so I was getting kind of nervous.

688
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,760
This one is sent in by Emma Cant.

689
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,400
Thank you, Emma.

690
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,720
It's Yahoo Answers user Ray who asks,

691
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,400
Why is it every time I binge Godfather 1, 2, 3,

692
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,320
I come out acting more serious like the Godfather himself?

693
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,120
Oh boy.

694
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,880
Tell me about it.

695
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,480
That's how I feel anytime I watch any movie, you know?

696
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,240
You've, no, I don't know, Travis.

697
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,760
I come out like the Godfather.

698
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,360
Oh, okay.

699
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,720
Any movie, huh?

700
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,840
Any movie.

701
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,280
I watched Follow That Bird,

702
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,840
the Sesame Street movie.

703
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,800
The Sesame Street movie?

704
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,720
Came out like, oh, forget about it.

705
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,680
That was cool.

706
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,440
I watched Dolittle.

707
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,680
I came out like, oh, the day of my daughter's wedding.

708
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,480
Forget about it.

709
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,240
That's cool.

710
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,240
We're doing good impressions of Godfather.

711
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,200
Yeah.

712
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,920
Justin, do you know the one about the offer?

713
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,240
Okay.

714
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,360
That's not bad.

715
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,720
Okay, now Griffin-

716
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,040
Whoa, guys, I didn't know I had one.

717
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,240
I opened my mouth.

718
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,920
I opened my mouth unsure of what would emerge.

719
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,800
It's very good.

720
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,280
I'll never have that back again.

721
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,880
There's just a little bit of one.

722
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,760
It's not much of one,

723
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,960
but there was a little bit of something in there.

724
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,640
I think it was because we weren't expecting it,

725
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,640
that it sounded like a lot of one.

726
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,320
Everybody save your files real quick.

727
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,600
Does everybody download and save the files real quick?

728
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,840
I gotta check, Juice, if it's hereditary.

729
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,920
I made him an offer he couldn't rule.

730
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,200
I made him an offer.

731
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,920
I made him an offer.

732
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,680
I made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

733
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,880
Yeah, we've all got it.

734
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,920
I wonder if that came from mom or dad,

735
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,840
this gene that we all have.

736
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,200
No, that's Cartman.

737
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,920
That's what I was doing.

738
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,800
Let me try again.

739
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,760
Let me take a drink of water.

740
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,160
Hold on.

741
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,040
Trying to refuse this offer, you can't.

742
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,840
It's too good.

743
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,920
I offered him something and he liked it.

744
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,160
He said, yeah, that's a good offer.

745
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,160
I included this question mostly because of the picture it paints

746
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,440
of the type of person this is who sees Godfather 1, 2, and 3,

747
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,880
and then has to comment on,

748
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,440
oh boy, I really feel more like the Godfather.

749
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,240
What a badass.

750
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,720
No, it does say serious, not like a badass.

751
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,240
You walk out and you're like,

752
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,240
I guess I should take care of my bills.

753
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,840
That's what the Godfather would do.

754
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,000
I feel more responsible.

755
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,120
You walk out of the theater like,

756
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,200
oh man, my shoes are really dirty.

757
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,640
How long have my shoes been dirty?

758
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,320
I'm going to clean those post-haste.

759
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:17,760
Are you all susceptible to movie personality shifts?

760
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,000
Because I am remembering distinctly when I went

761
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,640
and I did see Drive and then I got out of Drive

762
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,720
and I got out on the highway and the needle hit that speed limit

763
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,280
and then I was like, but then I was like, Drive?

764
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,760
And I went just a little bit over

765
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,800
and I felt guilty about it for like six weeks.

766
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,560
That's, I remember when I went

767
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,200
and I saw Dirty Dancing Havana Nights.

768
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,760
Here it goes.

769
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,160
And I was like, up till then, you know,

770
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,560
my very religious parents had always tried to keep me dancing

771
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,800
pretty clean, you know, with Room for the Holy Ghost

772
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,080
and Katie by the Door.

773
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,320
And in the daytime in Havana.

774
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,520
And in the daytime too.

775
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,080
They said, you can dance in Havana,

776
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,960
but only during the daytime and with Room for the Holy Ghost.

777
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,920
And I said, no, no, no, no one puts Travis in a corner

778
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,680
and tonight I'm going to dirty dance at night in Havana.

779
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,400
And they said, okay, well, I guess that's fine.

780
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,600
You're 36.

781
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,840
So I just, oh, by the way, I just saw it like last week.

782
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,800
Yeah.

783
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,680
You just watched of your own volition the film

784
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,640
Dirty Dancing Havana Nights.

785
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,160
Well, I was the only person to watch it

786
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,680
probably for the last four years.

787
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,000
Well, I just seen Dirty Dancing for the first time

788
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,840
and I said, I have to see what happens next.

789
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,880
The saga continues.

790
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,800
What happens to these characters that I love so much.

791
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,000
Oh, they go to Havana.

792
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,440
That sounds intriguing.

793
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,760
You all may have read in the newspapers

794
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,320
about how Travis did get arrested in Havana

795
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,960
for going to a nightclub and dancing

796
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,360
while spreading his butt cheeks wide, wide open

797
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,040
and people kept yelling too dirty.

798
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,080
And they also kept saying six feet, six feet.

799
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,840
And I thought they meant how wide

800
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,280
I needed to spread my butt cheeks.

801
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,560
He got, Travis got hurt.

802
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,360
Travis got hurt.

803
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,800
Travis got hurt real bad.

804
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,280
Got hurt real bad.

805
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,600
I was laid up in a Havana hospital for a while

806
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,840
while they sewed my body back together.

807
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,160
I done ripped myself in half starting the butt cheeks

808
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,680
which to be fair, I've said before

809
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,760
would be the place to do it

810
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,440
because that's the natural perforation.

811
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
Yeah, but sure.

812
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,160
But now he can fly like a Dumbo boy down there.

813
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,600
That is true.

814
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,080
That is true.

815
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,080
Did you guys hear about vampire pizza?

816
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,320
No.

817
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,760
I just want to say thank you.

818
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,560
This is good.

819
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,280
This is not a much squad because it's too good.

820
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,520
I just kind of wanted to kind of put it out in the world.

821
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,840
Thank you to Mel and Eric for reporting on this.

822
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,880
This is an LA thing

823
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,960
and basically vampire pizza is this pizza restaurant

824
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,000
that's run by vampires and you order a pizza

825
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,320
and when they bring you the pizza and maybe a salad

826
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,280
they also bring an immersive alternate reality game

827
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,000
about a vampire family owning a pizza restaurant

828
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,680
that you have to involve yourself in and solve.

829
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,000
Does that make you mad?

830
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,360
I would love to do that.

831
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,680
I would love to get into vampire pizza.

832
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,360
I just want to let you guys know

833
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,880
that vampire pizza was happening out there.

834
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,120
There's still artists, both pizza and more traditional media

835
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,840
working out there to bring joy

836
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:34,160
and I want to thank the vampire pizza for existing

837
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,200
and thank you to Mel and Eric for the report.

838
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,920
With that out of the way.

839
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:53,840
I want to munch, I want to munch, I want to munch,

840
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:59,040
I want to munch, I want to munch, I want to munch.

841
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,480
Welcome to Munch Squad Retro.

842
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,680
I could almost pinpoint the inspiration for that

843
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,800
and I couldn't.

844
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,960
It's a pastiche, it's a pastiche.

845
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,160
She's so mad.

846
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,360
It's a pastiche, pastiche.

847
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,400
With brand innovation at an all time low,

848
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,520
I asked you folks to find your finest munch squads

849
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,560
from the olden days, press releases

850
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,520
from back the before times, way, way back.

851
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,480
Last time we took you to the amazing world of 1993

852
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,240
and this, by the way, you could send this to Justin

853
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,320
at mbnbam.com, just put like throwback munch squad

854
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,240
in the subject, but bring the heat

855
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,920
or you will be mercilessly mocked.

856
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,040
So thank you to Nate who did in fact bring the heat

857
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,920
with this fine story.

858
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,000
Heinz easy squirt adds a little quote mystery

859
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,280
to its colored condiment.

860
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,840
Oh, you won't know until you squirt.

861
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:04,480
Oh, what an unpleasant combination

862
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,160
of thoughts and words.

863
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,280
It's just so fucking.

864
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,720
Okay, so 90s kids are gonna love this one

865
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,720
because they remember, but for a while Heinz

866
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,440
was making ketchup in a lot of buckwild colors

867
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,080
and it still tasted like ketchup,

868
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,920
but it's all the colors were wild

869
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,080
and this was an evolution of that

870
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,360
in February of 2002.

871
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,000
So let's see.

872
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,360
Oh, Travis was looking forward

873
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,520
to graduating high school, he was.

874
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,480
Yeah, we're five months out from 9-11

875
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
and finally the nation is ready to heal

876
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,120
with Heinz easy squirt.

877
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,560
Heinz has a great condiment caper on their hands.

878
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,120
Oh boy.

879
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,120
Can color condiment crazed kids

880
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,880
help solve the mystery?

881
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,680
Heinz revealed today its new product for kids,

882
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,080
Heinz easy squirt mystery color.

883
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,240
Three new colors of the condiment

884
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,520
will hit grocery shelves nationwide in late April,

885
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,760
but children and parents won't have a clue

886
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,160
what's inside the easy squirt bottles

887
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,800
until they squirt or draw with it

888
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,480
on their favorite foods.

889
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,480
The new colors are passion pink,

890
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,840
awesome orange and totally teal.

891
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,680
Okay, fine.

892
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,160
You don't understand children

893
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,560
if you think there's any chance

894
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,320
they wanna be surprised by what color

895
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,360
is now on their hot dog.

896
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,400
It's all the same flavor?

897
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,400
It's all the same flavor.

898
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,680
Quote, here's a quote from Brian Hansberry.

899
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,240
Heinz is introducing three new colors

900
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,760
that kids can mix and match

901
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,160
to triple their fun at family meals.

902
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,480
So just so I'm clear,

903
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,600
I'm now keeping three bottles of ketchup

904
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,280
that I've had to hand label

905
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,680
because it's a mystery what color these are

906
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,320
so my kids can make ketchup art.

907
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,080
This is, okay.

908
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,480
Thanks to its cool curves and thin nozzle,

909
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,520
easy squirt gives kids the opportunity

910
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,360
to be artists at the table,

911
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,800
expressing their creativity

912
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,720
by drawing with bright colors.

913
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,320
Brian, you haven't met my terrible children.

914
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,360
What have you done?

915
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,360
Families that buy two or more bottles

916
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,880
may find they have different colors,

917
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,520
allowing pint-sized Picassos

918
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,920
to blend one mystery color with another.

919
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,400
They're all ketchup, Stell, they're all ketchup.

920
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,240
They'll also enjoy the same benefits

921
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,560
consumers have come to expect

922
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,720
from the popular kid condiment.

923
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,040
You mean ketchup flavor, I guess.

924
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,480
Yeah, Justin, red ketchup flavor.

925
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,040
Wait a minute, it's different now.

926
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,120
This is good.

927
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,560
Heinz easy squirt mystery color

928
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,880
boasts a special nozzle for accuracy

929
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,880
and an ergonomic shape designed

930
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,200
so smaller hands can hold on tight,

931
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,760
allowing them to create mealtime masterpieces.

932
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,720
This is the best.

933
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,200
And for little fries who want no surprise,

934
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,280
try regular Heinz tomato ketchup.

935
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,920
You can't handle it, you stick with red.

936
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,800
Your dumbass kids can't chill with this amazing ketchup.

937
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,360
But here's the thing, I'm betting that's most kids.

938
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,920
Yeah, only one million bottles

939
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,920
of Heinz easy squirt mystery color

940
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,360
are being produced.

941
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,720
When they're gone, they're gone.

942
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,040
Super sleuths will need to emerge

943
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,360
from the shadows quickly to nap a bottle

944
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,440
before the trail grows cold

945
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,760
and easy squirt mystery colors disappear forever.

946
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,960
Also, we should mention, Heinz has murdered someone,

947
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,280
so we're gonna need you to solve that as well.

948
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,080
Thank you.

949
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,840
Mr. and Mrs. Perkins, I gotta tell you,

950
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,400
Johnny's failing all of his classes

951
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,080
and us at school are really worried about him.

952
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,320
Listen, he's really wrapped up in this Heinz mystery.

953
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,480
It's really soaking up all of his free time.

954
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,080
No.

955
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:49,520
You don't know, it's a worldwide conspiracy at this point.

956
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,920
He's been undercover at the Giant Eagle

957
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,040
for three months now.

958
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,960
Heinz's most recent, it's saying how fast

959
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,040
these are gonna sell, Heinz's most recent

960
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,840
condiment coupes, blastin' green

961
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,160
and funky purple easy squirt food products.

962
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:08,880
I remember those.

963
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,960
They gripped the imaginations of children.

964
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,840
They, like, mom, listen, I wanna go to school,

965
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,240
I can't stop thinking about this fucking green ketchup.

966
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,040
Hey, just one more time, can I see it one more time?

967
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,080
Just one more time.

968
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,440
I'd love to go outside and play pretend

969
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,360
with Vicky and Brian and all the gang,

970
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,120
but my imagination is gripped by the funky purple easy squirt.

971
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,160
Think about all the things I could do

972
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,600
with this green ketchup.

973
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,360
I could put it on a hot dog, with french fry, anything.

974
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,200
I've spoiled all the dang food in the fridge again.

975
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,240
What with my constant opening to peer

976
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,600
at these beautiful ketchups.

977
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,080
It is, it is bonkers to me,

978
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,600
because I was just sitting here thinking,

979
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,040
oh yeah, there was a time when I couldn't squirt ketchup

980
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,040
out of a bottle, huh?

981
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,520
Yeah, as always, Heinz is looking for feedback

982
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,680
from its number one consumer, kids.

983
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:07,520
Kids are encouraged to log on to www.easysquirt.com.

984
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,880
Oh no, oh no.

985
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,000
April 1st, and get candid about the new colors.

986
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,800
Now, there's another line here from Justin McElroy,

987
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,480
April 2020, kids are discouraged from logging on

988
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,800
to www.easysquirtatanything.anything.

989
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,480
Anything with the word squirt in it, kids.

990
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,880
www.easysquirt.

991
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,880
This is not what I expected.

992
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,040
It's, we're not gonna, no,

993
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,400
no one should be going to this website.

994
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,160
Here's the thing, Heinz let it go, okay?

995
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,040
I don't know why, but Heinz didn't renew the lease

996
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,320
on that particular URL.

997
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,320
Do you think they're looking,

998
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,720
they're in the market for a new verb

999
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,880
to describe how to get the fluid out of their bodies?

1000
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,720
Do you think they've been shopping around some,

1001
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,440
yeah, dude, it just sploches right,

1002
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,960
no, not that one, dang it.

1003
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,800
Which mystery color will write

1004
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,040
the next chapter of Easy Squirt history?

1005
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,200
Huh, will young food artists create passion pink penguins

1006
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,040
waddling across their hamburgers?

1007
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,280
What?

1008
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,400
Will they sketch awesome orange orangutans

1009
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,880
clambering across their french fries

1010
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,200
or outline totally teal turtles napping on their hot dogs?

1011
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,800
Hey, thanks for the fucking creativity prompts,

1012
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,600
press release about colorful ketchup.

1013
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,800
My kids really appreciate it.

1014
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,640
I'll also say this, granted BB's not even four yet,

1015
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,240
but I can't imagine her being like,

1016
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,920
I'd love to eat this hot dog, dad,

1017
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,320
but first I'm gonna draw an orangutan on it with ketchup.

1018
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:43,120
Yeah, my kid made a cat out of a Diet Dr. Pepper box

1019
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,840
and a Cool Whip container named Trash Cat,

1020
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,240
and it's been sitting in our mantle for six months.

1021
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,600
So I shudder to think, shudder to think

1022
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,640
what the fate would be of a hot dog

1023
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,680
that received a lot of creative attention.

1024
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,120
It's terrifying to consider.

1025
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,960
How about another question?

1026
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,040
Here's another question, I live in the Midwest

1027
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,240
and my state has a very big state fair every year

1028
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,320
that I've gone to ever since I was a kid.

1029
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,600
I recently found out my state fair

1030
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,840
has a husband calling contest,

1031
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,920
which is basically a contest where wives compete

1032
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,320
to see who can call their husband in for supper the best.

1033
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,720
Like if they were on a farm.

1034
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,880
I think, yeah, got it.

1035
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,120
I think that it'd be fun to participate in this contest,

1036
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,720
but unfortunately I don't have a husband.

1037
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,480
I really wanna yell at my fake husband for prize money.

1038
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,040
Is it ethical for me to enter this contest?

1039
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,640
And if so, how would I do it?

1040
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,000
Ethical is a funny word to use there.

1041
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,440
Is it ethical?

1042
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,800
Sure, it's a, yeah.

1043
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,080
You're not lying about a law degree.

1044
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,160
Let's talk about this contest.

1045
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,400
This is from Husbandless Hopeful in Iowa.

1046
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:56,080
If it's just wives allowed to call their farm husbands

1047
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,560
to supper, I think that it would be good

1048
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,040
to do unethical to the contest.

1049
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,880
I think, you know what I mean?

1050
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,520
If it's-

1051
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,920
I would argue that if you enter the contest

1052
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,120
without a husband and yelled so good

1053
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,080
that your future husband showed up,

1054
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,080
you automatically win.

1055
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,360
Like you yell and someone walks up and is like,

1056
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,960
I heard the call and I had to come.

1057
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,200
Hi, I'm Jerry, right?

1058
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,600
And it's like, wow, that's a win, right?

1059
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,600
I have just some samplings.

1060
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:39,040
I've found an Iowa PBS report about a similar contest.

1061
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,640
Perhaps it is this one, who knows?

1062
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,440
And I just wanted to, if you guys wanna get an idea

1063
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,720
of sort of what we're talking about,

1064
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,440
I'll play that clip for you now.

1065
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,240
Please be silent.

1066
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:55,040
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, hurry up.

1067
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,320
I don't wanna be late.

1068
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,120
I don't wanna be late to the great Iowa State Fair.

1069
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,640
Bob, hurry, hurry.

1070
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,360
Bob, Robert Dean.

1071
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,680
That's cool.

1072
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,960
That was not at all what I was expecting.

1073
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,520
No, so do you have to yell Bob?

1074
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,680
Everybody yells Bob.

1075
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,040
Everybody's married to-

1076
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,320
It sounds like Robert Dean.

1077
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,200
It just seems to me like you could win

1078
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,040
by just being like, hey, and then be like,

1079
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,760
oh, be right there.

1080
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,760
And you're like, that's how good I yell.

1081
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,720
That's how good I yell.

1082
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,840
I don't have to do-

1083
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,880
Or you just get like supper or just text them.

1084
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,840
Walk up onto the stage and hold onto your temples

1085
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,440
and close your eyes and then have a paid professional walk

1086
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,960
onto the stage like, did you call me?

1087
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,480
And you'd be like, money, please.

1088
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,560
Prize money now, give it to me, I've won.

1089
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,920
Checking back in, here's our fourth place winner.

1090
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:52,640
Yoo-hoo, Yoo-hoo, Keith, Keith, Yoo-hoo.

1091
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,200
That's strong.

1092
00:50:53,200 --> 00:51:00,880
Cuckoo, cuckoo, the clock says dinner time.

1093
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,440
That was strong.

1094
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,160
That's powerful.

1095
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,880
That's a powerful call.

1096
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,680
Is the husband's name in that scenario, King?

1097
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,840
I think it was Keith.

1098
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,080
Keith, okay, it did sound like she was just yelling,

1099
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,840
King, King, the clock says dinner.

1100
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,160
Do you think she decided to do a cuckoo thing

1101
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,440
like halfway through?

1102
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,800
Like, I'm gonna dip into this.

1103
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,680
She just, the motivation hit and she was like,

1104
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,720
you know what, this wasn't the direction I was gonna go,

1105
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,520
but, and you know what, here's the sad thing.

1106
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,800
She probably could have gotten third

1107
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,640
if she had just stuck with her.

1108
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,360
I think the judges probably saw that flip-flop in the middle

1109
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,240
and they're like, nope, no husband's coming to that.

1110
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,240
No husband will arrive for that.

1111
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,400
Here's our first place winner.

1112
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,400
This is the last one I'm gonna dip on, you guys.

1113
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:46,960
Here we go.

1114
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,800
Roy, Roy, can you hear me?

1115
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,520
You get yourself in here right now.

1116
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,040
Come on.

1117
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,640
You know you're gonna be late again

1118
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,520
and you know that I want to get there on time.

1119
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:09,520
Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy.

1120
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:20,960
I can't, I can't.

1121
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,460
No.

1122
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,440
Fuck yes.

1123
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,880
Don't even enter.

1124
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,280
If that's the heat you have to go up against,

1125
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,320
unless you're going to come correct, do not enter.

1126
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:37,040
Is that really the thing that any human being ever

1127
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,920
is doing on a regular basis to call to another

1128
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,600
living human being ever?

1129
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,880
Travis, farms are big.

1130
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,680
Farms are so big.

1131
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,720
Farms are big, Travis.

1132
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,800
I know, but I'm saying.

1133
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,040
I like the soft Roys that definitely won't get Roy inside.

1134
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,040
It began with some quiet Roys that you knew

1135
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,480
weren't gonna work, Bonnie.

1136
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,880
So I feel like it's a little bit of a honeypot situation.

1137
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,600
So I didn't appreciate that, but overall great calling.

1138
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,960
I like the subtle Roy because a subtle Roy is good

1139
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,680
if it turns out you just didn't see him in the periphery

1140
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,160
and Roy is like three feet to your left, right?

1141
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,200
And you're like, Roy?

1142
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,640
And Roy's like, I'm right here.

1143
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,840
And you're like, oh, thank God.

1144
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,600
Because if you started off with a powerful Roy

1145
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,640
and then you have subtle Roy standing next to you

1146
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,000
and he's like, that was too powerful.

1147
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,520
You could have been subtle, I'm right here.

1148
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,280
Right, okay, that's fair.

1149
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,760
Do you think there's people listening to this podcast

1150
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,240
who just got ASMR for the first time

1151
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,800
and they're like, ah, damn it, I want that now.

1152
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,080
And it's so scarce.

1153
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,440
It's such a scarce resource.

1154
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,760
There's not enough husband calling to go around.

1155
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,760
Thank you all so much for listening to our program.

1156
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,360
We hope you've enjoyed yourself

1157
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,640
and I hope you're hanging in there pretty much

1158
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,840
as we while away the days and work together as a planet

1159
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,240
to try to battle back the unpleasantness.

1160
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:07,600
We are still doing this podcast and a lot of others.

1161
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,320
Now would be a perfect time to dip

1162
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,000
into the McElroy back catalog.

1163
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,040
If you head on over to McElroy.family,

1164
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,560
you'll find a bevy of entertainment products

1165
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,920
for you to enjoy.

1166
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,320
There's wonderful, a show about things

1167
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,800
that bring Griffin and his wife, Rachel, a lot of joy.

1168
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,240
You'll find shmanners about a show about etiquette

1169
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,560
in all kinds of different varieties.

1170
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,520
There's the Adventure Zone is our actual play,

1171
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,040
role-playing podcast.

1172
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,480
My wife and I, who's a physician,

1173
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,320
does a medical history podcast called Sawbones.

1174
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,280
There's a fucking show about cereal on there

1175
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,000
called The Empty Bowl.

1176
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,440
There's so much for you to go and absorb and enjoy

1177
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,520
and we would hope that you'll do that.

1178
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,360
But if all of that sounds like garbage,

1179
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,560
go to the McElroy family YouTube account

1180
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,000
and maybe dig around there.

1181
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,480
There's lots.

1182
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,200
That's videos at least.

1183
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,320
There's so many options.

1184
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,320
Hey, thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1185
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,320

1186
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,840
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1187
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,560
Thanks to MaxFun for having us on the network.

1188
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,960
Amazing shows on there as well at maximumfun.org.

1189
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,520
And hey, do you all want a final Yahoo?

1190
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,760
I love that, Griffin.

1191
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,240
Okay, this one was sent in by The Prospector.

1192
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,280
Mayor Palmer, thank you.

1193
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,640
It's a Yahoo Answers user, Beverly, who asks,

1194
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,920
how to just make the lasagna sauce?

1195
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,560
My name is Justin McElroy.

1196
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,840
I'm Travis McElroy.

1197
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,960
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1198
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,640
This has been my brother, my brother.

1199
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:54,240
May kiss your dad's square on the lips.
