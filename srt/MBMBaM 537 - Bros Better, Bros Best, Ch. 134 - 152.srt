1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:53,900
My son is at Santa for a Wii U. Is it Santa or Santa? My son is at Santa for a Wii U this year.

3
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,000
My wife and I have absolutely no intention of buying a Wii U for a

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,160
variety of reasons. He's young enough that we don't want to tell him the truth

5
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,160
about Santa yet, but we don't want to be disappointed when the big day comes.

6
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,440
We've tried several ways of talking him out of this Wii U idea, but his

7
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,040
conviction is pretty strong. How can we shake him of the idea that Santa will

8
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,480
bring him this ridiculous gift without ruining the magic? That's from Alex.

9
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,040
Why is your kid asking for presents from Sansa from Game of Thrones? I don't

10
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,320
understand. I thought it was Beyonce's alter ego, Santa Fears. Sure. Listen, let me

11
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,680
let me talk to your kid. You guys have to leave the room. Come in here little

12
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,360
Bryce. Come in here little Bryce. Let the brothers back right talk to you. Now parents you do

13
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,760
have to leave the room. We probably, you know we can't use bad words. We've been

14
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,900
bound by a blood oath, so just leave the room and let us talk to him. You know

15
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:55,520
Santa's gonna bring it to you. Yeah. Mom and dad are playing this, playing dumb

16
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,040
basically. They're trying to be so cool. You know my parents try to play this

17
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,000
game. Oh what a Guinness. I'm not gonna get you one of those. And then what's

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,220
that? Nintendo 64. Wouldn't you like settle for a Nintendo 63? And then what's that behind the

19
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,000
couch? Oh must be from Santa. What's that from Nonny? Nonny's got you another

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,680
present. What's that? It's a secret present. Wait what did Nonny get?

21
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,680
Open it up. Oh it's a sewing machine box. Nonny wait a minute. Wait a minute.

22
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,120
Feels like there's some extra space. Something now rattling around in this

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:40,240
box. Open it up. Is it closed? There's a map. There's a map on this sweater. Is

24
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:58,400
that a codex? Oh my god Jesus had a son. I'm not even worried about the Wii U anymore. Now I'm off on an international intrigue. I love this. I've gotta go find the Pope and kill him while he sleeps. I did not

25
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:08,240
rig the da Vinci thing. That's basically it. Bryce listen. Bryce you know Santa's gonna bring it to you. Yeah if you believe. Your parents are just playing

26
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,560
dumb. Santa always hooks you up. Bryce for real have you been good? That's the only

27
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,480
question because if it doesn't show up then you know that somewhere along the

28
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,560
line you done goofed up somewhere. Bryce have you been good and are you a

29
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,200
Christian? Have you heard the good news? Bryce we've got good news. Wear this cape.

30
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,480
Wear this cape. Take this little book. Don't tell your parents though. Bryce we've got good news about the love of Christ.

31
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:53,520
Keep this little book secret Bryce. But if Santa doesn't bring you a Wii U then Jesus definitely is. Jesus is Wii U insurance Bryce. If Santa doesn't bring you a Wii U it's because your parents don't believe in

32
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,800
Jesus. You gotta diversify. Diversify your Wii U portfolio. Listen playing Wii U is

33
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:17,160
cool. You know what is cool? Living forever. Don't you want to live forever Bryce? And also possibly playing two Wii U's. One from Santa one from Jesus. After you hear this good news you're gonna be like we who? Because of the good news. Nintendo power? No power of prayer. Power of prayer. Maybe the real power isn't Nintendo

34
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,680
power after all. And also Nintendo power of prayer. Hey Bryce Jesus does what

35
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:43,560
Nintendo don't. Just food for thought Bryce. Chew it over. Maul it over. Parents you can come back. It's all sorted. We smoothed it all out. Hey listen do get my cape back from him though. That wasn't for Keebz. That wasn't Keebz that was like a

36
00:04:43,560 --> 00:05:13,520
load of cake. He's crying because he saw something outside the window that scared him. It was a hawk. A big hawk flew down. We scared it away. We freaked it out though. God once you have one year where Santa doesn't bring the kid what he wants you never have to worry about bad behavior again. Do you want this to be like the one year? The one year that Santa really followed through on his seemingly hollow threat to not bring you what you wanted?

37
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:41,480
Just Merry Christmas. Bryce's parents. It's going to be a great one. It's going to be a great one. Don't listen back to that part. You're going to be tempted. Just burn this after it's done. Your iPhone I mean. Bryce just flush it. Just flush this phone down the potty Bryce. Daddy doesn't need it. That way Santa can find it. Because he lives in the sewers. No I'm thinking of it. I'm sorry.

38
00:05:41,480 --> 00:06:07,480
One of those three is definitely going to hook you up with the Wii U. Jesus, Santa, or it. Pennywise is going to bring you a Wii U. This is important Bryce. Don't go to him. Let him come to you with the Wii U. Don't. He's going to come at you from the sewer like check it out. Tell him to slide it to you. I'm down here having a fun fun two screen experience with Mario and Yoshi. Come check it out. And you say no Pennywise why don't you come up. I got a big table up here.

39
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Why don't you come up here Pennywise. They all waggle down here Brycey. I've got a lot of space that you can really explore with that gamepad. You're going to. I'm telling you I think it's going to be way better up here. So why don't you just. Just not in the sewer if we could. Hey, I know kids love clowns. Is there a clown in the world that can entice a child to follow into a sewer? How good is this clown?

40
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:43,480
He was just so gosh darn charming. He is. No he's not. He's Tim Curry.

41
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:59,480
And Tim Curry as we know is not blessed with natural charm. Could Tim Curry entice any child into any space anywhere on the earth above ground or subterranean for any reason using any means imaginable?

42
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:13,480
He can have all the Wii U's and candy in the world and be standing 10 feet away from the child in an open space. I'm going to make you a deal. Surrounded by Wii U, the candy, the pony, and the balloons. Right.

43
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Tim Curry couldn't entice a child into an ice cream truck driven by a Pokemon.

44
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:31,480
He could be surrounded by his parents and police officers. Come here. You're going to love this. I'm chilling in here with Pikachu and Charmander.

45
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:40,480
Charizard, pump the brakes. We're all eating push pops.

46
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:55,480
How do I see you met my faithful ghastly? Don't get strung out by the way I look. Well, what else do I have to go on right now? You are a clown with sharp teeth.

47
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:02,480
I would rather not. Do get strung out. Very strung out. To be fair, I also don't think Tim Curry could encourage an adult to do anything.

48
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:12,480
Well, except dance. But let's let's get back to Snuggies because I feel like we've made Justin uncomfortable.

49
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,480
I think Justin's left. I think Justin might have switched the nozzle. He might have flipped the flanger.

50
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:30,480
I'm still here. What happened? My cat took a dump in here and I'm dying.

51
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:38,480
I'm trying to like listen to this goop and pick back up on the goop. I'm trying to also light a sensei.

52
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:50,480
This is important. Is it the cat that you have that is approximately three apples long or is it the 600 pound sea cow with furry legs?

53
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,480
I'm going to say it's the skinny one because they got it. It was like a stealth mish.

54
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:04,480
They got in and out and I didn't I didn't get them until I started getting in my old factories. Oh God, it's so dirty in here.

55
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:14,480
I have to find a candle. Say something funny. I sprayed some Old Spice Fiji body spray.

56
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:24,480
It's getting a little better. Oh no, it's getting worse. They're blending. Stop doing aerosol alchemy.

57
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Can you not? It smells like physical therapist and cat food in here and I hate it.

58
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,480
It's like Jim, bro. Let's do the next question. Okay. Oh, I got a question.

59
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,480
How do you get the cat poopy smell out of your office when you try to do comedy?

60
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,480
This is a really good idea. The room in your house that you work out of and spend most of your time.

61
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Don't let your animals shit in it. Maybe don't put a shit receptacle for any living being in it.

62
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,480
You have full control over where that shit occurs.

63
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,480
It all started because I had to keep the little one locked in here to keep her separate from the big one.

64
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,480
So I would put the dookie box in here and then I realized I should move it out of here because I'm in here.

65
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,480
But then I'm so worried that Amelia will be like, well, I've always stayed here before.

66
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,480
Sorry you didn't have that magic dirt. I'm a cat.

67
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:26,480
As I'm passing those people, it is almost certainly the only time I'm ever going to see them.

68
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
It is intoxicating, right?

69
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,480
The way I think about it is that as soon as I avert my eyes from those people, they're dead.

70
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,480
That's actually how I operate in just everyday life.

71
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,480
When I don't see my friends, they're dead. Whenever I'm not talking to you guys, you're dead.

72
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,480
My world only exists within a six foot circle around me.

73
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:55,480
So when babies start to figure out spatial understanding, you just skip that one.

74
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,480
We tried to play peekaboo with Travis and he just screams. He just screams wildly.

75
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,480
Where are you? What the fuck? Justin!

76
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,480
There was a man. There was a man named Clint.

77
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,480
This sounds like a pretty good Liam Neeson movie.

78
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,480
Exactly.

79
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
Where did you go?

80
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,480
It's taken three and he's playing peekaboo with his daughter.

81
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Return my daughter to me!

82
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,480
I'm just behind this washcloth, Dad.

83
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,480
Dad, I'm behind a washcloth.

84
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,480
I have a particular set of skills.

85
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,480
I'm upstairs. You hear the vacuum cleaner. I'm upstairs.

86
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,480
Please fix your object permanence.

87
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,480
I have a particular set of skills. Object permanence is not one of them.

88
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,480
But I have learned all my shapes.

89
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,480
Let me draw you a circle.

90
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,480
Ten. I have ten fingers, ten toes.

91
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,480
This is like a Muppet Babies version of Taken.

92
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,480
Taken Babies.

93
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,480
Oh, God.

94
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,480
I make pee pee in the potty.

95
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Who's the big boy? You're about to find out.

96
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,480
If you don't return my daughter. Dad, I'm right here!

97
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Just turn around slightly to the side.

98
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,480
You swear you wouldn't do this at my wedding.

99
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,480
I'll lift the veil. Is that what you want? I'll lift it.

100
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Fuck!

101
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,480
Can I cut you guys with a proverb and you let me know if it seems wise to you?

102
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Because in my head right now, it seems really wise.

103
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Throw your wisdom spaghetti against our wall and we'll tell you what's next.

104
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
Let me just see what it says.

105
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
And then we'll say, you wasted that spaghetti. What the fuck?

106
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,480
I'm not saying you're going to want to cross-stitch this on something.

107
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
But I think there's a nugget of truth there.

108
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,480
The man who sleeps with a machete is a fool every night but one.

109
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
Think about that for a second.

110
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,480
You know what? I am going to get that stitched onto a pillow.

111
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Or your arm or something. Just stitch it, I feel like.

112
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,480
I don't want to get too deep here, but I would also say that every morning when you wake up, you're forced to survive.

113
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,480
Wow. Damn it.

114
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,480
Can I try? Can I try?

115
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
Yeah.

116
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,480
The world is a little bit brighter when you carry a smile for a flashlight. God damn it.

117
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
Can I try again?

118
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,480
Let me hit you with another one.

119
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
Okay.

120
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Okay.

121
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
Life is like a box of chocolate.

122
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,480
Get out. We were doing so good. We were doing so good.

123
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
Wait. Okay. How about this one?

124
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,480
Okay.

125
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,480
The man who sleeps with a machete is a cut above the rest.

126
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
That wasn't a proverb. It's like a pun.

127
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,480
I think it was.

128
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:41,480
That sounds like the sign you put outside of your machete store.

129
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,480
Well, okay. To be fair, my machete store, a cut above, is thriving. Thank you very much.

130
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,480
It leads me to a question I've always wondered, which is, if you got someone strong enough,

131
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:59,480
and they, whilst hugging someone, grab both of their buttcheeks and pull the part really hard, could you rip someone in half?

132
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Because I feel like the butt crack is like that little slit that they make in packages that allow you to open it easily.

133
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,480
And it's like God's way of saying, rip this person in two.

134
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,480
It's your Achilles heel, except it's your asshole.

135
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Have you never wondered that, you guys?

136
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,480
You've never wondered that? Come on.

137
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Why God perforated us? Is he daring?

138
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,480
You're saying that if you were to tear a human being in half long ways,

139
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,480
that the best place to start would be the buttcheeks because it's natural handles, and also there's already-

140
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,480
Obviously. I mean, that's a given. That's not my question.

141
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,480
My question is, I don't know if anyone's ever tried it before, but would it be a clean break?

142
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
Could you do it in two?

143
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,480
I don't think that anyone- I don't even think Hulk Hogan and his prime could do that.

144
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Maybe the power team could. Maybe the blessing of God's will.

145
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,480
I just thought about it, and I watched the Hulk Hogan sex tape, and he actually did do that. I take it back.

146
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Brother, are you ready for my special move, brother?

147
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,480
Here it comes.

148
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,480
I'd rather not!

149
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:09,480
Hulkamania is about to run wild all over your butt and your vagina.

150
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,480
I'm gonna tear your butt and vagina in half, brother.

151
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,480
Then there was a 48-hour manhunt.

152
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,480
Only one man could leave tracks like this.

153
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,480
It's just Hulk Hogan running naked through the woods.

154
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Somebody call Tommy Lee Jones!

155
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,480
I didn't destroy that butt, Hulk Hogan, sir.

156
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
I'm pretty sure you did.

157
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
We actually have a sex tape of you doing it.

158
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,480
I'm Hulk Hogan destroying this butt.

159
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,480
You have butt blood all over your hands.

160
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,480
Sir, Andre the Giant is dead. There's nobody else.

161
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,480
Have you guys seen that Hulk Hogan Andre the Giant sex tape?

162
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,480
Oh my God.

163
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,480
Both of them in a test for dominance trying to tear the other one's butt.

164
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,480
It's like the opening scene in Melancholia where the two planets collide.

165
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,480
That's basically what we're talking about.

166
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,480
It's like the last scene in Over the Top.

167
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:16,480
Except it's under the bottom.

168
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Oh man.

169
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Can we be done?

170
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,480
Hulk Hogan, it feels so good.

171
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:31,480
I didn't think I would like the way it feels inside, but I do in fact like the way it feels.

172
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,480
I'm gonna call me new Hulk Hogan!

173
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,480
What the hell is that impression?

174
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,480
That's what Andre the Giant sounds like mid-coitus, of course.

175
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Because it sounds like the baby of Andre the Giant Sylvester Stallone.

176
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,480
If you tear my butt in half, then I do not think I will laugh.

177
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Anybody want a penis?

178
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Hulk Hogan, perhaps you?

179
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Should we make a bet?

180
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:10,480
I have four gallons of what in my room?

181
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,480
I have a bag of 30 hamburgers.

182
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:23,480
I have that giant armchair Gallagher used to use.

183
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,480
I have a bicycle built for two.

184
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,480
It is just mine.

185
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,480
I'm gonna snap into some butt cheeks.

186
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
What are you doing?

187
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
Get out of here.

188
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Randy, watch me.

189
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Nobody wants you here.

190
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Nobody wants to tear your butt in half.

191
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
We're getting tender.

192
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
Get out of here.

193
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,480
Oh yeah, I have a lance.

194
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,480
Tear my butt in half.

195
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,480
Get out of here, Randy.

196
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
Please.

197
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
Randy, please.

198
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
Unless.

199
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Unless.

200
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:59,480
She's trying to set you up as like, can't fuck this.

201
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
You know what I mean?

202
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,480
Oh, she's putting her on a pedestal preemptively.

203
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,480
This is what I'm saying.

204
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,480
It's not what I'm saying though, because it's the dumbest.

205
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
No, say it.

206
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
Get it out there.

207
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,480
If you say that this person doesn't have sexual, then the person, if the person is the right

208
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,480
kind of person, or by which I mean the wrongest person ever, they might say, well, I can get

209
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
some sexual in there.

210
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
I bet.

211
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
Let me see.

212
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
I bet I can.

213
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Let me.

214
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
You haven't seen what I do in there.

215
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Let me find out.

216
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
Up and around it.

217
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
Let me find out.

218
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
Maybe you're just Dansexual.

219
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
Hold on.

220
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,480
Let Dan find out what's going on in there.

221
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Maybe this whole time you've been Dansexual.

222
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,480
Might I suggest Dan?

223
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,480
Hey, don't be Danphobic.

224
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
This is...

225
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Let me break you off some Dan.

226
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
Just real quick.

227
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,480
Just the taste of the flavor.

228
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,480
You know what they say.

229
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:03,480
Once you go Dan, hey, did you try the flan?

230
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Because Dan makes flan for you after he makes love to you.

231
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Dan's the flan man.

232
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
Don't even worry about it.

233
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,480
That's basically Dan's calling card.

234
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,480
If you smell flan, you know Dan's been fucking.

235
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
Do you want to fuck Dan and eat some flan?

236
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,480
Oh, what's that?

237
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,480
You don't like flan?

238
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,480
I understand.

239
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,480
The weirdest Dr. Seuss book ever.

240
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,480
Dan the man with the flan plan.

241
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,480
Fucking.

242
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,480
Dan's about two things.

243
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,480
Fucking and eating flan.

244
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,480
On his deathbed.

245
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
And we're all out of flan.

246
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,480
On his deathbed, Dr. Seuss handed that book to his publisher.

247
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,480
Dr. Seuss is like, listen, I know I told you that I didn't have any more books.

248
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,480
I said I was out the game, but wait till you hear my new shit.

249
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,480
I know I've been battling with mild dementia, but I believe this is my magnum opus.

250
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,480
That bitch is fine.

251
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
Let me know what you think.

252
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
It's like that scene in Proof.

253
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
It's from the notebook.

254
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,480
This is just pictures of a guy fucking some flan.

255
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,480
He had so many characters, Dan the flan fucking man.

256
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
What do you think?

257
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,480
What do you think, Seuss Incorporated?

258
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,480
Can I get another hit?

259
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
No.

260
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,480
We are already building the ride at Universal.

261
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:23,480
We're gonna have to edit this more than the original story for Hop on Pop.

262
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
You're on fire today.

263
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,480
I know.

264
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,480
Absolutely.

265
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,480
Just keep passing him the rock.

266
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,480
I think the in memoriam was kind of lame this year.

267
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,480
You guys think so?

268
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
I don't know who died.

269
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
Not a lot of like good people died.

270
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,480
A lot of beast rangers.

271
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
A lot of beast rangers.

272
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
A lot of cinematographers.

273
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
A lot of, you know.

274
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,480
Can we all just agree to make a commitment to have more awesome people die this year?

275
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Can we get some good people to die this year?

276
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Listen, I'm not saying anything wink nudge, but I'm just saying I'd like a really blockbuster in memoriam this year.

277
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,480
We could talk to them about adding people that haven't died yet.

278
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,480
How fucking crazy would that be?

279
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,480
Fucking Mickey Rourke up on the screen like in the audience.

280
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,480
And then cut to Mickey Rourke going, what? No.

281
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
No, I'm here.

282
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
Can't you see me?

283
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,480
Can't anyone see me?

284
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,480
The whole night's about trying to convince Mickey Rourke that he's a ghost.

285
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,480
I'd watch those Oscars.

286
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,480
They're happening to me.

287
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,480
And then like the only person that can see him is Bruce Willis and he just shits his pants.

288
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,480
By the end of the night, James Cameron's like, thank you for this Oscar for Avatar 2.

289
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,480
And he's jumping up and down behind him, waving his hands.

290
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Can't you see me?

291
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,480
Please, someone, if you can see me, call.

292
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,480
Call somebody.

293
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
I'm not ready to go.

294
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,480
I'm not ready to go yet.

295
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,480
I have so much left to do.

296
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,480
At least turn me into a snowman like in Jack Frost.

297
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,480
I need to tell my son I love him.

298
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,480
Like the documentary Jack Frost that I saw.

299
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,480
Please, if anyone knows a voodoo priestess, please.

300
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,480
I promise to be a good Jack Frost, not like the killer kind, the killer one Jack Frost movie.

301
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Snowman killer, good snowman.

302
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:27,480
Hey, folks, thanks for listening to our best of episodes.

303
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,480
It's been a few years since we've done one of these, but we weren't able to record last week.

304
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:42,480
So we hope you're enjoying the golden days back when we all had the loudest air conditioners in existence.

305
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:50,480
I'm guessing that air conditioner technology was not quite as advanced as it is now with our whisper quiet, you know, super coolers and stuff.

306
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
But anyway, I'm not here to complain about audio quality.

307
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
I am.

308
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
A little bit.

309
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
I'm also here to tell you about our sponsors this week.

310
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
Like Away.

311
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,480
Everything is super shitty right now, but you know what's not shitty?

312
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:16,480
Away's line of rugged and powerful and sleek stylish suitcases and rollaways and bags and other jams like that.

313
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,480
It says here, Away has asked me to speak about travel that I'm excited about in the future.

314
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,480
To which I would reply, any travel, all travel.

315
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:41,480
I have obviously not not doing a lot of flying these days, but sometimes I'll pack up my Away suitcase and carry it up the stairs and take it into the upstairs bathroom.

316
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:48,480
And I don't need a lot of stuff while I'm in there, but it just feels good to do a make believe pretend voyage.

317
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:58,480
But they offer a wide array of suitcases and other stuff made from a variety of different materials like polycarbonate, aluminum and durable nylon.

318
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
And do they have many colors and sizes?

319
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Yes, they do.

320
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
I have a big sort of gray one.

321
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,480
I have a sort of medium sized green one.

322
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Together they they fill all my family's needs.

323
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
Do they have four 360 degree spinner wheels?

324
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
Yes.

325
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Do those help it roll very smoothly?

326
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
Yes, of course they do.

327
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:25,480
You can shop Away's selection of suitcases and bags at awaytravel.com slash my brother and give someone something to look forward to this holiday season.

328
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,480
That's awaytravel.com slash my brother.

329
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,480
Hey, with the holidays coming up, you know what everybody could probably use a nice pair of?

330
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Not mittens.

331
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
Throw your mittens in the fucking toilet.

332
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,480
I'm talking about Raycon earbuds.

333
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,480
These little doodads are comfy and cozy.

334
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
They plop right into your ear.

335
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
They got a great sound.

336
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,480
It's got a deep, deep, rich bassy tones.

337
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:55,480
It's got anything that you could ask for to get a pleasant sort of sonorous experience.

338
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,480
They have seamless Bluetooth pairing and a comfortable noise isolating fit.

339
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
And you can start listening to them right out of the box.

340
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,480
There's no, you know, BS setup process.

341
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,480
You just plop them in and you can keep listening for hours.

342
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,480
You can use them for calls or music or work or play or at home or on the go.

343
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,480
It's the gift that keeps on giving.

344
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,480
And it's a great gift this holiday season because it's something someone's going to use.

345
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,480
Who wants it?

346
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,480
Don't give them that doily.

347
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,480
Oh, no one wants that candle.

348
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,480
They want Raycon earbuds.

349
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,480
And also, the best part, they're not wicked super expensive like other wireless earbuds.

350
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,480
On top of Raycon's everyday great prices, they're offering our listeners 15% off right now.

Enjoy the rest of the episode.

355
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
Bye.

356
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,480
Video games.

357
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
Video games.

358
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,480
Video games.

359
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
You like them?

360
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
Maybe you wish you had more time for them.

361
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
Maybe you want to know the best ones to play.

362
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,480
Maybe you want to know what happens to Mario when he dies.

363
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
In that case, you should check out TripleClick.

364
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,480
It's a podcast about video games.

365
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
A podcast about video games?

366
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
But I don't have time for that.

367
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,480
Sure you do.

368
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,480
Once a week, kick back as three video game experts give you everything from critical

369
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
takes on the hottest new releases.

370
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,480
To scoops, interviews, and explanations about how video games work.

371
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,480
To fascinating and sometimes weird stories about the games we love.

372
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,480
TripleClick is hosted by me, Kirk Hamilton.

373
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,480
Me, Jason Schreier.

374
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
And me, Maddie Myers.

375
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,480
You can find TripleClick wherever you get your podcasts and listen at MaximumFun.org.

376
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Bye.

377
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Can we just stop it?

378
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
It's really fucking silly.

379
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,480
Like completely made up bullshit?

380
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Stop it?

381
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Is that what you mean?

382
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,480
It really rams home the fact that time itself and our measurement of it is absolute horseshit.

383
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
Not just time, right?

384
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
All measurements.

385
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,480
All measurements are made up.

386
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:07,480
It's money fucking, it's a, you know, oh man, the man, right?

387
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,480
Like business and politics and like Wall Street's not looking out for me.

388
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,480
And my bank?

389
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
No thank you.

390
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
My bank.

391
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
I don't want it.

392
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
You know what I'm talking about?

393
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Like savings and loans.

394
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
Yeah, right.

395
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,480
Exactly.

396
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,480
The government man.

397
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,480
I don't know what's going on.

398
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,480
The government man is taking your time away and he eats it.

399
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
Is this Obama's fault?

400
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,480
Is Obama hoarding my time?

401
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,480
Do you know where that hour you lose goes?

402
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Where?

403
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
It goes straight to the 1%.

404
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,480
And they go out on a yacht and they spend all the poor people time.

405
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,480
That's like that Justin Timberlake movie where they have the time in their arm and when it

406
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
runs out they die.

407
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
Where they keep looking at their watches.

408
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
Uh-huh.

409
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,480
And then Justin Timberlake is like, I'm going to instill a change in this unfair world.

410
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,480
And he does it with the power of his song and dance.

411
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,480
No, you haven't seen it have you?

412
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
I did not see the film.

413
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
Did not what?

414
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,480
It's called Time to Sing and Dance.

415
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Can we not kickstart a horse?

416
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
Guys.

417
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
Are you saying that?

418
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
Guys.

419
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
No.

420
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
Guys.

421
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
We've talked about revving up the engine.

422
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,480
We've got to get out of here.

423
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,480
And that's the sound of it idling.

424
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
Jon Bon Jovi.

425
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,480
I'm not making a shitty metaphor between a horse and a motorcycle.

426
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
What I'm saying to you is.

427
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Wait, he wasn't riding an actual steel horse?

428
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
Oh my God.

429
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,480
That would make it the fucking best song.

430
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,480
On my cybernetic horse.

431
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,480
I ride the wastelands of my katana.

432
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,480
With my vibra sword.

433
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:52,480
And my emerald visor.

434
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,480
I smoke a pack of nano stems.

435
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Oh my God.

436
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
I love that.

437
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
Oh Jon.

438
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
Somebody write that baby.

439
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,480
I've seen a million faces.

440
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,480
And I process them for fuel for my metal horse.

441
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
I'm a cowboy.

442
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,480
I sell water at a great profit.

443
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,480
The land is not a myth.

444
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
This Yahoo was sent in by two different people.

445
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
One of whom was Jacob Blocker.

446
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,480
One of whom was Jack Howard.

447
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
I don't know how it happened.

448
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
It's a mystical occurrence.

449
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
Are they working together?

450
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,480
I think that they fucking work together.

451
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,480
Except they were sent like days apart.

452
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
So they probably found it together.

453
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
And then Jack was like.

454
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
Yeah, let's wait until Tuesday to send this in.

455
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,480
And then he fucking got the jump on it on Saturday.

456
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Anyway, thank you both.

457
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,480
It's by Yahoo Institute's user, Manuel, who asks.

458
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Is it okay to eat in the bathroom at McDonald's?

459
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Hi.

460
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
Hello.

461
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
How are you?

462
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
Whenever I go to McDonald's, I always eat in the bathroom.

463
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,480
I've been doing this for five years now without a problem.

464
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,480
I think that saying without a problem is very generous.

465
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,480
Well, yeah, let's break that term down.

466
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,480
Like the fucking McDonald's bouncer is not going to kick the door and be like.

467
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
I've been following your trail for five years.

468
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,480
It goes straight from the fucking cash register to the bathroom.

469
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,480
So it was not a very difficult trail to follow.

470
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
You've got to think, though, that if he's been going to the same McDonald's.

471
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,480
That the cashiers are starting to talk.

472
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,480
Oh, I hope he's not going to the same.

473
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,480
I hope nobody's going to the same McDonald's.

474
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,480
Except for that dude in Super Size Me.

475
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
Oh, new guy.

476
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Don't worry.

477
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
That's just Bathroom Steve.

478
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
He's in Super Size Me.

479
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,480
He's like, I ate five thousand Big Macs.

480
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
I eat six a day.

481
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,480
And it's like, that's great.

482
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
But like, can you do them at different McDonald's?

483
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,480
So they're not like, oh, here comes Big Mac Mac.

484
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Because his name's Mac.

485
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,480
His name is also Mac.

486
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,480
His name is also Mac.

487
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,480
Can you?

488
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
And it's like, why wouldn't you just call him Big Mac?

489
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
If that's the case.

490
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
Can you imagine?

491
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Because he was actually very thin, if I remember correctly.

492
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
He was a thin man.

493
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
You're on a road trip.

494
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
You park.

495
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
You pull into a McDonald's.

496
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
You run.

497
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,480
You make a rush for the bathroom.

498
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,480
You're promising yourself that you'll go back and buy a Hi-C or something.

499
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
You go to the bathroom.

500
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
You open the stall door.

501
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,480
And there's just this guy hunched over jamming chicken strips into his mouth.

502
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
Occupied.

503
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Occupied.

504
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Occupado, my good man.

505
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
Occupado flavor.

506
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,480
Is he voiding, though, while he eats, is the question.

507
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,480
I should hope not.

508
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
Is this?

509
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,480
Have we ever told a corncob story?

510
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,480
I feel like we have to have told a corncob story.

511
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,480
Because it's the best thing that's ever happened.

512
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,480
To my knowledge, we have not.

513
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,480
The perfect diagram of efficiency that is the corncob story.

514
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,480
The corncob story is we were at a trailer park.

515
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
Trailer park campground.

516
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,480
We were staying there with our cousins or uncles.

517
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
I think it was Tim and Tom, right?

518
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,480
So we were staying there.

519
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
And we were walking the grounds.

520
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Seeing the sights.

521
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
Checking out.

522
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Scoping some whinnies.

523
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,480
And we went to the bathroom.

524
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,480
And it was one of those deplorable kinds of bathrooms with no doors on the stalls.

525
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
So like those technically aren't even.

526
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
Which are not bathrooms.

527
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
In my opinion, they're not bathrooms.

528
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
They're not bathrooms.

529
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,480
They're risky water fountains, as far as I'm concerned.

530
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
They're little public jails.

531
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,480
And we walked in.

532
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,480
And I was walking, you know, just checking to see if maybe one of these fucking stalls had a door on it.

533
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
Because it's 1999.

534
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,480
And we're living in a civilized goddamn world.

535
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,480
Walked by one stall.

536
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,480
And I didn't look long.

537
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,480
Because it's like I guess a crime.

538
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,480
But there was a little kid.

539
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,480
And he's sitting there taking a poop.

540
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:55,480
And while he was taking a poop, he was also eating some corn on the cob.

541
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,480
He was eating his corn on the cob while voiding.

542
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,480
And I walked out and made a hand gesture.

543
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
I forget who was with me.

544
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,480
I made a hand gesture like a fucking SWAT team.

545
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,480
Like I can't talk.

546
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,480
I'm about to lose my fucking mind laughing.

547
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,480
You need to go walk eight feet in that direction.

548
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
And look westward.

549
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,480
Turn your eyes westward towards Corncob Boy.

550
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,480
And then we'll talk.

551
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,480
I did a little loop with my finger to say we will do some recon later on this.

552
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,480
We will get together and discuss it in a group.

553
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,480
Not now though.

554
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,480
Not now.

555
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
Not now.

556
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,480
I need your total silence.

557
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,480
I need you to walk there.

558
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,480
I need it to be very clear that I did not say hey go check out this kid with no pants on.

559
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
You have to keep it totally cash.

560
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
You gotta keep it cash.

561
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Turn.

562
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
Oh.

563
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
Excuse me.

564
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
Say like excuse me.

565
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,480
Or how's that corn?

566
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Pretty good I bet.

567
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,480
Since you couldn't fucking tear yourself away from it.

568
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,480
Couldn't leave it on the picnic table.

569
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,480
Go void.

570
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,480
Go evacuate and then return to your biz.

571
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,480
There was a moment in this kid's life where he was eating corn.

572
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,480
Realized he needed to use the bathroom and thought well I can't leave this here.

573
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
I get it.

574
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
I mean he buttered it.

575
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,480
And once you butter it it's like that's your day.

576
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Yeah.

577
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
That's your day until it's done.

578
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,480
That's your day.

579
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Have you ever thought about it from this kid's point of view?

580
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,480
That maybe like Griffin's acknowledgement of him and like just the look on Griffin's face.

581
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Changed this kid's life.

582
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
Turned his life around.

583
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,480
He grew up Steve Jobs.

584
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,480
He grew up super fast.

585
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,480
He grew up Steve Jobs.

586
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,480
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Reed.

587
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,480
Thank you Reed.

588
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:46,480
It's by Yahoo Answers user Miomi who asks well I quitted karate is that a good decision?

589
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,480
Trainings are hard my bro told me to quit.

590
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,480
Oh Jesus.

591
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,480
Trainings are hard.

592
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,480
My bro told me to quit because I didn't want to attend karate so I quitted.

593
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
My parents don't.

594
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,480
Hey did you.

595
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,480
Were you found guilty for karate?

596
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,480
No I was acquitted.

597
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,480
My parents don't want me to quit because they wanted me to protect myself when I grow older.

598
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,480
So is it a good or bad decision to quit?

599
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:18,480
Do you guys know anybody who did karate coming up?

600
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
Yes I do.

601
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
I knew one.

602
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,480
Chris Sizemore.

603
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,480
Derek Moore.

604
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:29,480
But like here's the thing I feel like there was a mythos around karate or all forms of

605
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,480
kung fu and there still is which is I'm learning it for self-defense.

606
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,480
I don't think that situation has ever unfolded organically in the history of pugilism.

607
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:49,480
I think that somebody who has dedicated 20 years of their life to mastering kung fu and

608
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,480
they get in one bar fight they in that bar fight in that moment that primal moment of

609
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,480
punch they do not go what did my sensei teach me.

610
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,480
See I disagree because I think in the moment of punch it probably comes up but like in

611
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,480
the dark alley where dude like pulls a gun you're probably not thinking like I'm

612
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
gonna cry.

613
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,480
Well no because you're not gonna fucking like throw a ball of chi at him like that's

614
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,480
obviously not gonna work.

615
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,480
Oh have you guys seen that thing though?

616
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
We totally do that.

617
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,480
But when you're careening towards that drunk truck driver you're not gonna kung fu his

618
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,480
car out of the way Travis.

619
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,480
When this when the fucking sun explodes and we experience the heat death of the universe

620
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,480
you're not gonna fucking kick your way out of that one.

621
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Can I tell you the funny thing is though as soon as someone says like self-defense I'm

622
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,480
taking it for self-defense that is what I picture like fighting off.

623
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,480
I'm 95 years old and this coronary is about to get me but let me just chop it.

624
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
Done.

625
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Fixed it.

626
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,480
Got it with a chop.

627
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,480
90 years of kung fu paid off.

628
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:54,480
People say they do it to defend themselves and if you really pound that math out it

629
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,480
is a bad investment no matter which way it breaks.

630
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
Inconceivable.

631
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:05,480
In this situation in this situation that you're that you're envisioning you're in mano

632
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:12,480
a mano combat hand-to-hand no weapons allowed because make no mistake my friend if you

633
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,480
have karate and he has insert sharp thing here you lose.

634
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
You lose.

635
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,480
It's over you get stabbed.

636
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,480
That's why that's why fucking knives and swords and guns were invented is because

637
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,480
people like this fuckhole on yahoo is like karate is too hard I wish there was a substitute.

638
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,480
Oh you're telling me this knife is worth a hundred billion years of karate okay I'll

639
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
just take that then it's way easier.

640
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,480
I uh I think that the the the the the big problem with with karate is I don't have an

641
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:50,480
end of the sentence.

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,480
the Terminator with Robin Williams robotic character from Bicentennial Man oh this is

662
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:09,480
gonna be so much fun okay so Bicentennial Man as portrayed by Robin Williams travels

663
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:16,480
is in a war in our future is in a war with humanity okay robots versus humans right does

664
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,480
he have his skin and stuff yet or is he still like the creepy servo at this point he has

665
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,480
skin okay so we're close to the end of the movie we're close to the end of the movie

666
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,480
it's in our future but he's about to go to the beginning of the movie which is our past

667
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,480
so back when he didn't have when he had just when he was just metal John Connor is leading

668
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:41,480
humanity's revolt against robots this is the baby like the baby is doing this yes yes

669
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:47,480
a baby from inside the womb fully grown John Connor is humanity's revolt against the robots

670
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,480
okay so the robots like this is going bad I don't think we're gonna win this one and

671
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:57,480
they're like well bullshit first off well this is the thing the robots never give up

672
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,480
okay here's the thing I don't see the robot sitting around a table like listen guys we're

673
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:07,480
blowing it listen guys I put a lot of thought into this and we had a good run in my guy

674
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:13,480
this is what happens so listen so they make a bunch of robots that look like Arnold Schwarzenegger

675
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:21,480
and now Arnold Schwarzenegger is it is a t800 but he's the 101 model so like his series

676
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:27,480
is like his robotic abilities and that 101 refers to like his flesh covering which all

677
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,480
look like Arnold Schwarzenegger so they sent him back in the past to kill John Connor's

678
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:40,480
mom which seems harsh it seems harsh t2 Terminator 2 and that's right that's the end of the

679
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,480
movie they send him back and say good luck and the movie is like thanks I'll do what

680
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:56,480
I can't and bum bum bum bum so then okay so then t2 they tried again with a robot made

681
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,480
of liquid but by this point the humans have their own Arnold Schwarzenegger and they sent

682
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:09,480
him back to protect him from that and that's John Connor's dad that's debatable is John

683
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:21,480
Connor's his own dad oh I saw the scene in the original t t1 uh-huh where um Arnold Schwarzenegger

684
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:28,480
goes that woman's door is like are you Sarah Connor and she was like yes let me take out

685
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,480
my chewing gum she was I said are you Sarah Connor yes I am and then he's like oh sorry

686
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:42,480
are you the Sarah Connor that specifically the one that does has a baby and the baby

687
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:49,480
and are you pregnant right now with a baby that just like feels like a like a few apocalyptic

688
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:55,480
leader of men and she's like no that's not I'm like I'm like 60 years old it's clearly

689
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,480
not me and he's like okay I apologize for the mistake have a nice day I love what you

690
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:09,480
I love the tasteful the hedges in your yard they're good while I'm here do you know any

691
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,480
other Sarah Connors that maybe you have like a daughter you're named after yourself did

692
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:21,480
you name a daughter after yourself by the way I have good news about robot Jesus he's

693
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:27,480
a new he's a new Jesus that I'm just gonna leave some pamphlets and a hundred years or

694
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:34,480
so it's really gone as it's just sweep the nation you could get on board super early

695
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,480
with robot Jesus I could I could leave you a few excerpts from the cyber that's a size

696
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:49,480
that's a cyber Bible that robot Jesus wrote for you from the future no okay let's not

697
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:57,480
try I'm gonna go his uh his oil will wash your heart clean if you want that that was

698
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:07,480
a fucking super super good impression we all did if we had a fourth brother he would be

699
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,480
indistinguishable from all sportsmaker because of diminishing returns and statistics you

700
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,480
know a lot of people don't know this but doing a doing an Arnold Schwarzenegger impression

701
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,480
is really easy just lower your voice slightly and mumble and apparently the only hard part

702
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:29,480
is fighting the temptation to say anybody want a peanut definitely it is your same I

703
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:43,480
just have an impression of a big man do you Jesse Ventura Oh hello I'm also a governor

704
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,480
so Griff just side note should we make like a bunch of loud noise so it's easier to find

705
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,480
the edit mark for when you cut out that giant section where we talk about Terminator now

706
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:01,480
do you guys like huge dildos to give me some sort of metric because that could mean like

707
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:08,480
my definition of what a huge dildo is is probably different than what yours is if it looks like

708
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,480
something that the eye of Sauron would appear above like that's the kind of thing I'm talking

709
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:20,480
about like I actually prefer a lot of really small dildos is that better for you and it's

710
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:28,480
just cuter it's fun it's like a couple pins on a desk you know in that one scene in Fantasia

711
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,480
where Mickey Mouse chops up the broom and it becomes a bunch of brooms it's like that

712
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:38,480
but with dildos do they sell that on extreme restraints do they sell do they sell a young

713
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:44,480
man's fancy on extreme restraints can you buy that can I buy my innocence back on I

714
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:51,480
want to tell you guys about one very special dildo to me this is the annihilator X X and

715
00:45:51,480 --> 00:46:00,480
you guessed it X L dildo this thing extra access for excellence this man looks like

716
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:09,480
he is cradling a poodle a black shiny poodle in front of his crotch is 18 inches long Christ

717
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:15,480
nine pounds fuck how do you even how do you fucking operate that you got to have a trusted

718
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:26,480
friend you have to have accomplished for this bill bow or running start either way I guess

719
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,640
yeah I don't really understand let me let me zip on out of the comments and see the

720
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:40,320
comments are all just like no no no no I love how flexible this one is and I love taking

721
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:47,160
it all the way to the base I felt like I would explode now folks when you are leaving a product

722
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,040
review on extremistrace.com it is so important to make sure it doesn't sound like you're

723
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:57,920
bragging and this one seems very braggy to me it's like a backdoor brag I couldn't see

724
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,560
my good though that was my husband many years ago suggested a threesome with his very well

725
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:20,400
endowed best friend my husband's small only six inches long oh so he's still into threesomes

726
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:28,280
I guess and anyway my husband a few years ago bought me this and OMG it's huge and intense

727
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,680
I was lucky I have sex a lot but with a very big cock but this OMG it's on a different

728
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,640
level and so am I I am addicted to feeling stretched Justin is no longer reading review

729
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:45,600
he is just he's just letting his forming thoughts just forming thoughts in his brain and using

730
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:52,200
his mouth to express them I actually love the power move of telling your wife you're

731
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,480
gonna have a threesome with with your well endowed friend your well endowed friend gets

732
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,080
out his wiener and then he turns his back for just a second and that's when you whip

733
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:09,600
out the annihilator XXXL it really kills the appeal of Greg it also kills it also kills

734
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:15,480
the person that it plunges into is there are there any reviews like I am typing this as

735
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:24,080
I'm using it for the first time and am now dead this period I'm hitting the period hitting

736
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:35,200
clicking the send button and dying they said annihilator and XXXL they were not at all

737
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:46,040
joking this is the loved ones we came home David had been shucked like a pistachio but

756
00:50:53,680 --> 00:51:04,600
horse women did you guys say your names because mine's just an orb is a very sexual being

757
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:13,680
I come from the advanced future of 5024 everyone is a geometric shape and everyone loves to

758
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:22,960
party please find me a horse that I will not crush to death and make sure she's down make

759
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:30,000
sure she's down to clown with a sex ball because orb is also only about consensual

760
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:37,800
sex do people in the pokemon universe eat pokemon pokemon seem to be the only animals

761
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,720
around the world created by the show and games do the humans who live there eat pokemon considering

762
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,040
that they can all be caught and trained they obviously have some sort of intelligence so

763
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,880
would eating them be in violation of some sort of ethical code the only way around this

764
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,760
I suppose would be if everyone was vegetarian but I don't see much evidence to support

765
00:51:53,760 --> 00:52:01,720
either side what do you think definitely ooh tricky tricky quandary tricky conundrum it's

766
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,560
hard to catch them all if you keep fucking getting high on your own supply so to speak

767
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:13,640
I feel like okay so practically speaking in the world of pokemon the battling and competition

768
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,320
of pokemon is a huge business I mean it's like the most important thing in their world

769
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:24,120
right yeah I mean it's on it's on tv it's on tv the highest thing you can world celebrities

770
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:30,080
the highest status you can hope to achieve is to be the the you know the master you know

771
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:39,400
what I mean like so the victor I I asked this because it seems like they would be too expensive

772
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:46,480
to eat like anytime you eat one it's like eating a show pony I guess but the supply

773
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,560
and demand is off there because you can just fucking walk in the grass and then there you

774
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:55,240
go yeah nobody's nobody's eating like mew but people are probably eating pidgey left

775
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:03,040
you're saying there's a hierarchy of edible pokemon and you're saying near the bottom

776
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:09,760
of that is a pidgey is a magic carp and then what's the mouse one retata retata but he's

777
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,600
probably in there oh I could go for a retata frittata right now it would be so good yum

778
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,680
yum definitely but you're saying everybody's probably eating slowpoke they're probably

779
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:22,440
eating snorlax because they're like herd animals sure snorlax is not snorlax is actually fairly

780
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:31,680
rare but I I understand what you're saying um god I ate my snorlax what if you just wander

781
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:37,040
up to the campfire and you see someone guiltily eating a snorlax and then you tell them like

782
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:42,160
no he was like really valuable there's like two of those in this whole game but at the

783
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:49,160
same time though you gotta keep in mind there's only one mewtwo you can catch right I bet

784
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:57,000
he is fucking delectable because because of the rarity of it that's the thing only the

785
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,960
super rich can afford to eat mewtwo now that's a tricky one because he's he can speak english

786
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,900
according to the first movie okay that gets weird oh no he speaks the king's english so

787
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:13,000
like that would be that would be uncomfortable unless you only ate just a little bit well

788
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,120
you could do like one leg at a time yeah precisely and then you could still have the pokemon

789
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,800
that would be an interesting twist because like i've reviewed pretty much every game

790
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,080
that has ever come out for that series and you know it's a little stale it needs something

791
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:31,960
to shake up the franchise what if you get your starter pokemon and you just eat it instantly

792
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:37,520
right in front of them right in front which one do i want which one do i want i'll take

793
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:44,480
the grass type let me get a little ranch can i have another one nope ah shit game over

794
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:50,040
into the game if your list of pokemon gets full and you want to catch another one you

795
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:54,720
have to eat it there's no storing it you store it in your belly and you convert it to calorie

796
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,360
energy and it's not just like a pop-up like you've eaten it like you have to actively

797
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:05,920
do it and if you if you press the buttons wrong it goes from like a smooth easy mercy

798
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:11,620
killing to like a botched really horrible experiment i think there needs to be some

799
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:17,160
recognition of the of the food chain of survival in the fittest because let's be honest if

800
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:21,880
you're out in the environment you've got all your pokemon are are knocked out except for

801
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:26,680
one and you fight like a fucking alligator and he kills your last pokemon you're not

802
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:32,880
just gonna fall asleep and wake up in a pokemon center you'll be killed you'll be devoured

803
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,620
ticket chance uh it's finally yahoo answer is hidden by ira ray thank you ira it's by
