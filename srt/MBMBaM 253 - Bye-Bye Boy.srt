1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,600
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me 2.0.

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,840
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,040
I'm Chaz and I've got a bone to pick with you because I'm a dog and dogs love bones.

8
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:05,600
What were we thinking? What were we thinking? So, just to do a progress report.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,800
We have made a significant investment. For My Brother, My Brother and Me 2.0, we redid the

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:20,800
studio. We did a huge, huge media blast. Huge media blast. Huge marketing push. Maybe you saw

11
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:27,440
us in Jurassic World, the trailer. I think the biggest change, the biggest sacrifice

12
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,880
that all, between all three of us, is that I had to go in and change the Twitter icon

13
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,440
for My Brother, My Brother and Me. That was probably the biggest change that any of us did.

14
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,800
Yeah, I mean, I was asleep during my dog body transformation where I got

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,680
surgically turned into a dog. So, like, I didn't really feel it, you know?

16
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,960
Well, I've had to spend a lot of time cleaning up after Griffin. Does that,

17
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,040
does that count as a sacrifice? I mean, I do it out of love.

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,360
Travis, give us the skinny on just how explosive the growth of My Brother, My Brother and Me 2.0 has

19
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:09,520
been. Well, we've seen about a 0.00003% increase. So, that's like, so that's just one?

20
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,640
Yeah, it was one guy. One guy?

21
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,040
One guy who was, he was really into the Powerade stuff at first, and then he was like,

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,040
okay, I get it. And then we kept doing it. And I was, I was sitting with him while he was listening

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,320
to it. And he got turned off about halfway through. I should mention, I was going over

24
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,840
our Powerade contract. I've got it here, hold on.

25
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:46,720
Okay, if you turn to index J, and then codex B, and then indices 13 through 6,

26
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,600
and it goes backwards, you'll actually see that they aren't paying us.

27
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,560
There is no money involved.

28
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,000
We read through the contract, and like the exclusivity, we looked at exclusivity,

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,200
like, yes, yes, yes. They're like, you don't have to mention the forbidden flavors. We're like,

30
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,440
good, because we wouldn't peddle that to our listeners.

31
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,760
Yeah, no long pork flavor. We don't talk about the long pork flavor.

32
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,720
Right, but what we didn't do was look over the contract for an index or a codex that mentions

33
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:20,560
restitution. Well, I just, I just like signed a lease on a sports car that's branded with

34
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,440
like Powerade down the side and on the hood. Yeah, and they're not, no, that's not, you're

35
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,560
paying for that. Yeah, they're actually taking money out of our pockets. So why,

36
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,160
God, did we sign on for a three-year deal? We have a three-year deal with Powerade,

37
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,880
and they're getting us coming and going. Yeah, so I don't think we can abandon My Brother,

38
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,880
My Brother, and Me 2.0. We are legally into this, legally speaking.

39
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,240
So welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me 2.0.

40
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,840
Boys in the house, get it?

41
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,680
Sorry, sorry, sorry, let's do it right. Powerade presents My Brother, My Brother,

42
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,400
and Me 2.0. A Powerade experience.

43
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,760
A Powerade experience. Ride the lightning.

44
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,760
I have to, I have to read this bit they have here. Make sure,

45
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:13,200
make sure to listen to the show on your Barnes and Noble Nook to get special enhanced media

46
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:23,920
cross-play features like a Catch the Chazz minigame and also complimentary coupons for

47
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,240
Powerade. Just an important question. Yeah. Does Powerade make the Nook?

48
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,000
Get yourself electrolyte blasted and then maybe dig into crime and police.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,320
Then maybe dig into crime and punishment.

50
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,960
They have a co-sponsorship deal. It's a transmedia.

51
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,760
It makes complete sense when you think about it.

52
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,120
It does. There's a, there's no overlap there so that it can be.

53
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,440
All right, let's just get on with the fucking show.

54
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,760
Let's just do the show and maybe focus on our core competencies and just,

55
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,920
I need some, some level of distraction.

56
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,160
There will be some wet stunts.

57
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Yeah, I'm fine with the wet stunts. We're just not getting paid fucking anything for it.

58
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,160
This, this, this podcast was an important revenue stream for me.

59
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,200
Well done, worth it.

60
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,240
No, because I spent $300,000 on this inflatable obstacle course.

61
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,600
Justin bought-

62
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,280
No one told you to do that, Justin.

63
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,680
Justin bought the wipeout obstacle course because he said,

64
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,880
quote, I want to get really good at the wipeout obstacle course.

65
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,320
And he spent $200,000 on the blob from the movie Heavyweights.

66
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
Once again, no one told you to do, Justin.

67
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,480
Yeah. Also not worth $200,000.

68
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,680
Like maybe-

69
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,720
Well, that's debatable.

70
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,200
Maybe six-

71
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,000
It's a piece of history.

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,080
Okay. Let's, uh, let's get on it.

73
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,320
Uh, my husband has a-

74
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,040
Wait, on the blob?

75
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,120
Yeah, oh yeah, sorry. All, all episodes of the podcast will now be recorded on the blob.

76
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,800
My husband has a terrible habit of removing his socks.

77
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,240
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, whee!

78
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,120
That was me on the blob.

79
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,280
Sorry, I jumped on and flipped Griffin into the lake.

80
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,760
It's full of Powerade.

81
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,200
The worst part is if he's in the living room, the mosquitoes are terrible.

82
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,920
It's a stagnant lake of Powerade.

83
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,640
I couldn't hear the question because I was flying through the air away from you.

84
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,880
Don't interrupt me!

85
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,280
And don't make any more wipeout specific references, I won't get them.

86
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,560
My brother has a terrible habit of removing his socks all over the house.

87
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,040
The worst part is if he's in the living room, he stuffs them between the couch cushions.

88
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,120
Do you do weird things like this to annoy your wives?

89
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,080
Oh, that annoy your wives, not specifically intended to annoy your wives.

90
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,440
Oh, that was a way different-

91
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,240
And what have they done to cope or get you to stop?

92
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,000
And that's from Help Brothers.

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Please tell me how to restore my wedded bliss.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
This is from House of Socks in Houston.

95
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,040
I don't think I have anything, you know?

96
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,400
I'm pretty much...

97
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,480
No, I do this.

98
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,560
So this one I have.

99
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,920
Okay, is this a universal thing?

100
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,520
Oh, I do this.

101
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
I take myself off everywhere.

102
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,080
It is weird how like in your day to day, no matter what you are doing,

103
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,760
getting to that point where you're like, what is with these fucking socks?

104
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,160
Yeah.

105
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,920
Why am I wearing these bad boys?

106
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,960
I gotta get these off.

107
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,200
I will also often only take one off.

108
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,880
And like, it's not like I do that on purpose.

109
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,040
Like I'll take one off and then get distracted by something

110
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,800
and realize like 45 minutes later, I just have one sock on

111
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,880
and I have no idea what the other one is.

112
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,400
I think of it as like being a sock farmer, where come the winter seasons,

113
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,080
I will have a harvest where I'm sitting in the living room with my wife,

114
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,360
watching Orphan Black and I'm like, oh, I've got cold feet.

115
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,880
I don't want to go into the bedroom though, where I keep my socks normally.

116
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,640
I wish I had a secret stash.

117
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,240
And then lo and behold, secret stash is right there waiting for me.

118
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,760
Now they're a little dry.

119
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,720
But you know, in the winter, you got to get the preserved stuff.

120
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,520
You know what I mean?

121
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,680
Maybe you've brined them.

122
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,160
Yeah, it's sock jerky, essentially, is what you're making.

123
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,200
I think everybody has things like this in their life.

124
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,760
I mean, I know I have my own little quirks.

125
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,760
I leave the toilet seat up.

126
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
I make love to men and women other than my wife.

127
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,000
I leave the cabinets open at every turn.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,760
I think that, you know, it's part of the adjustment of living with another person.

129
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,240
Yeah, everyone's got fun stuff.

130
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,080
I just make love too good, you know, and my wife's so annoyed.

131
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,280
She's like, oh, stop making love so good all the time.

132
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,480
Yeah, like I leave glasses of water around the house so much

133
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,560
that I'm basically like the little girl from Signs

134
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,760
and also I've been siphoning funds out of my wife's retirement account

135
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,320
to buy myself crack and then I smoke all the crack.

136
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,200
And then sometimes I like don't do the dishes.

137
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,200
Yeah, it's hard.

138
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,520
That's what marriage is like learning to love the fact

139
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,000
that your husband is gaslighting you slowly.

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,800
You know what I mean?

141
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,720
It's like, yeah, you're going insane,

142
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,240
but maybe it's like you grow old and insane together.

143
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,040
Yeah, the problem with voicing these concerns

144
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,760
are that like if my wife says to me,

145
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,920
hey, fucking with the cabinets, seriously, stop it.

146
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,280
Because mom used to get on us.

147
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,840
Do you remember that?

148
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,000
Like mom would get on our case about this constantly

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
because we would go into the kitchen and leave every cabinet open

150
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,680
and then just walk out.

151
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,360
So like this has been a recurring problem.

152
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,640
And so Sydney will bring this up to me

153
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,520
and I'll like the danger of that is I'll remember to close cabinets

154
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
and expect a fucking medal for it.

155
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,880
Yeah, like, hey, check.

156
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,960
Hey, did you notice any cabinets today?

157
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,280
Do you think anything special in the kitchen?

158
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,760
Did you cook something special for me?

159
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,400
No, I just didn't fuck up as bad as I actually do.

160
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:28,960
Treat please.

161
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,480
I do the socks things constantly.

162
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,000
God, this is so annoying.

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,280
I do, I leave them.

164
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,120
But I usually like, I put the socks in a place

165
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,280
where it could theoretically,

166
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,360
like if you were a severely disturbed person

167
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,200
could be the place where you put socks.

168
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,720
Like I will drape them over the arm of the couch

169
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,880
like, oh no, that was intentional.

170
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,320
This is where I meant to put the socks.

171
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,480
These, it's so they were in eyesight.

172
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,600
So I would get them later.

173
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,160
I would say, oh yeah, these socks.

174
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,920
I do a thing where I take my socks off

175
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,280
after I ride the exercise bike,

176
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,400
which we keep in the living room,

177
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,280
watch our property brothers while I bike

178
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,760
and then just grind it out and try to drop some LBs.

179
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,160
And then I got off the bike and I'm like, sweaty socks,

180
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,760
take them off and throw them on the floor.

181
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,280
And I know that Rachel's like,

182
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,600
I would prefer those not to be there.

183
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,120
But in my mind, it's like,

184
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,040
I just worked out, like I earned this.

185
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,640
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

186
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,680
Please.

187
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,560
Yahoo was sent in by Zoe Kansky.

188
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,160
Thank you, Zoe.

189
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,640
It's by Yahoo.

190
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,360
Climbing that ladder.

191
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,320
Yeah, I almost said,

192
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,400
I almost just like let her rip with a nickname.

193
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,840
Well, her kind of thing is climbing that ladder.

194
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,720
Climbing that ladder.

195
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, but then what if she's on top?

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,960
Then it's, we're being-

197
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,120
Falling off that ladder.

198
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,160
Falling off.

199
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,960
Falling off that ladder,

200
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,800
but grabbing back onto it at the last second.

201
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,160
But now she's about midway down,

202
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,120
got to climb her way back up.

203
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,880
Top of the ladder, about six rungs up.

204
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,520
Okay, wait, quick aside.

205
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,560
I was listening to a clip

206
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,120
that somebody had posted on YouTube

207
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,240
of My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

208
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,000
because I thought it was just called

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,440
My Brother, My Brother, and Me extra bit.

210
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,200
And I thought maybe it was something funny

211
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,920
that I had done.

212
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,520
And I needed to brighten my day a little bit.

213
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,840
So I thought, oh, man, that would feel good.

214
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,640
And I listened to it.

215
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,920
It was just a bit where we were like

216
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,280
calling people's names out at the end

217
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,320
for tweeting about the show.

218
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,760
Do you remember when we used to do this?

219
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,480
This is like episode 150, if I remember correctly.

220
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,840
So over, like basically over two years ago.

221
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,800
And one of the names I thanked for tweeting about us

222
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,240
was Drew Davenport.

223
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,040
That dude has been on the bus for so long,

224
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,560
much longer than I realized.

225
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,640
And he wasn't the Drew Davenport back then.

226
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,840
He had to listen.

227
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,280
He was odd, Drew Davenport.

228
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,600
One of multiple Drew Davenports.

229
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Sorry, Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

230
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,960
Let me get that Yahoo from you.

231
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user Benjamin C, who asks,

232
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,480
is Mountain Dew screwing with my head

233
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,840
and increasing my sex drive?

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,640
Hey, guys.

235
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,360
Smiley face.

236
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,680
OK, so I had my first bottle of Mountain Dew

237
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,280
about five days ago.

238
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,360
Since then, I've been having like one to two

239
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,520
500 milliliter bottles a day.

240
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,720
Just today, my girlfriend said,

241
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,800
I've been acting weird slash different.

242
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,920
I'm only 16, but apparently my sex drive has increased.

243
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
And I've become, quote, cocky.

244
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,200
Cocky means cheeky, saying things that are risky

245
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,560
that I usually wouldn't say.

246
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,520
I think that's what it means anyway.

247
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,120
Thanks, Merriam-Webster.

248
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,960
I think that's what it means anyway.

249
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,280
So do you guys think it's OK to do with the do?

250
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,440
I'm English, by the way.

251
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,160
So the do only just recently arrived.

252
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,520
Man, I love this stuff.

253
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,360
But depending on what you guys think,

254
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
I reckon I'll quit doing the do.

255
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,400
What do you think?

256
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,960
Thanks.

257
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,080
And then just to bookend it, another smiley face.

258
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,080
OK, one, I love anybody who says cocky.

259
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,320
Oh, you probably don't know what that means.

260
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,360
Here's what it means.

261
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,280
Anyway, that's what I think it means.

262
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,240
God, if only there was some way to figure it out for sure.

263
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,320
Griffin, is it possible that this is a Mountain Dew

264
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,320
buzz marketing like British thing where they're like,

265
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
I guess it made me sex too good?

266
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,640
I don't know, you guys.

267
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,680
You should check it out.

268
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,760
I drink like two bottles of it a day.

269
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,280
It just got here to England.

270
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,360
It's this new thing called Mountain Dew

271
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,600
that apparently makes your sex real good.

272
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,720
It's amazing to me.

273
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,920
The amazing thing to me is that this shit's just now

274
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,120
getting over to the aisles, as I call them.

275
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,840
Well, it had to go on the ships.

276
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,320
Yeah, and they got lost.

277
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,760
There's two reasons why I find this wonderful is,

278
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,400
first of all, the fact that it only just arrived,

279
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,680
this venerable brand that I wish we had picked up

280
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,640
instead of Powerade, probably the same company owns them.

281
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,040
Anyway, this means I intimate from this knowledge

282
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,160
that there has been somebody or a group of people

283
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,440
in the aisles that have been just viciously fighting

284
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,280
to keep Mountain Dew off their shores.

285
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,720
Just their scenes of them just like dumping it into a harbor.

286
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,360
Or just like maybe there's some politicking,

287
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,080
some embargoes, trade embargoes going on.

288
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,520
Just to keep this neon power juice out of the-

289
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,280
Mr. Prime Minister, we will not do that dew.

290
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,320
We don't do it.

291
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,160
Except they have a British accent.

292
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,240
The second thing, though, is it makes sense to me

293
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,680
all of a sudden why British people drink so much tea

294
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,720
that's not good.

295
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,760
Like they drink not great tea most of the time.

296
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,120
And it's just because they haven't,

297
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,200
like other better beverages just aren't available yet.

298
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,560
But they're coming around now,

299
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,000
and pretty soon it's gonna be dew in a biscuit, love.

300
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,880
It's 5.30.

301
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,720
It's dew time.

302
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,120
Dew time.

303
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,560
It's dew time, baby.

304
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,520
It's 5.30.

305
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,560
Dew in a biscuit, love.

306
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,680
Well, that trickle down here,

307
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,160
we have to start calling our smallest tablespoons,

308
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,240
will we call them dew spoons?

309
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,440
Dew spoons, yes, exactly.

310
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,200
Three dew spoons of olive oil.

311
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,240
And when you put your balls in another person's mouth,

312
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,440
you're dew bagging them, yes.

313
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,960
That is-

314
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,840
Right wing conservatives will be called dew partiers,

315
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,440
and that sounds amazing to me.

316
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,280
Ooh, I would join that group.

317
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,800
I would join that group in a heartbeat.

318
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,680
I think part of the problem that I'm having

319
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,440
answering this question authoritatively,

320
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,480
which I would love to do,

321
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,920
is that they did not specify

322
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,480
what flavor of Mountain Dew they were drinking.

323
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,400
And as I'm about to fill you guys in on,

324
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,080
there are 69 different flavors of Mountain Dew

325
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,200
they could be in piping.

326
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,760
69.

327
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,760
Yeah, nice.

328
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,640
They have to stop there.

329
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,600
They can never make another-

330
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,240
Or a race is the most extreme number, gentlemen.

331
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,320
We shan't make a new dew.

332
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,920
So I'd like to hit you guys with a few flavors,

333
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,840
and you tell me if they are real or fake.

334
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,480
Ooh, okay.

335
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,960
I like to call dew or no dew.

336
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,280
There is no try.

337
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,880
That's a good name.

338
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,800
No, he's doing a deal or no deal thing.

339
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,520
Oh, I see.

340
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,160
Okay, I got you.

341
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,720
Yeah.

342
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,220
Yeah.

343
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,200
So here's my first one.

344
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,400
Okay.

345
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,160
Mountain Dew, Johnson City Gold.

346
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,120
Don't waste my time.

347
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,960
Okay.

348
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,520
Is that real?

349
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:05,680
No.

350
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,360
No, that's real.

351
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,880
It's a flavor variant with part of a regional dew promotion,

352
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,360
and it's a distinctive malt-flavored soda

353
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,320
from the creators of Mountain Dew.

354
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,600
Oh my God.

355
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,720
Malt-flavored distinct-

356
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,400
It would be distinctive.

357
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,600
It would be an unforgettable experience.

358
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,640
This is just like all those other malt-flavored sodas.

359
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,320
Dewitos.

360
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,040
Mountain Dew Dewitos.

361
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,720
I'm gonna say that's real.

362
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,800
What would you think it is?

363
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,920
Dorito flavored.

364
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,280
Correct.

365
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,920
It is real.

366
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,000
It was tested on college campuses in 2014.

367
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,360
Oh my God.

368
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,760
Mountain Dew Frigid Blast.

369
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,640
No, that's not real.

370
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,760
You stumbled over it.

371
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,560
I made that one up.

372
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:44,720
Yeah.

373
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,080
Mountain Dew Thin Ice Freeze.

374
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,040
That one, yes.

375
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,520
I'm gonna go real.

376
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,600
Maybe like as a Happy Feet promotion.

377
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,520
Dragon fruit, acai, and pomegranate flavors.

378
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,400
Of course.

379
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,200
That's what I want.

380
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,120
Excuse me, sir.

381
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,080
Do you have this on tap?

382
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,640
Mountain Dew Cryptonite Ice.

383
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:06,880
Yeah.

384
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,840
That's real.

385
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,080
For sure.

386
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,960
That's super real.

387
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,920
There is a lot of flavors of Mountain Dew,

388
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,480
and they are not as funny to read as I thought they would be.

389
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:14,800
No, they never are.

390
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,640
Is there one that's like Crystal Dew?

391
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,040
I feel like somebody sent that to us recently.

392
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,680
Yeah, and that's the one that tastes like Crystal Bernard's sweat.

393
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,200
Then the original tagline for that was,

394
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,400
it'll give you wings,

395
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,960
but then fucking Red Bull chomped that flavor.

396
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,120
They had to change it to,

397
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,720
it'll make you watch wings.

398
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,120
It'll make you-

399
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,600
There's one.

400
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,440
Mountain Dew Grape.

401
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,400
No, no, there was Mountain Dew-

402
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,840
Then there's parentheses,

403
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,360
think of better title later.

404
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,120
It is only available in 12 ounce cans

405
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,720
in certain Japanese vending machines.

406
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,520
Bill, will you punch this up later?

407
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,560
Thanks, Tim.

408
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:58,880
Thanks.

409
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,280
Maybe like pre-wine juice blast or something?

410
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,680
I don't know.

411
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,800
I'm thinking maybe like extreme mountain splash.

412
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,280
I don't know.

413
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,240
You'll think of something.

414
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,360
You're a genius.

415
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,560
So this is weird.

416
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,000
One of the Yahoo's I picked out for us to do on this episode

417
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,360
was actually a quiz about monster energy flavors.

418
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,200
And I'm wondering if I should just jettison that

419
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,160
into the archives.

420
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:22,960
No.

421
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,760
You should actually probably do it right now.

422
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,680
Yeah, you should do it right now.

423
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,360
Quiz flip, flipping the quiz.

424
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,880
Quiz flip.

425
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,640
I have some monster energy flavors

426
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,720
based on this Yahoo sent in by Chase Greenlee.

427
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,520
Thank you, Chase.

428
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Asked by Yahoo Answers user invisible,

429
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,320
they're gone, they're dead.

430
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,840
But they asked,

431
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,000
what are all the monster energy flavors?

432
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,040
And Yahoo Answers user also not available.

433
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,480
Man, Yahoo.

434
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,240
You need to get your fucking website right.

435
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,800
Reply with a whole bunch of stuff.

436
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,040
And I'm just going to hit you with some of them

437
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,400
and you tell me if they're real or not.

438
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,360
In a game we like to call do or no do too.

439
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,800
This is my guess.

440
00:18:59,360 --> 00:18:59,600
Yeah.

441
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,920
Frankenberry, boo berry, fruit brute, yummy mummy, chocolate.

442
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,640
No, these are beverages that are drank by DJs

443
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,640
to help them fucking party harder.

444
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,800
How about a monster assault?

445
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,920
Yeah, I think that's real.

446
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,360
Yeah, monster low carb.

447
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,320
Yeah, it's real.

448
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,360
Yeah, that one's real.

449
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,560
Monster mixed.

450
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,840
Real.

451
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,040
No, no, not real.

452
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,840
That's right, Justin.

453
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,400
It's not real.

454
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Now monster mixed with two X's.

455
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,640
Real.

456
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,320
Yeah, that one's on point.

457
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,760
How about monster rehab?

458
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,360
Real.

459
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,720
Yeah, that's a whole chain.

460
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,160
They got tea lemonade and energy flavor,

461
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,880
which I guess now is due to the

462
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,320
I guess now is due lemonade and energy.

463
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,000
It's a delicious cocktail.

464
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
Is it supposed to be like can you have a hangover?

465
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,320
Is that the idea?

466
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,440
It's anti-monster.

467
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,320
It nullifies the monster already coursing through your veins

468
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,680
poisoning you from within.

469
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,080
It's basically liquid silver.

470
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,680
How about monster hitman?

471
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,920
Oh, yes.

472
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,800
Yeah, that's another chain of flavors there.

473
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,920
Monster shots, three fluid ounces of straight party juice.

474
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,920
Monster hitman.

475
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,560
When you only have a short break in between the two records

476
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,080
you're playing as a party DJ.

477
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,960
Right, there's monster hitman regular who and if you drink

478
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,440
that you're an idiot because you should instead jump on

479
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,720
monster hitman lobo and monster hitman sniper.

480
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,440
Monster hitman sniper.

481
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,800
Monster hitman sniper was the name of a product that

482
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,240
monster created and they said we need a name for this

483
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,200
horrible poison shot and someone said monster hitman

484
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,160
sniper and they said you just said three different words

485
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,160
that are sounds scary and of course that's what we're

486
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,880
going to name it.

487
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,400
Happy birthday, Robert.

488
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,440
This is your present.

489
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,840
We're going to go with your bad bad idea that you came up

490
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,120
with at this monster meeting.

491
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,480
Monster hitman sniper sounds like the translated Japanese

492
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,080
title that Die Hard would have.

493
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,200
Yeah, that's what they call it in Japan.

494
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,080
There's some crazy shit up in here.

495
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,160
Expresso, monster, hammer, it's just like we need three words.

496
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,600
How about ex-presso, monster, and hammer?

497
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,160
Yeah, cool.

498
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,880
Why not?

499
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,320
Hey, there's also Italian cafe monster.

500
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,480
There's Vienna monster.

501
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,960
Remember that waiter, Jean-Luc?

502
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,520
And he did that sick kick flip over the table.

503
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,120
Hey, let me hit you with karate chop my lawn chair now.

504
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,200
How about this laser monster sword?

505
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,920
Well, yeah, let's just, yeah, laser monster sword, sure.

506
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,400
And again, as long as we get monster in there,

507
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,360
the other two words just have to sound radical.

508
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,000
Hey, how about jetpack monster monster?

509
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,200
So two monsters?

510
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,040
Yeah, but like the second one's not the brand.

511
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,320
It's like an actual monster.

512
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,200
How about mother of all monsters?

513
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,080
That's pretty good, too.

514
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,240
How about monster monster monster?

515
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,520
I'm currently 17 years old and just got out of high school,

516
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,800
but not by graduating.

517
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,040
That is a cool thing to say.

518
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,960
Hey, wow, why am I not asking this person for advice?

519
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,680
I will be 18 this August when I start looking for a job

520
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,880
and save it for deposit on a place once I turn 18.

521
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,400
I'm just looking for some advice as far as general

522
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,680
how to be an adult advice.

523
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,160
And that's from a boy as dry as a popcorn fart in Atlanta.

524
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,520
This is crazy.

525
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,280
This is a crazy thing you've asked us.

526
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,440
We've made a fucking podcast empire out of drip feeding

527
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,640
these answers to people.

528
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,320
And you want us to just close up shop

529
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,600
and have a going a fire sale on adult advice?

530
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,160
You're partying 24, Sev.

531
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,080
You're the coolest person I've ever met.

532
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,280
How about I ask you how to get her done constantly?

533
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,240
Is that a thing that you ask people?

534
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,920
I don't think that Larry the K-Gry

535
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,200
has ever made it a question how to get her done.

536
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,040
Well, I guess nobody in the audience

537
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,600
has ever been brave enough to ask.

538
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,560
Sorry, sorry, stop the show.

539
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,360
Stop the show.

540
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,640
What do you mean by that?

541
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,120
You know, compadre, you just get her done.

542
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,000
Yeah, you said it.

543
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,360
You can't just keep saying it.

544
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,240
Well, I mean, I can.

545
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,720
I'm legally bound to three times a minute.

546
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,760
No, this is the thing.

547
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,800
What you guys don't know is if somebody asks that question,

548
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,280
Larry the K-Gry is able to remove his hat,

549
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
revert back to the human being he was,

550
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,120
and then the person who asked the question

551
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,520
has to take over as Larry the K-Gry.

552
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,400
When they put the hat on,

553
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,080
they become Larry the K-Gry

554
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,880
until they're able to eventually solve the riddle

555
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,400
of how to get her done.

556
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,960
Or pass the curse along to the next person.

557
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,120
What you just described is a mirror universe version

558
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,120
of the plot of Tooth Fairy,

559
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,440
which Lawrence the Cable Gentleman is also in.

560
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,680
Yeah, well, that's where they got the idea.

561
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,400
For Larry the Cable Guy?

562
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,600
No, Larry the Cable Guy said,

563
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,440
I got an idea for a movie.

564
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,080
It's like this horrible hellscape that I'm trapped in.

565
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,680
What if there's a blue-collar comedian

566
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,160
who was every day his whole existence was a pain scape

567
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,600
from which he never received any relief?

568
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,160
And he missed the days when he was a neurosurgeon

569
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,840
without an accent.

570
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,040
I used to be a patent lawyer in Rhode Island.

571
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,400
I had a wife and kids.

572
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,440
I haven't seen them in 12 painful years.

573
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,000
And I guess what I'm saying is get her done.

574
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,480
Wink, wink, hint, hint, nudge, nudge.

575
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,400
Boy, that sure makes you curious, doesn't it?

576
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,560
You could be 27th in the line of cablemen.

577
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,640
A proud tradition of pain.

578
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,640
I mean, what if at the end of the Santa Claus,

579
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,120
Tim Allen was just freed and he's walking out the door

580
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,640
of Santa Claus HQ at the North Pole

581
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,880
and he's like, oh my God, I'm gonna get out there

582
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,160
and live my life.

583
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,520
I'm finally free of this curse.

584
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,800
And the last scene after the credits as he's leaving

585
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,480
is he summons across Larry the Cable Guy

586
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,960
who just stares at him and is like, get her done.

587
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,840
And Tim Allen, as though driven

588
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,920
by some otherworldly force, asks him,

589
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,200
what do you mean get her done?

590
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
And it's just the cycle begins anew,

591
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,240
except this time he's Larry the Cable Guy.

592
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,880
Oh, so the last shot is just Larry the Cable Guy's face

593
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,120
lighting up.

594
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,960
Exactly.

595
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,720
So adult advice.

596
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,680
I think there's something in there, right?

597
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,320
My number one piece of adult advice is to,

598
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,600
whenever a new scenario, like how to get health insurance,

599
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,760
paying bills, whenever a scenario like that presents itself,

600
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,960
just do it, learn how to do it, educate yourself on it,

601
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,840
rather than trying to dance around it

602
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,240
until eventually at 25 you have to deal with it.

603
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,440
Because if at 18 you can really start to wrap your mind

604
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,440
around all of the minutia of how to day-to-day deal

605
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,320
with adult life, you'll be so far ahead of the curve.

606
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,960
There's stuff I didn't learn how to do

607
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,320
until I was like 23 or 24 that I should have been doing

608
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,720
so far ahead of that.

609
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,000
Is it fucked up to say go back to high school

610
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,120
and just finish it?

611
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,160
You got so close.

612
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,320
You got so close.

613
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,240
I mean, I get it.

614
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,200
I get it, I get it, it's the worst.

615
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,920
But you are so close, it breaks my heart

616
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,640
that you put in 17 of the 18 years

617
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,280
that you gotta do to finish it.

618
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,840
And if you finish it, I feel like it's gonna be

619
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,000
a lot easier for you out there.

620
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,840
At the very least, just take the test for the GED.

621
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,200
Yeah, you can do it.

622
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,400
It's super easy.

623
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,460
It's probably super hard.

624
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,640
I probably couldn't pass the GED test now.

625
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,480
No question.

626
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,300
No question about it.

627
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,140
I would fail that test.

628
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,960
I barely passed my driver's test.

629
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,780
Yeah.

630
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,620
No question.

631
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,280
I drive my little sister Riley from school sometimes

632
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,840
and I ask her, so what'd you learn today?

633
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,720
And she starts describing things that I feel like

634
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,760
my brain is melting.

635
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,840
Like trigamom.

636
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,680
Trig?

637
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,280
Trigam, yeah, I remember that, this is good.

638
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,220
No, I could not process it anymore.

639
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,120
Couldn't handle it.

640
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,520
Especially, you know what I definitely couldn't handle

641
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,520
anymore, why I could not do it, this person's doing it?

642
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,960
I could not handle being in a room for an hour and a half

643
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,120
and also I have to eat lunch at like 10.30

644
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,440
or some crazy time and I have to be in a room

645
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,060
for an hour and a half listening to a person

646
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,480
and I can't just like, well, I'm an adult, bye, walk out.

647
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,940
That power is what guides me through every situation

648
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,780
in my life.

649
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,100
Even if I'm gonna sit and listen to somebody

650
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,480
for an hour and a half, I know I have the power.

651
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,880
To not learn.

652
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,720
To not learn.

653
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,680
To defiantly unlearn things.

654
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,800
To unlearn.

655
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,880
Go back to school.

656
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,280
Go back to school or don't.

657
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,760
Or don't, whatever.

658
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,160
If you're not gonna go back to school, learn a martial art

659
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,240
because if there's one thing I know,

660
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,400
that if you're gonna wander the world,

661
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,840
you'd better be a black belt in some way.

662
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,680
Well, I don't think they're talking about.

663
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,480
Well, here's the thing, you're not gonna be a black belt

664
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,640
in trigonometry or social studies, clearly,

665
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,640
so maybe it's time to learn like Krav Maga or something,

666
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,760
which I don't think has belts, but the point remains.

667
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,840
Here's my advice that may be terrible.

668
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,880
The Travis McElroy story.

669
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,400
The story.

670
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,760
Is this, there are lots of people that like,

671
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,080
whenever you hear a story about someone

672
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,200
that's really successful in like the entertainment industry,

673
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,280
for example, who says like, well, I didn't go to college

674
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,440
and said I just started working and now I'm where I am now.

675
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,540
So my advice is this, either go back to school

676
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,620
and focus on doing school or go into your chosen field

677
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,040
and work your fucking ass off,

678
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,080
because what you don't get to do is neither.

679
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,440
Like you don't get to not finish schooling

680
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,880
and also kick around for four years.

681
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,080
I mean, you do, lots of people do that.

682
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,480
Yes, but very rarely is that the person

683
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,600
that you're reading like the Fortune 500, you know,

684
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,960
like biographies. Just to waste time,

685
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,000
I guess is what Travis is saying.

686
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,840
Exactly.

687
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,680
If you're not gonna be in school, fine,

688
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,040
like that's not for everybody,

689
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,720
but like throw yourself into something.

690
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,840
Like go travel or go like work really hard at a field

691
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,800
and get really good at it.

692
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,640
Do something.

693
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,520
Like if you're not gonna do the school thing,

694
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,720
like just don't waste these days.

695
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,720
You're young, you're probably strong, very strong and virile.

696
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,020
Just don't waste fucking sexy.

697
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,860
Sexy?

698
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,400
That works for another reason too.

699
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,640
Cause when people are like, why didn't you finish school?

700
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,300
If your response is, nah, I just, I watched SpongeBob a lot.

701
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,480
Like no one respects them.

702
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,300
And if you're like, you know what?

703
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,400
I got out there and started living my life.

704
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,640
Then everybody's gonna be like, oh, okay, that makes sense.

705
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,120
I would also say in terms of good adult advice

706
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,760
is don't be afraid of how much stuff you don't know

707
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,040
about being an adult.

708
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,280
Because look around at all the dum-dums

709
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,760
that are successfully doing that stuff.

710
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,700
Like all of the dum-dums that know

711
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,120
how to get a social security card and pay your taxes.

712
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,160
They're silly, silly, silly goofs.

713
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,820
And they can do it.

714
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,660
You can do it.

715
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,200
You can do anything.

716
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,480
If you believe in yourself, you can do anything.

717
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,600
You can do anything.

718
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,960
But I think you should finish school

719
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,240
cause you got real close.

720
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,080
Money zone.

721
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,900
Let's go to the money zone.

722
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:07,900
I would like to tell you guys about a sponsor

723
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,280
that I'm very close to.

724
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,120
Okay.

725
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,960
How close?

726
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,720
I mean about two feet away.

727
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,880
Cause it's like in my bedroom right now.

728
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,840
One might say you've been sleeping with this sponsor.

729
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,320
I've been sleeping with it.

730
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,400
I'm in bed with this sponsor.

731
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,320
Here's the thing, you guys.

732
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,040
And it's not Powerade who does send sexual representatives.

733
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,460
That it's a friend of his contract

734
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,720
that three of us have to take turns making love to.

735
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,840
And I hate it.

736
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,680
I don't like it.

737
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,200
We all hate it.

738
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,400
But here's the thing, you guys.

739
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,920
My brother, my brother and me is sponsored

740
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,000
in part by Casper, an online retailer of premium,

741
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
obsessively engineered mattresses

742
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,180
for a fraction of the price.

743
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,840
Casper, I have a Casper mattress.

744
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,980
I'm a big fan of it.

745
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,680
Teresa and I, you know, in the past,

746
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,960
I've always been very picky about my mattresses.

747
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,320
I had the same one for far too long.

748
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,120
And then when we moved, it was time to get a new mattress

749
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,660
and we tried this out and it's amazing.

750
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,120
Like I've slept so well since I got it.

751
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,700
I usually like toss and turn

752
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,120
and I have woken up in the same position every day.

753
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,960
You really use it?

754
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,200
Cause I thought initially you were gonna use it

755
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,040
as a guest bed.

756
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,860
You go like, got down with it.

757
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,780
Oh, I got down with it.

758
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,080
As soon as it got here, we were like,

759
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,600
oh no, this is our new jam.

760
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,560
This is the coolest thing.

761
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,680
It came in a box.

762
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,480
I'm gonna say like about two feet by two feet

763
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,160
and then about three feet tall, four feet tall.

764
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,440
I mean, depending on the size of the mattress you get,

765
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,260
of course.

766
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,960
But it comes in a completely like compact manageable.

767
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,120
It's all rolled up in like a sealed package.

768
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,400
And then when you open it up,

769
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,960
basically all the air rushes back into it.

770
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,120
And it kind of like, you know, in cartoons,

771
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,000
when someone pulls the tab on like a raft

772
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,840
and it suddenly goes like,

773
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,680
boom, boom, boom.

774
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,500
That's what it does.

775
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,340
And it's super fun.

776
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,320
Did you have to like clear the room?

777
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,440
Like, oh no, oh no.

778
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,360
Oh well, I probably should have better.

779
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,120
It like, it expanded out.

780
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,080
The cat ran away.

781
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,200
It was great.

782
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,120
Now you can just put these bad boys right on the floor,

783
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,960
right?

784
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,800
Like you don't need a box spring or whatever.

785
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,000
No, it works on, you could put it,

786
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,120
we have a slotted bed.

787
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,500
So we don't even have a box spring

788
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,440
and it works great with that.

789
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,080
You can put it on the floor cause it's so supportive.

790
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,480
You don't need anything underneath it.

791
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,640
And Casper has a risk-free trial and return policy.

792
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,720
So you can try sleeping on Casper for a hundred days

793
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,800
with free delivery and painless returns.

794
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,160
Like that's, that's a ridiculous offer.

795
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,480
A hundred days.

796
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,320
So over three months.

797
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,600
I don't know what they're charging for these mattresses,

798
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,160
but I bet it's $50 too much.

799
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,440
Well, here's the thing, Justin.

800
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,720
My brother and my brother and me listeners

801
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,640
can get $50 towards any mattress purchase.

802
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,600
If you go to Casper.com slash my brother

803
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,560
and use the promo code, my brother,

804
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,480
all one word at checkout, you get $50 off.

805
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,560
Now terms and conditions apply, of course,

806
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,400
because- What's that mean?

807
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,220
What's that mean?

808
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,060
What's that mean?

809
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,840
It means that there are terms and there are conditions

810
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,360
and they apply to the situation.

811
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,640
God, no, no, God.

812
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,600
I just want it Scott free.

813
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,660
Well, we all want Scott free mattresses.

814
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,500
I don't want terms.

815
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,340
But sometimes Scott comes with them

816
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,560
and that's one of the terms.

817
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,400
I'm afraid of conditions.

818
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,560
My friend Scott, he comes with the mattress.

819
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,400
So go to Casper.com slash my brother

820
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,160
and use the promo code, my brother,

821
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,760
and you can save $50.

822
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,600
And they have all different sizes

823
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,080
and it's a great product.

824
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,640
And there are no terms and conditions.

825
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,640
No terms and conditions, no Griffin.

826
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,480
We have to say-

827
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,560
Terms and conditions apply.

828
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,400
No, no, no.

829
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,960
We have to say that terms and conditions apply,

830
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,800
but don't worry.

831
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,520
No terms or conditions to be found here.

832
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,760
Tell them you're with us.

833
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,960
They know us.

834
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,800
Tell them you're with us.

835
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,120
You guys are my bambinos.

836
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,200
We'll waive the terms and those conditions, my man.

837
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,080
I don't know.

838
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,360
I'm checking with my boss upstairs.

839
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,200
No conditions, huh?

840
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,600
Let me see if I can get you a good deal

841
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,200
vis-a-vis terms and conditions.

842
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,640
Yeah, waived.

843
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,520
Waived them right now.

844
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,560
There will be, straight up though,

845
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,920
there's gonna be some terms and conditions.

846
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,740
We're goofing.

847
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,040
We're all having a good time now,

848
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,160
but don't try and sneak past those terms and conditions

849
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,880
because they'll catch you.

850
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,400
Note to future advertisers,

851
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,320
if you put the line terms and conditions apply in our copy,

852
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,040
we will talk about it for three minutes.

853
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,320
We will make sure they know

854
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,600
that terms and conditions do, in fact, apply.

855
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,240
I have another message here from a sponsor

856
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,040
that paid us to talk about them,

857
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,580
and it is Nature Box.

858
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,420
Heard of them?

859
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,240
But they wouldn't have to.

860
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,080
No, they wouldn't.

861
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,000
I mean, they could pay us

862
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,760
in many Belgian waffles at this point,

863
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,760
but Nature Box is your online premier source

864
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,620
for delicious, healthy snacks.

00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,660

and no high fructose corn syrup.

868
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,320
You can get those mini Belgian waffles.

869
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,800
You can get some strawberry lemonade fruit stars.

870
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,000
You can get a sweet and salty nut medley.

871
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,960
Oh my God, those sound so good.

872
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,000

Get some free snacks that you can eat in your bed,

your new bed, your new Casper bed.

877
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:05,100
I got a message for Breezy B from Better Know a Husband.

878
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,240
That sounds like a weird punny name.

879
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,400
Like you better know a husband,

880
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,500
but it actually has the name Noah in there.

881
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,840
So I'm very confused.

882
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
That is very confusing.

883
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,360
Happy 12th anniversary, Breezy B.

884
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
I'm so excited.

885
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,480
We're doing new things together,

886
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,600
like listening to the brothers and raising our daughter.

887
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,080
Hopefully not at the same time,

888
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,720
who by the time you're hearing this

889
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,800
is at least one year old.

890
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,640
I love you.

891
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,100
Here's to an exciting 12 years.

892
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,940
And there's a note here.

893
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:36,480
It says, PS brothers, wifey likes it when you go meta.

894
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,280
Oh, okay, what does that mean?

895
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,560
I mean, it's like we talk about like the show,

896
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,960
but we like part the veil.

897
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,320
I'm wearing three headbands.

898
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,160
Is that meta?

899
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,860
I got a headband holding on my headband.

900
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,700
Is that true?

901
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,520
Yeah.

902
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,280
I've just, I've been looking around the desk,

903
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,880
picking up headbands and putting them on as I got bored.

904
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,700
I've been drinking.

905
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,960
That's what happened a lot this episode, huh?

906
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,920
Yep, three times at least.

907
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,320
I've been drinking the same cup of coffee

908
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,920
since 7 a.m. this morning.

909
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,680
And it's really, really, really gross.

910
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,520
But I don't feel like going back in the kitchen

911
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,400
and pour myself a new cup and throw it in the microwave.

912
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,240
Speaking of drinking coffee,

913
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,200
I had a realization this morning

914
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,280
that some of my classic moments

915
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,720
that I remember the most fondly on this program

916
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,760
and have not listened to again

917
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,120
have been when I've been drunk at live shows.

918
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,120
And I had this realization today

919
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,300
when I was making my coffee

920
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,000
and I saw that bottle of raspberry liqueur staring back.

921
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,840
Uh-oh.

922
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,660
Wait a minute.

923
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,040
Where it starts. Hold on.

924
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,600
Hold on, wait a second.

925
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,560
You can swallow this stuff anytime.

926
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,400
Oh, boy.

927
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,720
It is always swallowable.

928
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,560
Oh, Jesus. Right?

929
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,300
You don't have to be about to go on stage.

930
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,640
The crazy thing about alcohol that you forget sometimes,

931
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,560
you can drink it whenever.

932
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,120
Yeah, it's drinking in the noon time,

933
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,320
drinking in the noon time,

934
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,580
drinking at supper time.

935
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,680
When drinking is a liquid,

936
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,440
you can drink drinking anytime.

937
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,280
You can do it whenever.

938
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,120
Yeah, sure.

939
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,160
We've got another message for Kurt.

940
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,600
We've got a message here for Justin.

941
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,480
We love you.

942
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,320
And this is a safe place.

943
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,280
Shambered.

944
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,360
Isn't my pronouncing that correctly?

945
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,200
That's the raspberry liqueur.

946
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,040
Shambered.

947
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,860
Yeah. Nailed it.

948
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,700
Crushed it.

949
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,720
This message is for Kurt.

950
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,960
It's from Coop, Jeremy, Mike and Mike.

951
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,140
To our favorite sub, sub, sub librarian.

952
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,720
Kurt with a C.

953
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,560
Excited to spell with a K.

954
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,180
Happy birthday and congratulations

955
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,860
on finding and catching your true white whale.

956
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,480
We hope your marriage to Becky

957
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,260
will be a long and happy one.

958
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,660
Hashtag gone girl.

959
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,500
Wait, what?

960
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,560
Did you get gone girled?

961
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,720
Are you gone girled?

962
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,480
Do you guys know how exponentially

963
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,760
the rate of gone girling has increased

964
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,280
since that fucking movie dropped?

965
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,160
Didn't happen with the book,

966
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,000
because nobody reads books.

967
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,080
When that movie dropped,

968
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,160
gone girling is like one out of every three marriages

969
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,000
ends in gone girling.

970
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,580
That's gonna be John Quinones' new show

971
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,840
to catch a gone girl.

972
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,680
Yeah.

973
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,840
And not everybody pulls a Ben Affleck.

974
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,840
Not everybody can reel it back in.

975
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,680
You know what I mean?

976
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,680
A lot of folks just get exumacuted

977
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,800
because they get gone girled successfully.

978
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,000
We probably shouldn't delve too deeply

979
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,320
into the plot of Gone Girl

980
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,880
here on where we don't wanna spoil the movie Gone Girl.

981
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,300
Wait, are we gonna travel back in time

982
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,740
to six months ago when no one had seen Gone Girl?

983
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,320
I mean, I'll spoil the book for people

984
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,360
because like Griffin said,

985
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,920
right, but I don't wanna spoil a movie.

986
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,560
I'm just saying keep your wits about you.

987
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,440
And Gone Girl, the girl in Gone Girl,

988
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,680
it doesn't necessarily refer to a gender.

989
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,560
You can gone husband like easy.

990
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,400
And that's happening too.

991
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,000
That's called gone fishing.

992
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,400
Gone, well, no, it's not called gone fishing.

993
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,240
It'd be called like gone boy.

994
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,000
Because men love to fish and ignore their wives.

995
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,440
It's called bye-bye boy.

996
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,600
And a lot of husbands out there

997
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,600
are bye-bye boying their wives.

998
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,040
And it's bad, it's bad, it's bad.

999
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,880
It's bad.

1000
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,720
Don't do it.

1001
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,960
Can't we just call it like gone,

1002
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,760
what's the word, like S-O?

1003
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,920
Like gone, like sayonara S-O?

1004
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,080
So long S-O.

1005
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,440
See ya spouse.

1006
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,760
See ya spouse, that's great.

1007
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,120
That's all inclusive.

1008
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,720
Everybody can see ya spouse.

1009
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,260
Some people don't believe

1010
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,240
in having a state-sponsored relationship.

1011
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,360
They wanna keep it open-ended.

1012
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,800
Peace out, partner.

1013
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,640
Peace out, partner.

1014
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,000
Ooh, peace out, partner.

1015
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm saying just we need to start including that

1016
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,040
just like de facto in vows.

1017
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,240
Like in sickness and in health.

1018
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,320
Also, I won't bye-bye,

1019
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,720
I won't bye-bye boy you at all.

1020
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,840
I won't bye-bye buddy you.

1021
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,680
Well.

1022
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,960
That's for like best friendships.

1023
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,080
You can bye-bye buddy somebody,

1024
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,920
it's just called moving.

1025
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,760
Yeah.

1026
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,200
I'm a police officer, I'm investigating.

1027
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
You're missing buddy.

1028
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,040
Why are you even talking to me right now?

1029
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,880
What do you mean?

1030
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,920
He lives in Indianapolis.

1031
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,760
He moved to Indianapolis.

1032
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,600
Moved to North Dakota.

1033
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,420
I don't know why I'm responsible for that.

1034
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,260
This is Biz.

1035
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,100
And I'm Teresa.

1036
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,280
And we host a show called One Bad Mother,

1037
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,280
a comedy podcast about parenting.

1038
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,360
Not a parenting podcast.

1039
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,280
Guess what?

1040
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,400
We both just had babies.

1041
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,240
Again.

1042
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,760
Check out the show enjoyed by breeders and ballers alike

1043
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,880
on iTunes or MaximumFun.org.

1044
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,600
How about a Yahoo?

1045
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Okay, that's fine.

1046
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,720
This Yahoo was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

1047
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,000
Again, thank you Zoe.

1048
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,680
It's by Yahoo Answers user Amy Rose who asks,

1049
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,480
I'm so, have a crush on Sonic the Hedgehog.

1050
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,320
Help.

1051
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,740
Lol.

1052
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,600
It gets kind of annoying crushing on someone

1053
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,000
who is probably not real.

1054
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,840
Someone cure me of my crush.

1055
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh God, so much to unpack.

1056
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,840
Not really.

1057
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,360
This person's in love with Sonic the Hedgehog

1058
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,720
and they're not sure if they're real or not.

1059
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,600
And can any of us be sure?

1060
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,880
They're real in the sense that he's a pop icon, right?

1061
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,120
Who is like, we've all been in love with her.

1062
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,520
That there's countless universes

1063
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,400
in which everything happens.

1064
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,960
We can't say what is real or what is not real

1065
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,860
because it's only our perceptions that determine that.

1066
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07,080
So there is definitely a universe

1067
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,440
in which Sonic the Hedgehog is real

1068
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,460
and is just going to town on this woman.

1069
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,600
Statistically, everything's happening

1070
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,760
in some universe at all times.

1071
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,000
You're saying infinite monkeys on infinite typewriters

1072
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,080
with an infinite amount of time

1073
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,360
will eventually create Hamlet.

1074
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,480
Somewhere in some alt-universe,

1075
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,880
Sonic is real and making love to this person.

1076
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,320
Oh, just going to town on her.

1077
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,080
Guaranteed.

1078
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,440
Griffin, at this point,

1079
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,720
I'm not even comfortable calling it making love.

1080
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,920
No, because he goes way too fast.

1081
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,760
So fast.

1082
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,680
Emotion is not part of it.

1083
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,800
It is just flesh machines at that point.

1084
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,480
At this point, they're just doing what comes naturally

1085
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,500
and that's Sonic the Hedgehog having sex with a woman.

1086
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,000
Hey, it actually happened in the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog.

1087
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,040
Anyway, we're getting completely off topic.

1088
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,440
If you want to end your love affair

1089
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,440
with Sonic the Hedgehog,

1090
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,240
you could do like the rest of the nation did

1091
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,280
and just play any Sonic the Hedgehog game

1092
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,480
from the past 15 years.

1093
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,660
Play Sonic Free Rider.

1094
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,840
See if you still have a crush on him.

1095
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,240
I guarantee you will not.

1096
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,720
What's the one where Sonic goes to the Olympics?

1097
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,200
Sonic 3D Blast.

1098
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,040
Mm-hmm.

1099
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,920
Let me introduce Becky.

1100
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,320
I know you've had a hard time

1101
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,920
getting over the Sonic the Hedgehog.

1102
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,640
Can I introduce you to my friend Crash Bandicoot?

1103
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,200
Crash, come in here.

1104
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,040
Hey, what's up?

1105
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,360
This is my friend Becky.

1106
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,260
She's been real lonely lately.

1107
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,100
You look like you've been hurt.

1108
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,320
I'll leave you two to it.

1109
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,520
You look like you've been hurt by an echidna.

1110
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,000
That's the worst part of having an unfulfilled crush

1111
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,680
on Sonic is that you know

1112
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,360
when you're the most vulnerable,

1113
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,520
Tails is gonna be like knocking at your door.

1114
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,720
Hey, hey. Hey.

1115
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,520
You okay? Hey.

1116
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,360
I'm so sorry.

1117
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,440
You know you deserve so much better than that.

1118
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,280
Take it from me.

1119
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,840
Knuckles, what are you doing here?

1120
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,600
You get away from her.

1121
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,640
I'm so sorry he was bothering you.

1122
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,220
Listen, how you doing?

1123
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,440
Do you wanna do it in the Robotnik tonight?

1124
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,280
Travis.

1125
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,520
Oh, fuck you.

1126
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,780
Best part about Knuckles is he's in the Three Sims.

1127
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,620
Probably.

1128
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,240
Well, let me read you some of my fan fiction.

1129
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,600
That'll prove that that is correct.

1130
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,440
You just plug Knuckles into your existing relationship

1131
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,400
and then there he is.

1132
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,720
Wow. Yeah.

1133
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,520
Wow. You like that shit.

1134
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,400
I do.

1135
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,400
I do like that shit.

1136
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,600
You can't even pretend like you don't like that shit.

1137
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,320
No, I do indeed like that shit.

1138
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,140
I'm not gonna try to deny it.

1139
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,240
I enjoy that shit.

1140
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,260
My wife and I moved to do a new apartment last year.

1141
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,660
Part of our duties slash domain is gardening the backyard.

1142
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,240
Last year, we discovered a plant near our back gate

1143
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,400
in late summer that turned out to be a random

1144
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,760
marijuana plant. Oh, boy.

1145
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,680
Neither of us do the pot.

1146
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,080
It was a tiny plant and so we just let it flower

1147
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,040
and figured the Minnesota winter would take care

1148
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,080
of what we didn't feel like dealing with.

1149
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,720
It died or so we thought.

1150
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,220
This year, it appears that multiple,

1151
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,880
multiple plants have sprouted up

1152
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,040
that are totally 100% more pot.

1153
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,120
I feel bad destroying them as many people put in

1154
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,400
a lot of work to grow this stuff

1155
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,200
but I also have no use for it and it's kinda illegal.

1156
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,240
What should we do with this brothers?

1157
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,000
That's from mystified by marijuana in Minneapolis.

1158
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,360
This season on Breaking Bad 2.

1159
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,080
What's the PO box number for our Huntington?

1160
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,360
Fuck that.

1161
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,160
There is a human being.

1162
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,600
We were in Minneapolis a month ago.

1163
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,760
There was a person presumably at that show

1164
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,440
who was like, I don't know what I'm gonna do

1165
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,840
with all the pot at my house.

1166
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,080
We've been asking for years.

1167
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,640
Years. Please don't send us pot in the mail.

1168
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,240
Holy shit, please don't do that.

1169
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,440
Hachi-machi please don't.

1170
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,280
Yipes, Justin as a kid, do not do that.

1171
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,880
You should probably start selling it.

1172
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,720
Yeah, I mean that's it, right?

1173
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,200
Whoa.

1174
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,640
In this economy, leaving money on the table?

1175
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,140
It's gonna be, here's what I'll say actually.

1176
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:56,980
Just let it be,

1177
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,960
cause that's just gonna be legal countrywide

1178
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,340
in the next two years.

1179
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,600
This is a serious question that I need someone

1180
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,880
to tweet at me after the show

1181
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,720
and tell me the answer to this.

1182
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,720
Is there such a thing as like wild marijuana these days?

1183
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,840
But in like the backyard

1184
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,240
of like a Minnesota apartment complex,

1185
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,960
it's like, oh yeah, we got,

1186
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,160
there's some clovers growing here

1187
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,720
and like some dandelions and some weed.

1188
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,680
Like that's a thing?

1189
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,520
Where do you think it came from?

1190
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,360
But I could expect to find it

1191
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,240
in like a hillside out in the country.

1192
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,520
In a shire.

1193
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,920
In the shire.

1194
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,320
But I'm just, it's weird to me that a random marijuana plant

1195
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,560
that a bird like pooped out a seed of a marijuana plant

1196
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,400
in the backyard. Oh my God, dude,

1197
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,180
there's so many gross misconceptions,

1198
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,480
just sort of about nature.

1199
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,320
That's how it works.

1200
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,560
Birds, they eat the seeds

1201
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,720
and then they poop out the seeds

1202
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,440
and the seeds grow.

1203
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,280
Then you smoke them.

1204
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,960
Then you smoke the bird poop.

1205
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,280
If you smoke bird poop, you will get high.

1206
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,760
What would you guys legit,

1207
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,280
like let's put the,

1208
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,240
okay, I'm gonna open up the joke locker for a second.

1209
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,280
Take your jokes, put it in the joke locker.

1210
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,080
Close it up fully.

1211
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,440
Now the jokes are in the joke locker.

1212
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,640
If you were in this situation,

1213
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,760
what would you literally do?

1214
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,240
Well, I totally get the confusion

1215
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,160
because I'm sitting here thinking like,

1216
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:19,240
one, I would be so worried that someone would find it

1217
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,480
and just immediately assume I planted it there.

1218
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,800
Sure. You know what I mean?

1219
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,600
Because the cockamamie story of,

1220
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,840
it's just a random plant, I guess.

1221
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,840
Like no one's gonna believe that.

1222
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,840
Even if it's true.

1223
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,520
How would it be discovered would be my question.

1224
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,360
I mean, I don't understand.

1225
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,640
Well, you're in an apartment complex.

1226
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,440
There's other people living there.

1227
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,800
Oh, by which you mean there's plenty of other people

1228
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,640
to take the fall.

1229
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,960
But that could be somebody else's plant.

1230
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,880
But it's this person's job to garden in the backyard.

1231
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,720
Oh, that's true.

1232
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,760
They're gonna be the first suspect.

1233
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,480
But as any good cop knows,

1234
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,360
it's very rarely the most obvious suspect.

1235
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,520
Do you think it was the apartment butler?

1236
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,360
I think it was the apartment butler, Travis.

1237
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,600
Oh, sorry, I broke into the joke locker.

1238
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,440
Let me put that back in there.

1239
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,640
Not really.

1240
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,120
No, no.

1241
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:09,960
Not technically speaking.

1242
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,080
I got that out of the joke shoe box that was under my bed.

1243
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,400
I think you're right in that

1244
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,800
destroying this plant is the wrong move.

1245
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,640
Because it's a living thing.

1246
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,480
It's kind.

1247
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,160
And it's kind, and it wants to help you.

1248
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,800
So you need to help it.

1249
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,600
And just like to pot it, very gently move it into a pot,

1250
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,040
put that pot in another pot, and then take it inside.

1251
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,480
And then you're gonna need to find

1252
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,960
the right hydroponic system for you.

1253
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:35,800
Cause there's lots of difference.

1254
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,880
Yeah, you're probably gonna have to convert your bedroom.

1255
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,160
Oh yeah, that's not a bedroom anymore.

1256
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,200
This is a no bedroom, one bath.

1257
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,400
And the bedroom, the bedroom,

1258
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,560
the only bed in there is a bed

1259
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,160
of that sweet, kind Carolina kush.

1260
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,600
I know we live in Minneapolis.

1261
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,440
I know.

1262
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,240
The strain was brought here by a bird.

1263
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,720
This kind strain.

1264
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,960
A tired bird.

1265
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,520
This kind, this kind kaki-laki.

1266
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,080
This bird who brought it this far

1267
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,600
and then died to bring us this sweet sticky weed.

1268
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,440
He died.

1269
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,280
And the plant grew, the bird's body nurtured the seed

1270
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,520
and gave us this kind, kind kaki-laki.

1271
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,360
This is our life now, honey.

1272
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,000
This is our life now.

1273
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,720
We're breaking bad.

1274
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,520
We are the ones who knock, I think.

1275
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,560
I didn't watch the whole show,

1276
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,520
and I can't now cause we don't have a TV.

1277
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,840
Cause I had to move it out of the room

1278
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,840
cause this is our garden.

1279
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,280
It got in the way of my weed.

1280
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,840
I put the plant in front of the TV

1281
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,420
and I turned the brightness all the way up.

1282
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,440
I think it's gonna happen.

1283
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,000
I've been talking to it like the little prince's rose.

1284
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Man, that'd be a much different book.

1285
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,040
Yeah, it'd be a way better book.

1286
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,560
Folks, thank you so much for listening

1287
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,400
to our comedy podcast.

1288
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,560
My brother, my brother and me, 2.0,

1289
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,400
boys in the house.

1290
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,360
Power A presents.

1291
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,880
Power A presents, fuck.

1292
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,000
Let me just try to start the whole episode over.

1293
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,920
Thanks, hey.

1294
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,200
We didn't, I mean, we just didn't mention

1295
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,920
Power A nearly enough.

1296
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,760
Yeah, you're right.

1297
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,760
Hey, extreme buds.

1298
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,160
Hey, extreme buds.

1299
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,080
Thanks so much for listening to Power A.

1300
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,560
Oh, we need a wet stunt.

1301
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,400
Okay, hold on.

1302
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,840
Oh, God, no.

1303
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,840
That's what wet stunts sound like.

1304
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,520
Thanks so much for listening to Power A

1305
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,840
presents my brother, my brother and me,

1306
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,480
2.0, boys in the house, a Power A experience.

1307
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,040
I have an idea for a wet stunt.

1308
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,280
Okay, okay.

1309
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,400
I would like everybody to tweet us pictures

1310
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,580
of them choosing not to drink Power A.

1311
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,200
Wait a minute, hold on, wait.

1312
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,960
Travis, you've nailed it.

1313
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,280
Okay.

1314
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,720
The only way we're gonna be free from this power prison.

1315
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,080
We have to make this relationship with Power A

1316
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,960
as undesirable to Power A as humanly possible.

1317
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,560
So what I want you to do is use the hashtag wet stunts

1318
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,600
to tweet pictures that just really,

1319
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,600
really make Power A look unappealing.

1320
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,480
That's what I need, that's what I need you to do.

1321
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,400
Do not tweet it.

1322
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,040
Power A has to be in the picture.

1323
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,280
You can't just like take a picture

1324
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,600
of you going like P.U. stink face.

1325
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,680
And by the way, don't tweet it at Power A.

1326
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,360
No, because that's not what we want at all.

1327
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,720
That's not what we, that's not the kind of attention

1328
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,320
we want to draw, personally.

1329
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,120
It would be pretty fucking funny though.

1330
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,360
Yeah, I just don't want to get Power A, big Power A,

1331
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,720
because that's like Coke, right?

1332
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,560
Or Pepsi? Yeah.

1333
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,380
I don't know.

1334
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,220
I don't need them on my hands.

1335
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,640
We're pretty big, but we're not Coca-Cola big.

1336
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,880
We're not Coca-Cola big.

1337
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,360
That's gonna be a good stunt.

1338
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,280
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

1339
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,120
for the use of our theme song.

1340
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,920
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1341
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,140
It's a wonderful album.

1342
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:43,000
We're gonna be kicking it with John Roderick

1343
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,520
at Max Funk on here in a few weeks.

1344
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,360
We're really excited.

1345
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,480
Johnny R, as I'm sure he'll insist we call him

1346
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,440
at the weekend's end.

1347
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,880
Except that we won't call him that,

1348
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,200
because we'll all probably be too nervous to talk to him.

1349
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,880
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

1350
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,940
Anyway, thank you John Roderick in the long winters.

1351
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,400
Also, thanks again to Nature Box,

We're also heading to John Roderick's town,

1358
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,280
which he will soon be the president of.

1359
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,640
I haven't been keeping track of it,

1360
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,480
but he's running for office in the Seattle area,

1361
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,240
which big fans of.

1362
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,080
Yeah.

1363
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,600
But we're doing a Pacific Northwest tour in August.

1364
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,040
We're going to Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver,

1365
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,660
August 28th, 29th, 30th respectively.

1366
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,000
The Portland show is already sold out.

1367
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,320
So unfortunately, you won't be able to see us at that one

1368
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,560
unless you've already got tickets.

1369
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,760
But there's still tickets available

1370
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,240

1371
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,360

00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,680

And it's signed seating, so don't sleep on it.

1375

Go get your tickets today, and we'll see you in August.

1376
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,400
Go listen to the other shows at the Maximum Fun Network

1377
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,000
if you haven't already.

1378
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,680
There's some really, really great shows all free.

1379
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,800
And if you like this one,

1380
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,380
you're going to like all the other ones,

1381
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,000
like Rendered and Lady Da Lady and One Bad Mother

1382
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,440
and Throwing Shade and Jordan Jesse Go

1383
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,280
and Judge John Hodgman.

1384
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,120
We all play-

1385
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,960
Bones the Adventure Zone and Bunker Buddies.

1386
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,240
Yes, which are all shows we do.

1387
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,760
Travis, you have a new show.

1388
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,000
It's not on Max Fun,

1389
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,320
but you want to tell the people about it?

1390
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,160
It's my brand new show.

1391
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,080
Yeah, so Brent, Brent O'Floss,

1392
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,640
who was my roommate in college

1393
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,920
and has been one of my best friends for 13 years,

1394
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,240
he and I launched a new show called Trends Like These.

1395
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,960
Basically, we talk about what the trending news

1396
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,780
on the internet.

1397
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:43,680
So for example, last week we talked about DadBod,

1398
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,320
we talked about Jaden Smith showing up to prom

1399
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,320
dressed as Batman.

1400
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,480
We talked about Simon Pegg.

1401
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,420
So we just talk about whatever stories are trending

1402
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,820
on like Twitter and Facebook and all over the internet.

1403
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:01,160
It's on iTunes, it's on Stitcher, it's on everything.

1404
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,280
You can go to trendslikethese.com

1405
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,200
and we've got links to all the different ways

1406
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,080
to listen to the show.

1407
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,560
It comes out every Thursday

1408
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,800
