1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,980
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

finally

15
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,420
Finally an old white

16
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,660
straight dude comedian has had the courage to say

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:51,500
That they liked comedy better when they could say whatever the fuck they wanted

18
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,020
Finally you being you've done done it again being let's I'd listen

19
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,100
I don't throw this word around a lot. Anyone who knows me knows that but I'm just gonna say it hero

20
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,260
Say I missed the time when I could fucking say

21
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,860
Anything and I didn't have to think about other people

22
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,740
Or like what my audience thought and so I'm so glad finally

23
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,100
We have someone standing up for transgressive comedy. Yeah challenges our ideas

24
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:30,300
So I can't wait to see what kind of challenging the status quo man versus

25
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,220
versus fuck

26
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,100
fucking man

27
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:41,260
versus fucking be press junkie is where being feels like he needs to take his stand and

28
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,380
Say oh, I might get listen

29
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,660
This this one's gonna get me in hot water. It's

30
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,020
Maybe be friend. I'm gonna be the marketing rep for

31
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,620
Netflix. Okay. Okay, if you're rowing. Yeah, I would love this

32
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,740
Buzz buzz

33
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,820
Roni in I got you go for bean

34
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,580
so

35
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:14,260
Classic and that is exactly the kind of magic. We're hoping you can capture today in your interviews about our

36
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,540
Project man versus be. Oh, yeah for sure for sure

37
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:26,220
So I brought in just so we can like kind of make sure we're on the same page. I've brought in

38
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,340
You know

39
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,940
David Sims from the Atlantic. Oh, we're good

40
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:38,900
Bros, you're David. Oh, hi. It's me David Sims. So David has been kind enough to sort of do a

41
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:46,100
I sort of mock interview if that's if we could try that. Oh, yeah, you know, you know

42
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:51,940
You don't think I'm ready for the real deal. I know you are. I know you are rowing

43
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,180
Oh, I just really want to keep it laser

44
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,900
Yeah, so I'm just gonna I'm gonna start off with a real softball here rowing

45
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,260
Ha ha

46
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,180
What what is it that you think makes man versus be such a great comment?

47
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,840
Well, I was talking to my good friend Ricky Gervais the other day

48
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,660
Okay, I was talking to him about

49
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,660
comedy

50
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,660
Yeah, okay. So what makes me ever

51
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,460
This is going I was about to say so good, but like Ricky's actually been in a little bit of a

52
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,980
I mean, we love him over here at Netflix can't get enough of them

53
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,340
Yeah, so I think actually it's all going fine. So yeah, no notes

54
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,860
I've prepared a statement. Oh, okay

55
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,660
That doesn't normally happen in interviews. But yeah, go ahead Rowan

56
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:57,780
It does seem to be that the job of comedy is to offend or have the potential to offend and it can't I'm

57
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,260
becoming Austrian

58
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,260
Well, you're very you're very transformative as an actor row and

59
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,960
So what it wait, so what did you say about the job of comedy?

60
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,260
It's to make a people angry and you say you can't punch down

61
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,760
But what if that's the closest thing to you? Well, hold on Rowan

62
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,800
It's the job of easier punch down the job of comedy is to make people

63
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
gravity

64
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,280
But that seemed Rowan isn't the job of comedy to make people happy and laugh

65
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,920
Well, I was talking to my good friend best friend

66
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,040
Then he was a group sort of my wedding Richard Gervais

67
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,920
And

68
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,240
He we were having a lot of laughs. We were watching his special. I was busting the fuck up at all of it and

69
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,360
I've got me thinking I

70
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,880
Should be able to tell a joke about anything I want with no repercussions whatsoever. Mr. Bain

71
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,080
Well, that's that seems like a big ask Rowan and I do also feel like sorry we're drifting away

72
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,880
from the focus

73
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:16,040
Ah the beers it represents woke culture. Oh

74
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,580
What? Yeah

75
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:25,000
This is a scoop. So you're telling me that what the movie actually is is man versus woke culture

76
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,140
kind of

77
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,660
but it also but it's also like

78
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,700
getting older

79
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:40,700
Like it's me versus getting older and I was and I could squeeze it a kid getting older with a big flame

80
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,700
Throw and say what?

81
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:48,040
No, no, please. I believe very much. I think I think what he I think what?

82
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,780
Sir Rowan is saying here. Oh, he's got the knighthood when you're fighting a bee

83
00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:02,900
You can't really punch up or down cuz it's flying around so much that you're just punching every which way in that and starting on it at all

84
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,460
I'm and knocking over vases. I think is another great

85
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:12,060
Oh, so it's like a literal like okay that it's a literal punching right Rowan

86
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,020
I'm just saying

87
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:23,900
That it seems to me the job of comedies to offend or have potential to offend and it cannot be drained of that

88
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,060
potential

89
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:32,100
Every joke has a victim. That's the definition of every let and let me make sure you get this quote

90
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:38,900
Which is the most bonkers shit I've ever said or anyone really getting word-for-word

91
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,700
Every joke has a victim. That's the definition of a joke

92
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,700
No

93
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,340
Every joke has a

94
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:56,300
Victim and that's and the rest of the quote that I didn't I'm not going to say off the record

95
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,540
Is that jokes are like stabbings like that? Whoa, Rowan?

96
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:06,340
Okay, Rowan if I could just I don't want to feed I'm ready to talk about my B film

97
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,220
No, no, no now we're gonna talk about how you think the job of

98
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,780
of comedy is to hurt offend

99
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,300
Entertain not to like

100
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:24,660
Better so look at my but look at my body. Uh-huh. It's very small

101
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,700
With comedy, uh-huh. I make her like a big weapon

102
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:39,620
I mean, I but I don't not at this particular

103
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,860
ten episode long series

104
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:52,100
Sir if I may even if you believe this bonkers thing about every joke has a victim

105
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,980
Let's just take that beautiful metaphor. So okay, you don't like the punching up punching down thing. That's fine

106
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,500
Why do you want to victimize? Okay in your logic you want a bit you think it's cool and fun

107
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,660
to victimize

108
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,980
Marginalized people that is what you think God

109
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,220
God made me a comedian God made me a weapon

110
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:21,420
Uh-huh. Look at my little look at my little body. Yeah, it's hard not to look at it now that you've removed the robe

111
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,580
You've contorted it into that big bug I face that you do. Yeah

112
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,540
Yeah, so anyway

113
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:35,000
So but when Mitch Hedberg said like when you're standing in front of a fire exit during a fire

114
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:41,980
Right and he makes that whole joke about someone telling him to move because that's a fire exit. Who's the victim in that joke?

115
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,100
Well, it reminds me of a story my best friend

116
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:52,500
Bill Maher told me when I was having dinner with him and Louis and Louis CK. Oh boy. Okay that

117
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,980
Can we get back to the B thing because I fall down a lot in this movie and it hurts

118
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:06,420
Every time and I want a little bit of credit for that when you used a credit card to spread butter on toast

119
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,140
Who was the victim there Rowan just out of curiosity?

120
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,580
Who were you really sticking it to there?

121
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,860
That wasn't a joke. That was a story

122
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,700
That really happened that was a story I would did you just do an impression of me to me I

123
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:32,060
Did do it again David that I'm sorry David hugely. I've actually been rowing this whole time. He's

124
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,620
You do it better than I do

125
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,300
I'm transformative

126
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,420
and seen the art

127
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:45,580
Must be separated from the artist in this case because it's Griffin

128
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,880
I don't think it needs to be we're all rooting for the fucking B

129
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,860
Oh, I hope the last shot is we find out early on that his character Trevor

130
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:00,700
So challenging Trevor is allergic to bees and I hope the last shot of episode 10

131
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,940
At minute 100 collectively he gets stabbed in the fucking eyeball

132
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,580
And we see him and like every flash of memory comes back and as he's dying

133
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,060
He's like I was really a piece of shit and then he dies

134
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,540
That's what I'm rooting for. I just think that's he's the likely that I think it's unlikely to happen

135
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:26,300
The quote you're assuming it's a comedy the quotes that mr. B says in this article

136
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,180
Are truly truly truly outrageous

137
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,540
First of all, he says you've always got to kick up really what?

138
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,540
That's not I don't think anyone says you got a kick a little to cause a stir

139
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:44,820
What if there's someone extremely smug arrogant aggressive self-satisfied who happens to be below in society?

140
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,260
They're not all in house. Yeah, like trans people

141
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,900
All arrogant they're not all in houses of Parliament or in monarchies

142
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,340
Thanks, really?

143
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,460
anyway

144
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:02,380
This is not hard. It's not it's not hard then the other people got it's like fucking

145
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,020
Then the other people in that community

146
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:12,380
That arrogant person at the top in that community is up from them

147
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,140
You don't just have fucking carte blanche

148
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,220
Rowan

149
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,540
They're not above you. Listen, I

150
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,900
Don't have anything to say here, but I just want to say

151
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,660
This is about the most half-assed sort of condemnation of cancel culture that I have ever read

152
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,100
If you could you can hear the trepidation in his quotes of like, um

153
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,420
It does seem to me that uh

154
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:47,420
Anyway, it's like he got a call from like other old white dude comedians and they're like, hey

155
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:53,260
Rowan buddy, we notice you getting a lot of press for man versus beat and you are of a certain age

156
00:12:53,260 --> 00:13:01,300
And your skin is white in your hand be gonna need you to make a comment about cancel culture

157
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
as is a

158
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,980
requirement it appears for

159
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,520
Everyone who is a straight white?

160
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:17,340
Cis dude of a certain age. Oh, you got a credit. I will say the credit where credits do

161
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:22,580
Yeah, you have to be

162
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,900
So deep in the paint on this belief system

163
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,780

Anguishing

00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:55,020
Thanks, yeah, it's given us it's given us I would say a lot to think about being

169
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:01,460
That hard to say. Yeah, you're right. I fucked up shouldn't have made that joke. I'll do better

170
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,900
Is that I don't even think I don't even think he said it

171
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,820
I think he's saying other people say he's look around he sees the way the winds blowing

172
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:13,740
He wonders when is spreading butter on toast with a fucking credit card gonna be problem. I'm attic

173
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,340
I don't know and he doesn't know you don't know that's the sword of Damocles swinging over his head

174
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:26,540
So let's let's begin the show yeah, it's an advice show as you know, here's some advice

175
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,020
Show your fucking mouth

176
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,680
Travis please everyone's opinion is incredible

177
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,680
Ah

178
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,320
Travis now which way think about the small body

179
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:46,360
Mm-hmm you punching cuz you're a bigger guy. You're a bigger guy than row. Oh, you're saying physically. Oh, yes. Okay physically

180
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,520
That's what it's meant the whole time. Oh

181
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,280
This is why everybody's always fucking ripping off Tom Hanks. Yes, so tall and so broad. It's why all we have to make our comedy

182
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:03,400
So weak because of our huge fucking bodies. Yeah, a big ripped muscles

183
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,680
We should stop working out so we could make fun of more people. That's why Tom Hanks is nice to everybody

184
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,400
It's cuz he's so worried. He'll notice there. He's all

185
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,720
Yeah

186
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,040
One V one me Tom one day Tom is gonna get mad, right?

187
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,600
He's gonna rip off his suit that he always wears and underneath this is gonna be huge

188
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,400
glistening fucking muscles and everyone's like we had no idea and he's like

189
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,080
Why'd you think I was so nice not now and then she's gonna punch through everyone's faces

190
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,820
You look at his you look at his eyes. They're the deadest eyes

191
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,960
Jedis eyes because all the life has drained down to his huge fists

192
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,240
Okay, this is my show. Oh real quick. Thanks to everybody who came out to our shows in

193
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,080
Boston and Mashantucket, Connecticut you all were really it was a really fun time

194
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:57,480
Especially to like the Platinum Rewards members or whatever at Foxwood's casino. Oh, can we just real quick?

195
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,600
Wandered in because they got free tickets if you're in their VIP program

196
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,760
So they're I got shows coming and they came in and a special shout out to the lady who then went to buy a poster

197
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,620
And said to the Merch person like I hated the show

198
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,320
But I will buy a poster and when asked why the response was I like that one's purple hair

199
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,040
So good. That's yours. Hey, thank you. Hey, thanks that money still folds, you know, whatever

200
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,400
Yeah, thanks to y'all that can't like they took a flyer on it

201
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,680
It's not for everybody, but they were like, you know what? I got a few minutes till the buffet opens

202
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,520
I'm just gonna duck in on the macaroons real quick. See what these cats are out to anyway

203
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,280
Thanks for coming. That's got to be a wild one to walk into but give good on yet

204
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,700
Thanks to everybody y'all look great

205
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:47,320
And if you want to see us for doing some more shows in July and in November and maybe some others keep it locked

206
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,320
Okay

207
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,300
Something I've been gun doing is painting on my front porch

208
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,880
I'm not very good, but I enjoy it just for sitting in the Sun laying my mind wander

209
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:05,680
However, one of my neighbors has seen me doing this several times and every time tells me I should put my art in the local

210
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,660
museum

211
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,400
The thing is she has never actually seen my work and she doesn't seem to be joking

212
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,520
In fact, she's begun asking me if I've sent my work to the gallery yet

213
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,240
And when I say no, she seems annoyed. How do I reclaim the contentment of painting on my porch?

214
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,120
That's from porch Picasso in Hamilton, Ontario

215
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,680
Art is if we've learned anything today subjective

216
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,920
Yeah, and so I bet right the right agent the right

217
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:40,040
I don't know dealer could sell your painting without anyone ever seeing it, you know what I mean?

218
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,640
And I can tell you exactly how and this is why I think I would be a great art agent

219
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,760
Okay, you hear me you're painting. Maybe it looks good. Maybe it looks like a dog shit

220
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,520
But I take like a literal like I take it to a rich

221
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,240
guy and I say

222
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,840
Check this art out and they say oh, that's interesting. I say yes

223
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,360
$50,000 and they say why I say well the elephant did paint it with his trunk. Oh

224
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,360
I

225
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,600
Love to meet the artist. It's a you can't he's too big

226
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,900
He's so good. You it's hard to get in places. I'll go to him

227
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,000
He's very territorial. His tusks are so sharp

228
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,760
but look at this and it's like it transcends the the

229
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,720
Elephant experience. Oh, yeah, it's really great. I'm just kind of into penguin art right now

230
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,600
Oh, well, let me see if I have any penguin art. Oh, here's one right here. It looks very same

231
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,760
It looks similar. I know but a penguin did this one. He's friends with the elephant. No way. Yeah, he did plagiarize

232
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:53,080
I'll tell you what. I'd love is if you could get a collab going between the two of them. Oh, here's that

233
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,160
Yeah, I'll take it. How much did you say?

234
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Well, this one's a hundred thousand cuz it was the collab between the pink penguin and the elephant. And so I

235
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,820
Have to pay them independently. Can I trade you this painting that was done by a tiger?

236
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,340
What if the painting is of the neighbor? Oh, wow

237
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,600
wait, they're like, did you send it in yet and you're like I

238
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Have not even begun

239
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,280
to capture

240
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:28,260
Tenth of a million of the light in my subjects eyes and then you spin it around and it's them

241
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,380
Yeah, and they're holding hands with the Joker. Yeah, and they're in it

242
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:40,700
Which Joker which Joker what which Joe come on the funniest Joker the only Joker I would say by the way

243
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,900
That's ever been funny the walkie-feet. Oh, you don't think the only funny Joker

244
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,300
Out of time and out of universe

245
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,140
So transgressive

246
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:58,860
Hey, is there anything funnier than the fact that everybody was clowning so hard at Morbius that Sony was like they love it

247
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,460
Let's put Morbius back in theaters and they had Lido up there on

248
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:08,900
Tick-tock like it's morbid time. Go see Morbius in theaters, baby. It's so funny, right? And then nobody went

249
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,420
What happened as I understand that

250
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:20,040
Morbid time was a viral joke and Jared Leto saw it was like

251
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,960
Yeah, and announced we're making Morbius too. And then Sony had to be like, uh, there are no plans to make Morbius, too

252
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,120
That's so Morbius. That's so Morbius. Did we do a Morbius watch?

253
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,160
I think we did do a Morbius. We were ahead of the curve on that one. Okay good

254
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,360
You need to show them the art and you will be able to

255
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,160
micro expression

256
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:49,960
judge whether or not they still believe it belongs in a museum or not and it's gonna be tough cuz they're gonna say like

257
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,960
Oh, yeah, that is

258
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,960
But that is perfection. That is poignant, but they're gonna make a face when they first see it like go to him

259
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,760
Oh damn, that can't go in a museum. Oh damn and you you will know from that

260
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,960
I think the next time they ask if it's in gallery just say yes

261
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,160
Just say yes

262
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
They'll be happy

263
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,920
The next time you see the next time you look in their window and see them cooking in the kitchen start pounding on their door

264
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,100
And they run to answer it be like just send that pie to the pie

265
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:30,920
Contest just so like they know what it's like when every single thing you do has to be adjudicated on the very highest level possible

266
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
in this case a pie contest

267
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,200
Or did you submit your painting to a pie contest

268
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,000
What why aren't there pie painting eating guns?

269
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,920
Thank you. I

270
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:54,600
Would love to watch I love watching YouTube art restoration videos, but they would be triple improved after sort of

271
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:02,860
dehydrating the work and repairing the the framework for the canvas and retacking it and you know doing a

272
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:09,100
you know very conservative touch-ups here and there and then they got out a big yummy plate and a knife and fork and they

273
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,560
Tucked in a bit and just went to town on it and got pretty sick

274
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:18,240
I'm guessing or what if it was like, what's it called? You guys are both video game nerds when it's like an unbalanced

275
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,480
Like PvP was that called when it's like one versus four something

276
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,280
Asymmetrical where one person is trying to restore the painting while someone else is trying to eat it

277
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,360
I see and it's like a race to see how much of it can get eaten before it's finished

278
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,200
How well you can restore it? That's getting eaten. That sounds good to me

279
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:46,400
I would watch the fuck out of that and also the floor is lava. Can we approach the wizard? Yeah. Yeah, let's go

280
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:52,200
Supplicate yourselves haters as we learn all about this one some a lot of people sent this in. Thank you

281
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,520
It's it is it's how to be a bro

282
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,980
I've done that. I have a I have siblings

283
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,520

Yeah Barney Samson Barney Brom Samson from how I did meet your mom

288
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:21,460
And so we are gonna start here with method one being a good bro live by a bro code every bros gotta have a code

289
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,220
It's the thing that unites and binds and solidifies the concept of the bro

290
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,300
Separating bro from the common beasts and squirrels of the world

291
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:35,060
You're broke your bro is and squirrels you say your bro code is up to you and your bros as well as the punishments for

292
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,780
Transgressing but a few rules are generally universal when it comes to bros never mess with your bros date sister or mother

293
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,400
Always have a bros back always take wingman responsibilities

294
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,180
Seriously bros won't make other bros look bad in front of girls bros

295
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:54,820
Don't let bros drive drunk that one. I don't think is typically in there, but it's the best one

296
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:01,940
It's awesome, right? It's a good. It's there should be more like that like bros help bros make smart fiscal investments

297
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,060
Yeah, right bros let other bros know when they should be

298
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,220
Don't let other bros lease because you're honestly just throwing your money

299
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:14,980
Yeah, bros help other bros remember to start preparing their taxes in like February and don't wait to the last minute

300
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:20,420
Find your neighbors and build up a brom unity bros. Fuck. I need to pay my taxes bros

Dereliction of bro duties on that we got to watch out

00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:54,440
Um, is that something you or anyone in this house would be interested in? It's Grecian if that helps

Bros, don't body-shame other bros, bro. Yeah, that's true. It's a broseur. I love it man. You look good

315
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:39,320
I love your confidence. I love how it makes you feel learn the proper bro shake when two bros meet

316
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,280
They don't shake hands like a couple of preachers and they certainly don't hug

317
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,460
What?

318
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:52,660
Bros don't hug guys or give each other preacher shakes. They bro-shake. They just gently touch-dance. It's a combination hug

319
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,940
They just give a feather soft kiss on the lips

320
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,300
Just butterflake it but broderflake

321
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,660
butterfly kisses butterfly kisses

322
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,180
Kisses my bro gets here

323
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:12,420
Gonna drink a hundred thousand cases of beer they

324
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,460
Feelings but we will never hug

325
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:23,040
Then he tries to drive home, but I won't let him cuz he's drunk they bro shake

326
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,140
It's like a combination hug high-five and arm wrestling match. In other words perfect for bros

327
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,540
They love and then you share a bro to visualize that is that the thing where they're like, bro

328
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:38,040
And then they're two hands like clasping arm wrestling fashion and they just swing it back and forth like big bodies together

329
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,900
Yeah, and touch this. I just don't understand. Why can't bros hug?

330
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:49,100
That's so weird. They hug in like they hug in band of brother. Well, you can hug Jocelyn

331
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,180
Sorry, you can hug you got to do handshake into hug pat pat break

332
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,260
Handshake into hug pat pat break. That's for bros

333
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:01,700
That's the Christians. I mean you got the Christian side hug and you can do a Christian side hug

334
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:07,300
But no hugs before bro marriage. It actually says the next step says abandon your faith in Christ only

335
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,580
But do keep your grades up keep your grades up it says

336
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:19,420
Bros help other rose cram for tests. I'm gonna skip around here. Say what you mean the world is yeah

337
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:26,820
Too many complicated things conversing with your bros shouldn't be one of them. You should have open bro-munication. Um

338
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:31,500
If you're pissed that your bro borrowed your car and didn't fill it up say dude next time fill it up

339
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,180
Word if you're upset that your bro

340
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:43,060
Borrowed your copy of Iron Giant and didn't rewind it before giving it back because you still believe in VHS

341
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,060
That's another thing about bros fucking love

342
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:49,460
It is yeah, they take DVDs hate they hate digital media

343
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,860
They like to have a collection a brolection if you will that they can show other bros. That's very important

344
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,540
Always be rallying just like Joe Montana in the Super Bowl

345
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:05,020
I don't under and ready at the Indy 500 he drives or Michael Jordan in the playoffs

346
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:10,980
I know that one good bros can't stop and won't stop whether you're partying working out or plugging through another round of Madden on

347
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,800
Xbox because bros she's not Sony phonies

348
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:23,180
But that's a shame. That's a shame because brony is well, that's a different thing. Isn't it? It's a different thing now Griffin

349
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:31,420
It's possible that I'm now starting to suspect reading between the lines here that this article is written by someone a lot like us

350
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,060
Because all of their sports

351
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:41,580
Memories and references are at least 20 years old. There's no way that the person who wrote. This is an actual bro. He's in

352
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,100
There's no way at all

353
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,500
You reference Joe Montana in the Super Bowl. Yeah, like it's big

354
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,120
It's so much better fine bro inspirations the image for this one is pretty good

355
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,460
It's just two boys looking at a big blow-up of a cover of men's journal featuring Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps

356
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,340
This is awesome for me

357
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:03,260
Every bro should have some famous bros look up to swipe lingo from and in general idolizes the pinnacles of brodom

358
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,940
Some classics of bros include Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps

359
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,460
Guys one time I got kicked in the brodom

360
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,460
Tim Tebow Johnny man's yell Derek Jeter and Chad Johnson

361
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:22,700
On new line Will Smith Channing Tatum Matthew McConaughey, do they hang?

362
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,220
I don't gotta gotta hang now I could see

363
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,140
McConaughey and Tatum because they were in the dancing movies together. I

364
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:38,060
Could see that one. They're making the Danzig movie together making the Danzig movie

365
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:45,060
I'm making the Danzig movie together, of course, and I believe I believe Tatum is running as McConaughey's a vice

366
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,700
Governor. Yeah

367
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,700
assistant governor

368
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Broven or excuse me

369
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:57,620
The next one is the bros from epic mealtime and then finally just to wrap it all up and I would love to be a fly

370
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:04,580
In this fucking wall of the room that these boys are in Dane Cook Jim Belushi and Joe Rogan. What's that?

371
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,020
Hang out. What is it?

372
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,740
I'm gonna open the door. What's that smell?

373
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:17,780
What is the smell in this room Dane Jim and Joe what have you all been doing in here Dane Jim and Joe

374
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,580
Who are your guys like bro idols?

375
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:25,580
Who do you look up to when you're like you're hanging out with your bros and you're like, this is who I want to be

376
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,580
like oh, man

377
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,620
Fucking Malcolm Gladwell. Yeah. Hell yeah

378
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,620
fucking

379
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:40,420
Jimmy Carter those two bros. They love hanging out and love to hang out fucking David Copperfield

380
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,420
Fucking

381
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:51,300
Homer Simpson, yeah, bro. Mr. Simpson fucking Jesus Christ and Bronin O'Brien

382
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,980
So that's that part and try to make it guys try to make every day epic

383
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,380
A bros just like a regular dude except more exciting

384
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:07,380
You got to be in constant search that next epic moment tweaking every situation to make it just a little more perfect

385
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:14,900
Now I will say I have been in many a bar and location where bros have come in and there is I don't know that the word

386
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,340
I would use is excitement, but there is a definite. Oh no kind of feeling

387
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:25,220
There's a what's about to happen now kind of feeling. Is that excitement? Is that or is it fight-or-flight?

388
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,940
Well, let me give you some great examples here Travis and these are just normal things

389
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,740
I would suggest everybody does don't go out to dinner with your bros

390
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:39,220
But make epic eating occasions seek out 72 ounce steak eating challenges or spicy food eating challenges to make it competitive

391
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:44,500
Never let the loser live it down bro. Wait, did you start off with don't go out to eat with your bros?

392
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:50,260
Don't go out to dinner with your bros, but make epic eating occasions. Don't know wait. No, what let me go

393
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,260
Don't go to class

394
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,140
Don't keep this is specific. This is whoa

395
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,140
unprecedented

396
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,740
Don't keep your grades up. Don't go to class seek out epic new ways of integrating information. You're misreading it

397
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,740
No, just this is what it says

398
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:10,500
Research and yeah, you've been handed a knockoff wiki how article. This cannot be this is from sticky

399
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,340
How get out of here? Hey, I just want to jump back real quick when they say don't go out to dinner with your bros

400
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:21,780
But do you like plan like 72 is it like there's a 72 ounce steak eating challenge

401
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,740
I would love to do that with you sometime, but we can't make plans to do it

402
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,260
But if we both end up there, it's cool

403
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:36,260
Don't go to class seek out epic new ways of integrating information research optimum workout routines to maximize your learning retention and record

404
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:41,460
Routines to maximize your learning retention and record lectures on your iPod while you multitask in the lecture hall what?

405
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,060
Work out in the lecture hall

406
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:49,660
Make your presence in class epic by answering questions arguing with the prof and making your presence known

407
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:54,220
Hey prof now this this seems like this is now

408
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,900
Headed towards how to be like a totally ripped

409
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,220
Like figure in a God's not dead movie. Yes

410
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,060
Yes, but if God's not dead, how do you explain these gains? Yeah

411
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:14,540
I've been worshiping at the iron temple and the Southern Baptist Church down the street

412
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:21,760
Do we have the fortitude as an organization to release a t-shirt which reads?

413
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,380
God's not dead. How do you explain these?

414
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:32,580
Gains, I'm also realizing that the knot in their face. They're wildly confused

415
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:44,740
Now it makes it seem like these games are crime against God so God's not dead if God was dead

416
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,740
The only way I could have these gains is

417
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,060
Living God

418
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,820
I acquiesced to a challenge of his power. He wouldn't stop to this

419
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,740
See these fucking gates my eyes on the throne

420
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,060
God is dead. I killed

421
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:13,640
I punched up way way up. I got him guys. I pushed up so hard. I got him

422
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,260
Got him

423
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:23,060
Not you know what whenever I say that and we don't actually make the shirt. Someone else makes the shirt

424
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,740
Well have to make it I don't think we can make that shirt

425
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:31,900
That's my best if we let that one I'm gonna just tell McKay to start working on it right now. Don't McKay, please don't

426
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:39,280
There's a lot of fashion ones of how you can be like a athletic gear bro or a gentleman, bro

427
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,340
My favorite is my favorites the motocross gentleman

428
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:48,980
Bro always leaves his calling card of the scene of the crime try out the motocross bro

429
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:54,100
Gearhead metal listening SoCal bros have their own style and vibe all together

430
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,860
You can see these sorts of bros at the vans warped to tour or at the skate park

431
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:04,620
Typically, they'll be decked out in the following entire long dickies shorts skate shoes like vans or air walk flat brim hats black socks

432
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:10,860
Pulled all the way up. This is more about their long dickies Griffin. It sounds like ska bro more than anything, which is

433
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,820
Love that here and then the last part is like

434
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,580
We want you to this is to keep your grades up of it and it's called avoiding stereotypes

435
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:26,840
It includes tips such as drink responsibly treat women respectfully eat a well-balanced diet and drive responsibly. I

436
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,100
Mean, yeah, okay fine, but that just seems like human

437
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:38,540
Responsibility they didn't start the article with this section for a reason because they wanted you to have like a lot of fun

438
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:45,380
And like think about all the epic times. Yeah. Yeah eating a big steak and then the spiciest food ever to give you

439
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,900
some sort of new

440
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,720
scientifically advanced

441
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,020
macho Rhea

442
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,740
That would be something that we could write about in medical journals

443
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:01,100
This is all bros always carry Toms for their bros with with soft tummies

444
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,980
I want to circle back to try to make everyday epic because there's a bit I didn't read which is don't go on dates

445
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,580
Go on adventures dinner in a movie. That's for regular dudes

446
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:16,940
Take the cutie from econ whitewater rafting or ask the hot barista at your favorite coffee shop to go to a metal concert tonight

447
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,240
Take your semi-serious date to the racquetball court and see what you're made of

448
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:28,860
Hey never ask anyone out and tell them that it's a semi-serious date they will wait

449
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:35,180
Don't get weird. Don't get weird. You can't tell them. It's a semi-charmed kind of date. That's a different thing 15 love

450
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:41,500
I love you. What what they lift up this head. You see me pick up a heavy thing. I do

451
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,420
Let's see that big guy over there. I'm gonna pick him up

452
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,300
I'll pick up this bench

453
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,660
That's all I don't want to read any more of this but it is helpful

454
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,700
I think if you want to if you do want to live this life, you know, don't hurt anyone

455
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:02,160
That's beautiful. Thank you. If you want to live this bro life and you want to be like

Pinnacle human Ryan Lochte then this is your chance to do that

459
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:16,060
If you want to kick it in a room with Dane Cook Jim Belushi and Joe Rogan, and what are they talking about?

460
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,940
They're talking about

461
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,820
woke culture

462
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,260
Probably. Yeah, I mean, let's be honest

463
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:29,320
Fucking it's it's Jim Belushi. Here's what the conversation is. Jim Belushi is like, hey guys have I been canceled?

464
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:34,900
I feel like I should have been by now. It's I've got that vibe. But like I don't know if I actually have been or not

465
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,420
help

466
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:43,340
Which okay wait, hold on so I just want to talk about Joe Rogan Jim Belushi and Jane cook for a second

467
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:48,940
Who do you think no? No, I have to know who is the connecting person mayor, right?

468
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:54,260
Who was a friend that they all know right? You can't tell me they all know each other equally, right?

469
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:59,860
Is it Dane Cook and her friend Dane Cook is friends with both of them or is it Joe Rogan?

470
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:04,860
That's friends with both of it's got to be that right. They were all actually, you know, it was they were all in that

471
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:11,800
12 angry men remake. Oh, right, right, right. Well angry, bro. It's 12 furious bros. Yeah

472
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,900
Yeah, God Jim Belushi was so fucking funny in that movie

473
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,700
Do you remember we stabbed that is like there's no chance anyone else would have that knife and then you stab the knife down

474
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:25,300
But it you you know, it went in into Dane Cook's hand and he was like, oh shit

475
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,460
Fucking challenging challenging stuff. You know what? I think it's the most challenging

476
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:36,700
Comedy when you say the same shit people have been saying for the last 20 years fucking challenging

477
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,540
It's hard when you do that because it's like you have to say it and like it you have to say it in like a silly

478
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,220
voice

479
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,940
Right hard to cut it's really hard to come up with those and also we should be careful about

480
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,940
Criticizing people for making the same jokes over and over again

481
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:54,780
We've been doing this show for about 50 years. Yeah, but we make the same stupid

482
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:01,220
Let's go to making mean Joe or we try to now the only people are mean to is

483
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:07,020
Old straight. Well, every joke has a victim Travis. Yeah, I guess that's true

484
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:16,100
You know now that you say it Griffin, I think it's time to go to the money zone. Yeah

485
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:25,100
Griffin you got any big summer plans? You gonna travel to like Italy or France?

486
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,780
Yeah, I was thinking about doing a sort of Italy France

487
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,020
Germany

488
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:38,660
Spain those the whole circuit just getting the big four the big four as we call them. Well, it's probably a little too late now

489
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:46,060
But you should start working on babble to learn all four of those languages in time for your summer trip

490
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:52,260
Oh, I know all of the languages to the countries you do. Did you use babble to do it? I did

491
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,340
Yeah, I learned Italian and I learned all of them. Yeah

492
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:01,540
Yeah, well, it actually makes a lot of sense because it only takes ten minutes to complete a lesson

493
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:06,700
So you're gonna start having real-life conversations in a new language in as little as three weeks

494
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:13,100
Hmm now other language learning apps use AI for their lessons plan and their love is real

495
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:20,380
But they are not but babble lessons were created by over a hundred and fifty language experts

496
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:25,340
All in one room. It was tower of babble up in and that's how they got the name

497
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,180
Yeah, and they want to let out till they solved it with babble

$500 and we said take that

504
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,780

543
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:30,540
Fuck you make this so hard. It doesn't have to be this hard. I said question me a question

544
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:35,020
Whip them up a question right now. You make this so hard loving me

545
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,940
I

546
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:41,740
Like the show general where we at are you the victim wait the whole time is Justin

547
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,900
That actually makes perfect sense. Hey brothers, so I met this

548
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,820
girl

549
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:51,100
That I think is pretty cool. All right, and well, yeah

550
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:59,260
Yeah, bro, yeah, yeah pretty cool, huh, but yeah, I get it what's her sense of humor like me she's rich

551
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:04,620
Yeah, we're talking to her one day. You heard me when I showed her this cute frog picture. I saw from instagram

552
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,020
Now I love frogs like every other guy

553
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,740
But now what that's the weirdest sexism I've ever heard in my entire life

554
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:20,700
Like every other guy like every dude I love frogs now whenever I talk to her she only ever sends posts of frogs

555
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,180
I'm not like super obsessed with frogs

556
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:28,140
So how'd I get out of this frog purgatory so I can move on from this frog talk?

557
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,980
Thanks brothers, and that's from frog friend frenzy

558
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,020
Uh, you can start throwing some toads in there

559
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:42,240
Oh, yeah, and then oh and then like a salamander. Yeah, walk it out to other sort of amphibians

560
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,260
It's a salamander amphibian

561
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:51,980
Uh, I think uh, wait, what's the one that has like a philly neck from he's a straight up phibian. Yeah

562
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:58,060
Yeah, yeah axolotl. I think is another one that's amphib. Yeah, that's a that's a fibby. They love water

563
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,500
Juice you got any fun frog?

564
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,540
I don't know. You don't have any frog facts, but I do want to say

565
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:10,140
The problem is you got to open up a bit. Yeah, this is the only thing this person knows about there

566
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:15,420
It is it's your frog thing. You got to let him know some other things about you that you care more about

567
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,860
It seems like she's invested in you in one way or another

568
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:25,820
Right, she likes talking to you. She was like this person likes frogs. I'm going to show them frogs

569
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,820
Everybody's got like everybody's had that experience if you have a new

570
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,900
uh a new relationship you're trying to foment and

571
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,380
you're you're the fertilizer that you've chosen for it is like

572
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:45,820
The one you just find one little bit of common ground, you know, this is actually that's oh you you have also seen

573
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,380
like

574
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,500
You know

575
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,940
All of oz and you're like that you I have to make that my entire life right now for the rest of this

576
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:59,420
Conversation like all I care about is oz or else i'm not getting out of this conversation alive

577
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,380
Like that kind of vibe and you've just done that with frog

578
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:08,860
It's so fun the way that you see human interactions. Justin. It's so great. Really. How do you mean trap go on?

579
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:13,980
The idea of getting out of a conversation alive. It's just it's wonderful

580
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,040
Have you ever died juice you ever died from a conversation?

581
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,180
No, because i'm a fucking professional

582
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,400
Because he's constantly got his head on a swivel exactly because I because I keep my shit

583
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,920
I keep my fucking powder dry and my shit tight

584
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,440
He's got one finger over the eject button at all times

585
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,960
I don't go into a conversation without an x-file plan, right? Like of course, it's fine

586
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:49,600
I had a coverage we had there was a very nice gentleman that we met at the casino as we were or

587
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,640
Sorry, I guess it's a resort, you know after the show we have

588
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,200
there's a guy who's like

589
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,760
The the weirdest thing about the show is that it's in a self-contained location. So there's signs of us

590
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:05,120
Like pictures of us big ones while you're eating lunch or like going to the store

591
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:10,560
Or up there using that they put up one of me in the bathroom their posters like our posters

592
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,240
And this fella behind us in line to get coffee is like hey

593
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,880
You guys are the brothers

594
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,240
And we're like, yeah, that's us. He's like I didn't go to this show, but I thought about it. I was like, okay

595
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,200
What kind of show is it? We're like, that's kind of a bad advice show

596
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,280
And he was like, oh, okay, and and then like three minutes pass

597
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
and he came back to us and he was like

598
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,040
I'm, sorry. Can you just give me an example of the kind of question?

599
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,040
Yeah, oh my heart is racing right now, I know right

600
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,360
travis

601
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,800
stepped in

602
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:48,480
And travis does not have my sort of like hang up so he's able to just actually talk to people

603
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:54,960
But he that he goes in a little hot sometimes and he said well like last night we had one

604
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,120
where a

605
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,760
Person's partner was drinking too much milk. Uh-huh

606
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,920
and he's like

607
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,280
Okay

608
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,240
Oh see justin

609
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,040
Let me tell you what I was thinking in that moment when that was my answer

610
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,480
This person wants an excuse to not listen to our show

611
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,200
right, like

612
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,920
We are all all of us looking for excuses to not listen to a podcast

613
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,920
Right the name of the show is literally plastered all over the place, right? Yeah

614
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,960
So he wanted to be like do I care enough about it?

615
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,880
So I was like i'm gonna give you the lowest bar I can think of

616
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,120
We had a question about milk and if you're like, I know okay

617
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,800
That was all I needed to to bump me off of it. You're welcome

So chicken rings

676
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:52,240
The crispy uniquely shaped chicken rings are made with all white meat chicken

677
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,380
And they're sure to leave cravers satisfied

678
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,800
While not taking a big bite out of their wallets if you find yourself craving chicken rings

679
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,520
You should seek help and don't bite your wallet

680
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,360
No

681
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:09,120
Here's jamie. I mean unless unless you're like setting a bone

682
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,240
In like a wilderness scenario and you need to bite down on something

683
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,920
Bite down on something

684
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,680
Then like you've dislocated a shoulder while running away from like the predator

685
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,440
Bite down on your wallet so you don't like swallow your tongue. I could see that

686
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,840
Jamie richardson vice president white castle seems to have conflated the restaurant with some sort of eldritch text

687
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,920
Let's check in with jamie

688
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:39,440
A hot and tasty meal at an appetizing price is how we feed the souls of craver generations everywhere

692
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:59,760
And will help cravers. Enjoy a hot summer treat while not breaking the bank. Can you imagine a world?

693
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,480
Where they made chicken rings, but they were expensive

694
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,640
Hey, it's me jamie from white castle

695
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,440
Um, so these chicken rings each ring individual ring does cost 20

696
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:21,840
But the reason is we realized it was easier to simply genetically modified chickens to grow in kind of a slinky shape tubular

697
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,200
And that science cost a lot guys, um

698
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,640
And you know and nowhere do we stop to think if we should

699
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:36,640
Um, and that one's on us, uh, but you're gonna love these hollow chicken flavor. It's fun
