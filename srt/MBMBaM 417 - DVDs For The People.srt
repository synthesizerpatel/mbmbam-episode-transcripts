1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:50,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to a much more distinguished My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,640
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,400
Salutations. I am your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. Now, let me sip this tea.

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,880
Kindest, warmest greetings and regards. I'm Professor Griffin McElroy.

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,480
Professor.

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,160
And my voice sounds different, not because I'm sick, but because I'm distinguished and

11
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,680
talking to you through a mahogany pipe full of rich and sweet tobacco.

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,760
Yes. We are, of course, a little different because now we are, how you say, authors.

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,600
We've been on a book tour, as they say in the biz.

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,080
We've gone through the change that happens once you are published. It's called Puberty.

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,160
Puberty? Because we've been public.

16
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,720
That's very good.

17
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,120
Thank you very much.

18
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:50,640
And now that you have seen we are number one New York Times bestselling authors

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,960
on the paper book list, they make you mention that.

20
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,920
And some people say-

21
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,760
Yeah, a lot of people would say paperback, but when you're a number one author,

22
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,720
they let you say it incorrectly.

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,640
So you have to forgive Justin for his confusion.

24
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,960
We've had nothing to eat for the past 12 days, but fresh baguettes and the lack of

25
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,640
vitamins is really starting to get- just cappuccinos and fresh baguettes.

26
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,440
Cappuccinos and fresh baguettes.

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,880
So many cappuccinos.

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,040
Some people have said, so you're a bestselling author now, I have to tell them

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:33,040
anyone on the list is a bestseller. I am a number one bestselling author of a book my dad mostly

30
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,080
wrote called The Adventures of- and then they leave before my sentence is even finished.

31
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,080
I went to college for five years because I got a D in Spanish.

32
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,520
Anybody can be a New York Times bestselling author.

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,560
I mean, fucking literally anybody can just let their dad write ones of a book.

34
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,160
Yeah, get a really talented artist to do a lot of pictures.

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,360
Get an extremely talented artist to do the heavy lifting.

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,120
So nobody notices it's a version of your podcast that you did about-

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,400
That they've already heard.

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,440
That they've already heard.

39
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,440
Oh my God.

40
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,160
Those baguettes taste the same either way, don't they?

41
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,160
It's fine to be on the New York Times bestselling list for paperbacks.

42
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,800
That's fine.

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:34,160
But I didn't write 15% of this book for the money because when you split it five ways,

44
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,280
there isn't a lot.

45
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,920
But the other thing is I didn't write this book for money.

46
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,960
I wrote it for a claim.

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:45,200
I want to be on the list of- is there one that's like fanciest books,

48
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,680
like our favorite books for this fancy time?

49
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,560
Bestselling book.

50
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
Uh-huh.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,120
Yeah, I'll say this about the book.

52
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,480
It's got a lot of great jokes, great story, very cool art, some real badass fights.

53
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,680
The smell is unremarkable.

54
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,440
The smell, there's no sort of leathery notes, no smells of rich tobacco like this very fine

55
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,480
pipe I've been smoking for a while, which again explains the voice.

56
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,280
And yeah, I suggested to the publisher that we get some sort of scent spray,

57
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,200
some sort of body spray that we could sort of get on the books.

58
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,400
But they said it would be a big soggy mess.

59
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,840
Man, I sound fucking terrible, huh?

60
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,120
I think you sound great.

61
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,280
No, I sound like a fucking human didgeridoo.

62
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:39,360
I wrote 15% of a book that mostly my daddy wrote because I'm hoping it opens some doors

63
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,680
for me, specifically the door to the 33 Club at Disneyland.

64
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,120
That's really why I wrote, I spent two years sort of working on this book just because

65
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,600
I want to go to the 33 Club in Disneyland.

66
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,080
It is literally the only thing that I want in my life.

67
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,120
I have two life goals.

68
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,560
One, get season three of Pete and Pete out on DVD.

69
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,960
Two, get into the 33 Club.

70
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,880
My whole thing was that I just wanted to get, the New York Times list is great.

71
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,000
We also placed number seven on the USA Today list and that was where I really wanted to

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,280
land was above Dan Brown.

73
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,240
And we did that by one spot with a bullet.

74
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,440
He was number eight.

75
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,680
And so it allowed me to finally say out loud, eat my ass, Dan Brown.

76
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,840
Huff my shorts, Dan Brown.

77
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,560
I did it.

78
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
Here's a Da Vinci code for you.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,960
I beat your book.

80
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,640
Dan Brown had to accept it.

81
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,080
Yeah, he got nothing to do about it.

82
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,200
Here's a Da Vinci code for you.

83
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,600
Up, up, down, down, B-A, eat my ass.

84
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,160
I beat you.

85
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,320
And there's nothing you can do about it.

86
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,640
Hey Dan Brown, solve my dick.

87
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,600
Hey, solve my dick.

88
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,640
Tom Hanks is mine now.

89
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
Katharine Stata-Jones is mine now.

90
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,120
Mine.

91
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,080
Is Stevie King with your book The Outsider?

92
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,520
Sure, it's been out for a few months now and a lot of people have bought it already, but hey.

93
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,360
So we're going to be fucking insufferable for a little bit, but I promise you that

94
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,080
The Shine is going to come off the Apple eventually.

95
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,160
I will say I have noticed that there are some books on that bestseller list where it's like

96
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,800
weeks on the list like 48, 72.

97
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,640
I expect to be off it by next week.

98
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,360
There's no questione in my mind.

99
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,920
We are off that motherfucker by next week.

100
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,320
There's no conceivable reality that the world has not righted itself.

101
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,320
The sound you heard last Tuesday was a bunch of glasses being pushed up Moses like,

102
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:39,440
Oh no, how could they? Please, everyone, buy regular books.

103
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,640
Yeah, by next week you'll just hear a loud slide whistle as we slide back down to the bottom.

104
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,880
A loud academic sigh of relief.

105
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,440
It's great.

106
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,200
I got really nervous for a second when you said that, Juice, because I have done a lot of press

107
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,960
since the big announcement where I called our book the Titanic of books because I thought it

108
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:08,080
was going to stay, but now I realize that can still be true in a way, but just referring to

109
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,920
a different sort of Titanic.

110
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,960
The real one.

111
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,560
Oh boy, we should get going.

112
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,000
I think I've got probably about 45 minutes of voice juice in me.

113
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,480
Delicious voice juice.

114
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,720
Not gross at all is what it says on the label.

115
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,000
Let's all take a sip of voice juice and enjoy out kidding aside.

116
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,560
Thank you for if you're listening.

117
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,240
It's unfucking believable like y'all have come out and supported us in the past,

118
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,280
but like this is this is obviously new echelon.

119
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,360
It feels like I can kind of be honest.

120
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,840
It feels like less this gesture in particular feels like less a supportive

121
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,120
move for us and more of a prank on earth.

122
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,080
Like it feels like the like you're like you're trolling earth, which is great.

123
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,280
Like no, no, no complaints here.

124
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,240
Uh, here we go.

125
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,200
Let's help earth on a break from work today while cycling down a fairly

126
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,080
well-traveled road.

127
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
I found a wallet brothers.

128
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,440
This wallet was stacked trying to do the right thing.

129
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,480
I picked up the wallet.

130
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,600
I found an ID there in and immediately sent the owner a message on Facebook so

131
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,920
that I could return the seriously comically overpacked wallet.

132
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,520
They're very they really want to reinforce.

133
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,960
This is a thick wallet.

134
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,880
Here's the thing upon trying to work.

135
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,280
Upon trying to work, I discovered that I too had lost the wallet.

136
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,400
Oh my God.

137
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,520
No, come on.

138
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,080
Oh no.

139
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,440
I traced back over my bike route to no avail.

140
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,640
The owner hasn't yet responded to my message, but brothers, what do I do?

141
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,280
And he does.

142
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,800
Oh my God.

143
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,400
Holy fucking shit.

144
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,240
That's from a properly panicking in Portland.

145
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,640
That's the worst story I've ever heard in my entire life.

146
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,760
This is the end.

147
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,880
That's the worst thing I've ever heard in my entire life.

148
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,680
It's the worst imaginable situation.

149
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,520
That's the worst thing.

150
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,000
There is no way for you to respond when this person responds to you

151
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,640
without sounding like you've decided to keep the wallet.

152
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,320
There is no way.

153
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:14,960
Wow.

154
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,600
Fuck.

155
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,080
All right.

156
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,960
Let's all right.

157
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,320
Now we've we've indulged ourselves in this panic.

158
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,800
Sometimes it feels good to sort of be part of the panic,

159
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,000
but now let's see if we can't help them dig out.

160
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,840
The truth ain't gonna cut it.

161
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,120
Truth will not set you free.

162
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,640
Truth will put you jail.

163
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,520
Actually this one.

164
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,920
Because truth will sound like a lie?

165
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:36,800
Yeah.

166
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,360
Now you had some time at that wallet and it is important that you start right now.

167
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,160
You should have started immediately as soon as you realized that you forgot.

168
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,440
Start sort of writing down everything you know about the wallet.

169
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,280
I'm talking about get a fucking professional sketch artist in there

170
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,760
and you start describing everything about the wallet.

171
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,680
Color, make, material, model, monogram maybe,

172
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,520
contents, cards, library, credit, identification.

173
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,800
How stacked was it?

174
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,000
How stacked was it?

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,160
And when you say that, are you talking about money

176
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,040
or are you saying like it had like a sexy bod?

177
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,240
I'm not entirely sure, but you need to start putting all this together.

178
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,600
You have, I would estimate,

179
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,160
it depends on when you sent this in,

180
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,680
but I would say about 48 hours to completely recreate this wallet.

181
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,240
You're gonna have some trouble in the identification department.

182
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,320
You're gonna have some trouble in the credit card department.

183
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,200
This will be the first sort of white hat credit card fraud

184
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,120
I've ever heard of in my entire life.

185
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,960
But that's literally, that's it.

186
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,120
That is all like you're gonna need a forger.

187
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,800
You're gonna need an architect.

188
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,440
You're gonna need to inception the fuck out of this situation

189
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,760
because you are in way too deep.

190
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,600
There's also a possibility that this wallet is cursed

191
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,400
and maybe like once it gets a certain distance away

192
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,560
from its permanent location,

193
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,840
it just like disapparates and returns there.

194
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,720
Oh my God.

195
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,200
You know what I mean?

196
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,400
Like this wallet can't leave where you found it

197
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,800
because that's where that wallet was murdered

198
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,200
in a gruesome fashion over 50 years ago.

199
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,160
Yeah, my wallet, you found my wallet.

200
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,160
It's got tickets to the red legs game.

201
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,800
It's, I lost that wallet 50 years ago.

202
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,760
The Washington sentinels were et cetera, et cetera.

203
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,920
If you don't share this podcast episode 10 times

204
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,880
in the next 10 minutes,

205
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,200
then the wallet curse is gonna spread to your wallet.

206
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,520
Yeah.

207
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,200
It happened to my dad.

208
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,400
What's in your wallet?

209
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,520
A ghost.

210
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:29,840
Yeah.

211
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,440
Oh man, I've been trying to cook up some like,

212
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,920
I was gonna swoop in with something practical.

213
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,840
There's fucking literally nothing you can do.

214
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,240
You know what's so wild about it is that the person,

215
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,280
this person, okay, person one lost the wallet.

216
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,400
Person two found the wallet, then they lost it.

217
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,560
Person one, when they find out about this latest development

218
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,040
is gonna be very, very frustrated

219
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,640
by our question asker here

220
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,600
and they'll have literally no cause to ethically speaking.

221
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,080
Like they're not worse off than they were

222
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,920
before this person tried to do a nice thing.

223
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,840
You're just being punished by the universe

224
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,200
for trying to help somebody.

225
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,320
It's unfathomable.

226
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,240
If nothing else, I will actually say

227
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,600
that person who lost the wallet originally is better off

228
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,320
because at least now question asker can say,

229
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,400
when I last saw it, there was still money in it.

230
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,400
So you still have hope.

231
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,440
Yeah.

232
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
Did you take a picture of yourself with the wallet

233
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,040
in today's newspaper?

234
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,760
Just to let them know that it is doing okay.

235
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,000
But maybe your early edition

236
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,560
and you stole the wallet money yesterday.

237
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,440
Think about it.

238
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,040
I'm flipping on this a little bit.

239
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,400
I think you messaged them and say like,

240
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,680
ah shit, I lost it too.

241
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,040
And if they say, what the fuck?

242
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,880
You say, you don't really have a leg to stand on.

243
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,040
You are also a wallet loser.

244
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,400
So you know how it feels.

245
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,040
Like, you know I feel bad right now because you feel bad

246
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,560
because you also lost the wallet.

247
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,240
I just did the same thing you did.

248
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,600
Maybe there are other people out there

249
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,920
who have lost this wallet and we can find each other

250
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,240
and like just console each other

251
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,160
and maybe form some sort of like sisterhood

252
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,240
of the traveling pants club, you know?

253
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,920
Yeah, well.

254
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,280
Friendhood of the lost wallets.

255
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,160
Sure.

256
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,760
Is that clear?

257
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, how about it? I mean, you broke up very badly in Skype.

258
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,440
I don't know if that happened for juice too.

259
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah, it did.

260
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,440
But I'm just gonna, you know what?

261
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,080
I'm just gonna agree with whatever Travis just said.

262
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,560
It's a real roll the dice moment, but I'm gonna do it.

263
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,040
Whatever you said, Travis, absolutely.

264
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,000
It was good.

265
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,880
I stand by it.

266
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
I just said that you broke up in Skype.

267
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,720
We're not using Skype right now

268
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,480
because it updated all of us to the new version

269
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,680
without our consent.

270
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,120
And we don't usually like sort of complain

271
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,880
about tech stuff on here.

272
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,320
We're not, you know, reply all,

273
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,880
but that's not really what they do on the show either.

274
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,960
They just complain about their Skype calls.

275
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,360
Yeah, it is the worst.

276
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,160
I don't know if anybody from Microsoft listens to the show.

277
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,920
It is the worst I've ever seen an application be tweaked.

278
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,480
We literally could not use it.

279
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
Like we couldn't use it because it wouldn't do the call good.

280
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,640
Like it wouldn't, not only do the call good,

281
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,920
it wouldn't do the call.

282
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,640
It's the worst.

283
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,080
It's fucking so bad.

284
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,200
This is for nobody.

285
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,520
Maybe we need to do a reply all crossover

286
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
where we just like, please fix Skype.

287
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,560
Please don't fix Skype.

288
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,920
Just go back to destroy it.

289
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,440
Original Skype wasn't even that great,

290
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,360
but we could at least use it to record a podcast

291
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,160
three times a week.

292
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,600
Anyway, here's a Yahoo that was sent in by so many people.

293
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,920
Thank you.

294
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Donald.

295
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,320
He looks so cool.

296
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,360
He's wearing like shiny, like reflective sunglasses

297
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,840
and just a nice strong face.

298
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,360
Says, in the TV show Friends,

299
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,800
what was the point of Ross?

300
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,120
Okay.

301
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,440
He was so cringe and had stupid hair.

302
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,400
Now that seems mean.

303
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,520
I wish I hadn't seen the last part of it.

304
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,600
He did not have stupid hair.

305
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,400
Yeah.

306
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,960
I also just like despise the word cringe

307
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,880
and how it's used in the internet,

308
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,080
but it brings up a good point.

309
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,920
What was the point of Ross?

310
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,360
What was Ross's whole point?

311
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,120
Like what was the point of him?

312
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,640
Well, he was the every man, Griffin.

313
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,520
Well, he was the surrogate.

314
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,000
Well, see, we look at the Joey,

315
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,800
your quintessential, the Joey and the Joey is there.

316
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,640
He's charming, but perhaps a little bit,

317
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,840
I would say not the sharpest, you know, sharpest spoon.

318
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,440
Yeah, sort of a goof,

319
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,280
but with like a lot of sort of raw,

320
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,800
just potent sexual energy.

321
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,200
And I suppose Ross is a foil to that.

322
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,520
Yes.

323
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,280
And maybe Joey's sexual energy is at times terrible.

324
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,440
Yeah.

325
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,880
And he's a terrible person.

326
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,280
He loved to eat sandwiches.

327
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,880
And Ross, I don't think we ever saw him eat even one sandwich.

328
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,800
Well, and with your Chandlers,

329
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,680
Chandlers tend to make the jokes.

330
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,280
He would say things that I sometimes think

331
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,720
he didn't actually believe.

332
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:46,960
What?

333
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,920
Yeah, I know.

334
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,200
It's just a cool thing.

335
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,960
And then he fell in love with Monica

336
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,680
and Ross never fell in love.

337
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,080
So there's another sort of difference

338
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,920
between him and the other boys.

339
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,760
Now your Monicas are very driven.

340
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,080
Monica has a lot of drive, yeah.

341
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,680
Very clean, organized.

342
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,280
Falls in love with Chandler, which is something

343
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,600
that her, I guess, brother Ross never does.

344
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,160
Correct.

345
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,600
My daughter was actually-

346
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,640
I'm not done.

347
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,280
You gotta let Travis finish, Justin.

348
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,480
Now your Phoebe's, they're a bit of a free spirit, Griffin.

349
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,080
Can't tie them down.

350
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,520
Ross, I would say, is not a free spirit.

351
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,280
Whatever you got is a completely captured spirit.

352
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,080
Now your Rachel's, this is where it gets a little tricky.

353
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,840
They have great hair.

354
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

355
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,680
Reductionist.

356
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,520
Ross tried to love Rachel, didn't he?

357
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:37,760
Yeah.

358
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,800
But she didn't do it back because he was such a goober

359
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,760
and he had the monkey and was very cringe.

360
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,080
Now the monkey, your Marcel's, they are the greatest of us.

361
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,800
Yeah, sure.

362
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,640
They are truly the best part.

363
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,440
Played by Crystal, who I recently met.

364
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,000
It's true.

365
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,880
So what's Ross's fucking deal then?

366
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,960
My daughter was born under the Monica sign

367
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,720
and it's been a real struggle raising her

368
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,200
because she's had a bob since she was about 18 months

369
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:13,120
and she's been organizing our home for the better part of her life

370
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,440
and we've had to grow to accept it.

371
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,520
That's who she is as a person.

372
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,200
That's her sign.

373
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,880
Travis, real quick, can you do Stinky the cat before you wrap up

374
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,200
because I hear a lot about that character.

375
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,280
So this is the only true redeemable character

376
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,800
I would say out of the entire show

377
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,360
because here's the thing, Friends doesn't super hold up super good

378
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,520
in regards to like gay panic and transphobia

379
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,600
and fatphobia and all of those things.

380
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,840
But the cat that smells bad.

381
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,200
Classic.

382
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:52,640
Continues to be, I would say, the greatest maybe character

383
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,160
because you remember all the dream sequences

384
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,120
where the cat with the bad smell would appear

385
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,120
and discuss the day's events with one or more of the friends

386
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,440
and be like, so what do you think you learned today?

387
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,760
And that was really where I think the heart of the show rested.

388
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,360
And then, of course, there's the classic episode.

389
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,040
I think it was their 100th episode

390
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,080
where the monkey and the smelly cat battled.

391
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

392
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,880
And I really think the show sucked after that.

393
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,480
Yeah, it sucked shit.

394
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,160
What I'm struggling with is, I believe it was James Lipton

395
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,480
James Lipton theorized that there were something like eight

396
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,000
sort of archetypes that every sort of literary work must fill.

397
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,480
And there's the one who eats a sandwich, which is Joey.

398
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,880
The one who loves Monica.

399
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,800
In this one, it's Chandler.

400
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,760
Monica is one of them.

401
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,560
Fun, flirty, free spirit with the smelly cat song

402
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,520
is obviously Phoebe.

403
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,360
And then sort of the cool one, I think is Rachel.

404
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,640
Okay, there it is.

405
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:00,960
Yes.

406
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,040
There is no dinosaur expert.

407
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,440
He seems completely, he's a skin tag.

408
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,240
Cut him off.

409
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,760
We need five friends.

410
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,920
I read in the TV guide that for the first four seasons

411
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,480
they didn't pay David Schwimmer to be there.

412
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,200
Oh, wow.

413
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,120
Yeah, he just, he kept showing up.

414
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,640
And like at first, if you watch the first episode,

415
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,240
he only has one line.

416
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,800
Yeah.

417
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,920
And the audience just liked his energy so much

418
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,080
that the next episode they gave him two lines.

419
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,840
And then the next episode they gave him four lines.

420
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,160
And by the end of the series, he had 6 million lines per episode.

421
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,480
Yeah, it's originally supposed to be Chandler, Joey, Phoebe,

422
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,320
Rachel, Monica, Gunther.

423
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,960
And Gunther was supposed to be sixth friend.

424
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,480
And his whole thing, he was the one who had all the swords.

425
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,680
Yeah.

426
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,040
But the audience just hated him.

427
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,000
The audience hated him.

428
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,200
And they wanted him to be sort of a recipient

429
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,600
of constant unearned scorn from the other six friends.

430
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,720
I hate this show.

431
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,080
Ross is half dinosaur.

432
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,200
Yeah.

433
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,720
All right, all right, all right.

434
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,160
He knew a lot about him and everyone wondered why.

435
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,360
And it was one of the longest running mysteries in TV history

436
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,440
is why Ross knew so much about dinosaurs.

437
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,920
And then on the last episode, they revealed it's

438
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,480
because he's half dinosaur the whole time.

439
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,280
And you know what?

440
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,520
Actually, I don't want to brag, but if you watch True, I knew that.

441
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,560
I knew that was going to be it because you could find little clues.

442
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,040
Like that scene where he comes back to Rachel

443
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,680
and he's standing in the door and it's raining, you know?

444
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,880
And you can see his tail waving around behind him.

445
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,920
Yeah, or the scene where he cuts Tom Selleck's belly open

446
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,360
with his razor sharp talon.

447
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,480
Just completely out from neck to navel.

448
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,720
Just really cracks him, cracks him wide open.

449
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,440
And then he spits venom on Chandler.

450
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,920
And Chandler's like, I like this.

451
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,840
Could I be any more blind?

452
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,720
Yes.

453
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,800
I just hate Ross so much.

454
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,600
It would be better if Ross didn't.

455
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,040
Yeah.

456
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,440
You know?

457
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:05,680
Yeah.

458
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,960
Yeah, just every time I watch it, I'd be like, could you not?

459
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,280
What if, okay, I would like to pitch a reboot of Friends.

460
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,280
And you take all the same footage from the original series,

461
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,440
but anytime Ross is on screen,

462
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,040
you replace it with David Schwimmer now responding like,

463
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,200
hey, that's a terrible thing to say.

464
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,920
Or like, how do we afford these apartments?

465
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,560
That's good.

466
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,800
I want to redo it as a mecha anime.

467
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,040
And so they all have sort of different mechas

468
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,480
that lock together Voltron style.

469
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,360
So like Joey's like a tiger who's the left leg.

470
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,480
Chandler's like a lion who's the right leg.

471
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,440
Phoebe's like an ostrich who's the torso.

472
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,040
Sorry, she'd be a smelly cat, which is like torso and head.

473
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,160
And then Monica and Rachel.

474
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,960
You mean the butt?

475
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,720
Well, the butt is part of the torso, Jess.

476
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,280
Keep up.

477
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,000
Okay.

478
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,240
Yeah.

479
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,400
And then Monica and Rachel would be the two arms.

480
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,800
And then Ross would come in also as a leg and he'd be like,

481
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,280
can I, hey guys, let me snap in.

482
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,600
And they're like, we're good.

483
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,360
They only need five of us.

484
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
We made the whole robot already, Ross.

485
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,560
You have no point.

486
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,240
Now sweep up, Ross.

487
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,600
Clean up our mecha leavings.

488
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,080
How about another question?

489
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,200
How would you guys feel about that?

490
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,680
That's good.

491
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,840
I feel bad for dunking on Schwimmer like that.

492
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,200
Schwimmer's cool as hell.

493
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,360
I have no beef with Schwimmer.

494
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,440
Schwimmer is just trying to make his nut.

495
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,920
He's great on Homecoming from Gimlet Media.

496
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,040
How about a question?

497
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,520
Yeah, man.

498
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,360
I've been looking for the email for 30 seconds.

499
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,640
Just give me a grip.

500
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,920
Just fucking ran my mouth a bunch of blah blah.

501
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,120
Just a bunch of blah blah blah trying to find the email.

502
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,320
Last time I lost it, I searched for wallet and then I found it again.

503
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,120
One of my neighbors stopped by today to say she's having a big birthday party on the weekend.

504
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,120
She told me there'll be a lot of guests coming, so they'll probably make a lot of noise

505
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,840
from the sheer volume of people, from music.

506
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,320
Plus, her guests might park all on the street.

507
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,960
She told me that the expected start and end times of this party.

508
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,280
Gave me her cell phone number, told me to text if there were any major issues, and then left.

509
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,640
Is it weird she gave me all this information but didn't invite me to the party?

510
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,840
Or am I weird for thinking it's weird when she was maybe just trying to be considerate?

511
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,000
What's the right way to respond to someone knocking on your door

512
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
to tell you you're not invited to their birthday?

513
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,640
That's from Potential Party Crasher in Coquitlam.

514
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,400
I don't think this is a thing, right?

515
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,200
I've gotten this dropped by a few times in my life where they just let me know,

516
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,280
hey, it's going to get loud and rowdy without extending the invitation.

517
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:45,360
Maybe this is wrong-headed of me, but I don't know that I would be eager to go to this party

518
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,760
where I wouldn't know anybody except for or possibly including my neighbor.

519
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,000
Yeah, it's basically like this person has just said,

520
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,280
hey, Justin, I'm going to have an area of earth that would be poisonous to you

521
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,200
in your natural state, and I'm giving you permission to not

522
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,120
put your physical mass into this poisonous area.

523
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,400
I will also say it is nice of you to attribute this to them being considerate,

524
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,080
but really this is them saying, please do not call the cops on us.

525
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,560
Yeah, sure.

526
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:25,200
Ah, the one thing I will say though is it would be so nice to get an invite to a next door party.

527
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,760
It's so close.

528
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,880
That's what I'm thinking about right now is I think I probably would go.

529
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,720
It's right there.

530
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,800
I can go mess up their house.

531
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,600
And if I need to poop, I just go back home.

532
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,160
This is the great party.

533
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,640
Actually, now I'm mad because you could go there.

534
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,200
You could eat all their chips, eat all their cool rancheritos,

535
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,320
eat all their sea salt and vinegar Pringles.

536
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
Oh, oh, yeah.

537
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,720
Oh, yeah.

538
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,000
Now we're talking.

539
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,680
See what they're watching on TV.

540
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,040
What are they watching on TV?

541
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,400
Maybe set up a couple of webcams in their bedroom and then-

542
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,760
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.

543
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,640
I misspoke.

544
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,480
I misspoke.

545
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,840
I said, I meant to say eat some sweet chili Doritos.

546
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,640
And then you go back to your house if you get tired.

547
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,080
And here's the wild thing.

548
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,160
If you decide you want to do more party later,

549
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,160
it sounds like this motherfucker is going to be rocking and rollicking all night long.

550
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,240
Just go back over if you want some more party.

551
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,440
This is great.

552
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,120
I got this drop by an old house I lived at here in Austin.

553
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,360
It's actually from a neighbor a couple of doors down,

554
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,640
maybe even three doors down.

555
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,880
And they came by just to give us a heads up.

556
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,480
Like, hey, we have this party every year.

557
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,000
It's like a big crawfish boil.

558
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,720
And it's like all day.

559
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,080
And so it's going to get a little bit loud.

560
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,280
Just wanted to give you the heads up.

561
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,560
And I was very like, I was very forgiving.

562
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,840
I was like, oh, that's totally fine.

563
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,120
Thank you for the warning.

564
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,320
I appreciate it.

565
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,920
I hope everything goes well.

566
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,600
And then day of about 400 people, I would say,

567
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,040
just estimating based on the number of cars that appear on the street showed up.

568
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,480
And they did the boil.

569
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,320
And I would say from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.

570
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,560
it was just nonstop live zydeco.

571
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,000
Like nonstop live zydeco.

572
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,920
Wow, that's a lot of zydeco.

573
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,320
Yeah, with some real like fucking 12 foot high Marshall stacks

574
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,320
just blasting that zydeco into my teeth, into my fillings,

575
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,400
just shattering all the toilets in my house

576
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,280
because of how loud and powerful the zydeco was.

577
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,560
And I remember thinking like,

578
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,400
I don't think I gave permission for this, right?

579
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,560
Like we're talking about 10 hours of straight zydeco.

580
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,400
I feel like maybe it was undersold a little bit.

581
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,800
Yeah, I think that if zydeco is gonna play a part

582
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,120
that is such a specific thing that you have been misled

583
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,680
if they don't specifically say, yes, zydeco, it's happening.

584
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,280
It's beautiful music, beautiful music.

585
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,520
Loud 10 hours of it is not my favorite way to enjoy zydeco.

586
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,760
I would say loud 10 hours of anything, you know?

587
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,800
Like there's some 90 songs I enjoy very, very much,

588
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,840
but if you played Lit's My Own Worst Enemy

589
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,840
on a loop for 10 hours, I'd probably burn your house down.

590
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,000
If you came over and said, hey, we're having a party over,

591
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,920
400 people are gonna show up and we're gonna play

592
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,200
nothing but nonstop billion decibel covers

593
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,080
of zydeco style versions of Lit's My Own Worst Enemy.

594
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,240
Lit's My Own Worst Enemy as if it was covered

595
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,920
by an authentic New Orleans zydeco band.

596
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,160
I would say, well, that's clearly not good.

597
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,000
I really wish you wouldn't do that.

598
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,040
There's nothing I can do about it

599
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,640
because I'm not gonna fucking call the cops on you,

600
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,840
but like, please, please, please don't.

601
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,800
Let's, I tell you what, let's take a quick break.

602
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,560
We'll go over to the Money Zone, get some cash,

603
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,040
and then come back to the comedy after that.

604
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,240
What do you think?

605
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,480
Okay, follow me.

606
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,200
Get in my pocket.

607
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,840
My shirt pocket.

608
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,200
I'm shrinking you down.

609
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,800
This is the power of audio, folks.

610
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,760
I'm shrinking you down.

611
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,800
Oh, man, I found a toy car in here.

612
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,760
I'm gonna get inside.

613
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,400
That's for you.

614
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,080
Oh, good, an M&M, I can.

615
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,400
Someone's activating the toy car in my wallet.

616
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,640
Vroom, vroom, I'm gonna drive out of here.

617
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,320
You guys have noticed that toy cars,

618
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,160
whenever somebody shrinks down in a movie

619
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,520
and there's a toy car in it,

620
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,920
it's always got working gas and brake pedals.

621
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,920
Why the fuck?

622
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
What the fuck are you talking about?

623
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,360
Like in Stuart Little, right?

624
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,240
This motherfucker climbs into a car and he drives it.

625
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,640
A Matchbox car and he drives it.

626
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,840
What the fuck?

627
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,480
How?

628
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,520
Why would, what sort of like bizarro serial killer toy maker

629
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,600
is putting like working gas and brake pedals

630
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,040
in his tiny cars for mice?

631
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,640
It's nonsense.

632
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,680
Yeah, Justin, thank you for finally finding

633
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,080
the one plot hole in Stuart Little,

634
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,760
the movie about a talking mouse.

635
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,480
Come at me, Joss, or was it in my Shyamalan?

636
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,680
I mean, could anybody actually hear the mouse?

637
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,960
Oh my God, you're right.

638
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,400
Yeah, I'm on some Rugrats shit.

639
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,760
We have to go to the money zone.

640
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,400
I'm there, this is it.

641
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,440
I thought we were here.

642
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,440
Today's sponsor is the DVD release of Stuart Little.

643
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,960
I'm gonna get us into the monies again.

644
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:22,800
Here comes our second transition into the money zone.

645
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,560
I'm gonna tell you about Bull and Branch.

646
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:24,800
Yes.

647
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,040
Okay.

648
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
Bull and Branch, changing the game.

649
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,800
Every day, you know linens, you don't.

650
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,320
Sorry, I didn't mean to get so aggressive there,

651
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,800
but Bull and Branch, it's getting a good night's sleep

652
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,600
is easier and more affordable than you think.

653
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,040
And let me tell you, everything Bull and Branch makes

654
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,600
from bedding to blankets is made from pure 100% organic.

655
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,880
Diamonds!

656
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,080
No, well, that wouldn't be comfortable.

657
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,000
No, this is 100% organic cotton,

658
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,920
which means that they start out super soft

659
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,680
and they get even softer over time.

660
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,280
None of that like breaking in like,

661
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,760
oh, after you wash this the 30th time,

662
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,880
it's good right away.

663
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,640
They have thousands of five-star reviews

664
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,720
and Forbes, Wall Street Journal and Fast Company

665
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,240
are all talking about Bull and Branch.

666
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,080
Shipping is free and you can try them for 30 nights

667
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,360

675
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,560
You know what feels good?

676
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,080
I lived my entire life not really caring

677
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,440
about what I put on my human body

678
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,520
because I was, I don't know, I didn't give a shit

679
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,560
or I didn't know and I didn't want to put it in the work,

680
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,360
whatever the reason.

681
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,880
I went through most of my life

682
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,240
just putting whatever on my body.

683
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,120
Then we started getting advertisements from Stitch Fix

684
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,400
and they started sending me boxes of clothes for me to wear

685
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,400
and it is so nice to, almost every time I dress

686
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,000
in Stitch Fix clothing, I will get a compliment

687
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,560
from somebody.

688
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,800
It's like, hey, I love your shirt.

689
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,600
Those are cool shoes or your pants are good

690
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,680
and I'll say, thank you, it's Stitch Fix

691
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,520
and it's almost become a joke at this point.

692
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,320
When we do a show, if we look nice,

693
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,560
it's probably all stuff from Stitch Fix

694
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,520
that we are all wearing and it is a wonderful service.

695
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,040
Run through our jacket, yeah, shirt, okay, pants.

696
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,360
If you have ever seen a picture of me

697
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,920
and thought that's a nice shirt, probably from Stitch Fix.

698
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,240
You give them your sizes, your favorite styles

699
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,320
and your budget and a personal stylist

700
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,120
will select five brand new clothing items just for you

701
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,800
and then they show up in a box.

702
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,000
You try on everything and the stuff that you love,

703
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,560
you keep, the stuff that you don't love,

704
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:59,520
you put into a container that's got a prepaid

705
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,920
for shipping label on it, you throw it in the bag

706
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,200
and you ship it back to them no problem

707
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,960
and you get a discount if you keep everything

708
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,360
and that is very nice as well.

709
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,640
Their hit rate is really good and just gets better

710
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,840
because they learn from the stuff that you like

711
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,600
and the stuff you don't like and they try to get closer

712
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,240
to your personal style.

713
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,800
My wife, Sydney, has very specific taste

714
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,960
and she was unconvinced that they would be able to get her

715
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,160
and we started Stitch Fix when she was pregnant

716
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,480
and not only did they eventually figure out her taste

717
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,440
pretty well, they sent clothing that was appropriately sized

718
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,760
for where she was in her pregnancy.

719
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,080
After we had the baby, they had already knew

720
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,560
that she had had the baby and they started delivering clothes

721
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:51,120
that were post-maternity wear, it's wild

722
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,160
and it's a wonderful service.

723
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,320
So stitchfix.com slash my brother

724
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,920
is where you can get started right now.

725
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,840
If you keep all five items you receive,

726
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,680
you'll get 25% off your entire purchase.

727
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,120
That's stitchfix.com slash my brother.

728
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,600
I just wanna say as we're moving into the summer months,

729
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,520
Stitch Fix has sent me a lot of shorts lately

730
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,400
and they've all been good.

731
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,480
I've never known how to buy shorts for myself.

732
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,840
I have rid myself of all cargo shorts I've owned.

733
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,840
That's it, they're gone.

734
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,240
It's just nice Stitch Fix shorts now.

735
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,480
It's the greatest thing anybody's ever done for me.

736
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,680
And the greatest thing that anybody's ever done for Jason

737
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,960
is to send this Jumbotron message over our airwaves.

738
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,960
The person who sent it is Claire and it's for Jason.

739
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,600
And Claire says, to our Dungeon Master, our best friend

740
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,720
and our giant phase spider, Jason.

741
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,240
Thank you for creating an excellent world

742
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,160
for us to run around in and letting us adopt

743
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,720
literally every adorable NPC you give us.

744
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,800
We love telling these stories with you.

745
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,720
Love, Claire, Cookie, Thunder, Brielle, and Anders,

746
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,080
the Knights of the Armored Pig.

747
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,400
I think this isn't real.

748
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,240
I think this is like a fiction.

749
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,240
I think it's like a fantastical world sort of like, yeah.

750
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,760
I think somebody's like using our podcast

751
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,680
like send a message like an alt reality ARG fantastical world.

752
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,040
So they're not really knights?

753
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,200
They might be, they might be.

754
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,320
That part might be real.

755
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,960
But this person being a big spider, I mean.

756
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,640
Uh-huh.

757
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,040
How would they even drive a car?

758
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,080
I guess at that point.

759
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,040
Well, if you designed the car specifically for a spider.

760
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Sure, I mean, four brake pedals, four gas pedals.

761
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,800
There's no denying that, Trav.

762
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,320
This next message is for Sam Boat, a.k.a. Heely Boy.

763
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,880
I think you just did a.k.a. a.k.a.

764
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,600
I think I did.

765
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,640
A.k.a. a.k.a.

766
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,080
It got away from me because I got distracted.

767
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,520
A.k.a. a.k.a.

768
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,360
A.k.a. a.k.a.

769
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,520
And it's from Ray Ray, a.k.a. The Shut In Roommate.

770
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,160
Maybe that's like Ray Ray's wrestling.

771
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,160
Like, oh, it's the Shut In Roommate.

772
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,840
Okay, thank you for being the best friend

773
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,680
and fellow Mackle fan this garbage boy could ask for.

774
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,040
It freaks my bean how positive you are 24 seven.

775
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,040
And it's helped me survive some of the toughest times of my life.

776
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,600
We won't be roomies anymore after this year,

777
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,640
but you'll always be my fourth brother from another mother.

778
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,720
My Lin-Manuel, you might say.

779
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,600
Happy birthday.

780
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,600
Wanted this one April 21st, so we fucked that up.

781
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Hopefully you're still a Mackle fan, as you said.

782
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,000
Got a message for Josh.

783
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,600
One last Jumbotron here.

784
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,880
It's from Jeremy.

785
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,560
It says, hey, sorry I was such a shitty middlest brother

786
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,440
while we were kids.

787
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,640
You were and are an awesome sweet baby brother.

788
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,040
Good job putting that master's degree in math to work

789
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,400
with that teaching gig.

790
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,880
P.S. Thanks for coming all the way to Canterbury

791
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,320
just to play in my D&D game.

792
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,080
Well, that's very nice.

793
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,200
Sounds like you all have a lovely relationship

794
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,240
that's evolved over the years.

795
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,240
And it's good to hear.

796
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,640
Good to see.

797
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,200
Jealous.

798
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:55,760
Jealous.

799
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,400
Nice.

800
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,440
Wait, why stagnant?

801
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,360
Griffin, what do you mean jealous?

802
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,400
Well, we're not allowed to evolve since we started the show.

803
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,120
So like our relationship has to stay the same.

804
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,800
We're all kind of Rosses now.

805
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,840
We're all the Ross.

806
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840
Now we are all become Ross.

807
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,120
I have a friend who like meets up with his family every year

808
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,920
and all they do is just like sit around in nature

809
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,280
and, you know, talk for hours and learn and grow.

810
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,440
And it's like, that would ruin this whole thing.

811
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,280
We can't have a conversation and we don't record.

812
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,800
That's all that.

813
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,360
I'll just leave it at that.

814
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,000
We can't finish.

815
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,400
Imagine.

816
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,520
Okay.

817
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,720
It's the saying of things like we can't finish.

818
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,760
That is like the proof is in the gross pudding.

819
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,240
Some people wouldn't even say that to their brothers.

820
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,200
Yeah, can you imagine?

821
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,760
Can you imagine?

822
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,920
Hi there, I'm film critic April Wolf

823
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,360
and host of the maximum fun podcast Switchblade Sisters.

824
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,040
Do you love genre films?

825
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,800
Do you love female filmmakers?

826
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,480
Do you love discussions on craft?

827
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,440
If your answer is yes, you'll love Switchblade Sisters.

828
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,080
Every episode I invite one female filmmaker on

829
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,800
and we talk in depth about their fave genre film

830
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,480
and how it influenced their own work.

831
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,840
So we're talking horror, action, sci-fi, fantasy, bizarro and exploitation cinema.

832
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,520
Mothers, lock up your sons

833
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,160
because the Switchblade Sisters are coming for you.

834
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,080
Available at maximumfun.org or wherever you find your podcasts.

835
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,400
All right.

836
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,520
Continue what you're saying.

837
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,680
I forget what I was fucking saying.

838
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:23,680
All right.

839
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,760
It's no fun if I don't get to interrupt something.

840
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,440
Well, then you have to let us start.

841
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,160
Okay, I'm sorry.

842
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,480
Okay.

843
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,880
Hey, let's wait for a few more.

844
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,040
I'll bring it back in in a few minutes.

845
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,120
Let's do a question first.

846
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,240
Go ahead, Griff.

847
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,440
Okay, here comes a Yahoo!

848
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,040
That was eat my shit, Justin.

849
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,400
Eat the shit out of my butt.

850
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:40,640
Yeah.

851
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:40,960
Okay.

852
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,560
Yeah, a little bit of shit.

853
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,640
Oh, shit, that sounds bad.

854
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,040
It's getting tender.

855
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,560
It's getting gentle.

856
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,120
This is the extreme more than words version of...

857
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:02,480
Oh, now it's getting kind of patriotic.

858
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,240
This is the Munch Squad.

859
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,480
I want a Munch Squad.

860
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,280
I want too much squad.

861
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,640
That was the first rap break that we've had in the middle of the Munch Squad intro.

862
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,240
Yeah.

863
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,560
So right.

864
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,280
So, oh, man, this one's good.

865
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,000
Chick-fil-A.

866
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,880
Who I don't know has actually made it to...

867
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,040
Thank you to Adam, by the way, for sending this my way.

868
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,160
I don't know that Chick-fil-A has made it to the squad before.

869
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,640
Well, they mostly do sort of straightforward God food.

870
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,320
It's mainly God's food and six days a week.

871
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,840
I normally go check out all the local restaurants to find my Munch Squad source

872
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,960
material on Sundays and they are always closed.

873
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,880
So that is an issue.

874
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,440
Because they're so lazy.

875
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:00,240
Chick-fil-A is testing meal kits at 150 restaurants.

876
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,400
Okay.

877
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,800
Okay.

878
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,400
So here's what I'm saying to you.

879
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,440
Yeah.

880
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,440
Here's what I'm saying to you.

881
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,120
This is going to happen in the Atlanta...

882
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,560
Oh, dudes.

883
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,520
It's starting August 27th across the Atlanta area.

884
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,120
Oh, shit.

885
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,400
We will be there for it.

886
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,720
It's a totally new concept for the brand.

887
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,360
And yeah, we will be right there.

888
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:26,800
They're launching them at 150 restaurants, which are designed for customers.

889
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,040
Okay.

890
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,280
They're designed for customers to cook their own meals at home with pre-measured ingredients

891
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,440
available for pickup in the drive-through at the front counter or via the Chick-fil-A 1 app.

892
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,120
What are we doing?

893
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,080
What I'm saying to you...

894
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,600
Are you fucking with me?

895
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:52,480
What I'm saying to you is you buy the ingredients at Chick-fil-A, you say,

896
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,480
honey, let's stay in tonight at Cook.

897
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,720
And your husband says, okay, honey, I'd love that.

898
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,880
Let's go to Chick-fil-A.

899
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,800
And you said, no, you dumb shit.

900
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,880
I said, let's stay home and cook.

901
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,400
No, I heard you.

902
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,360
I'm going to cut out all the shopping and just get the ingredients at Chick-fil-A.

903
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm going to cut out both the options and convenience.

904
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,320
Yes.

905
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,840
It's the worst of both.

906
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,840
Imagine Chick-fil-A, you have to cook on your own.

907
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,320
Can you even fathom it?

908
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,160
Chick-fil-A will be the first in the quick service industry to offer a full meal kit

909
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,960
offering and customer feedback on the test will help the restaurant company decide whether

910
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,640
to roll out the concept nationwide.

911
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,320
So here's what that feedback looks like.

912
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,360
Someone comes to the counter.

913
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,560
Um, yes, sir.

914
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,120
Yes, hello.

915
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,680
Excuse me.

916
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,440
I got the the meal kit from Chick-fil-A.

917
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:43,760
Uh-huh.

918
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,160
Yes, sir.

919
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,040
What did you think?

920
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,760
Well, it was a dumb thing of me to do.

921
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,120
But the blame you have fulfilled your end of the bargain.

922
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,840
I did a dumb thing.

923
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:58,240
If you think about it, I felt depressed in myself and sad about my own self.

924
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,000
And that's not really feedback on your product.

925
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,560
There you go.

926
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,960
I have no complaints about you, but you have made me realize something about myself that

927
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,160
I am disappointed in.

928
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,360
So thank you.

929
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:13,520
Uh, the test that so they've got five meal kit recipes nationwide.

930
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,240
You can express your interest in trying the kits by filling out an online form.

931
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,440
So, um, if you do this, it should have a pop up.

932
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,720
It's like, get a hobby.

933
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,880
It's like, what are you?

934
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,920
It's fucking something.

935
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,680
This is a form that's like, bring these meal kits to my fucking place.

936
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,400
This is amazing.

937
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,720
I tell you the most bonkers thing.

938
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,320
I'm looking at these five recipes.

939
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:40,240
None of them are chicken sandwich or chicken nuggets or waffle fries.

940
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,160
Yeah, but Trav, you could get that.

941
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,560
That would be truly maddening.

942
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,520
Like, that would be truly like, I'm going to cook high chick-fil-a.

943
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,400
I'm going to cook.

944
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,360
I want to out chick-fil-a, chick-fil-a at my own home.

945
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,680
They're not going to give you the ingredients to do that.

946
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,320
You're going to have chicken parmesan, chicken enchiladas, Dijon chicken, pan-roasted chicken

947
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,080
and chicken flatbread.

948
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:08,240
But he's making your own nugs at home really so much weirder than saying, I'm in the mood

949
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,920
for chicken enchiladas.

950
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,320
Going to drive over to chick-fil-a and get the individual ingredients.

951
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,600
It's so wild.

952
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:25,120
Blue Apron, I trust to give me a box of like, good ingredients that I know where they came

953
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,720
from and they will taste good at the end of it.

954
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,800
Chick-fil-a is chick-fil-a though.

955
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,600
That's like, I don't know, we haven't established that level of trust, chick-fil-a.

956
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Yeah, the problem is that they can't do the chicken sandwiches because there's a lot of

957
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,680
complex sort of things that go into making it.

958
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,760
You have to brine the chicken in the pickle juice.

959
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,360
The big thing is that you can't really put homophobia in a meal prep box.

960
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,320
Do you know what I mean?

961
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,320
Like, they have to do that kind of on site by putting it in a bag and then hanging it

962
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:04,640
up in front of an old episode of Friends for like, a day and you can't really do that at

963
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,200
home.

964
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,840
There it is.

965
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,680
What the fuck are we even doing as a people, as a civilization?

966
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,680
I don't have a good answer for why chick-fil-a is doing this.

967
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,400
It just, and also can I say one other thing?

968
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,520
If you don't have a chick-fil-a in your area, especially one with a drive-thru, chick-fil-a

969
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,720
drive-thrus are absolutely fucking buck wild.

970
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,840
I have not seen the one in Huntington near the Barbersville Mall not extend out the parking

971
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,480
lot and down the street in my entire life.

972
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,160
It is always 15 minutes waiting in line to get this chick-fil-a.

973
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,680
So you're going to go to the chick-fil-a, you're going to wait 15 minutes in line so

974
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,960
you can get the ingredients to make Dijon chicken at home?

975
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,800
Who would do this?

976
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,720
I'm looking through the FAQs here and none of them are, why did you do this?

977
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,600
Why did you do it?

978
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,320
Hey chick-fil-a, I got a Q that will perhaps become FA, ASAP.

979
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,120
Why?

980
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,400
WHY, guys?

981
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,280
I got a Yahoo that was sent in by Mike Eckert.

982
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:07,840
Thanks, Mike.

983
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,280
It's Yahoo Answers user.

984
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,640
Layla asks, am I a hipster if I watch DVDs?

985
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,800
Oh, come on.

986
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,120
Oh, god.

987
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,920
For movies, I buy DVDs instead of Netflix or buying it online or something.

988
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,960
I have a huge closet filled with DVDs.

989
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,440
I just prefer a DVD over Netflix or digital.

990
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,880
Does that make me a hipster?

991
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,320
You can't get the fucking quality, the fucking, the crackles, the snaps, and the pops of the

992
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:46,080
film reel spooling through its mechanisms unless you get the authentic DVD of the movie swingers.

993
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:54,480
You can't get the bonus, you don't get those bonus features of Jon Favreau being all Favreau

994
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,480
like on the Netflix version, you don't get the pops of the reels.

995
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,720
You gotta be able to feel it.

996
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,720
I went to Alamo Drafthouse.

997
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:10,480
They did a special screening of Go, the follow-up to swingers that nobody seems to remember,

998
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,880
and they had a new print, a lost, long lost print on DVD of it.

999
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,440
Oh, it was like I was seeing it the way that the director intended.

1000
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,920
They do load faster than Blu-rays.

1001
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,120
If you have a child in the back seat that needs to watch Trolls then and not in two

1002
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,760
minutes, the DVDs do load faster.

1003
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,680
So there is like, I don't want to be that guy.

1004
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,040
The DVDs do load faster than the Blu-rays, okay?

1005
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,160
That I will say.

1006
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,000
I love being able to display my stuff, right?

1007
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So that when people come in, they can be like, oh, you have a lot of Jon Favreau movies.

1008
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,520
And I'll say, yes, I do.

1009
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,120
Because when I have them on my iTunes, people can't see them, you know?

1010
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,880
And they load faster.

1011
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:02,400
I just think that DVDs are a little more, it's a format of the people.

1012
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:09,040
Oh, you remember when DVDs first came out and everybody started making their own movies?

1013
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,360
No.

1014
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,080
Yeah, okay.

1015
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:12,560
No, yes.

1016
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,640
You remember when the DVDs first came out, everybody started making their own movies?

1017
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,000
Yes, yes.

1018
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:28,240
And that was a really kind of a democratizing format for a lot of people.

1019
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,760
Because, hold on, let me start over.

1020
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,280
You remember when VHS came out and everybody started making their own movies?

1021
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:40,480
Okay, well, on that format, you could put one in your dad's big VCR and you could shoot

1022
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,000
your own movie, right?

1023
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,440
Yeah, and that was the brand of it.

1024
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,080
I believe it was the Mitsubishi dad's VCR.

1025
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:58,960
For me, the DVD was Hollywood's way of saying, that's ours, you know what I mean?

1026
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,560
That's Hollywood's way of saying, not everybody can actually make a movie.

1027
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,920
We're taking this back, because your dad doesn't have a DVD camera.

1028
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,480
And if he does, we'll buy it, because that's amazing.

1029
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,040
Was your dad Steven Spielberg?

1030
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,400
Are you Joni Spielberg, child of Steven?

1031
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:15,440
Yes.

1032
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,520
With your DVD camera?

1033
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,960
That's got to cost an arm and a leg.

1034
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,460
Yeah.

1035
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,560
So, Justin, I guess I'm confused as to what your point is.

1036
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,280
Yeah, but VHS is a format of the people.

1037
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:27,840
This is what I'm saying.

1038
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,320
VHS is a format of the people.

1039
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,520
What I like about DVDs is it was Hollywood's way of saying, not everybody can do this.

1040
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,160
Kevin Smith, not everybody can do this, okay?

1041
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,160
You can't just decide you're going to make a movie.

1042
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,280
Give this back to us.

1043
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,120
You like that about DVDs.

1044
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,200
I like the artistic voice.

1045
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,760
The ship has been righted.

1046
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,240
And the auteurs, the auteurs can take the format back.

1047
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,440
They take movies back from the common man, and they say,

1048
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,120
actually, this isn't, like, not everybody can make movies.

1049
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,000
Like, you can't do that anymore.

1050
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,640
That's ours again.

1051
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,520
Yeah, it's ours.

1052
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,000
It's ours again.

1053
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:18,160
Okay, so, Justin, what you like about DVDs is how restrictive and exclusive it is.

1054
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,880
If I bought a VHS, fucking anybody could have made it.

1055
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:28,880
If I get a movie on VHS, like, anybody, anybody could have made that film.

1056
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,280
If I get a movie on DVD, I know that Hollywood...

1057
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,120
Hollywood made it.

1058
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,880
It's got the Hollywood feel to it.

1059
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,000
It's got that special bit of Hollywood glamour, that little bit of glitter sprinkled over it.

1060
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,480
Travis, you're very confused, I can tell.

1061
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,960
I want to help you walk you through, Justin.

1062
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,880
Okay, please, yes.

1063
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,320
You can't just make a DVD.

1064
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:52,720
Thank you.

1065
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,800
Thank you, yes.

1066
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,040
I can't just make a DVD.

1067
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,920
I can't go out there with my friends and shoot a DVD movie.

1068
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,800
Do you understand now?

1069
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,000
It's the disc, and nobody knows how to put the thing on the disc.

1070
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,800
And so, but that makes it better.

1071
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1072
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,680
It's better because you can trust...

1073
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,760
It ups the level of quality.

1074
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,080
Okay.

1075
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,680
Because you know Hollywood has had their fingers all over it if you see a DVD.

1076
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,040
Oh, okay.

1077
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:25,440
If I went out to the store, the movie store, and I bought Lost in Space with Matt LeBlanc in it,

1078
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,680
on VHS, anybody could have made that.

1079
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,040
Anybody could have made that to VHS, like Dad's Big VCR would play.

1080
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,480
Matt LeBlanc could have made it?

1081
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,920
Matt LeBlanc could have made it, yeah.

1082
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:40,160
And if I go to the DVD store for movies, and I get the DVD of Lost in Space,

1083
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,760
it's just going to be the genuine article.

1084
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,240
It's going to be the real Lost in Space, and there's no doubt about that.

1085
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,320
That was the first DVD I ever bought, by the way.

1086
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:46,800
Was it?

1087
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,840
Good pickup, good pickup.

1088
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,840
Good soundtrack on that one too.

1089
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,080
Second one, oh yeah, fucking Apollo 440 crushed it.

1090
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:59,120
And then the second one I bought was The Time Machine starring fucking...

1091
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,240
Guy Pearce.

1092
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:00,800
Guy Pearce.

1093
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,920
I had a real fucking...

1094
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,800
I had a real preference back then.

1095
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,840
And now, and this is what I'm saying with Netflix, we're back to anybody could have made it before.

1096
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:09,920
Thank you.

1097
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,120
Because it could just be like...

1098
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:16,080
I turn it on YouTube, and I search for The Time Machine.

1099
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,960
I'm going to find a bunch of like Minecraft videos,

1100
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,760
and I'm going to find a bunch of like dumb videos that might...

1101
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,440
Gameplay walkthrough.

1102
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,360
Gameplay walkthrough of, you know, Mario is missing, and it's like...

1103
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,960
It's not The Time Machine.

1104
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,240
If you search YouTube for The Time Machine,

1105
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,960
the first result is a single button that you click to watch the actual movie.

1106
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,080
The Time Machine starring Guy Pearce.

1107
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,480
That is literally the first thing.

1108
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:54,240
And then the next four results are clips from the movie The Time Machine.

1109
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,080
The first button is like, oh, you wanted to watch The Time Machine with Guy Pearce.

1110
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,040
We got you.

1111
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,760
No problem.

1112
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,680
There's nobody stopping us from putting this entire movie up here.

1113
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,880
That's an outlier.

1114
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,560
That's an outlier.

1115
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,160
The exception proves the rule.

1116
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,960
I guess.

1117
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,560
I just want to touch the movie.

1118
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:13,440
When I want to watch Swingers, I want to touch Swingers.

1119
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,560
I don't want to just...

1120
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,440
It's intimate.

1121
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,400
I touch it.

1122
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,000
I put it in the machine.

1123
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,680
I, you know, real quickly put my finger in and out of the little hole

1124
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,160
just to make sure there's no dust, dirt, or cobwebs in there.

1125
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:24,660
Yep.

1126
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,720
And if you don't do that, you're going to get gunk all over your DVD player.

1127
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,220
Yep.

1128
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:34,320
And that we all still have a standalone DVD player in our house that we all still definitely use.

1129
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:34,720
Yes.

1130
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,160
You finger blast it, clean it out, you put it in, and then you watch the movie.

1131
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,240
And then you've had like a little bond with the movie.

1132
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,640
When I load it up on Netflix, I don't get to finger blast.

1133
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,600
Yeah.

1134
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,880
There's nothing to finger blast.

1135
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,080
Here's the thing.

1136
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:53,920
When it comes to your digital movies, your Netflixes, your iTunes, your what have yous,

1137
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,320
when the shit hits the fan, right, and the end times come,

1138
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,800
we won't be able to watch this anymore, right?

1139
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,360
But if I hold my DVD up to the light in the right way...

1140
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,440
Spin it around on your finger real fast.

1141
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:07,920
Right.

1142
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,400
Get a laser pointer and like I can play it myself.

1143
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,120
You know what I mean?

1144
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:18,160
And like you just don't get that with digital movies.

1145
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:18,640
Yeah.

1146
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,440
What do we do now?

1147
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:20,720
I don't know.

1148
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,480
We usually wrap up here, I think.

1149
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:22,960
Okay.

1150
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,880
No, I think he means as like a people.

1151
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,480
No, I did mean us.

1152
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,520
Specifically us.

1153
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,440
Thank you so much for listening to our show.

1154
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,120
We love you so much.

1155
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:37,760
And we appreciate all your support all the time.

1156
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,720
I wanted to mention, I am trying to get Pete and Pete season three release on DVD.

1157
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:48,640
So if you just tweet, set the Peets free, hashtag set the Peets free, just tweeted it,

1158
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,840
Nickelodeon, and just let them know sort of.

1159
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:58,000
They have acknowledged me because they sent me a GIF of little Pete sticking his tongue out.

1160
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,360
So they're kind of fucking with me.

1161
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,640
Did they send you any GIFs?

1162
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,720
No, choose your networks, choose GIFs.

1163
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,280
Okay.

1164
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,960
And so I'm very excited that the campaign is building ahead of steam.

1165
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,560
We got a theme song.

1166
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,720
We've gotten some tweets from both the Peets in support.

1167
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,880
So it's really building a lot of momentum.

1168
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,320
So hashtag set the Peets free.

1169
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,120
Let's do this thing.

1170
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,400
So couple very important announcements, along with the important announcements about

1171
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,200
set the Peets free.

1172
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:31,840
So PodCon, it's coming again.

1173
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,160
Do you hear the blues are calling?

1174
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:34,880
It's PodCon.

1175
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,200
Because it's in Seattle?

1176
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:37,840
What the fuck?

1177
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,400
Sure.

1178
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,360
But it's coming again.

1179
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:43,280
And it's January 2019.

1180
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:48,480
But we need your help because we are funding it and trying to make sure that we have the

1181
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,960
funds to be able to make it as good, if not better, than it was last time.

1182
00:53:52,960 --> 00:54:00,160
If you weren't able to make it to PodCon 1.0, it's maybe my favorite convention thing I've

1183
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:00,880
ever been to.

1184
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,080
I made a lot of great friends there, and we did a lot of good shows, and it was super

1185
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:04,580
fun.

1186
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,160
And we're really excited to be able to do it again.

1187
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,080
So please consider donating to the campaign to fund PodCon.

1188
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:17,600
If you go to bit.ly slash McElroyPodCon2, you'll find it there.

1189
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,480
We're going to be there.

1190
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,640
Let's see.

1191
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,040
Go there and look at all the other amazing shows that we've already got on the list,

1192
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,880
and we're hoping to have even more guests and shows.

1193
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,880
But we need your help to do that.

1194
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,840
So bit.ly slash McElroyPodCon2.

1195
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:41,040
Also, I'm going to be at Gen Con this weekend and doing a bunch of super fun events that

1196
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:45,920
I'm really looking forward to, including a Munchkin live stream.

1197
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,680
I'm doing a Hello from the Magic Tavern show.

1198
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:58,080
And I'm also doing a panel called Open DMs, where I have me and some other GM and DM people

1199
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:05,040
to give advice on how to be a DM and to take questions and give you some pointers on upping

1200
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,600
your game.

1201
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,560
So if you want to get those tickets ahead of time so that you can come and hang out

1202
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,920
with us, it's at McElroyShows.com slash Tours.

1203
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,480
All the events are there.

1204
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,280
Also there are our upcoming book events.

1205
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,760
We've got some, I'm doing one in Newport, Kentucky, on August 11th.

1206
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,520
Justin and Dad are doing one in Byersville, West Virginia, on August 11th.

1207
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,680
And Dad and I are doing one in Lexington, Kentucky, on August 18th.

1208
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,480
Those are also, I believe, ticketed events.

1209
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,600
You can find those on McElroyShows.com slash Tours.

1210
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:43,360
And speaking of Tours, we have our Orlando and Atlanta shows coming up.

1211
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:47,600
So please send in questions for those.

1212
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,560
If you have been waiting for the time, this is it.

1213
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:56,240
Make sure to include in the subject line, you know, Orlando show or Atlanta show, and

1214
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,200
we'll see you there.

1215
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,040
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for a theme song instead of departure

1216
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,480
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1217
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,240
It's so, so, so good.

1218
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,080
I want to thank Max Fund for having us on the network.

1219
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:11,120
You can go to MaxFund.org, check out a lot of great free shows there, shows like Stop

1220
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:17,200
Podcasting Yourself and Bubble and Switchblade Sisters and a lot more at MaxFund.org.

1221
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,040
And how about that final?

1222
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:24,320
Oh, wait, real quick, we mentioned it, but didn't say, so our graphic novel is out.

1223
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:24,880
Oh, yeah.

1224
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:31,360
Yeah, you can get it at TheAdventureZoneComic.com or like at Barnes and Noble or like, I think

1225
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,720
a lot of bookstores now.

1226
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,440
Yep.

1227
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,720
If you haven't gotten it yet, please consider doing so.

1228
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,200
Sure.

1229
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,080
Here's that final yahoo.

1230
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,680
It was sent in by Natalie Rueb.

1231
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,320
Thanks, Natalie, it's from Yahoo Answers user Tide.

1232
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:46,800
This is the first episode in maybe 300 episodes where all of the names have loaded, so I think

1233
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,640
maybe I'll probably die today.

1234
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,320
I think probably a meteor will crash in my house today or something.

1235
00:56:52,320 --> 00:57:00,720
But Tide asks, is it true that sweat and pee are like cousins?

1236
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,480
Well, it was Justin McElroy.

1237
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,720
I'm Travis McElroy.

1238
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,240
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1239
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,560
It's been my brother, my brother, and me.

1240
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,200
Kiss your dad.

1241
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,320
Square on the lips.

1242
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:29,680
Hey, good girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna?

1243
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,520
Maximumfun.org.

1244
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,560
Comedy and culture.

1245
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,680
Artist owned.

1246
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,720
Listener supported.

1247
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,360
You probably know that MaxFun podcasters are funny in the talking way, but did you know

1248
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,840
they also are funny in the writing way?

1249
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:46,480
We are very excited to announce that John Hodgman and Paula Poundstone wrote books that

1250
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:52,000
have been named as semifinalists for the 2018 Thurber Prize for American Humor.

1251
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,600
John Hodgman, celebrated fake internet court presider, is the host of Judge John Hodgman

1252
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,640
and was recognized for his book Vacationland.

1253
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,200
Paula Poundstone's book is called The Totally Unscientific Study of the Search for Human

1254
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:10,000
Happiness, and you can hear her expound on happiness and many other topics on her new

1255
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,040
podcast, Nobody Listens to Paula Poundstone.

1256
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,120
The Thurber Prize is one of the highest awards for humor writing in the United States, and

1257
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:22,240
we are proud to have both these authors on Maximum Fun every week.

1258
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:31,040
Paula Poundstone and John Hodgman, congratulations.
