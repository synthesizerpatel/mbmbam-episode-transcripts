1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,080
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,360
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,480
cool they are for listening.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
What's up, you cool baby?

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:30,880
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,880
on me If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,880
around If you got no place to go, when you're feeling

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,880
down If you're all alone, when the pretty birds

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,880
have flown Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,880
I think you're exactly where you need to be, because today is August 15th, and you're listening

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
to my brother, my brother, and me.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,880
Well, you probably won't hear it until the 16th, but God, the 15th.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,640
If you heard it today, today's the day where it's really fresh.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,160
This is an advice show for the modern era.

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:11,560
I am your semi-host, one of three hosts, Justin McElroy.

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,440
I'm another partial host, half-host, third host, Travis McElroy.

18
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,080
I'm a, I'm quasi-host, Griffin McElroy.

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,760
Oh, that's a good one.

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
That's a good one, Tim.

21
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
That was way better.

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
You and your words.

23
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Mm-hmm.

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
Where you get them words from?

25
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,400
Where you get them, all those words?

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,240
I read lots of thesauruses.

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
Slow down.

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,640
I didn't want a whole life story, it scares me, one of the words.

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,560
You go ahead and keep that locked up, son.

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,040
Hey, how do you guys feel about helping some people out with their lives today?

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
I would-

32
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
Do I have to help them move?

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
Nope, nope, nope.

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,320
There will be actually no effort required, either physical or mental.

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,320
My brother and my brother-

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
You just said the secret word.

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,320
We'll always help you, just not with moving.

38
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Or money.

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,440
We don't even help each other with moving, we can avoid it.

40
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Yeah.

41
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
Yeah.

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,440
I've moved too many people in my life.

43
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
Whatever.

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,160
You two bastards move every few weeks, Justin, come to this family.

45
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,720
I gotta throw them off, Justin.

46
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
The carpet looked-

47
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
I've been staying in one place for too long.

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
The carpet looked at me wrong.

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm out.

50
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,100
Chris, Chris via Gmail asks, I find myself feeling horribly embarrassed when I'm with

51
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,420
a girl who says something that doesn't live up to my exacting standards of wit and charm.

52
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,080
Where can I go to meet some intelligent women?

53
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,360
I was honestly considering going back for my post-graduate degree in the hopes of meeting

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
someone.

55
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
I know that Justin is with us-

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
That's not a good reason.

57
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
That's not a good reason.

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,080
I know Justin is with a smart lady.

59
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,040
Where do people like her go to socialize because I haven't met them where I'm at?

60
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
Chris, Gmail.

61
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,600
Here's the thing, Chris.

62
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:54,120
You're looking at bars, nobody's smart when they're in a bar because they went on the

63
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,680
booze on the sauce.

64
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,200
If I've learned one thing from Ernest Hemingway, smartest people are the stupidest drunks.

65
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,120
So it's true.

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
And he was impotent.

67
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,520
It might seem stupid there, but he was what?

68
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,660
He was impotent.

69
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,660
It's pronounced important.

70
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,660
No, it was impotent.

71
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,660
Impotent.

72
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,800
That has literally nothing to do with this situation, but it's all I know about Ernest

73
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Hemingway.

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
He may not even be impotent.

75
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Let's move on.

76
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
I prefer Papa.

77
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,000
That's how I always think of him.

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,400
The thing about this question is of the qualities that are worth looking for in a person.

79
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:48,120
I think intelligence is good, but I don't think it's a number one thing.

80
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,700
If that's what you're looking for for a connection, I don't know if that should be your number

81
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,440
one standard.

82
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Intelligence is like humor.

83
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
It's relative.

84
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
You know what I mean?

85
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:05,120
I mean, people that have never read The Great Gatsby, but their street smarts, their common

86
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,160
sense is off the charts.

87
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,560
You know what I mean?

88
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,720
A lot of my friends can't do math, but they're way smarter than I am.

89
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,120
And there are so many people out there in the world who are wicked stoops, who are with

90
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,720
somebody who's similarly wicked stoops.

91
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,920
And if one of their girlfriends asks them, is he smart?

92
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,280
She said, yeah, he's got a beautiful mind the way it works.

93
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,960
You wouldn't even believe it.

94
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
He says these things.

95
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,600
I don't know where he comes up with them.

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
It's beautiful.

97
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:42,040
He's just, he's quoting rush lyrics, really just quoting rush lyrics for Y Y Z.

98
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:49,760
So Chris, to answer your question, just, um, you know, I don't know where do smart people

99
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
hang out?

100
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:58,920
Starbucks, don't go back to, don't go back to, uh, I think Starbucks is not a bad idea.

101
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,280
Do people really hang out at Starbucks?

102
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,080
I do just to do, yeah, I'm, I'm there on the rack.

103
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
I always thought that was a myth.

104
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
No.

105
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,280
Well, I go there to wheeze off the internet sometimes.

106
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
Yeah.

107
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,040
When you work from home and have literally zero human contact, you have to, you have

108
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,160
to make a pilgrimage to the box or got to get the box to get that human connection.

109
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,720
So sometimes I just, I don't even get a drink.

110
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,920
I just rub up against people and hey, no one says you have to be pursuing your graduate

111
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,120
degree to hang out on college campuses.

112
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Trust me.

113
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,560
You just have to be faster than campus police.

114
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:42,520
Hey Phil, there's a guy, that guy again, who that guy is always with the wide, that's

115
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,560
PD one with this.

116
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,480
He never has any books ever.

117
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,680
That's why he's so fast.

118
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,400
We're used to catching people with books, even have any, he just has sunglasses and

119
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
a wide brim hat.

120
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,400
He was just hanging out by the, by the quad playing guitar.

121
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,000
Hey, I, uh, I took a trip home.

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,760
I go once a year and my best friend of almost 10 years bailed on me the entire time.

123
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,680
He has a new girlfriend, just moved in together.

124
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,780
How do I handle this using the least amount of curse words possible?

125
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,780
I'm a girl.

126
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,960
If that matters, that totally matters.

127
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,680
Uh, hey, that totally matters.

128
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,400
Of course it matters.

129
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,880
Let's course.

130
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
Let's break down the sentence structure here.

131
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,520
Let's break down the actual question.

132
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
Yeah.

133
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,640
The important, most verbatim, most important sentence in there.

134
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,800
He has a new girlfriend, just moved in together.

135
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,480
I am a girl.

136
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,960
Like your friend did not bail on you.

137
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,160
Your friend is protecting his relationship.

138
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Yeah.

139
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
Yeah.

140
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
Sorry lady.

141
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:53,560
The, the whole, like, no matter how secure somebody is in their relationship, I, I,

142
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,360
and I wholeheartedly believe this, no matter how secure somebody is in their relationship,

143
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:06,680
it is really hard for them to handle their SO, their significant other being friends

144
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,580
with, especially best friends with someone of the opposite sex, especially if they're

145
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,960
not also friends with them.

146
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:22,380
Because for starters, they probably think they should be their bestie, you know, they,

147
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,720
they should be your best friend.

148
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:30,160
So that's, and that's probably, and they should, you psycho, no, they should be, they should

149
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,080
be their best friend.

150
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,820
So yeah, of course you're going to feel threatened.

151
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,520
Of course it has everything to do with it.

152
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,400
And what you need to know is it's not that you can't still be his friend, but you have

153
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,840
to be sensitive to the fact that he is, you know, especially if he just moved in with

154
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,340
his girl, they have reached this new plateau and like they, you know, are getting used

155
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,000
to each other and dealing with that.

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,560
Be sensitive to that fact and don't try to rush in and be like, why are you hanging out

157
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
with that biddy?

158
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,040
Hang out with me.

159
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,440
You gotta be cool, homie.

160
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,640
Hey, plateau is totally the best word for that by the way.

161
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Yeah.

162
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,440
You can keep the other plateaus.

163
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,800
It's like a serious steps or just a series of plateaus.

164
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,840
If you think about it, I think that's a great NBNBA motivational poster, reach for the plateaus.

165
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,880
My advice in this situation, my, my advice, I can't tell you to, to move away.

166
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,640
Um, but I can tell you that you already did the best that you could do was move away.

167
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,120
So you are, you did step one, which is pack your bags and move away.

168
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,160
Step two, never ever go home again.

169
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
You're done there.

170
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,680
They say you can't go home again and for you that has become literal.

171
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
You can't.

172
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
You just can't.

173
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
He's dead now.

174
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
It's actually, you shouldn't go home again.

175
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
What happened to my best friend, Jerry?

176
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
It doesn't matter.

177
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
He's dead now.

178
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
He's dead to you.

179
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
He's gone.

180
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
He's dead to you.

181
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,680
For all intents and purposes.

182
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,320
They told me on this podcast I listened to that he died.

183
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,320
It was very peaceful.

184
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,400
Yahoo answers Yahoo answers user Ashley P. Uh, this question was sent in by a Twitter

185
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,200
user that Garrett kid.

186
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
So thank you.

187
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
That Garrett kid.

188
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,280
Uh, Ashley P asks, is this true?

189
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,680
My mom said that after you have sex, you won't grow taller anymore.

190
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,600
Example, get taller.

191
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
That's completely true.

192
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,720
That is completely true.

193
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,760
You're spitting out all your bones, right?

194
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
Yeah.

195
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,360
That's what makes your bones is your bone juice.

196
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,600
They call it, they call it boning down because it literally compresses your bones when you

197
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
do it.

198
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Yeah, that is correct.

199
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,040
And once you break the seal, you're done.

200
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,600
So you actually start shrinking.

201
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Yeah.

202
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Yes.

203
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,960
Constantly keep blinking all the time.

204
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,200
Do you know how like old old people are really small if they only get like that because they're

205
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:52,680
total sluts osteoporosis more like hosteo ho porous is whore.

206
00:09:52,680 --> 00:10:00,960
You old whore old whore by the way, Rupa clan and was three feet tall at her desk.

207
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,960
That's why she didn't get more TV appearances.

208
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,960
That's a fact.

209
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,840
You ever see that episode where Blanche was like, I can fit through a mouse hole.

210
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,520
It's too soon to joke about that.

211
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Is it?

212
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
It's never too soon.

213
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
It's a little too soon.

214
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,280
Is it too soon for her to hop back in bed with the guy after guy after guy after guy

215
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,680
until she was two feet tall.

216
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,440
Didn't I go to bed with Rupa clan again?

217
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
She's gone.

218
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
She's not gone.

219
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
She's at the bed.

220
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,680
Actually, she's boning down that Indian from Indian in the cupboard.

221
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,840
What the fuck, man?

222
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
That's where he went.

223
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,720
Travis with those classic literature references, that's the easier guy.

224
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,000
To be fair, I was just hitting the times by watching my audacity go across the screen

225
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,800
and Indian in the cupboard popped into my head.

226
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,800
I am just going to go ahead and apologize.

227
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,280
We all need to we all need to get our heads back in the game.

228
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,720
Yeah, I can tell we're starting to we're starting to drift a little bit.

229
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,120
Where do you think that started?

230
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
It's hard to say.

231
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,360
Hey, I have a problem with my name is from Gmail.

232
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,920
I'm going to guess it's from Sarah from Gmail.

233
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,000
I have a problem with my name.

234
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,460
I find my legal name, Sarah, to be too boring.

235
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,920
So for years I've gone by Sashi pronounced Sashi.

236
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,720
Sorry, I shouldn't read that part.

237
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,160
However, people seem to be easily confused by my nickname is I've seen it misspelled

238
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,640
myriad ways, Sushi, Sasha, Shashi, Shawshank.

239
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,840
And perhaps more frustratingly, people tend to think it's a man's name.

240
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,500
What should I do?

241
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,380
Become a more boring person to fit my legal name, undergo a sex change or legally change

242
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,560
my name to Sushi.

243
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,000
Help Gmail.

244
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,480
Where does a sex change come into the equation?

245
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,040
She just wanted to slip that in there.

246
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,880
That's what she's really asking about.

247
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,600
Listen here, Sushi.

248
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,200
Don't get a sex change.

249
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,720
That's not going to help your problem at all.

250
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,920
I think Sarah is an OK name.

251
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,360
But maybe that's the problem is that it's just an OK name.

252
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,200
There's so many of them.

253
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:21,520
Listen, Hashish, there is never a time in your life where your behavior is dictated

254
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,760
by your first name.

255
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,680
If you're living your life that way, you're doing it wrong.

256
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
That's so not true.

257
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,880
Unless your name is dictated, then you're just awesome.

258
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,360
I really am of the opinion that half of the things that happen to you in your life are

259
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,880
because of your first name.

260
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
Wow.

261
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
Really?

262
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
Yeah.

263
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,880
I think if you have a dull first name, you've got to work harder to make awesome things

264
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,960
happen for you.

265
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
That's true.

266
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,840
Does that make sense?

267
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:54,240
If you're looking at a list of people who you're going to hire for a job, they're all

268
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:04,120
equally qualified, one's named Steven, one is named Robert, and then one is named Pygmalion.

269
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,160
Which one of those three guys are you going to pick?

270
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,360
The trick question, it's Rob.

271
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
It is Robert.

272
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
You got it.

273
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Damn it.

274
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
Do you know why you pick Robert?

275
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
Why?

276
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
Why?

277
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
I didn't.

278
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
He's more qualified.

279
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
I don't know.

280
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
I was hoping you would have.

281
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:29,240
I think the problem that you're running into, Sasha, is that the reason people use boring,

282
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,440
standardized names is to save their children the embarrassment of having to explain their

283
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,520
names to people and to help make their names a little more, you know, to streamline their

284
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,920
life experience, let's say that.

285
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,760
You need to change your name.

286
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,560
The problem with Sasha is, of course, that it's not a word.

287
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
It's not.

288
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
You can say it all day.

289
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
It's not going to make it a word.

290
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
It's made up gibberish.

291
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,560
Just gibberish.

292
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,760
She's like a crazy person.

293
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:02,600
So what you need to do is pick a new name that is a word already but is also your name.

294
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,960
And I know that you came to us for this purpose.

295
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:13,840
So now we're going to go round Robin for you and suggest to you a new name that you can

296
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,200
use that's going to be impactful.

297
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:27,040
It's going to make a difference with people, but they're also going to know what it is.

298
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,520
And Griffin, let's start with you.

299
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,480
What should Habib's new name be?

300
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,720
Dominique.

301
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,880
Whoa.

302
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,720
Yeah, let that one just roll between your lips.

303
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,200
It feels so good to say it.

304
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Dominique.

305
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,880
I like to say it like that, too, as if it's kind of a question.

306
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,320
Hey, whatever happened to Dominique?

307
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,800
The first five letters are all lowercase, and the remainder is all uppercase.

308
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,260
That's how people will know.

309
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,360
What I like about that is it serves two purposes.

310
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,960
It can be her name and then the name of her clothing line.

311
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
Dominique.

312
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,200
It's her clothing line.

313
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,520
Oh, wow.

314
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,120
You have got upper-level management written all over you, Griffin.

315
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,160
I'm not giving her a name.

316
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,640
I'm building an empire.

317
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,080
It's about a brand, okay?

318
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:30,080
I'm of course going to go with Benigans because they closed, so they don't need the name anymore,

319
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,440
but people still have some pretty good feelings about it.

320
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,060
They had a good Monte Cristo.

321
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,060
I love it.

322
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,060
I love it.

323
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,240
But here's the problem.

324
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,160
It's not going to solve her being confused for a man problem.

325
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,520
She's property of Benigan.

326
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
That's easy.

327
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
I've got it.

328
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
Well, I guess it is.

329
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
I've got it.

330
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
How to solve the man problem.

331
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Okay.

332
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Okay.

333
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,520
Here's the name.

334
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,520
Lady Farquhar, Duchess of York.

335
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,840
Now, why does that fix anything?

336
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,720
Well, because it's got lady and duchess right in there, so it's clearly a female's name.

337
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,680
How about Lady Benigans?

338
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,640
Lady Benigans of Dominique.

339
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,240
How about TGI Fridays?

340
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Follow me.

341
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
Follow me.

342
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,240
Follow me.

343
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
I'm going somewhere with this.

344
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Okay.

345
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,240
Applebee's.

346
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
So, you weren't going anywhere.

347
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
Okay.

348
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
P.F.

349
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,240
Changs.

350
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
Okay.

351
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,200
Speaking of people with names.

352
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,740
Outback Steakhouse.

353
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,800
This next email comes to us from Lask via Gmail.

354
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
That's fucking awesome.

355
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
Which is a pretty good name.

356
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,920
I'm getting ready to pop the question, the marriage one.

357
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
Thanks, man.

358
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,920
I knew.

359
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
Piece it together.

360
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,280
I'm ready to pop the question.

361
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
To my princess.

362
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,400
Piece it together.

363
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,400
But I'm dreadfully boring, and she's made it clear that the proposal has to be special,

364
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,040
not some ho-hum, hey, you want to marry me thing.

365
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:59,600
Do you guys have any ideas how to make it sufficiently amazing, Dominique, and wonderful?

366
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,040
I think, hey, you want to marry me is a great proposal, but get a Skyrider to do it.

367
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Yeah.

368
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,320
Hey, you got anything to do in like a year and a half, want to get married?

369
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
This is the one.

370
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
Great.

371
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,240
You have to fake your own death for two years.

372
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,880
Oh my God, I love this.

373
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,680
And then two years after, you have to fake your death on like whatever anniversary of

374
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,680
coming up.

375
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,840
Two years to the day on your anniversary, you come back with a wedding ring.

376
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,600
She will be floored.

377
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,560
But make sure when you fake your death, it's something like really tragic, where it'll

378
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,800
take her like a solid three years to get over you.

379
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Yeah, because-

380
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
You don't want her to start-

381
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
It's got to hurt bad, man.

382
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,280
You got to ruin her, just really wreck her.

383
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,760
It's got to be her fault.

384
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,480
Oh, yes.

385
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,480
I told you to do the dishes.

386
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,880
I fell over on the dishwasher like that dude's mom in Garden State.

387
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,240
I have a better idea.

388
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,240
Actually die.

389
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Whoa.

390
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Whoa.

391
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Make her marry your ashes.

392
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,720
And then have your twin brother propose marriage to her.

393
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,200
But it's actually you.

394
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,640
But no, wait.

395
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,760
Okay, there's some holes in my plan.

396
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,600
There are some definite holes.

397
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:15,120
I think the main thing to do is to remember that she is going to be repeating this story

398
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,280
to people over and over and over, and you're going to have to repeat it over and over and

399
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
over again.

400
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,360
And I cannot tell you how many people I've talked to, and I asked like, so how'd you

401
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
do it?

402
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,880
And they're just, well, I don't know, we're just at dinner, and I was like, hey, what

403
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
about this?

404
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,880
And they're like, okay, fine.

405
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,800
And then that was it.

406
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,680
And you need to bring the heat.

407
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,800
It's not about being boring, and it's not so much about being creative, I think.

408
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,940
It's about effort.

409
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,600
You have to come up with something where it's clear you thought about it and put some work

410
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
into it.

411
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,480
Let me suggest this last, this is not a joke.

412
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:04,100
Look in your area in the yellow pages to see if there are any quartets or sometimes very

413
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
large quartets.

414
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,680
On my wife, the first Valentine's Day we were together, I had a 20-member quartet.

415
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,840
They call it a very large quartet, which is funny.

416
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,480
It's the best joke that people in large singing groups have, it's a very large quartet, came

417
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,640
and sang to her on Valentine's Day.

418
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,040
Now did I regret that for all the years following when I had trouble topping it?

419
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,400
Yeah, you bet.

420
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,960
But that's okay for this.

421
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,520
This is one where you can go all out.

422
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,600
So I say call a quartet to do it.

423
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,600
Not only think about what's in your area and what's available, think about her.

424
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:45,160
You know her pretty well, what it will make it specific to her and not a real, in general,

425
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,600
do you want to marry me thing.

426
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:52,440
What is a specific thing you can do that only she would appreciate?

427
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,600
Or you could do what Dude It's Coke did and get us to ask her for you.

428
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,080
We are always here for this.

429
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,280
If you need us, we are here for you.

430
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,300
I've seen enough TV to know that you shouldn't hide the wedding ring in some sort of food

431
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,760
item in a table, like mashed potatoes.

432
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,440
This Vichyssoise is crunchy.

433
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,320
Because Uncle Phil will eat it right up.

434
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,320
Can I just say, I think in the mashed potatoes, though, if you're going to go with the food

435
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,080
one, mashed potatoes is the best.

436
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,640
Yeah, it's really the sexiest, definitely.

437
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
It's easy to hide.

438
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,080
Hide it in a pile of green beans.

439
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,320
Okay, Josh writes to us from Gmail.

440
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,960
He says, I'm getting married this October and of all the things I'm worried about,

441
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,880
the main worry I have is dancing.

442
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,720
The first dance, he means.

443
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,880
Saying I have two left feet is putting it nicely.

444
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,480
I'm more of a quadriplegic with one left foot and one club foot.

445
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
That's kind of mean.

446
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,480
It is a little mean.

447
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,320
It's Daniel Day Lewis getting married.

448
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,200
What does being a robot have to do with it?

449
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,440
My fiance has made many mentions of how we're probably going to go to the old high school

450
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,400
dance route where we just hold each other and spin in a circle slowly.

451
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,120
I can tell by her less than enthusiastic tone, this will not make her happy.

452
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,680
I am too poor to afford dance lessons, thanks to the wedding.

453
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,680
And I'm wondering if MB and BAM has any tips or advice on what I should do.

454
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Oh, Jesus.

455
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
Josh.

456
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,680
Oh, dance tips.

457
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
Perfect, Josh.

458
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
Hold on.

459
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Here we go.

460
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,680
Sway.

461
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,160
Let me give you, I'm going to give you a five word answer right here.

462
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,520
Watch Save the Last Dance.

463
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
Yeah.

464
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,880
Step up 3D.

465
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,320
That's the cheapest dance classes you can get because at the end you don't just learn

466
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
the moves.

467
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
You learn about the passion.

468
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
And that's the important thing.

469
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,440
Justin, what did you, you're married.

470
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
Yeah.

471
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
What did you do?

472
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,120
I, I'm a grownup.

473
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,000
So I held my wife's waist and she held my shoulders and we spun in a circle.

474
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,200
Like that, guys, that's not boring.

475
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,680
That's like what people do because I cannot, like seriously, if, if you guys choreograph

476
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:59,560
a swing routine, the douche chills will hit me from hundreds of miles and I'm like, oh,

477
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,120
what did they just do?

478
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,320
I just got a douche.

479
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,160
I think you should freak dancer.

480
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
Yeah.

481
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:12,400
Crunk that shit in front of God and everyone really start crumping and like just go to

482
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
town on it.

483
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Just cramp it.

484
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,800
Just cramp across the dance floor.

485
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
That's the thing, right?

486
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,960
Cramping and don't let her know you're going to do that.

487
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,840
Start really sweet and like swaying and like in a circle and then just go to town.

488
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Someone help me.

489
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,800
My new husband is having a seizure.

490
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Help.

491
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:36,080
So many people, so many people do first dances at their wedding receptions.

492
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,960
Like there's gotta be other things that you can do to symbolize like you and I are, are

493
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,440
together for revs.

494
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
Right?

495
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
Right.

496
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
First arm wrestling.

497
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,760
First, first staring contest is what I was thinking of.

498
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,180
Like put on a slow song, whatever.

499
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,640
Just go on the dance floor, don't touch and just have a staring contest.

500
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
Yeah.

501
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
First knife fight.

502
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,560
Well, that might be a little grizzly.

503
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:01,640
Can I tell you it seriously on the day when you are married, there's, there's so much

504
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:07,600
else going on and so many people there that care about you and, and, and things like that.

505
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,000
You will not worry about your dance.

506
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,440
I promise you it will be like so low on your, on your priority list.

507
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,680
It's going to be fine.

508
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:23,000
And I, and, and it, if you're worried about your wife being bored by your first dance,

509
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,080
there's going to be so much else.

510
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
Yeah.

511
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,600
There's going to be so much else going on that day.

512
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,360
Well, I thought you were going a different way with that.

513
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,360
Wow.

514
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,360
Yeah.

515
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,600
You are so many more problems that are just going to branch off of that one.

516
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,200
You guys should probably talk about it.

517
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Yeah.

518
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,960
Ask, uh, and last ask Josh how he did it.

519
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
See we're making connections.

520
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,400
Hey, as long as we're going on this romantic streak, I would like to posit one from Yahoo

521
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
answers.

522
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,400
Yeah.

523
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
Okay.

524
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,160
Um, this one comes to us from blue devil ATV racer.

525
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,720
I'm so glad I worked that one out.

526
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,360
Um, blue devil ATV racer like that have, I think he's got it all figured out.

527
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,520
Uh, this question was also sent in by Mike Susek.

528
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
Thank you.

529
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
Mike Susek.

530
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,920
Um, blue devil ATV racer asks, how do I get my girlfriend to start to rub my crotch while

531
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,240
we make out?

532
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,640
I just don't know how to get her to, we've been making out since forever and I get excited,

533
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,500
but my crotch just needs some attention.

534
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,680
How do I go about this?

535
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,720
Oh, blue devil.

536
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
It's so easy.

537
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,360
Um, you just put a little peanut butter down there.

538
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:43,360
Oh, well, what you don't want to do is hide it in mashed potatoes.

539
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,600
That's absolutely the worst thing you can do.

540
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,040
I like how nonspecific he is.

541
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:57,520
I don't care if she rubs my penis in that quadrant and you just want her to start to

542
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
do it.

543
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
Yeah.

544
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
Just start from there.

545
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,520
She'll know what to do.

546
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
Where the hair starts.

547
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:09,400
Did you tell her it's sore and ask if she has any icy hot?

548
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
Yeah.

549
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,640
Can you rub that down for me?

550
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,920
It's getting a little stiff.

551
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
What?

552
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:24,840
I'm going to use my crotch just needs some attention.

553
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:32,440
That sounds like something a serial killer says.

554
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,520
What dialogue is going on between you and your crotch?

555
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,200
Hey, I'm down here too.

556
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Come on.

557
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,160
Um, I didn't want to say anything, but I could use a little attention down here.

558
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,800
I'm feeling real snubbed down here.

559
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,720
You and I used to be so close.

560
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,720
I miss Debra.

561
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,720
Remember Debra?

562
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,360
You remember Debra?

563
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,000
She used to rub, start to rub me frequently.

564
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So frequently.

565
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,440
And you wouldn't even have to tell her that there was peanut butter down there.

566
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
She would just know.

567
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
Holy shit.

568
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
What?

569
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
God, people.

570
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,440
What?

571
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:14,880
I don't understand these people who would ask this on Yahoo instead of just saying like,

572
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,120
hey, rub my balls.

573
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
It's important.

574
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
I love you.

575
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
I need some attention.

576
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,560
Some attention in my downtown.

577
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
Take me downtown to attention town.

578
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,760
You know what's up?

579
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
Dear Bim Bammers.

580
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,400
I have a friend that once.

581
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
We're simpatico.

582
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,960
Can we just take a moment?

583
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,360
We need the exact moment to move on.

584
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,680
I'll be over here.

585
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,800
Hey, Bim Bammers.

586
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
We'll do every other word.

587
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Okay.

588
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Okay.

589
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
I have.

590
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
I'm not doing this.

591
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,760
A friend that wants advice about her relationship, which seems to have become toxic.

592
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,020
I don't know the guy.

593
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,680
So can I really tell her to break up with him even though I've never met him?

594
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,240
Would that be overstepping my boundaries?

595
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,360
Bitch, what do you think we do every week?

596
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
What?

597
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:04,520
Do you remember the guy who was like, my friend is trapped in town and I need him to get him

598
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
to move away?

599
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
That one?

600
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
Yeah.

601
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,920
This is like the same basic principle of, yeah, you can totally tell her to break up

602
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
with him.

603
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
But be prepared.

604
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Yeah.

605
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Right.

606
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
You can tell anybody anything.

607
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,600
Just this week, just this episode, we've told people to fake their death to really

608
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,720
die and put peanut butter on their genitalia.

609
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
Yeah.

610
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,960
So, yeah, I don't think boundaries are a big issue for us.

611
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,200
But we also don't have to see any of you every day, so that's an added bonus for us.

612
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,120
This is the only thing I can tell you about advice like that.

613
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,920
Their relationship has become toxic.

614
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Okay.

615
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,280
That's bad.

616
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:47,100
But I would say for 99% of advice, people don't want it.

617
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,880
What they want is someone to support what they already believe.

618
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,480
I really do think that.

619
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,760
Especially if she's not seeking out advice from you like, oh, I don't know what to do.

620
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:06,640
She doesn't want you to tell her that unless she's looking for it specifically.

621
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:14,160
And excluding everything that we say every episode, as a friend, your job is to give

622
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,560
her the advice she wants and not the advice you think she needs.

623
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
That's not how that works.

624
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,560
That's interesting.

625
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Yeah.

626
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,760
That's a good, you know, supporting her opinions is more important.

627
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:33,200
If it's like, if you believe in your heart that it's bad, you should tell her that.

628
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,560
You should tell her that you think it's bad.

629
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:41,200
But people have to go in those realizations on their own, especially in bad relationships.

630
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,520
People have got to realize it.

631
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,400
I really think you've got to meet the guy first, though, before you can, because maybe

632
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,880
things aren't going toxic.

633
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,000
Maybe things are getting a little bit stale.

634
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,840
Maybe he's a super nice guy and there's something else that's wrong in the relationship.

635
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,280
I just think it's kind of a blunt way to handle the problem.

636
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
You should, you should.

637
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,160
And how serious can this relationship be if you haven't met the dude?

638
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
Yeah.

639
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,920
If you want to be my lover, you got to get with my friends.

640
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,480
And it seems like she completely over, like, just skip that step.

641
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,640
Stop right now, thank you very much.

642
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,640
Whoa.

643
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,640
You think he's radioactive?

644
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
Yeah.

645
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,640
Oh shit.

646
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,640
That's why she hasn't met him.

647
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,120
He's being kept in a lead box.

648
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,960
This is my boyfriend, lead box.

649
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,360
I've never seen his face.

650
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,720
I can't hear him talk.

651
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,140
This lady's friend is dating the toxic Avenger.

652
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,720
It's got a little toxic.

653
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,560
What you need to do is stay with that, because that franchise is coming back around.

654
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,220
Oh man, that garbage pail kids.

655
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,400
It's a new day.

656
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,720
Here's a quickie from FormSpring, a quickie from us, because it's going to be a quick

657
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
answer.

658
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Yeah.

659
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,680
Dear bambinos, or dear bambinos, can you really have friends that are girls?

660
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,860
After a while, I get really close to them and start seeing the possibility of more than

661
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,280
friends relationship.

662
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,000
What do?

663
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,960
You're a terrible person.

664
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,640
Ew.

665
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,640
I'm not exactly sure what you're asking.

666
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,120
I think he's saying that he tries to be friends with girls and then he falls in love with

667
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
them.

668
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
Is that right?

669
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Sure.

670
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
Yeah.

671
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Hey, that's called biology, man.

672
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,180
Like, seriously.

673
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,180
That's how we're built.

674
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,680
We're built to want to propagate this species.

675
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,240
No, some people are built like that.

676
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,920
I totally see where this dude's coming from.

677
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:27,240
Some people are built like that, and it really is something that you mature out of.

678
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,160
Yeah, that is true, though.

679
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:35,160
I think that you can have more mature, cross-gender relationships as you get older.

680
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,360
And as you have more legit relationships.

681
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,360
Yeah.

682
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:43,520
And as you understand, like right now, you don't understand how that relationship works.

683
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,960
So you're starting to feel these nice, warm, fuzzy feelings, which is the friendship, and

684
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,080
then looking at a girl that you find attractive and combining those two things.

685
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,720
You have to be able to keep those two things separate to maintain the friendship.

686
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,360
Friendship is a good basis for a relationship, but the problem is, if you've been friends

687
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:07,480
for a long time, you kind of miss out on that flirting stage where you're getting to know

688
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
each other.

689
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,680
And that can be one of those exciting time relationships.

690
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,080
And you're in kind of a weird spot.

691
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:21,140
You're like ahead of and behind the game simultaneously when you start off as friends.

692
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,120
But that is normal.

693
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Let's say that.

694
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
And you can't have friends.

695
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,360
You just got to be a little older.

696
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,880
And it's easier if you have a girlfriend already to have friends that are girls, but she will

697
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
hate them.

698
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
That's even easier.

699
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
Or if they're uggos.

700
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
If they're uggos.

701
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Yeah.

702
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,720
Hey, that's your answer.

703
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,600
Yes, if they're uggos.

704
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,600
And that's, hey ladies, that goes both ways, okay?

705
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,520
And also, if they go both ways, you can be great friends with them.

706
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,760
I'm leaving for my sophomore year at college in a couple of weeks, so there's going to

707
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,880
be the inevitable teary goodbye soon.

708
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,200
Would it be weird if, when that final goodbye hug, I pecked one of my female friends on

709
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
the cheek?

710
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,960
We're extremely close.

711
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,440
She's blown kisses at me before.

712
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,080
I see it as a way to express our affection for each other.

713
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,680
I just don't want to pull away from that post-peck hug and suddenly be weird between us.

714
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Any help would be appreciated.

715
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,680
God damn it, Brad.

716
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
Damn it, Brad.

717
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
I'm so creeped out.

718
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
Did you not hear what we just said?

719
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,720
What we just said.

720
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,120
It's like you're not even listening.

721
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,040
How could you ask that?

722
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,760
I'm so creeped out right now.

723
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,760
Why would you-

724
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,760
No, don't be creeped out.

725
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
That's a natural.

726
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,840
It's because he uses the word pecked.

727
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:40,240
Brad, I think if that's in your heart, there is nothing wrong with affection.

728
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,400
No one's ever going to think that's weird.

729
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,480
You know, in France, you legally have to kiss someone on the lips four times when you meet

730
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,600
a new person.

731
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
Did you know that, Brad?

732
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,960
There's a lot of herpes going around in France.

733
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,160
Just give her a kiss.

734
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
You know what?

735
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:03,000
I think if you're moving away, I think you should kiss her full on the lips and then

736
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,160
put some peanut butter on your crotch and just see where it goes, you know?

737
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,400
Brad, let me counterpoint here.

738
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Okay.

739
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
That's weird.

740
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Don't do that.

741
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Don't do that.

742
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,520
Because you will pull away and even if it's not weird, it will be weird because you will

743
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,080
pull away and be thinking, was that weird?

744
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,340
Yes, it is.

745
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,240
Because you know who pecks people on the cheek?

746
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
Old people.

747
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,240
Are you old people?

748
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,400
Are you not old people?

749
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,680
Are you over four feet tall because you ain't that old?

750
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
Do you know what?

751
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,680
I'm going to start giving people kisses on the cheek.

752
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,280
That's going to be my new jam.

753
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,840
Like Justin, you hug people all the time.

754
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,920
I'm going to start like when I meet people at like a convention or something, they're

755
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,560
going to get a big smack on the cheek.

756
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,440
That's going to be my calling card because I don't think there's anything wrong with

757
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,440
it.

758
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,240
I think it's a sweet display of affection.

759
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,240
Okay.

760
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,240
Here's what we're going to do.

761
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,440
We're all going to, you and the rest of the MBM nation are going to start hugging and

762
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,840
kissing people, kissing them on the cheek so much that by the time you leave, it's not

763
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,160
going to be weird anymore from like an adult point of view.

764
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,160
That's what I'm saying.

765
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,160
I'm taking it back.

766
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,920
So we're going to take care of it for him?

767
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
We're going to fix it?

768
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:16,920
When you see us in public, by which I mean Griffin, just kiss him on the cheek and he

769
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,920
will return the favor.

770
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,920
Unless you're a dude.

771
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,640
Just come on.

772
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,440
The important thing to keep in mind is after that kiss on the cheek, no eye contact.

773
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,440
Oh my God.

774
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
It's so important.

775
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,800
You've got to, you've got to just get out, look away and go.

776
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,480
And I think remember shoulder slumped, it's, it's open mouth, no tongue for your first

777
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:46,580
cheek kiss for your first cheek kiss, maybe move up to the ear, maybe give a little nibble.

778
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:52,080
Maybe just find out, smell her hair or don't do that at all.

779
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,400
Don't do any of that stuff.

780
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,020
There's a hot girl cashiering, is that a word?

781
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,480
There's a hot girl cashiering at my local hypermarket.

782
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,760
I've only seen her once and have not been through her checkout line.

783
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,000
What can I purchase at her register to make a great first impression?

784
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,080
Is there a sequence of items that will make her mine?

785
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,800
This is a great question, people who want great questions.

786
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,040
This is a great question.

787
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:28,440
Jar of honey, box of condoms, children's movie, fish oil, fish oil, take care of yourself.

788
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,800
I would say walk up and slap down like a bag of kitty litter and stare her directly in

789
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:40,360
the eyes and say, I don't own a cat here to get extra small condoms and then throw them

790
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,480
on the register and be like, what?

791
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,920
Confidence, ladies like that.

792
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,640
You have these any smaller?

793
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:55,400
Can I talk to your manager about special ordering smaller condoms than your smallest size?

794
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,800
You got any thimbles?

795
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:05,080
Do you have any plantains upon which I can test these bad boys out?

796
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,280
Little rubber things you put on your thumb to go through papers, that would be ideal.

797
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,720
I'm more or less dealing with a gumdrop down there.

798
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:19,560
It's a little safe and fleshy acorn.

799
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,160
I don't think any of these things are going to work.

800
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,680
No, I don't think so either.

801
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,200
Man, this is really bad advice.

802
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
It seemed good.

803
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:32,760
It seemed like it was going so well.

804
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,760
Cosmo?

805
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,280
Would that be cool?

806
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,600
Like you're in the women's needs?

807
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,640
Oh, you know what would be fucking dope?

808
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:45,440
What if you bought a whole bunch of expensive shit so that whenever the price came up on

809
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,280
the little monitor there, the price was your phone number.

810
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:58,960
You would have to add it up super specific, but she'd be like, oh, this is 30,000 blah

811
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,960
blah blah.

812
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,640
It would be your phone number, dog.

813
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,920
And you'd be like, oh, that's so weird.

814
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,920
That's my phone number.

815
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,560
You should give me a ring sometime and then walk away without paying for it.

816
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,880
But also I need to return all this stuff.

817
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,640
Good luck re-shelving this shit.

818
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,480
You should say, maybe you can ring me up.

819
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
What?

820
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,560
And then she'd be like, oh my God, I'm a cashier.

821
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,440
And you'd be like, yeah, I know.

822
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,400
Have fun putting that stuff back.

823
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,560
Yeah, I think that Griffin's got the best idea.

824
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:36,520
The only other alternative is to wait until an old, like old, old short, slutty woman

825
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
goes through her register.

826
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,800
And then when she's like fumbling for her checkbook or whatever, you just say, oh, don't

827
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
worry about it, ma'am.

828
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
I've got it.

829
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,880
Thank you for your dedication to this nation.

830
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,680
And I think that would go really well.

831
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,280
You fucked a lot of Marines.

832
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,280
You old slut.

833
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,280
What do you guys think?

834
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,760
Are we ready for the last question or should we do another?

835
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,760
What do you think?

836
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,760
Yeah, let's do one more.

837
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
Okay.

838
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,760
Griffin, you pick.

839
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,760
You're good at picking.

840
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:12,240
Um, let's see, let's, let's see.

841
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,960
Okay.

842
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:20,800
This is not the kind of flow we would normally look for in a high energy podcast, but we'll

843
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,760
just slow it down until you pick just the right question.

844
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
I'm reading.

845
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,880
We got so many good questions this week.

846
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,600
I want to thank everyone for sending us so many good questions.

847
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,720
You really got the hint.

848
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,400
Now let me say we did get fewer creepy questions, but they became exponentially more creepy.

849
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,320
Um, and to those people I say, no, thank you.

850
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,560
Um, we actually got a good, we actually got a good one from a, on Twitter that I want

851
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,200
to address from hit it from Joe Martini is his, is his Twitter username.

852
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,680
I was just laid off on Wednesday.

853
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,400
I'm sorry to hear that, Joe.

854
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,400
And rather than seeking new employment, I decided to chase my dreams.

855
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,960
Good idea or bad.

856
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:06,000
Well, the important component here is what's, what's your dream jet packs jet pack.

857
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,120
If you're going to pursue the jet pack future and lift society up with you, then yes, that's

858
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,120
good.

859
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,040
Now, if your dream is being homeless, that's bad.

860
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,040
That's the thing.

861
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:24,360
No one's, no one's dream has ever like the manager of a local bank, which would be a

862
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,100
fungibly secure, you know, um, vocation.

863
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:34,440
And most people are, you know, I want to be Tom Cruise's best friend.

864
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,400
I want to open a failing bar.

865
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
That's my dream.

866
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,520
A real middle of the road kind of establishment.

867
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:46,520
Uh, I think that pursuing your dreams is always a good idea cause you only go around on those

868
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,800
big blue ball once and it's big, stupid orb.

869
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:58,560
Listen, shoot for the stars, shoot for the stars.

870
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,200
And even if you miss, you'll run into the moon.

871
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,200
What's up moon?

872
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,200
I failed.

873
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,200
You're a hollow bitch.

874
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,200
I'm 95% sure.

875
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Aim for the sky.

876
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
That's how that phrase goes.

877
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,200
Yeah.

878
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Something like that.

879
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:24,320
So Griffin, I want to hear your last question, but first I'll do a little housekeeping.

880
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
Um, thank you guys.

881
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,200
We can't thank you guys enough.

882
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,200
Seriously.

883
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,240
You do not know how incredibly supportive you've been.

884
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,920
Um, we, uh, have gotten so many people spreading the word about the show that that's really

885
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:49,060
how we, um, how we increase the size of our, uh, influence is by, uh, is by adding new

886
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,980
listeners via word of mouth.

887
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,000
You can always put us on speakers and blast us as you drive through your neighborhood.

888
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,040
That's good.

889
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:04,920
Tell a friend, tell an enemy, tell a loved one, um, and you'll love them more as a result

890
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,440
because you'll bond.

891
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:12,880
Um, if you want to ask us a question, if you want to seek out our advice, it's at mbmbam.com

892
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:23,360
or all the different, um, methods, uh, you can, uh, you can, uh, email us mbmbam at gmail.com.

893
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,360
You can call us.

894
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,360
What's the number?

895
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:30,240
Uh, it's, oh God, I'll tell you in just one second.

896
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,240
Okay.

897
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,240
Keep talking.

898
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
Okay.

899
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,880
Uh, you can hit us on Twitter.

900
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,360
We love to see a two zero three mbmbam one.

901
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,360
Okay.

902
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,360
You can hit us on Twitter.

903
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:46,480
We like to, we love to see, uh, questions on Twitter and, and quotes, uh, uh, from the

904
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,800
show always make us laugh cause we forget the dumb shit that we say.

905
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,960
Um, and just so everyone knows secretly, I'm keeping count in my head of which, whose

906
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
quotes get tweeted more.

907
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
Yeah.

908
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,960
How's it going?

909
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,600
Um, you're going to have to check my math on this, but I got a leg up.

910
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:09,400
I got a leg up last week cause so many people tweeted the, the anorexic balsamic thing.

911
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,400
Yeah.

912
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,040
But that was the funniest question we've ever gotten.

913
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
So that was understandable.

914
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,040
Yeah.

915
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:22,840
Um, so also still on the site that you can buy if you want to, if you want to get active,

916
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:27,320
like get involved, uh, you can buy a t-shirt.

917
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,120
We have a logo t-shirt and a shirt that says, Hey Jeffrey.

918
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,040
Um, I know the site says pre-order, but they're not pre-orders there.

919
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,440
They're actually on sale now and they have them in stock.

920
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,240
Um, they just started shipping too, didn't they?

921
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,240
Yeah.

922
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,240
They just started shipping.

923
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,900
They should, you should start getting them next week.

924
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,960
They're shipping out in the, in the order they were purchased.

925
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,600
So, uh, if you got on it early, hopefully next week you should be getting one.

926
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:58,320
Make sure you send us like pictures with you wearing them in, uh, dangerous places or pictures

927
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,280
of you not wearing them.

928
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,280
Yuck.

929
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,280
Gross.

930
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,920
That's, that's weirder than a peck on the cheek.

931
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:13,360
Um, you, you can also buy in BNB am the app experience, um, which is our, our iPhone app.

932
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,360
Uh, so many people purchased that.

933
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,360
Uh, we just got the numbers in and people, people really support it.

934
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:26,080
Um, there's a, as of this listening Griffin, is there a new special feature on?

935
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,400
Yeah, I'll put it on there.

936
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,960
Yeah, there's a, there's a new bonus feature on there.

937
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:35,400
We, we put some little edited clips, uh, up on the app experience so you can purchase

938
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,600
that in the app store if you want even more.

939
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,760
And you can listen to all the episodes and contact us with it and stuff.

940
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,000
I just want to throw out, we've been keeping track of all the justice stats fats entries.

941
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Haven't been many.

942
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
At least I have.

943
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,760
There haven't been many, but the ones we've gotten, I mean, pretty, pretty impressive.

944
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,760
Well one was an obvious lie because if you weighed that much, you'd be, you'd be so totally

945
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,760
dead.

946
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,280
You would sink into the hollow earth.

947
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,360
And one person sent in a picture, which I explicitly told them not to do.

948
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:07,240
I explicitly said no pics.

949
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:13,800
So you want them to prove it, just not with a picture, just send an MP3 of yourself running

950
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,680
up a flight of stairs.

951
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,560
We're trying to find our fattest listener and reward them with a $2 voucher for our

952
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,840
iPhone app.

953
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,400
I don't know, I don't remember why anymore.

954
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,440
If that helps, that'd be more palatable.

955
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,400
So that's all the housekeeping stuff we have to do.

956
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,880
The main thing is just thank you guys so much.

957
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,640
You have no idea how much it means to us.

958
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,640
Oh, thank you.

959
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,700
Thank you to Bob Ball who recorded our, our disclaimer, which we're going to start putting

960
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:50,320
before episodes so that we don't get sued by people who, you know, who do put peanut

961
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,360
butter on their, on their wieners.

962
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,040
And then like, I stand by that though.

963
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:59,360
I do think that that you should follow that advice and also let us know how, if you followed

964
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,280
our advice, which you shouldn't ever do, let us know how that went.

965
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,280
Griffin.

966
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,960
This one's going to be tricky.

967
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:15,840
Yahoo Answers user Ashley asks, where can I watch the animated version of boku wa imautao

968
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,340
ni koi usuru?

969
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:31,520
I'm in love with my younger sister, I'm Travis McElroy, I'm Griffin McElroy, and this has

970
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,520
been my brother.

971
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,520
My brother and me.

972
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,520
Kiss your dad.

973
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,520
Square on the lips.

974
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:54,520
You will never know me.

975
00:45:54,520 --> 00:46:09,120
I'm Travis McElroy, and this has been my brother.
