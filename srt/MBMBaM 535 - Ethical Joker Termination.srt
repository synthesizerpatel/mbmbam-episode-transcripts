1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:46,960
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,200
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,440
Hello, I'm Travis McElroy, and I'm running a bit late, so I recorded my part of the intro ahead of

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,720
time, and it will be filling in between everyone else's bits. But don't worry, I've done this show

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:09,120
over 500 times, so I'm sure that it will make sense. Weird, it's already off. It's already

10
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:16,400
weirdly off. It's a shame that- Good one, Griffin. When Travis went to space on the big hero mission

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,240
to stop the Hubble from falling on all of us, I thought that was brave of him. I did not think

12
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,800
about it being a scheduling issue. Ross Perot? I haven't heard that name in forever. He told us

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,440
to talk about Ross Perot, and we fucking- Okay, let's get this shit back on track. Ross Perot,

14
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,120
I remember that guy. He used to do political stuff. He didn't live to see Elon Musk shoot

15
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:46,560
several people into space. He's dead? Okay, this is sounding good, actually. No, Travis,

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,800
Elon Musk is very much alive. Fuck Elon Musk. Wow, okay. This is interesting, because what did

17
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,720
he think? What bridge did he think we were gonna cross? Where did he think we were gonna go with

18
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,120
that? I know he hates underground magnetic sort of maglev tunnels. That's like a thing he's always

19
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,160
kind of talking about. Travis is half train. Yes. On his mother's side. Yeah, our mom was a train.

20
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,240
Toot toot. Okay. This is fucked up now. It is actually getting a little weird. Travis, are you-

21
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,960
I don't think it's that weird, Justin. Are you here with us, Travis, in the room? Nope, still

22
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:34,000
prerecorded. Whoa. Travis, give me a sign. Hit me, baby, one more time. Okay. Travis, give me a few

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:51,840
bars of The Sign by Ace of Base. I saw the signs. Okay, so there's not a recording. I opened up my eyes, and I am happy now living without you. Just a few bars. Let you go. Oh, oh, I saw the signs. So did you bail out of your space mission? I opened up my eyes, I saw the signs.

24
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,280
Because you were talking about how you were going to be a brave astronaut and save the whole country

25
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,680
from Hubble. Good one, Griffin. Okay. No, but fucking answer me, because you have been talking

26
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,960
for months about this big brave space mission you're going to go on with all the astronauts.

27
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,240
Do you guys think the Mandalorian also puts a tiny helmet on his penis sometimes just for fun?

28
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,320
Wow, that sucks. Sucks. It sucks. We actually should have pre-listened. Now, I'm thinking that. Like,

29
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,320
I kind of feel like, no, I'm the asshole. You know what I mean? It's weird that he didn't make this

30
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,680
conversational. But it's not weird, because it is Travis, right? It is, yeah. Is he just walking around

31
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,000
hanging brain with his helmet on? In a lot of ways, this is indiscernible from recording a podcast

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,440
with live Travis. Yeah, it's not really much of a difference. Interesting. It's worth thinking

33
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,120
about, isn't it? Is there a satellite phone or something we can use to call John Glenn, Houston,

34
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,680
ask them to patch us through? Hey, guys, I'm back. Is this still the recording?

35
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,840
Haha, just kidding. Still pre-recorded. Yeah, fuck off. So I guess Juice and I can

36
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,080
just do this show ourselves. And yeah. God, it would be great to have Travis here, though. Wow,

37
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,600
this bit's going to get a little long in the tooth pretty fast. It feels long. Yeah, it's getting

38
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,640
pretty long in the tooth, huh? Okay, so you're here now, right? Nope, still pre-recorded. Oh,

39
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,640
my God. Okay, I don't like it. I'm going to move on. This is an advice show where we-

40
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,880
I really liked Mamma Mia 2. I don't know what people had against it. Oh, Griffin's pre-recording

41
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,440
now too, or I'm having an episode. One of my mini episodes. PU, my feet stink. Hey, Griffin,

42
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:45,120
are you back? Yes. I'm not. Do you guys think the Mandalor- Great one, guys. Another great episode.

43
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,080
Squirrel nut zippers. So we have to stop now. We're really dissociating. Okay, I'm back. No,

44
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,560
I'm really back. This is me really back, you guys. I'm really back. How did it go? Pretty bad,

45
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,040
actually. Oh, man. This is an advice show, and I got some advice for you, Travis. I'll give it to

46
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,280
you privately after the show. And cut. Okay, let's go. This is an advice show for the modern era.

47
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:17,920
I want to gift a handmade oven mitt to my drug dealer for Christmas. I think oven mitts are the

48
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,560
perfect universal gift since everyone uses them, but I don't know what pattern of fabric to use.

49
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,000
The only thing I know about this person is that they both sell and smoke weed. Is a marijuana

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,880
print too cliche? What fabric is sure to make my dealer know that I'm actually chill and I only

51
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,600
seem sketchy when we meet because I'm an anxious person that's from weed wearing in Wisconsin?

52
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,400
Huh. Isn't this an indictment of our modern society? All we know about our weed dealers

53
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:55,360
is weed. It used to be back in 1930, you used to invite your weed dealer to dinner every Sunday,

54
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:05,920
you know? And you really got to know him, and now this fly by night, just fast paced concrete jungle.

55
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,440
Now, I know you can know certain other things about your dealer. Like, for instance, I know

56
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,800
what kind of car they drive and how much money they like in exchange for marijuana.

57
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,160
Yeah, that's true. Is there anything I can do? Maybe just sort of go with like a

58
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,920
license, a novelty license plate for the kind of car or a key chain that's like,

59
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,320
I'm a Honda man, something like that. What about a picture of their face

60
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,240
on the oven mitt with like their mouth open so it looks like they're biting the hot pan to pull it

61
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,640
out? That's funny and fun. And then, and it gets around a lot of the issues that were discussed

62
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:51,840
in the message to us. Also, an oven mitt that looks like a crab claw always lands.

63
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,920
That's always good. Maybe you don't have to go so specific. You know what I mean? The oven mitt

64
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:06,080
I use is a black rubber just tool, a kitchen tool. It's not funny. It doesn't have shit I like on it.

65
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,040
And mine has a photo of Danny DeVito's face with his mouth open that looks like he's biting the pan.

66
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,720
Yeah. And it has a little sound chip in it. So when you grab it, he goes,

67
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,800
ah, it's hot on my mouth. Someone pass me some limoncello to cool this off.

68
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,840
Exactly. Hey, what about gingham?

69
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,080
Huh? It's a classic, you know, nice gingham.

70
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,840
Gingham fits in so many different, uh, different kitchen styles. You don't know what kind of kitchen.

71
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,000
You know what it fits Justin? Yeah. What?

72
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,800
Gingham style.

73
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,440
Ope, ope, ope, ope, ope, ope. Gingham style.

74
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:51,120
Yeah. Sometimes it's like a contest to see how long we can go to just let the fart kind of settle.

75
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,080
To just get, because a lot of the times when there are three hosts on a podcast and one of

76
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,120
them just like really rips a beaver of a joke, the other two will immediately jump in to try

77
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,120
and distract or light a candle or try to wave it away or open a window or something. But sometimes

78
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,840
it seems like sometimes it seems, oh man, another one aftershocks. It seems like the two of us are

79
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,480
sometimes willing to marinate, just as an experiment against our listeners.

80
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,320
Well, against ourselves too. Cause there is pride. There's ego on the line.

81
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,640
Well, and money. And money, Justin. A lot of people forget about that.

82
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,480
Our family's living. Yeah, our family's living.

83
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,240
But we're willing to put it all on the line to marinate.

84
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,480
You guys get it? Cause it's like the, it's like Psy.

85
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,960
We fucking get it, Travis. It sounds like gingham.

86
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,360
It's not.

87
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,760
It's, it's, it's 2020. Psy is long dead.

88
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,960
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Graham Roebuck. Thank you, Graham.

89
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,120
It's Yahoo Answers user anonymous. I'm going to call them, uh, Chevy asks,

90
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,560
my upstairs neighbor pretends not to be the one playing the trombone at night. What do I do?

91
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,560
About once a week for two months now, someone has been playing a trombone in our building.

92
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,560
It came from above and was very loud. So I suspected my direct upstairs neighbor.

93
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,000
I rang his bell once in the beginning and he came to my door all quote sleepy and quote upset.

94
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,920
Telling me it wasn't him. And why now I was also not letting him sleep. I felt so sorry,

95
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,440
but now I saw him playing it in the reflection of the window across the street.

96
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,520
He's a stone cold liar. What could I do?

97
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:24,800
Huh? I, I was not anticipating that reveal of I've seen him doing it.

98
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:32,560
This is, there are probably bolder lies that you could tell in this life that we are all sort of

99
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,360
sharing together, but I can't think of a bigger one. I can't think of a bigger lie than

100
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:50,240
are you playing trombone? No, I was actually asleep. See, my ears are,

101
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,400
have a lot of waxy buildup in a way that negates trombone sound waves.

102
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,800
Now here's the thing though. Here's I will. Oh, here's the thing though, Griffin.

103
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,080
Yeah. Maybe, just maybe.

104
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,720
Maybe. It's unrelated. Maybe he was playing it during the day

105
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,120
because he has a trombone that he plays during the day.

106
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,200
Oh, I see. And there's more than one trombone on earth.

107
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,920
And if we can all acknowledge that universal truth.

108
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,800
I've seen more than one. I've seen more than one in the room at the same time.

109
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Thank you. I played trombone in band and there were at least two other kids in middle school

110
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,480
who played it too. So there are three trombones on this earth.

111
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,760
Now, if you get them together and play at the same time, God.

112
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,320
The walls of Jericho will come tumbling down.

113
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:43,200
That is why each of me and Chris and I believe Hunter, we all learned one third of the song

114
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,840
and would just trade off who was playing at any given time.

115
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,160
Not because we were lazy, but to protect the universe itself.

116
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,720
So I'm saying maybe Upstairs Neighbor plays during the daytime for fun.

117
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,480
And knowing this, somebody is trying to frame him by playing at night.

118
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,720
I see. So you're saying that the neighbor could bring out their trombone to show you that it is solar powered.

119
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,040
So the idea of him being- Oh, it's too cold.

120
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,680
It's too cold for me to play it. I need the heat of the sun upon the brass in order to produce sound with it.

121
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,680
This is super bone and he can only play with the power of the earth's yellow sun.

122
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,520
This is Boktai, the trombone.

123
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,120
Jesus, that's a deep one.

124
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:37,360
This is so- I feel like you have a sort of unofficial warrant to conduct a sort of citizen's arrest investigation.

125
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,800
A citizen's breaking and entering warrant. Is that anything?

126
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,640
A citizen's arrest, because it's music.

127
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,160
Arrest.

128
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,120
I thought we did talk about this once already.

129
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,440
You know what, even as I was saying it- You knew it was bad when you were saying it.

130
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,640
Maybe he's not lying and maybe he was sleep tromboning.

131
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Interesting.

132
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,600
Yeah, he's been practicing for the big concert, I guess, coming up.

133
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,840
The big solo trombone concert.

134
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,000
He's got that big trombone solo in the middle of that Squirrel Nut Zippers song.

135
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,960
And maybe he plays with the Squirrel Nut Zippers or the Brian Setzer Orchestra.

136
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,480
I assume they're still going.

137
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,600
One of those two.

138
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,960
And he's had it in his head now for a while.

139
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,240
And now when he sleeps, it's all I can think about.

140
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,600
And he rises still asleep from his bed, blasts out that solo.

141
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,240
And then you knocked on his door and he was like, why is this guy waking me up?

142
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,880
I mean, it doesn't even have to be him dream tromboning.

143
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,200
In his dream, he could be blowing on a big foot long hot dog to cool it off.

144
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,400
Oh, that's true, yeah.

145
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,880
Or something else of a sexual nature.

146
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,000
It could be one of those things.

147
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,480
And you don't even know that that's what you're actually playing a trombone in real life.

148
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,760
Now, I will say as someone who admittedly barely played the trombone for about two years

149
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,080
in middle school, if you're doing something of a sexual nature at all with the same method

150
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,520
you play a trombone, something has gone horribly wrong.

151
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,200
Not great.

152
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,040
None of those movements match.

153
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,360
Yeah, especially the arm movement.

154
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,400
That's bad.

155
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,680
Arm movement's not good.

156
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,680
The necessitation of an embouchure?

157
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,000
Yep.

158
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,280
Also, it's not necessary, not great.

159
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,280
In any separate piece, the arm movement, the blowing, the embouchure, any of those individually,

160
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,680
I could see that working and somebody enjoying it.

161
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,240
All three at the same time?

162
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,640
The only person who's going to enjoy that is somebody who is just tromboned from the

163
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,240
waist down.

164
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,200
Go ahead, Griff.

165
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,520
Just their bottom half got blowed up in an accident.

166
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,400
And now it's trombone.

167
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,360
Now it's a trombone down there.

168
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,080
Go ahead, Justin.

169
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,960
Now, Justin, go ahead.

170
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,640
Once you crack into the spit valve, now you're really cooking.

171
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,720
Yeah, but it's really hard to do the spit valve while you're playing, Justin.

172
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,280
That's why there shouldn't be music in schools.

173
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,440
Because you cannot give eighth graders a big metal tube armed with a single button

174
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,880
that when you press it, it will dump a not insignificant amount of spit in your reaction.

175
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,480
It's just a sort of musical teen blowhole, if you will.

176
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,200
Yeah, this is a valve on brass instruments.

177
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,480
If you don't know, it's a real thing.

178
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,800
You press it and all the spit falls out.

179
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,080
You cannot give this technology to eighth graders.

180
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,880
You cannot.

181
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
It makes school hell for me.

182
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,400
It's also a rare, complicated machine that still exists and has not been improved upon,

183
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,920
in which you might say, oh, the problem with it is it's too full of spit.

184
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,120
The only other thing that exists in is dentistry.

185
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,620
Yeah.

186
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,920
How about another question?

187
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,840
My wife and I recently celebrated our anniversary, which was lovely,

188
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,320
except for one thing that I need a judgment call on.

189
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,720
I wish, can I say, we used to tell people like, this is just an anecdote.

190
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,760
You don't need any advice.

191
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:09,040
As we get older and I feel less qualified to advise people,

192
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,840
I wish we had more questions that were just like, judge this.

193
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,340
Yeah.

194
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:20,240
I feel like I'm more qualified now as a 40-year-old man to be judgmental than I am to be nurturing.

195
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,740
Oh, yeah.

196
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,840
I need a judgment call.

197
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,040
Somehow in the planning of our celebration, it became clear to me

198
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,720
that my wife remembered the wrong date for our anniversary.

199
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,080
I was going to point this out, but then I remembered that this year our real actual date

200
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,200
was taking place on top of something that I wanted to take part in virtually.

201
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:48,320
So I just kind of rolled with the wrong date and we celebrated early.

202
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,000
No harm, no foul, right?

203
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,160
Well, now the day is here and we're getting cards and congratulations from relatives

204
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,520
who have annoyingly accurate calendar reminders and I'm not really sure what to do.

205
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,520
Do I fess up?

206
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,800
Do I play goalie and block the cards for the day?

207
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,640
Do I feign getting the day wrong myself?

208
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,640
Do we laugh at our relatives for getting the day wrong, et cetera?

209
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,040
Bit of a pickle, this one.

210
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,880
That's from no way I'm putting my name on this.

211
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:27,280
Just generally speaking as a rule, I feel like your wife remembered the wrong date

212
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,640
for your anniversary, that's a whoopsie.

213
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,400
That's a mistake, right?

214
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,840
And then you kind of just rolling with it because you wanted to take part in this virtual event.

215
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,200
You wanted to do a wow raid.

216
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,720
You needed to do a wow raid for the big drops.

217
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,440
You got Shadowlands coming up soon, you got to get fucking best in slot, baby.

218
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,880
But then the problem is that you both had one whoopsie at that point.

219
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,000
It was an even distribution of whoopsies and uh-ohs.

220
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,280
But then you, it seems like there was a slippery slope where it's like,

221
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,760
oh, we're starting to get cards, I need to do a whoopsie on these cards

222
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,720
and throw them in the trash.

223
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,080
And then I need to change all our G-cals.

224
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,800
And then I need to make fun of my parents for getting it wrong.

225
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,480
It's a sort of continuation of the whoopsies that makes it think like,

226
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,320
hey, you're probably doing the baddest, wrongest thing here.

227
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,120
A little bit, maybe, a little, don't you think?

228
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,760
You should just come clean because it will, here's the thing.

229
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,240
As Griffin has pointed out, I think the whoopsies are balanced.

230
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,080
They got, they were, correct.

231
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,920
They got the date wrong.

232
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,640
And you said, oh, that works for me, scheduling wise.

233
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,480
And you went with it, right?

234
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,640
And so now let me be honest, what you should have done is said,

235
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,160
no, darling, our anniversary is actually two days after that.

236
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,920
And let's do something almost all day.

237
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,960
And I will take one hour for this raid that I need to do.

238
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,440
That's bad, that sucks actually.

239
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,880
No, no, no, it's bad.

240
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,360
But you know that what they did was worse, right?

241
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,160
We all know that.

242
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,560
I kind of feel like if you're good, we all lie.

243
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,360
Everybody needs to lie to get through the day.

244
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,040
We all lie.

245
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,440
But I think before you do a lie, before you do a little Feborosky,

246
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,480
you need to, you should make it mandatory

247
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,920
that you need to visualize telling the other person about the lie.

248
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,000
That you need to be able to, if you're going to do the lie,

249
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,840
you need to mentally walk through the pain.

250
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,080
You have to have a plan for dismantling the lie.

251
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,760
There has to be a way to walk it back.

252
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,880
You have to have the pattern.

253
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,080
You're like a little Hansel and Gretel in the forest of deception.

254
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,680
You got to leave yourself a little breadcrumb trail

255
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,480
of how to get back to truth and honesty.

256
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,600
You had to have walked through in your head and said,

257
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,480
well, yeah, see, you got it wrong.

258
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,840
And then I didn't correct you

259
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,680
because I had to get that best in slot Fury Warrior DPS gear.

260
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,080
So that is what happened.

261
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,000
And there's the truth for you.

262
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,280
Okay, I feel terrible

263
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,840
because I think we're starting to border on like gaslighting.

264
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,600
Yeah, don't do that.

265
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,160
Clearly, don't do that.

266
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, but.

267
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,160
Unless.

268
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,800
No.

269
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

270
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,900
Trust.

271
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,880
Unless.

272
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,120
Could you somehow blame it on daylight?

273
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,160
Are you kidding me?

274
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,600
I set you up for a fucking unless

275
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,400
and you tried to swoop my unless with your own fucking unless?

276
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,360
Unless!

277
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,360
We got rules here, unless.

278
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,080
Unless.

279
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,440
You can say you didn't correct her

280
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,560
because you didn't want her to feel bad.

281
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,280
Justin, do you maybe, here, I'll set up the unless

282
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,360
and then Justin, do you maybe want to swoop the unless?

283
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,480
Because Travis just did it twice.

284
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,000
You technically could do two.

285
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,480
I don't.

286
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,440
I'll go see if Rachel wants to go swoop my unless.

287
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,080
Let me go grab her.

288
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,440
Maybe I'll go grab my son

289
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,600
because he would show about the same amount of decorum

290
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,840
that Travis just showed when he swooped my unless

291
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,520
two different times.

292
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,400
Unless.

293
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,480
She got the date wrong on purpose

294
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,320
because she was doing a wow raid.

295
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,640
She's Weed Man 420.

296
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,920
She is Weed Man 420, Brave Paladin.

297
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,040
Hero of the land.

298
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,480
If you like skipping anniversaries

299
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,960
to get your best in slot gear

300
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,400
if you want to get a new cloak

301
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,040
if you found your lover right here

302
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,640
and then in the wet raid, you're like, huh?

303
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,480
Vicky?

304
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,440
Come clean and apologize the shit out of it.

305
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,760
What are you apologizing the shit out of?

306
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,120
Vicky, first off, your AOEs were mistimed.

307
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,080
Whoa, a bold opener.

308
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,160
Your AOEs were mistimed.

309
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,360
Gotta get your dots in order

310
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,960
but also I love you so much.

311
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,520
I love you so much.

312
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,720
I'm so glad we could share this.

313
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,320
I always wondered what you did in your office

314
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,600
with the door locked and now I know.

315
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,120
It was play with me in World of Warcraft.

316
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,320
I'm gonna roll for need on your heart and your love.

317
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,880
I need it.

318
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,760
Give me your heart.

319
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,480
Give me a cyber kiss and come give me a flesh kiss

320
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,440
because we're just on opposite into the office right now.

321
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,840
We really need to pay better attention to things.

322
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,040
You know what?

323
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,280
Maybe this is where we learn to put down the,

324
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,480
oh wait, no, sorry.

325
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,320
I just started doing an incense.

326
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,040
Sorry, give me a second.

327
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,080
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

328
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,200
Just my timer went up.

329
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,160
Hey, Vicki, I'm LFG looking for a girlfriend.

330
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,520
They're married.

331
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,120
We're actually married.

332
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,840
You are what?

333
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,440
Vicki, come back.

334
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,640
Wait, come back, please.

335
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,440
I'm so sorry.

336
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,200
I did misspeak.

337
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,080
We are married.

338
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,720
That is true.

339
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,520
I'm sorry, Vicki.

340
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,760
I'm gonna turn off LFG.

341
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,640
I'm LFG looking for a good husband to be one to you.

342
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,960
Now would you like a mount?

343
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,520
But the dots really are shitty.

344
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,280
And Travis made a sexual joke,

345
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,080
and I didn't think that that was the right time for it.

346
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,640
Like if me and Rachel Piña Colada each other,

347
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,960
and we laughed it off like, ha ha ha ha.

348
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,360
And then I was like, but let's party.

349
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,560
Like I feel like that's,

350
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,640
I guess though that song is about,

351
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,040
let's, we're trying to cheat on each other,

352
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,120
but then we cheat on each other with each other.

353
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,360
Everything's okay.

354
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,040
Yeah, this is the thing that I've actually been thinking

355
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,320
about Piña Colada's song.

356
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,120
Yeah, go off.

357
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,920
Whatever the summer.

358
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,680
Go off, ping.

359
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,000
If you're a kid, a youngin,

360
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,400
it's about somebody who puts a personal ad in the newspaper

361
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,320
for the kind of lover they want to take

362
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,480
because they're bored of their current lover.

363
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,880
And then someone answers the ad,

364
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,040
and it turns out that it is their current lover

365
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,600
who apparently liked other things they thought

366
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,680
that their lover didn't like, but actually does.

367
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,440
And then they are like, well, I guess we're still together.

368
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,800
That's not, the next like couple months of that relationship

369
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,160
is not a happy story of,

370
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm so glad you told me you like champagne.

371
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,040
We're both deeply unhappy.

372
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,440
We're deeply and profoundly unhappy with each other

373
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,520
in lots of large and small ways.

374
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,720
And I don't feel like it's a happy ending necessarily.

375
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
But Justin, they found in each other

376
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,440
the unhappiness that clicked.

377
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,920
You know, it's like your unhappiness is like my unhappiness,

378
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,680
so might as well be unhappy together.

379
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,280
But it turns out we like all the same stuff

380
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,920
that I guess we're just not doing.

381
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,720
I wish there was one about kink.

382
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,200
That would be fucking great.

383
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,080
Wouldn't that be good?

384
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,240
I want a new version of that song

385
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,440
that's just about different kink

386
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,720
that you don't think your partner's into.

387
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,120
And then they answer it.

388
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,360
Do you like bondage and hentai?

389
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,800
There we go, exactly.

390
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,320
Do you like wiener-based pain?

391
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:35,760
If you like eating old shoes, I'm not sure that's a thing.

392
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:45,760
Let's head to the mic.

393
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,360
Hey, nerd, do you want to fucking build a website?

394
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,400
Yeah, you do.

395
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,360
Get out of here with your wimpy websites

396
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,880
and get a cool beer.

397
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,240
Beefy websites and get a cool beefy website from Squarespace.

398
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,480
What's a wimpy website look like, Chico?

399
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,440
I'm not done.

400
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:03,840
Okay.

401
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,640
Has the neighborhood bully been picking on your website?

402
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,000
Then you need to get beefy and kick the internet sand

403
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,440
right back in that bully's face.

404
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,240
You can get a beefy muscle website from Squarespace.

405
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,200
Squarespace is the fucking drill bit tailor

406
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,000
of website making app.

407
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,960
Hell yeah, my dude.

408
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,440
This website is swole

409
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,200
and it could showcase your work,

410
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
sell products and services of all kind,

411
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,240
promote your physical or online business and more.

412
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,480
And that more is beat up their bully

413
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,160
with beautiful customizable templates

414
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,920
created by world-class designers.

415
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,080
This website can kick any bully's ass.

416
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,440
Everything optimized for mobile right out of the box,

417
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,560
analytics that help you grow your muscles in real time,

418
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,400
free and secure hosting and nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

419
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,200
But your bully will need to patch up their wounds

420
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,440
so go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial.

421
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,880
And when you're ready to launch,

422
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
use the offer code my brother to save 10%

423
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,160
of your first purchase of a website or domain.

424
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,160
Squarespace, we'll kill your bully.

425
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,800
I don't think that they want,

426
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,080
they don't necessarily want that.

427
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,120
I don't think that's actually-

428
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,760
We'll kill you.

429
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,480
We've killed before and we'll do it again, motherfucker.

430
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,040
Oh, that's better.

431
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,960
Maybe it's something like we've killed bullies.

432
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,800
They're not necessarily saying like-

433
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,560
Squarespace, we've killed bullies.

434
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,400
Yeah, you can't prove it though.

435
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,760
Well, they did just-

436
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
Double jeopardy.

437
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,320
That's actually works here.

438
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,280
Audible's up next and they said specifically

439
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,840
not to say that they have killed before,

440
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,760
we'll kill again, whether or not it's a bully,

441
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,520
a bad guy, you know, the Joker, like whatever,

442
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,120
even like the baddest dude.

443
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,840
But what they do have-

444
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,280
You don't think Audible would kill the Joker?

445
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,920
Yeah, actually, you know what I said?

446
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,040
Actually, that should be a screening question

447
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,680
for advertisers.

448
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,160
Yeah.

449
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,920
Like if given the opportunity, would you kill it?

450
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,360
Would you finish the business that Batman is unwilling to?

451
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,600
And a lot of people would be like,

452
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,960
what version of the Joker?

453
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,440
And if you have to say that,

454
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,360
like if you have to couch it like that,

455
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,120
you've already lost our endorsement.

456
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,080
Because at a certain point, Batman's just not doing it

457
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,920
and the blood on the Joker's hands

458
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,760
is on Batman's hands too, right?

459
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,320
Oh, yes.

460
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,800
For ages now, yes.

461
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm not saying that I am for the death penalty,

462
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,600
except for the Joker.

463
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,880
Joker's the only one I want to kill.

464
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,360
Right?

465
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,120
Like really, really, really bad.

466
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,480
Even like the fucking Adam West,

467
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,840
like I'm a silly clown.

468
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,000
Fucking get him!

469
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,040
Get him!

470
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,560
That fool, right?

471
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,520
You know, if you take your eyes off him for three seconds,

472
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
he's killed 18 more people.

473
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,560
That's on you.

474
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,320
He's not coming back from this.

475
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,600
Even when he doesn't kill 18 people,

476
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,760
he's causing so much mischief in me.

477
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,160
Oh, yeah.

478
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,080
He's the clown prince of chaos.

479
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,040
You know what I mean?

480
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,360
He's like-

481
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,160
Talk about Audible.

482
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,800
Okay, right.

483
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,080
Yeah, they do audio books

484
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,800
and they're super, super good to listen to.

485
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,520
Now, when we're all a little bit cooped up,

486
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,040
they got a lot of spoken word entertainment,

487
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,400
they have Audible originals,

488
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,000
they have daily news digests,

489
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,360
and they have soothing audio experiences

490
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,640
to help you drift to sleep.

491
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,040
And anyone with children at home

492
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,120
can use stories.audible.com

493
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,720
where anyone anywhere can stream

494
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,760
hundreds of ad-free, hand-picked Audible titles

495
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,160
completely free, no strings attached.

496
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,920
It's a great way of hearing the kind of stories

497
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,800
or news that you want to hear

498
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,600
without being locked to a screen

499
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,840
because, God, we're all getting so much screen time,

500
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,680
maybe even a little bit too much.

501
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,120
Maybe a bit too much.

502
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
Maybe just even a little bit too much screen time.

503
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,720
So why don't you have ear time?

504
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,560
Why not have sounds time?

505
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,160
Why not have sounds time instead?

506
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,400

That's audible.com slash brother.

510
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,840
Okay, here's what I'm saying.

511
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,120
Batman knows people that kill people a lot, right?

512
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,680
So even if Batman is unwilling to do it,

513
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,320
he could facilitate it easier.

514
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,960
Where is his line, right?

515
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,600
Like his line in the sand of morality,

516
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,760
it seems pretty flexible up till a certain point.

517
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,720
And he's like, oh, I arbitrarily draw the line

518
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,480
at killing for some reason,

519
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,240
even though the joke, oh, fuck.

520
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,240
What if Bruce Wayne hired Deadshot to kill the Joker?

521
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,560
Right.

522
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,440
This is still part of the Audible ad copy.

523
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,880
I'm just saying.

524
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,960
We're really over-delivering on the value end of this ad.

525
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,320
This is a very long ad.

526
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,920
They've got stories for children,

527
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,080
and they also have a detailed plan

528
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,920
on how Batman could ethically kill,

529
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,040
terminate the Joker's life.

530
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,540
Thank you.

531
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,680
Sometimes inaction alone would have allowed it to happen.

532
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,960
Still part of a copy.

533
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,280
Right?

534
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,200
It's like Batman opted not only to not kill Joker,

535
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,600
but to not allow Joker to die.

536
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,720
A lot of hand wringing here.

537
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,280
His unwillingness to kill the Joker,

538
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,680
I think at this point, it's hard.

539
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,120
It's becoming, I'm not a fan of capital punishment.

540
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,400
I'm not, obviously.

541
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,160
Let me just say that upfront.

542
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,520
That said, Batman's unwillingness to kill the,

543
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,240
maybe inability, honestly, at this point.

544
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,840
His unwillingness to kill the Joker,

545
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,000
it's like a trolley problem,

546
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,600
but on one end, there's a bajillion people,

547
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,000
and on the other end, there's a jail cell

548
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,320
that is open in both the front and the back,

549
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,120
and a million other people beyond that.

550
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,640
So that's basically what you're,

551
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,280
you're either letting them plow into a bunch of people,

552
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,960
or cruise through a jail cell,

553
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,880
and then go kill some other people.

554
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,640
And the track is lined with people.

555
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,080
Oh.

556
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
Is someone gonna answer that?

557
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
Oh, hello?

558
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,140
Hello?

559
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,760
Hey, boys, it's me, Bob Kerrigan,

560
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,000
CEO of Audible, and I just wanted to say,

561
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,880
you guys did a bang-up job with that ad spot.

562
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,360
You said all the things that we needed you to say

563
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,160
about the stories and the great audiobooks

564
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,400
that people could have delivered to them,

565
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,520
and you said the stuff about Ears Time,

566
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,560
and I loved that,

567
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,640
but then, where you really landed the plane,

568
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,760
I gotta tell you, boys,

569
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,840
was how you let everybody know

570
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,280
how Batman could ethically kill the Joker

571
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,200
and end his life and his reign of crime.

572
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,400
And that's important to me,

573
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,560
Bob Kerrigan, CEO of Audible.

574
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
Hey, Bob, Bob, can I ask you a question?

575
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,440
Yeah, please go ahead.

576
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,800
Why do you think at this point,

577
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,840
Batman hasn't just cut off one of Joker's legs?

578
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,120
Well, Travis, you'll see that

579
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,880
if you continue reading the ad copy.

580
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,840
I do have a sort of a second branch of ideas here

581
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,720
of just sort of-

582
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,400
Oh, it does say, it says right here,

583
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,160
why not chop him right in half?

584
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,640
Love, Bob.

585
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,920
Chop him in half, and then, yeah,

586
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,840
and then let him waste away on the dirty ground.

587
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,080
Yeah.

588
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,960
Just a macro here?

589
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,840
Go right ahead.

590
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,200
Don't you think at the end of every Joker story in Batman,

591
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,720
there should be a prolonged sequence

592
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,080
where Batman is investigating Arkham Asylum to see-

593
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,200
Why they're so bad.

594
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,440
Yeah.

595
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,120
Just some of the different-

596
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,680
Why the whole jail is made of Swiss cheese, apparently.

597
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,160
Yeah.

598
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,080
Yeah, you can see I have a lot, actually,

599
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,280
in this sort of book of an email I sent to you, boys,

600
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,120
with all the ad copy points.

601
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,480
And then if you keep reading,

602
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,360
it reveals our big plans in 2021 to have-

603
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,440
I'm having to delete some stuff to make room for this.

604
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,480
Oh, no, I like this.

605
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,200
You put-

606
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,560
There's an additional PDF here that just says Bob Thoughts.

607
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,280
Bob Thoughts, yeah.

608
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,080
And so if you read that,

609
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,400
there's some good stuff in there like yelling books.

610
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,880
And it's like audio books where we scream them

611
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,320
as loud as we can at you.

612
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,080
The one I really like here, though, in Bob Thoughts,

613
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,120
is you've put,

614
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,560
why not put him in a permanent coma, question mark?

615
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,520
Well, I actually misspelled the word cone.

616
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,360
Oh, put the joke in a cone like a dog cone?

617
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,880
Like a big dog cone, yeah.

618
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,600
And then I feel like that would really hamper his ability to do-

619
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,240
It really would.

620
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,120
I believe it really makes him less scary.

621
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,320
God, I hate the Joker.

622
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,120
I really do.

623
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,080
Yeah, we all do.

624
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,360
I really hate that man.

625
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,360
I can remember as a child thinking it was odd

626
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,080
that here was this can full of meat.

627
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,280
I'm Jesse Thorne.

628
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,280
This week on my show Bullseye,

629
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,920
David Letterman on shame, regret, and canned hams.

630
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,640
Is this the best delivery version of pork?

631
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,720
That's this week on Bullseye for MaximumFun.org and NPR.

632
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,600
Oh, yes.

633
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,680
I started doing it before I'm even sure if I want to do this.

634
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,180
Cool.

635
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,840
I want a munch.

636
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,240
Squash.

637
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,120
Munchquad Jr.

638
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,280
I have a brief, I have two brief notes.

639
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,480
This is just two brief notes.

640
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,880
The first is that Krispy Kreme has introduced a new caramel glaze.

641
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,360
This is such a Munchquad Jr.

642
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,640
I'm not even going to bring Count Donut out

643
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,520
for their Count Party Bagel if you prefer out for this one.

644
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,640
I just want to read you the first line of this.

645
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,920
I miss him so much.

646
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,420
I know.

647
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,760
Ask the world of donuts to do better.

648
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,720
Krispy Kreme introduces new caramel glaze.

649
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:49,840
Cool.

650
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,400
Wait, sorry.

651
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,520
Was the first line ask the world's donuts to do better or is that?

652
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:55,840
No, no, no.

653
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,480
Oh, okay.

654
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,840
That was being editorialized.

655
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,960
I thought that's what they were leading off their press release with.

656
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,280
Krispy Kreme introduces new caramel glaze.

657
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:03,600
Okay.

658
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,100
Yeah.

659
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,520
Krispy Kreme is helping fans melt away from 2020

660
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,320
and into a delicious and creamy world

661
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,880
by introducing an all new glaze flavor, caramel.

662
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,920
Hey, are you?

663
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,480
Are you guys doing okay in marketing?

664
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,320
Are things going all right for you?

665
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,240
I mean, I know they've been bad for us here in the real world for a while,

666
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,120
but I can't read fucking Munch Squads anymore without them being like,

667
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,720
everyone sounds like fucking Lobo waking up from a three-day drunk.

668
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,760
It's miserable.

669
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,240
Everyone is so miserable.

670
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,560
God, this year fucking dookie, right?

671
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,160
Anyway, we got some new caramel party bagels for you.

672
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,200
Is that anything?

673
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,480
Are you happy?

674
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,840
It's very evocative though because they've handled it in a different way,

675
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,720
which is like melt away into a different world.

676
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,520
They make it sound like if you can somehow climb through the whole of the donut

677
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,000
without breaking the bread completely,

678
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,800
it'll take you to fucking donut Narnia.

679
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,000
Well, here's what they don't tell you.

680
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,120
Take a bite of this party bagel and that caramel glaze.

681
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,600
It flows right into your brain ducts

682
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,080
and it's going to take you into a kind of a virtual world.

683
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,600
Your body will still exist here on this plane.

684
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,320
But your brain is often to kind of a creamy matrix like scenario.

685
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,000
It's sort of donut zone.

686
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,480
Yeah, that's what, oh, you've read my thesis.

687
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,320
That's what we actually call it, the donut zone.

688
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,080
And once you're in the donut zone, Gervin,

689
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,800
it all kinds of melts away into a creamy world of pleasure.

690
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,200
I wanted to mention the Mountain Dew Cookbook,

691
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,360
which feels like Munch Squad bait to an extent

692
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,280
that I'm not going to luxuriate in it.

693
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,880
They're paying tribute to the world's greatest fans

694
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,520
with the release of its first ever cookbook.

695
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,840
Just in time for the brand's 80th birthday.

696
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,240
With nearly 40 dishes to satisfy every craving,

697
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,960
provided presumably that that craving involves

698
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,600
consuming Mountain Dew,

699
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,160
the Big Bold Book of Mountain Dew recipes

700
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,640
is a compilation of fan-made, fan-inspired,

701
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,280
and fan-favorited creations from some of the most imaginative

702
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,040
culinary minds on the planet.

703
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,720
Ranging from the quick and easy two-ingredient cupcake treats

704
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,960
to the advanced- Wait, really?

705
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,720
What could you possibly add to Mountain Dew

706
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
to make cupcakes come out of them?

707
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,880
Is it like flour and dew?

708
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,280
No, it would be cake mix,

709
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,960
because you can do 12 ounces of soda plus any box cake mix

710
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,960
and make a cake, like a 7-Up cake.

711
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,040
How complicated does it go, Justin?

712
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,840
Well, there's an advanced code red brisket

713
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,480
that will entice any BBQ pit master.

714
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,800
I wanna say this, if the code red brisket is advanced,

715
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,120
that means there is a possibility

716
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,080
for a failed code red brisket

717
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,440
that I don't think it should be legal to consume.

718
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,280
I don't think it's fair to say like,

719
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,600
I'm not sure you did this right.

720
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,280
It's a very advanced recipe.

721
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,280
This is a bad version of the Mountain Dew code red brisket.

722
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,640
The real problem is, is if you enter a catastrophic failed state

723
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,400
on the code red brisket,

724
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
there's no way of letting anyone know

725
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,640
in a clearly communicable way.

726
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,600
Same if you succeed wildly.

727
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,120
There's a code red brisket, fucking call the fire department.

728
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,640
No, that's a good thing.

729
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,600
It's got bold flavors.

730
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,960
Look at this crust.

731
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,640
I love that the cookbook had to specify

732
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,800
this as the big, bold Mountain Dew cookbook,

733
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,960
the sequel to the big, tasteful, reserved,

734
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,440
restrained Mountain Dew cookbook.

735
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,800
This ain't your grandma's Mountain Dew cookbook.

736
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,320
It's got six chapters.

737
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,920
I'm gonna give a quick rundown.

738
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,600
Badass breakfast, except the S's and the S are dollar signs.

739
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,640
Even better.

740
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,120
Cowards.

741
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,720
Dew lovers can whip up fluffy green short stacks

742
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,640
and iconic green eggs and ham

743
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,920
that are worth getting out of bed with.

744
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,420
Ew!

745
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,480
What do I get out of bed for?

746
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,880
Fucking green eggs and ham made with Mountain Dew.

747
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,400
Yeah, my life's not going so good.

748
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,960
It's a fair criticism.

749
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,520
Thank you, dad.

750
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,960
Dippin' with Dew.

751
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,640
I actually don't think it's legal to consume Mountain Dew

752
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,360
unless you're dippin'.

753
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,520
As somebody who used to clean up movie theaters

754
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,680
after movie showings in Huntington, West Virginia,

755
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,360
I can pretty much confirm those two are not strange bedfellows.

756
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,840
Dew does dinner?

757
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,960
Seriously, epic entrees like Mountain Dew code red brisket

758
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,920
and Mountain Dew live wire brined turkey.

759
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,120
Oh, boy.

760
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,240
Wow, yeah.

761
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,200
Oh, boy.

762
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,240
Calling for seconds.

763
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,880
These are not cheap cuts of meat you're ruining here, Mountain Dew.

764
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,320
I'll have you calling for seconds

765
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,720
and probably calling your ex-spouse to ask her,

766
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,640
will we're wrong and will she take you back?

767
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,400
And when you can see the kids again,

768
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,720
I'm learning to cook, Debbie, don't you see?

769
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,480
I'm trying, goddammit.

770
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,760
It's satisfying sides with snacks like jalapeno poppers

771
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,000
and Mountain Dew infused pickles.

772
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,120
Now you'll never have to choose between your go-to party sides

773
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,520
and a count of Mountain Dew ever again.

774
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,240
I wasn't.

775
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,360
What world do you think I was in

776
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,880
in which I had to decide between either a jalapeno bubber

777
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,400
or a drink of Mountain Dew?

778
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
What is this scenario you presented?

779
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,000
You're counting your calories, but it's Super Bowl Day.

780
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,680
You're right.

781
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,320
Right.

782
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,120
This is, it says that this will be out the week of November 16th,

783
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,480
which is where we are now.

784
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,640
In time, yes.

785
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,920
It is not available on the store currently.

786
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,200
So another lie from a QSR press release.

787
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,080
It's a classic QSR calling their bluff.

788
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,680
Like, okay, I'll engage with this.

789
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,520
Oh, no, no, no, you weren't supposed to come in here.

790
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,040
No, no, no, it's not real.

791
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,680
It's just a thing.

792
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,920
Tony Luck didn't really make a burrito.

793
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,960
I want to share this t-shirt that I found with you guys.

794
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,280
And Griff, if you would mind describing the image

795
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,200
that you've just been sent, I would love that.

796
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,680
Sure, yes.

797
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,960
What do you think I will claim?

798
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,000
It's on Slack.

799
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,320
So this is actually something that I'm going to buy immediately

800
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,280
and wear it until the pits fall out.

801
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,920
I'm buying it right now.

802
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,920
This is a white and sort of-

803
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,640
Hey, can you go and get me one of those in a large, please?

804
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,000
Yeah, go ahead and grab a large for this guy, too.

805
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,120
I'm not going to also ship it to you.

806
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,920
It's a fair point.

807
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,680
No, Christmas is coming up.

808
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,720
Oh, Christmas is coming.

809
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,600
That's a good point.

810
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,600
So this is a white and sort of-

811
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,840
What did you say, medium, Trav?

812
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,640
Large, please.

813
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,400
Large, large here, too, yeah.

814
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:44,720
Okay.

815
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,280
This is sort of a neon green and white tie-dye design.

816
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,400
They don't have them in kid's size.

817
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,880
With big, bold, black text on it.

818
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,280
All uppercase letters that reads-

819
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,040
Is that going to feel left out?

820
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,600
No, it's fine.

821
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:57,680
No.

822
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,800
He will if we all wear them at the same time,

823
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,160
which I assume we will.

824
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,800
Oh, yeah.

825
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,520
It says in big, bold-

826
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,880
For photos and stuff.

827
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,480
Big, bold marquee letters.

828
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,280
Make MTN Mountain Dew.

829
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,240
Make Mountain Dew Baja Blast available in stores all the time.

830
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,720
They have it-

831
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,800
I'm going to pass out.

832
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,440
They have the Mountain Dew logo right on the sleeve, too,

833
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,640
to let people know that this is an officially licensed product.

834
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,280
But that is strong.

835
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,480
It is Mountain Dew lobbying Mountain Dew

836
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,520
to make their product available.

837
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,160
Their Mountain Dew Baja Blast available in stores all the time.

838
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,480
The call is coming from inside the house.

839
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:44,800
Right.

840
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,680
Or inside the mountain.

841
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,200
This is like when Roswell fan sent in hot sauce to save Roswell,

842
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,640
but it's like if Roswell sent hot sauce out to people

843
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,840
to send right back to them

844
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,000
to prove that they really wanted to keep watching Roswell.

845
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
And made the fans pay for the hot sauce.

846
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,840
And made the fans pay for $35 for the hot sauce.

847
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,920
That's a lot for a t-shirt Baja Blast.

848
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,280
Are you sure?

849
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:09,600
Okay.

850
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,360
You know something?

851
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,440
I haven't drank Mountain Dew,

852
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,920
let alone Mountain Dew Baja Blast in many moons.

853
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,720
But if I was at the store and saw Mountain Dew Baja Blast

854
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,280
on the store shelves, I would take a little journey.

855
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,160
I would take a little trip back into my own psyche

856
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,320
just to see where I go.

857
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,040
I would just like to say if Mountain Dew,

858
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,280
I don't know if you have Rainer, what you're connected to,

859
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,160
but if you want to release a series of these that's like,

860
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,200
and also JASTA, and maybe some Surge in there,

861
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,840
like bring back Orbitz, like sure.

862
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,080
I don't know that they own all those, but.

863
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,120
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

864
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,480
Sure, I'd love that.

865
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,440
This one was sent in by The Wizard, Ben Cant, who's superlative.

866
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,400
I omitted last week, shamefully.

867
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,920
Thank you, The Wizard, Ben Cant.

868
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,480
It's from Yahoo Answers user, they are anonymous,

869
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,600
so I'm gonna call them.

870
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,400
Jason asks,

871
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,200
what are some ways to force hotel guests

872
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,800
to go to a free breakfast?

873
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,920
I'm assuming this is,

874
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,040
I don't think that like a La Quinta

875
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,280
is particularly concerned about whether or not

876
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,400
every single guest shows up

877
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,680
to the mandatory free continental breakfast.

878
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,920
I assume this is a sort of mom and pop operation,

879
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,520
mom and pop up,

880
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,760
and they really need to get some of these

881
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,640
old biscuits out of here.

882
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,440
And let's take a current pandemic scenario off the table,

883
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,000
because I think that that presents far too many hurdles.

884
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,400
Yeah, like the one big one

885
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,480
where they could go and then die from it.

886
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,080
Right, exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah.

887
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,880
So let's say that this is in the before or after times.

888
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,200
The problem is I forget what the first one is,

889
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,080
and I can't even visualize and imagine the second one.

890
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,960
I know, we've been wandering in the desert for a while now.

891
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,680
It's all desert, like it's all desert to me now.

892
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,680
All I can, all I remember is sand.

893
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,600
We used to have like laser dogs that could like bring you,

894
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,560
I think I remember like laser dogs.

895
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,320
I don't even remember that.

896
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,640
Like laser dogs that would bring you an orange.

897
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,120
I think that sounds right,

898
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,480
but if you didn't want to force hotel guests

899
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,280
to have free breakfast,

900
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,200
anytime you walk by like a well-ventilated restaurant

901
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,480
making smoky foods,

902
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,360
it makes you want to go in there and just like,

903
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,160
see what's up.

904
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,680
I'm not like the biggest barbecue fan,

905
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,120
but if I walk by a barbecue joint

906
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,840
that's venting their barbecue, their meat stink,

907
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,920
out into the universe for everyone to enjoy,

908
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,320
I kind of want to poke my head in there and be like,

909
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,520
oh, what you guys got going on?

910
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,280
And they're like super spicy sausage links.

911
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,960
And I'm like, I'll be going then.

912
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,080
I'm glad I found out though.

913
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,120
Is there any way to do this in an environment

914
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,320
where you do control the air conditioning system

915
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,600
and where it goes?

916
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,640
Well, what if-

917
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,280
You know this, right?

918
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,640
Yeah, Disney does do it.

919
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,240
It's called Smellitzers.

920
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,760
It's called what?

921
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,360
Smellitzers.

922
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,040
They blast out the, like we were on Main Street,

923
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,280
they blast out those candy and baked goods scents

924
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,120
to try to lure you into the shops

925
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,720
and to give you just a fond sense.

926
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,440
It's artificial.

927
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,640
They're just blasting, like,

928
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,320
nostalgia scents at you.

929
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,480
But then at nighttime,

930
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,400
when they want to get everybody out of the park,

931
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,800
they blast a bad smell, like Goofy's dick.

932
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,400
Why would you think Goofy's dick smells bad?

933
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,240
At the end of a hot day working at Disney World?

934
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:36,800
Yeah, that's fair.

935
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:37,840
That's fair.

936
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,640
The only thing you need

937
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,960
to get people into a continental breakfast

938
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,960
is one of those make-your-own waffle makers.

939
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,200
People go fucking crazy for that.

940
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,320
There is a line.

941
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,800
When I used to travel back in the before times,

942
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,080
if there was one of those babies,

943
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,960
no matter how long it took to make that goddamn waffle,

944
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,720
people would stand there and wait.

945
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,120
They loved pouring that tiny solo cup of batter

946
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,080
into that bad boy.

947
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,040
Oh, timer went off.

948
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,760
Time to flip it.

949
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,440
Oh, gotta use my little plastic fork

950
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,960
to flip that bad boy out of there.

951
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,560
People love that shit.

952
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,760
That is a wild...

953
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,400
I don't want to get fucking Seinfeld on it

954
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,280
because I'm less, like, it's not as wild to me

955
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,680
that there was a make-your-own waffle maker system

956
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,120
as much as it is wild to me that there was a batter gun

957
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,200
that you kind of just put a little cup under

958
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,480
and then let it milked it like a moocow did,

959
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,120
but pancake juice comes out.

960
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,480
It's a terrible system.

961
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,480
It's a terrible system.

962
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,560
Also, biscuits and gravy.

963
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,040
I'll do that any day of the week if I see anything,

964
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,320
even if I'm not hungry.

965
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,120
If there's biscuits and gravy available, I'll take it.

966
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,320
That's a real day-determiner right there.

967
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,720
Yeah, biscuits and gravy first thing in the day.

968
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,520
That's really setting a tone that you won't be shaking.

969
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,280
You're not getting out of there by 11 a.m.

970
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,120
At hotels, since you asked,

971
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,720
get that fucking, like, tureen of oatmeal out of there.

972
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,240
Nobody's touching that shit.

973
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,360
What is that?

974
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,800
Get that out of there.

975
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,600
And you know what?

976
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,280
I also don't want to see any plain Kellogg's Flakes.

977
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,640
Get that shit out of there.

978
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,920
Nobody wants that.

979
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,040
Sorry, what do you think?

980
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,880
What are, sorry, stop it.

981
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,400
What are plain Kellogg's Flakes?

982
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,760
Like, not the Frosted Flakes.

983
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,000
It's just like the Kellogg's Flake.

984
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:16,720
You know, it's just like Kellogg's.

985
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,760
Oh, this is great.

986
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,240
No, Travis, stop it.

987
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,200
Stop the podcast.

988
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,320
What are Kellogg's Flakes?

989
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,680
They're like, you know, just like the plain cereal flakes

990
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,000
without any, like, sugar on them.

991
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,800
No frosting.

992
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,040
And those are called, tell me one more time again?

993
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,640
I can't remember the exact name,

994
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,600
but you know what I'm talking about.

995
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,400
Kellogg's Flakes.

996
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,560
Are you doing a bit?

997
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,480
No, you know, with the green and red rooster on it.

998
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,800
What are the bee circles called?

999
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,440
The ones that the bee endorses

1000
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,280
and makes so sweet with his stick.

1001
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:48,800
And I think they're called-

1002
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,160
You know what I'm talking about.

1003
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,720
I think they're called bee circles or beos.

1004
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,120
Are they beos?

1005
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:55,440
Little beos?

1006
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,120
Cornflakes, Cornflakes.

1007
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,080
There it is.

1008
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,600
Oh, I got them.

1009
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,040
Oh, thanks, boys.

1010
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,560
We've talked a lot about the carrot.

1011
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,000
Let's talk about this.

1012
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,360
Let's talk about the stick.

1013
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,680
There's lots of ways to entice your guests

1014
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,800
to go to your free breakfast.

1015
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,760
That's not what the question is.

1016
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,640
The question is, how do I force hotel guests to go?

1017
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,840
You gotta get them out of their rooms.

1018
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,720
Yes, that is, yes.

1019
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,800
You vacuum seal that room, you shut off the air.

1020
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,960
6 a.m., they're out of there to go get some-

1021
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,280
You've sealed it though, so they are dead now.

1022
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:25,760
Damn it.

1023
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,040
They're definitely not gonna be.

1024
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,160
Justin, do you wanna try?

1025
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:36,480
Um, a trail of Cheerios that they'll eat the first few

1026
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,840
and be like, mm, pretty good.

1027
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,840
And then they'll be forced to use your logic.

1028
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,320
They'll be forced to continue by their hunger

1029
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,360
and their taste for Cheerios.

1030
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,520
They'll work on a three-year-old who has bad parents.

1031
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,320
Work on ET.

1032
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,160
Okay, listen, we got the key cards, right?

1033
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,680
That open all the doors, they wake up,

1034
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,920
there's someone with the breakfast right there.

1035
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,760
Key party.

1036
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,560
Oh, well, that's not at all what I said.

1037
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,320
Have you guys ever stayed at a residence inn

1038
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,000
where they advertise the key parties

1039
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,600
that they have every weeknight,

1040
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,360
like come and mingle with other young singles

1041
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,040
at the residence inn?

1042
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,400
Can we all agree that a key party with blank key cards

1043
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,520
with no discerning identification on them

1044
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,920
would be, I don't know, almost fun?

1045
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,320
We're gonna run around and see what door we can open now.

1046
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,840
It doesn't matter, because you'll get down there

1047
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,320
and you'll be anxiously eating breakfast,

1048
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,400
and then by the end, you'd be like, I don't even actually

1049
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,520
feel like doing it anymore.

1050
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,400
Yeah, I ate a lot of biscuits and gravy.

1051
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,120
I'm not.

1052
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,240
Have you guys ever noticed the experience,

1053
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,440
the phenomenon of if you go to a hotel breakfast

1054
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,880
where everything is like pre-packaged,

1055
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,000
you know what I mean?

1056
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,560
Where it's like all pre-wrapped, pre-packaged foods,

1057
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,080
like not prepared on site, all sort of pre-made.

1058
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,000
You'll see this a lot at like Holiday Inn Express.

1059
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,160
Does it just trigger your urge to steal?

1060
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:56,720
Oh yeah.

1061
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,080
I see that, I'm like, I'm gonna load every fucking pocket I got.

1062
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,920
I don't know what this day is gonna bring,

1063
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,720
but I am gonna have a yogurt at the ready for it

1064
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,360
whenever it comes.

1065
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,520
I'm always surprised that there's not someone standing by there

1066
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,840
when I'm just like, oh, I'm gonna get a plate and some coffee,

1067
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,720
take it back to my room, like you eat it here or you leave it.

1068
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,280
Yeah, that has monetary, if it's pre-packaged,

1069
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,440
this has a monetary value.

1070
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,920
There's a value to this, you know what I mean?

1071
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,200
If I bring a loose scoop of scoops of coffee,

1072
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,200
a scoop of scrambled eggs in my hand,

1073
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,480
no one's gonna pay me for that.

1074
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,680
But as soon as you contain those scrambled eggs in some way,

1075
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,440
it has value.

1076
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,720
Baggy or satchel.

1077
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,160
Sure, okay.

1078
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,000
So Nick, you're saying next time I go,

1079
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,240
I should bring a tote bag that I can just dump

1080
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,880
the batter blaster like right into,

1081
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,400
and then that's my batter now,

1082
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,440
and I can resell it on the street for dollars.

1083
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,640
It's not that, so much as like,

1084
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,800
they have like the little pre-packaged containers,

1085
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,520
Raisin Bran, you take one, that's perfectly fine.

1086
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,400
You take two, no one's gonna bat an eye.

1087
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,160
But there is definitely at the other end of the spectrum,

1088
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,920
if you just like supermark them,

1089
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,880
sweep them right into your backpack and walk away,

1090
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,720
they probably will detain you.

1091
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,360
So what is that?

1092
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,080
There is a number in the middle at which you are no longer-

1093
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,720
Welcome at this establishment.

1094
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,480
There is a part of me that acknowledges then that

1095
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,600
on some level, the people working the counter,

1096
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,880
no one answered to, how many yogurts can I take?

1097
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,800
They won't tell you, but you'll pass that point,

1098
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,440
and they'll be like, hey, you know that's too many.

1099
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,200
They've also gotta clean it up.

1100
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,200
So for every yogurt you don't take,

1101
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,240
that's another yogurt they have to lug back to the fridge.

1102
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:36,880
You know what I mean?

1103
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,120
So they'll probably let you take whatever the fuck you please.

1104
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,640
I'm just gonna keep taking yogurts.

1105
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,000
You tell me when to stop.

1106
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,120
You tell me.

1107
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,560
Give me a nod or a sign.

1108
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,440
Speaking of telling you when to stop, Travis,

1109
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,120
I'm gonna tell you to stop podcasting.

1110
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:49,440
Okay.

1111
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,040
Because we've reached the end of another episode

1112
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,320
of My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

1113
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,800
an advice show for the modern era.

1114
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,560
Thank you so much for joining us

1115
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,240
for another one of these dalliances.

1116
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,240
We hope you're doing well.

1117
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:00,960
Yes, that's right.

1118
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,600
A dalliance.

1119
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,680
Hey, I wanna tell everybody about a couple exciting things.

1120
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,120
One, this weekend, like five days from the 16th,

1121
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,480
which I assume is when you're listening to this,

1122
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,360
but who knows?

1123
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,280
9 p.m. Eastern time, we're doing a virtual

1124
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,720
My Brother, My Brother, and Me with-

1125
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,280
This Saturday.

1126
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,320
This Saturday with Sawbones opening 9 p.m. Eastern time.

1127
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,640
It's going to be, let's say, weird

1128
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,880
and probably very enjoyable.

1129
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,720
Tickets are only $10, and you can get them

1130
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,280
at live.themacroroid.family.

1131
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,200
Also, we have a lot of exciting merch,

1132
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,440
including a pin of the month that is a beautiful void fish,

1133
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,520
if I do say so myself, from the Adventure Zone.

1134
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,280
It benefits the Loveland Foundation,

1135
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,520
which is committed to showing up for communities of color

1136
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,000
in unique and powerful ways with a particular focus

1137
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,600
on black women and girls.

1138
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,480
There's also a Steven the Goldfish keychain by Kate May,

1139
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,400
a Vaccines Bumper sticker that benefits

1140
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,160
the Immunization Action Coalition,

1141
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,000
which works to increase immunization rates

1142
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,120
and prevent disease.

1143
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:51,600
There's still-

1144
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,160
Lots of other stuff.

1145
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,200
Yeah, lots of other stuff.

1146
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,240
Yeah, lots of stuff.

off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1158
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,880
And I wouldn't mind putting These Days to Bed.

1159
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,360
Oh, boy.

1160
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,120
To get back to bed and get back to better ones.

Yes.

1174
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,680
Several people sent in this final Yahoo Answers question

1175
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,320
that was asked 10 years ago.

1176
00:52:59,120 --> 00:52:59,440
Wow.

1177
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,680
User DonnyOnions asked,

1178
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:08,400
In what year did Bill Grates invent Microsoft?

1179
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:18,720

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,200
in a relaxing environment with two lovers.

1190
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,480
Wow.

1191
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,840
Well, this sounds like a sort of proposition of sorts,

1192
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,160
but really it's an ad for our podcast.

1193
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,120
Wonderful.

1194
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,040
It's a show we do here on Maximum Fun

1195
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,720

Things like sneezing or the idea of rain.

1201
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,720
Can you get news or information you can use?

1202
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,800
