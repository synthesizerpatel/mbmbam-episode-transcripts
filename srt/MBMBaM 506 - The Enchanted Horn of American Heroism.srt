1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:46,560
Well, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,760
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,040
I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,200
I am your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,640
Isn't it rich? There has to be a

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,960
certain separation. Don't you approve?

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,000
There's so many songs. There's a lot of songs.

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,080
Okay. Is this the only song you know?

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,760
It doesn't even apply. There's lots of songs, I know.

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,680
But that song doesn't even apply to this. Are we the clowns?

15
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,440
No, we've always been the clowns. It's the 10-year anniversary spectacular

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,400
that we are not putting extra effort into. Why?

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:40,000
Well, one, we did something different for our 500th episode and you need consistency right now.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,160
We can't just throw another really special episode on you out of nowhere.

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,000
The whiplash. Come on.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,400
Secondly, it's just a hard time right now, okay?

21
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,560
Get up our butts.

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,000
You know what? Thirdly, we're tired. 10 years of this.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,800
10 years.

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,480
Do the math, folks. This is episode 506. In 10 years, we have missed 14 episodes.

25
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,360
Not bad.

26
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,360
Not bad. Not a bad hit rate.

27
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,760
That's 1.4 episodes a year we've missed.

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,360
Hey, everyone, let's go on a trip back in time to 2010.

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,280
What were we all doing? Well, in theaters, we were watching The King's Speech.

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,080
Uh-huh. I thought I haven't seen it.

31
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,840
We were enjoying Winter's Bone as a nation.

32
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,160
No, I didn't read it.

33
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,720
It seems like a million years. Winter's Bone. Can you even remember?

34
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,400
Toy Story 3? It's like decoding ancient hieroglyphs, isn't it?

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,200
I'll never forget when Justin called us and said,

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,720
guys, I know how we can make a quick buck. We'll just start this podcasting thing.

37
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,960
The money is there. We can do whatever.

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,800
We'll just phone something in and get that sweet cache.

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,280
He said, we'll get that sweet cache for inflation, counting for inflation.

40
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,440
He knew, like in the context of this conversation,

41
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,240
he was like, counting for inflation, this is going to be a lot of money 10 years from now.

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,520
And also, I just got out of Winter's Bone in the theater,

43
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,120
and I drove home listening to Dynamite by Teo Cruz,

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,000
because it's 2010, and that's how we fucking do things this year.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,320
I did a double feature, King's Speech and Winter's Bone,

46
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,760
and now I'm ready for the yucks. So let's get that comedy money.

47
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,680
I want to keep talking about 2010 for a second, the different world we live in.

48
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,200
I just wanted to mention one of the big things that happened in 2010

49
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,440
is 33 Chilean miners were trapped in a mine a half mile underground

50
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,560
and then emerged safely from that mine after two months.

51
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,040
So that's 10 years since the Chilean miners thing.

52
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,200
And of course, the Xbox Kinect came out and changed gaming forever.

53
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,960
The Good Wife with Juliana Margulies.

54
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,880
How about that? How about them fucking apples?

55
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,920
And it's now anamorphed into The Good Fight on CBS All Access,

56
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,960
if you want to check that out.

57
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,160
Check that out, but what a difference 10 years makes.

58
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,480
The Good Wife with Juliana Margulies going into the second season in 2010,

59
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,160
three young boys with dreams in their eyes and their hearts

60
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,360
and sweat on their brow put together a podcasting empire.

61
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,040
10 years pass, now it's The Good Fight on CBS All Access.

62
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,280
Still a great show, not as much Juliana Margulies.

63
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,560
Too true. Couldn't hold on to Juliana.

64
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,240
So let's just do a regular show and not make a big deal out of it, okay?

65
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,240
It's been 10 years and I can't wait for 10 more.

66
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,920
Can I listen to CeeLo Green's Fuck You or Forget You?

67
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,440
Damn y'all, can I just, 2010, real quick,

68
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,400
Rollin' in the Deep by Adele, Runaway by Kanye West,

69
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,480
Just the Way You Are by Bruno Mars,

70
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,640
Super Bass by Nicki Minaj,

71
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,480
Dancing on My Own by Robin,

72
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,400
California Girls by Katy Perry,

73
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,120
Fucking Firework by Katy Perry.

74
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,320
Like, hello, one year? Are you sure?

75
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,240
Moves Like Jagger by Maroon 5?

76
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,440
Are you sure in one year you want to do all that?

77
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,760
Okay. Call Your Girlfriend by Robin.

78
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,040
Fine. That's cool.

79
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,540
Damn.

80
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,720
Hey, and let's just take a quick look over at the movies.

81
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,680
It's just Avatar.

82
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,560
That was the only movie in 2010.

83
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,280
Oh!

84
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,840
Yeah.

85
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,680
So was Winter's Bone with it, like, as you were watching Avatar,

86
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,040
it was like buried in it?

87
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,400
It was a spinoff.

88
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,200
Oh!

89
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,000
It was a spinoff.

90
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:36,800
Okay.

91
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,240
Hey, real though, though, can I just say though, real quick, though?

92
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,440
If I could just say real quick?

93
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,880
Yeah, give it to us real quick, juice.

94
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,160
I'm looking at that box office for 2010, right at 8, 9, 10,

95
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,640
you got Despicable Me, Shrek, Forever After,

96
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,760
How to Train Your Dragon.

97
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,880
Are you okay?

98
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,200
We're doing great.

99
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,560
Is everybody all right?

100
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,360
Holy shit.

101
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,820
Yeah.

102
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
Anyway, 2010 was a banger of a year.

103
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,520
Zolo, never forget it,

104
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,920
beats the shit out of our current sort of situation.

105
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,440
Yeah, so much better than our year.

106
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,200
Yeah, Tightrope by Janelle MonÃ¡e, come on.

107
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,400
Let's go back, take me back.

108
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,760
Earlier this week, I was doing some gardening with my sister.

109
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,680
It was hard to concentrate because two cats were boisterously making love beyond the hedge.

110
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,000
Our cat is, our yard is a cat hotspot,

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,560
so this is likely not the last time it will happen.

112
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,160
I want to spend more time in the garden,

113
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,760
but I'm afraid the ambiance will be broken by a couple of cats getting down.

114
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,840
What can I do about these feisty felines?

115
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,880
That's from Yard Dweller.

116
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
I hate doing animal questions.

117
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,080
You know what the problem is?

118
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't know fucking anything about animals,

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,560
but a lot of people on internet defo do.

120
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:40,960
Right.

121
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,200
And they definitely want to talk about.

122
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,840
I don't think we've ever answered an animal question

123
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,320
that like a SWAT team of 30 animal experts didn't fall through the skylight like,

124
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,560
no, wait, the horse, you can't do that.

125
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,040
His feet are actually made of nails or whatever.

126
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,800
Justin, you might not know from cats,

127
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,120
but I know you know about fucking.

128
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,960
Justin does know about, no, no, come on, dude.

129
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,240
That's why we all call you the fuck master.

130
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,800
So now you're infringing on blank checks, trademarks.

131
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,280
That's great.

132
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,200
Okay, the fuck doctor is here, Justin.

133
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,240
He doesn't know anything about cats.

134
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,360
Professor fuck.

135
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,600
Professor fuck is here and-

136
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,640
You don't need to know about cats.

137
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,720
You just need to know how to stop people.

138
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,920
But it could be linked.

139
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,760
Stop something from fucking.

140
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,200
Justin's point could still hold though,

141
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,880
because we could be like, well, just chase them off

142
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,000
so they don't have sex.

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,640
And then we will get like 50 tweets from people like,

144
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,960
no, cats have to have sex or they'll die.

145
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,000
And it's like, ah, man.

146
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,360
Eventually.

147
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
Eventually, I guess that's true.

148
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,920
Broadly speaking, as a species,

149
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
maybe we need to focus more on like,

150
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,720
what is making your yard conducive to cat fucking?

151
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, you've turned your yard into a sort of feline,

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,520
sort of Caligula den.

153
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,920
What if you, do you just leave saucers of milk?

154
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,720
And also, what makes cat horny?

155
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,200
Well, I mean, like I said,

156
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,600
I think that you could just universally describe things

157
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,680
that wouldn't make anything horny.

158
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,440
You know, like as you've always said,

159
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,560
saucer milk, comfortable sheets.

160
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,600
Cat's movie makes humans horny.

161
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,040
Yeah, so human movies.

162
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,440
You think a human movie.

163
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,720
Any movie about humans.

164
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,920
So just, I guess, do you have pornographic films

165
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,760
running in your yard on like little iPod Nanos?

166
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,760
That might be part of the problem.

167
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,520
Yeah, get rid of those.

168
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,600
Did you say sheets?

169
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,520
Comfortable sheets, yeah.

170
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,880
In your yard?

171
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,040
Well, I know this is just a bit,

172
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,480
well, I was just throwing noodles.

173
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,640
You're assuming that this person has maybe left

174
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
some comfortable sheets in their yard.

175
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,400
No, but maybe there's something replicating

176
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,200
comfortable sheets.

177
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,840
Maybe there's some really smooth ivy, right?

178
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,120
And they're like, oh, this is the cat equivalent of sheets.

179
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,320
I want a bone on this.

180
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,720
Right, you need to get rid of that ivy.

181
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,600
I like that Justin took umbrage with that

182
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,640
and not with my suggestion that you have iPod Nanos

183
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,440
showing pornography as if you've set in a bunch of different

184
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,360
sort of drive-in smut theaters for borrowers

185
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,920
and Honey, I Shrunk the Kid situations.

186
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,360
All right, counter-argument.

187
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,600
The iPod Nanos have to be somewhere.

188
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,800
We bought a lot of them.

189
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,680
Where are they now?

190
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,400
I don't have one.

191
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,120
You don't have one.

192
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,080
He doesn't have one.

193
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,840
So they're somewhere, right?

194
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,840
We kept eating them, didn't we?

195
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,400
As a dare.

196
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,900
Yep.

197
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,120
Just kept munching them.

198
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,200
You know, maybe it's just that your yard is a place

199
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,840
where cats feel comfortable having something.

200
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,360
Maybe it's not an arousal thing.

201
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,480
They're just like, you know what?

202
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,440
I feel like I can really be myself here

203
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,240
and really let go.

204
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,600
It's like the sandals for cats, you know?

205
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,160
They go, they feel comfortable there.

206
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,040
It's all inclusive.

207
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,000
And they're able to let their hair down

208
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,400
and really make love, really.

209
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,040
I mean, this is for fun sex for these cats, maybe.

210
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,960
Yeah, I mean, it could just be a snowball effect

211
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,920
where a couple of cats fucked in your yard once

212
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
and then other cats saw that and they were like,

213
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,920
oh, it's safe to fuck in that yard.

214
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,320
Yep.

215
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,840
So I think you do need to,

216
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,360
and this may be one of the more irresponsible suggestions

217
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,560
I've sort of put out there,

218
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,040
but get a lover and you both dress up like kitty cats

219
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,960
and go in your neighbor's yard and start boisterously plowing

220
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,240
but just be like, meow, this butt is the cat's pajamas

221
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,520
or say whatever it is.

222
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,200
They would just say our pajamas.

223
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
This is good as our, yeah.

224
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,800
This is the us meow.

225
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,120
But do it loud and make it seem appealing like,

226
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,080
oh, that yard must have better sexual energy in it

227
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,200
because I'd see two enormous bipedal cats

228
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,720
and so that's the party I want to be on.

229
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,000
Now, how do you do this without your neighbor seeing

230
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,960
or anyone else seeing or God seeing God in heaven

231
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,360
who sees all, you don't want him to see this one.

232
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,240
No, not this one.

233
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,640
I don't know, maybe a tarp.

234
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,840
That's great, Travis.

235
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,560
That's great.

236
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
Up on sticks, so you have room underneath it

237
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,480
so the cats can see from the side

238
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,560
but God looking down from the sky can't see around the tarp.

239
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,920
He's afraid of tarps.

240
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,320
I have a-

241
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,960
Can't see through them.

242
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,680
It's like his lead.

243
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,600
Hey, I have a Yahoo here.

244
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,160
Can I read it?

245
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,840
God can't see through tarps.

246
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,280
Can't see through tarps.

247
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,040
I'm sad you said that at the end

248
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
because if I wasn't bored of this question by now,

249
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,600
I think I would hang out there and play with that

250
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,520
but I'm done pretty good.

251
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,440
I'm pretty good done at this point.

252
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,120
This is a super cool Yahoo

253
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
that the prospector Merritt Palmer sent in.

254
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,440
Thank you.

255
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,120
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

256
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,680
I really wish somebody had stamped their name on this one.

257
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,200
So instead, I'm going to call it Susannanana.

258
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,440
Susannanana asks-

259
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,240
Susannanana.

260
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,960
If the founding fathers left-

261
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,840
If the founding fathers-

262
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,520
If the founding fathers left behind a magic horn

263
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,800
that could summon the legends-

264
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,360
If the founding fathers left behind a magic horn

265
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,760
that could summon the legends of American history,

266
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,680
would now be the time to blow it?

267
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,720
Man, that's such a hard decision to make, you know?

268
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,160
Because you only get to do it once.

269
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,680
Yeah, I mean, they specifically inscribed that on the magic horn

270
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,200
when they left it behind and buried it beneath the White House.

271
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,640
But it goes on.

272
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,920
If the founding fathers left behind a magic horn

273
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,800
that could be blown in a time of dire need to save America

274
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,000
but it would only work once-

275
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,120
Thank you, Travis.

276
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,040
Would now be the time to use it?

277
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,760
They would stay-

278
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,480
They would stay till the next new moon.

279
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,920
All right, let's break this down.

280
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,120
This continues on.

281
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,560
The founding fathers could come back

282
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,160
and solve the political problems.

283
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,720
Great inventors like Edison and Tesla and Curie

284
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,760
and Joe Salk, Jonas Salk and such

285
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,200
could find a vaccine and a cure for the coronavirus.

286
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,440
The inventors and scientists could work out something

287
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,720
for saving the environment.

288
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,920
It would be cool to see the great composers, musicians,

289
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,000
and singers again who would bring us great music

290
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,920
to inspire us through this crisis.

291
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,480
Andrew's sisters could be back a while,

292
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,240
just like they were in World War II.

293
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,920
John Henry and Paul Bunyan could build us

294
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,360
some new infrastructure.

295
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,320
What is happening?

296
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,280
Well, a blue magic horn brought back all American legends.

297
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,080
Let me finish.

298
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,720
Okay, no, wait.

299
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,360
I'm confused, although I do want to dispute.

300
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,960
Some of these are real human beings

301
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,400
that invented fucking vaccines

302
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,680
and some of them are Paul Bunyan.

303
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,400
This is a good horn.

304
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,640
I'm pretty sure-

305
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,920
Okay, Marie Curie, I'm kind of sure.

306
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,000
But Tesla, I know wasn't born here.

307
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,400
I would not call them American legends.

308
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,720
Maybe we know of them here.

309
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,920
But it's not like-

310
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,440
Can we claim Marie Curie?

311
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,320
Is that ours?

312
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,240
You gotta let me finish this.

313
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,200
There's one last part here

314
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,800
that is maybe the wildest one of all.

315
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,280
It would likely conjure the armies of the past

316
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,680
who could restore peace in the Middle East.

317
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,280
Oh, I don't think that that's what

318
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,040
they've been waiting on over there.

319
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,320
I don't think they've been waiting on

320
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,840
a bunch of old, tiny soldiers to show up

321
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,280
in old, heavy, woolen garb

322
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,800
with their muskets and what have you

323
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,360
and been like, oh, that was it.

324
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,720
That was the piece of the puzzle

325
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,640
that's been missing the whole time.

326
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,720
Final sentence, if there was such a magic horn

327
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,080
would now be the time to use it.

328
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,840
Well, okay, so I think a couple things

329
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,800
we can kind of maybe poke holes in a little bit.

330
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,960
Like, I think if Edison, Marie Curie,

331
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,040
Jonas Salk, Tesla, if they came back now,

332
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,400
I think they would have so much science to catch up on.

333
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,240
Like, I don't think that they would be able

334
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,640
to get to it by the next new moon, right?

335
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,920
Because they'd come back and be like,

336
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,520
whoa, let me see that iPhone.

337
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,440
And you're like, yeah, but let's work on coronavirus.

338
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,840
And they're like, give me a minute.

339
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,880
Is that a TV?

340
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,000
What the hell, right?

341
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,640
Like, I don't think coronavirus,

342
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,160
we're gonna get to that.

343
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,200
You know what I mean?

344
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,360
Well, they'd have to also jump through some hoops.

345
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,800
Edison has fallen, I would say, greatly out of favor.

346
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Yeah, he's gonna be doing so,

347
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,960
like his main first thing is gonna be

348
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,160
just rebuilding the brand.

349
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,040
Yeah, he has had it rough.

350
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,880
Here's where we go, fucking Tesla, Marie Curie.

351
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,840
They're like, what's up, what's up?

352
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,080
People are like, oh, fuck yeah, cool, come on in.

353
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,200
Edison's like, what's up?

354
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,400
Your man, Edison's here too.

355
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,760
Anybody need anything invented?

356
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,760
And they'll be like, yo, tell us about this elephant

357
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,920
that you shocked to death, partner.

358
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,760
And he'd have to be like, oh, fuck,

359
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,360
I think I can really whip this thing into,

360
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,160
no, you're right.

361
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,920
Okay, so listen, it was a different time.

362
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,040
You have gone from like world renowned inventor father

363
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,840
of like the electric light to literal Dr. Who villain

364
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,640
in a literal episode of Dr. Who, my man.

365
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,120
I know it's been rough since you kind of checked out

366
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,920
with the dying, but things have not gone well for you

367
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,880
in the interim.

368
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,840
You should have left a very sympathetic like memoir

369
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,880
or something.

370
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,800
And can you imagine when Paul Bunyan comes back

371
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,960
and you're like, let's get to work on this infrastructure.

372
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,440
How about some kind of universal wifi?

373
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,560
And he's like, what?

374
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,440
What are you talking about?

375
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,280
I can take a new Grand Canyon.

376
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,920
You're like, no, we need highways, we need restructure

377
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,400
bridges.

378
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,440
Oh, I don't do that.

379
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,600
In my mindscape, I have thought of a deeper hole

380
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,960
we can poo poo and pee in.

381
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
John Henry, we're gonna need you to do some kind

382
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,640
of light rail system.

383
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,000
No, I'm a steel driving man.

384
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't know anything about that.

385
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,360
You have 24 hours to learn all about electromagnets

386
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,120
or else we're gonna blow the fucking horn again.

387
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,720
Okay, oh no, you'll send me back to hell.

388
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,800
What?

389
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,840
All of them are in hell.

390
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,440
They're all in hell.

391
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,480
Okay, wow.

392
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,520
Even Jonas Salk created the polio vaccine.

393
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
That's a tough break, Jonas.

394
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,600
Sorry, hey, you gave it away for free and refused

395
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,160
to patent your vaccine, but you're in hell?

396
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,640
Yep, you don't know what other stuff he was into.

397
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,320
You know what?

398
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,520
That's a tough way to counterbalance that, Trav.

399
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,160
I mean, not my works are you saved.

400
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
I do get that, for sure.

401
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,360
All right, let's put this out there right now.

402
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,440
The next new moon is gonna come April 22nd.

403
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,880
So right now, sort of chronologically speaking,

404
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,640
is not the best time to blow this horn.

405
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,520
No, no, no, no.

406
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,160
April 23rd, we blow this horn, we get the maximum

407
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,480
amount of time with these American legends.

408
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,840
But here's the problem, Griffin.

409
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,800
What if-

410
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,760
There's a problem?

411
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,720
Yes, between now and the 22nd is when it's the exact

412
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,120
moment we most needed them, right?

413
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,200
So we might not, it might be quality over quantity, right?

414
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,520
Like we would only have 10 days with them,

415
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,400
but in that 10 days is when we needed them most.

416
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,240
Well, I would argue that we should have fucking

417
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,600
blown this horn on what, February or March 22nd?

418
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,080
Yeah, Griffin, yeah, duh.

419
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,960
But we just found the horn, didn't we?

420
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,320
We just found it.

421
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,400
We were repainting that one bathroom,

422
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,640
and we peeled off the wallpaper,

423
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,920
and there was a little door there,

424
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,520
and we just never looked.

425
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,000
I think-

426
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,880
We never looked.

427
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,560
What do you think the founding fathers,

428
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,120
like if John Adams came back now and like fixed

429
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,720
the American government, he'd be like,

430
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,960
ooh, I don't fucking know, man.

431
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,440
I don't know.

432
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,160
And it's like, oh, okay, and he's like,

433
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,840
so I got like what, 27 days left?

434
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,640
I'm just gonna go, well, I can't go outside, huh?

435
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,560
Because you guys fucked that up.

436
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,280
Ooh.

437
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,680
Sorry.

438
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,600
I'm pretty sure that like their shit aged pretty bad also.

439
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,440
Pretty sure by the time Bill Wright came out,

440
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,920
that most of them were like, oh, man,

441
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,280
we fucking beefed it pretty bad on that one, huh?

442
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,040
The whole foundational shit.

443
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,920
Ah, beans.

444
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,160
I don't think that's gotten better since, what?

445
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,960
Why didn't we put-

446
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,120
We should have put no scrubs into the Constitution.

447
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,160
Yeah, damn it.

448
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,200
Should have just written no scrubs.

449
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,800
Ben Franklin's like, I know, right?

450
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,760
That's what I said.

451
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,280
I said that.

452
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,880
And you said, but what about him?

453
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,600
He's a scrub.

454
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,720
And I said, no scrubs.

455
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,560
Do you have to play a song on the magic horn

456
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,080
or is it just, is it sort of like one of those long

457
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,840
Ricola horns that you just kind of like

458
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,440
emit a deep blow from?

459
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,280
And then do they come out of the horn?

460
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,560
Huh?

461
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,920
No, I think it just summons it.

462
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,760
You blow it, knock, knock, knock.

463
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,360
Hey, you needed us?

464
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,640
Like, it would be weird if they sprung fully formed.

465
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,320
How big is the horn though, I guess?

466
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,400
Because if the horn is like gigantic

467
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,960
and we found it like in, you know, I don't know,

468
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
a desert or something, that's pretty cool.

469
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
But if it's just like a handheld number,

470
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,280
I don't want to see human beings come out of it.

471
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,600
I bet fucking Alexander Hamilton

472
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,760
would be pretty psyched about everything though, huh?

473
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,920
Yeah, he'd probably enjoy it.

474
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,600
He'd probably come out with all this stuff.

475
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,520
He'd be like, how's the money stuff?

476
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,480
Not good, not good?

477
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,920
I'll do what I can, but hold on.

478
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,040
First, let me enjoy this moment.

479
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,720
I can actually, it would be a little,

480
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,600
that would be kind of, I think that would be difficult.

481
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,680
Cause it's like, they did a whole musical about me.

482
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,280
Yeah, how do people feel about it?

483
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,560
They fucking love it.

484
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,840
Oh yeah, can I go see it?

485
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,440
You cannot, nope, that I cannot.

486
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,800
I am so sorry about this, but you cannot do that.

487
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,280
I can't.

488
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,320
Well, soon, right though, before the next new moon, right?

489
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,120
Ooh.

490
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,520
This is challenging.

491
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,600
I can't wait to see the end when I shoot Aaron Burr

492
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,720
right in his fucking head and waste that dude, right?

493
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,000
That's how it happened, right?

494
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,200
That's how it happened, right?

495
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,240
Did I waste him?

496
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,840
I sure hope I did, right?

497
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,880
God, it's been so long.

498
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,760
Real quick, you guys.

499
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,480
Yeah, please.

500
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,920
Now that everyone's stuck at home,

501
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,080
I thought that this would be a really good time.

502
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,240
Oh no, he's about to do something bad, isn't he?

503
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,040
Hi, everybody.

504
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,960
I was just about to give a quiz to my brothers.

505
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,480
So I thought it was a good time for you all

506
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,920
to play along at home.

507
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,480
Yes, yes.

508
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,120
Yeah, you know what?

509
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,080
Actually, I like it now.

510
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,200
Oh, good.

511
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,800
Now I've tried something new here

512
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,360
rather than one question for both of you.

513
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,720
Travis, the format was not broken, pal.

514
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,200
You would-

515
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,960
I have written multiple questions,

516
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,520
but so three questions for Justin

517
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,680
and three questions for Griffin.

518
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,080
Holy Christ, that's got a lot of questions.

519
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,520
But only Justin is allowed to answer Justin's questions

520
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,600
and only Griffin is allowed to answer Griffin's questions,

521
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,560
but everyone at home is welcome to play along

522
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,440
on all the questions.

523
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,160
So let's begin.

524
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,680
Justin, of the original 150,

525
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,200
please name the three ghost type Pokemon.

526
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,400
It's easy shit.

527
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,640
Gastly.

528
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,680
Uh-huh, that's one.

529
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
Are you fucking kidding me?

530
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:58,880
Oh, no.

531
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,560
Gastly.

532
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,520
Oh, I'm sorry, Justin.

533
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,000
Time's up.

534
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,120
Griffin, do you want to-

535
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
Fucking Gastly, Haunter, and Gengar.

536
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,680
And technically, and technically,

537
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,400
that one Marowak that was Cubone's mom

538
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,360
that was dead as hell at the top of the tower.

539
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,880
Now, Griffin, at Disneyland,

540
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,680
which animal is given free reign to roam the park at night?

541
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,080
What animal?

542
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,640
A horse.

543
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,480
No, I'm sorry.

544
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,560
The answer is feral cats.

545
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,920
There's estimated to be over 200 feral cats

546
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,520
that roam the grounds of Disneyland at night.

547
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,280
Well, they should do something about that.

548
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,480
Disneyland sucks.

549
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:40,980
Sucks.

550
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,040
Is that why you did this?

551
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,720
To give me an opportunity to say Disneyland sucks.

552
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,280
Oh, really?

553
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,960
You're Disney World, man.

554
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,400
Only.

555
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,520
Yeah, Disneyland is-

556
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,080
It's pretty good if you can get past the feral cats.

557
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,200
I heard it's not even open.

558
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,880
So, Justin.

559
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,600
Yeah, I bet they're having a fucking heyday, by the way.

560
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,240
200 feral cats, you mean 2,000.

561
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,360
The gates are open.

562
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,120
Everything's made of feral cats.

563
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,320
Justin.

564
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,240
Currently, Eevee has eight possible evolutions.

565
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,840
Please name at least five.

566
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,040
Eevee, possible evolutions.

567
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,920
I mean-

568
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,800
Are you Googling?

569
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,080
No, I'm not Googling, which you'll know because I won't.

570
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,320
Eevee, eight?

571
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,640
Eight seems like so many, right?

572
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,480
Yeah, seems like a lot.

573
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,680
It's a lot to keep track of.

574
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,680
I wanted to say clay fairy for the last one,

575
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,880
so I'm gonna say clay fairy again.

576
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,800
No, God, come on.

577
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,320
Eevee, two?

578
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,240
They all end in eon.

579
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,000
Griffin, how many can you name?

580
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,680
Radion, is that one?

581
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,960
God damn it.

582
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,400
How many can you name, Griffin?

583
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,680
Well, you got Jolteon, Flareon, and Vaporeon from Gen 1,

584
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,560
and I think that's when they added Espeon and Umbreon,

585
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,160
which are the psychic and dark type.

586
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,120
You do have Leafeon and Glaceon, which is ice,

587
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,520
and the fairy type one is Sylveon?

588
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,920
Damn, that's all eight right there.

589
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,320
You guys want me to know?

590
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,440
It's eight Pokemon.

591
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,280
Are you fucking kidding me?

592
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,960
It's eight Pokemon.

593
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,720
Griffin, and if you get anywhere close to the number,

594
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,920
I will count it as correct.

595
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,640
But how many churros are sold at Disneyland every year?

596
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,160
A billion.

597
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,160
Jesus, no, over 2.8 million.

598
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,000
That's a lot of churros, though, huh?

599
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,600
That's quite a lot of churros.

600
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,280
Sorry, I'm just trying to answer these as quickly as possible.

601
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,760
I appreciate that.

602
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,920
I could sooner answer, by the way,

603
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,160
questions about Pokemon than I could about Disneyland.

604
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,640
Oh, really?

605
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,960
With that bad theme park that no one enjoys.

606
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,400
Next week, I'll make them on Disney World.

607
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
Or don't do it next week.

608
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,200
Let's not.

609
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,120
Justin, Pikachu's name is a Japanese onomatopoeia portmanteau

610
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,560
for what two words?

611
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,120
Pikachu's name is a Japanese onomatopoeia portmanteau

612
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,400
for what two words?

613
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:12,320
It is a portmanteau of two onomatopoetical words, I guess.

614
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,400
Two onomatopoetical English words?

615
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:15,520
No.

616
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,200
Okay, so just...

617
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,400
No, no problem.

618
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,520
Yeah, let me just dip in my knowledge of Pokemon and Japanese

619
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,680
to come up with...

620
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,920
I always thought it was like, peek at you.

621
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,460
Okay.

622
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,060
So, like, you know how he's a dirty perv.

623
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,060
Like, he's a dirty perv when he peeks at you.

624
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,780
I Pikachu.

625
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,140
It's actually...

626
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,700
Oh, let me get a...

627
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,260
Okay.

628
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,980
I mean, Choo Choo Rocket is about a mouse,

629
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,780
so I think Choo is the onomatopoetic noise that a mouse makes.

630
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:48,660
Okay.

631
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,300
Which would mean that Pika is the sound that electricity makes.

632
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,500
Well, hey, you know what?

633
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,060
I'll count it.

634
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,580
Because Choo Choo is squeaking and Pika Pika is sparkle.

635
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,100
So Pikachu is sparkle and squeaking.

636
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,600
Okay.

637
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,500
Griffin, one last question.

638
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,460
What doesn't he know?

639
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,180
Who said that?

640
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,020
When Pirates of the Caribbean originally opened at Disneyland,

641
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,780
what authentic props were used on loan from UCLA?

642
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,280
Guns.

643
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,100
Incorrect.

644
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,620
The answer is human skeletons.

645
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,100
Oh, they shouldn't have done that.

646
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,340
No, not at all.

647
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,860
That seems horribly, like, morally seeking, right?

648
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,700
Yeah, they shouldn't have used those.

649
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,020
Those are real dead, real deads.

650
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,380
And hey, just FYI, those were all returned,

651
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,260
but there is still, according to the thing I read,

652
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,020
one human skull still in use at Pirates of the Caribbean and Disneyland.

653
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,940
So, guess times, they haven't changed that much.

654
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,740
So who won?

655
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,020
That would be, well, I guess-

656
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,860
I fucking stomped your ass, dude.

657
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,660
Well, Griffin at least knew the answers to your questions.

658
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,300
That's true.

659
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,580
Oh, well.

660
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,660
Hey, we'll get him next time.

661
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,980
But thank you, Travis, for that great segment.

662
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,100
I think we all had a lot of fun.

663
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,180
It was a nice break from humor.

664
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:07,780
Let's take a break and head on over to the Money Zone.

665
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,620
I want to tell you about Blue Apron.

666
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,380
Because I know that neither one of you have ever heard about it before.

667
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:23,860
Get this.

668
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,820
This, imagine being able to cook food at home,

669
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,420
but without having to go anywhere to buy that food first.

670
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,700
Blue Apron sends you a box full of ingredients.

671
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,620
Just random ingredients, you ask?

672
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,700
No, specific ingredients to make specific meals

673
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,060
that they also give you instructions on how to cook.

674
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,620
It's just that simple.

675
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,980
And I know what you're asking.

676
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,940
Is it the same three meals every time?

677
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,260
No.

678
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,940
Yes, hamburgers, spaghetti.

679
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,180
No.

680
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,940
No, it's different meals each time.

681
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,980
And you can choose what kind of meals you want.

682
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,540
And these are chef-designed, delicious, ready-to-cook meals

683
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,140
with perfectly portioned ingredients

684
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,660
and a lot of flavorful options.

685
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:13,220
And it's also near your door, starting as low as $7.49 per serving.

686
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,100
And it's flexible.

687
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,180
You can skip weeks or cancel any time.

688
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,820
Feel good about your food and your environment impact

689
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,140
with Blue Apron, the first and only meal kit

690
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,820
to partner with How To Recycle,

691
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,580
which takes the guesswork out of recycling

692
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,140
and is committed to transparency and reducing waste.

693
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,900
Find comfort in the kitchen with Blue Apron

694
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,220
and enjoy delicious home-cooked meal.

695
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,260
Check out this week's menu and visit BlueApron.com.

696
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,580
That's BlueApron.com.

697
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,980
Blue Apron, eat your soul.

698
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,260
No, feed your soul, excuse me.

699
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,060
Eat your own soul.

700
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,780
You think Shang Tsung ever accidentally ate his own soul?

701
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,260
He was like, oh, crap.

702
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,580
Probably when he was young, right, and first doing it.

703
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:52,820
Yeah.

704
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,980
Or he was like, kind of like this, like, no.

705
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,940
And he maybe, well, then is it still in your tummy then?

706
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,740
Well, the soul lives in the tummy.

707
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,700
And as you ponder that, also ponder about Stitch Fix.

708
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,660
It is a box that is also gonna come to your door.

709
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,500
And can you build a robot costume out of these boxes?

710
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:12,820
Sure.

711
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,380
Nobody's gonna stop you from doing that.

712
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,860
But there's other clothes too that come in these Stitch Fix boxes.

713
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,260
It's a personal styling company that makes getting the clothes you love effortless.

714
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:31,940
You send a box of clothes that is set up for you via the Stitch Fix profile service.

715
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,740
You punch in, like, what kind of stuff you like to wear.

716
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,660
And you work with an online stylist who will then send you clothes.

717
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,620
And whatever you like, you keep and you pay for it.

718
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,900
Everything else you just ship back.

719
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,900
And returns and shipping and exchanges are always easy and free.

720
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,980
You just pay a $20 styling fee for each fix that gets sent to you.

721
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,060
And it's credited towards anything that you keep.

722
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,500
So get started today at stitchfix.com.

723

What if I like to wear clothes that are dumb and ugly and uncomfortable?

725
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,100
Will they send me some of those?

726
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,300
I mean, if you ask for it, I don't know.

727
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,780
Hey, Stitch Fix, give me dumb poopy clothes.

728
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,140
Give me the dutiest stuff you got.

729
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,300
They have never sent me poopy clothes ever.

730
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,500
They've only sent me good stuff.

731
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,620
And I really like it.

732
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,340

Stitch Fix, wear your soul.

737
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,940
Hi, I'm Dave.

738
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,900
Hi, I'm Graham.

739
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,620
And we're two house DJs who have been trapped inside our drum machine.

740
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,340
We love it here.

741
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,860
And we'd love if you stopped by and visited us every week.

742
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,620
On Stop Podcasting Yourself.

743
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,860
Here on MaximumFun.org.

744
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,820
We're just a couple of doofuses from Canada.

745
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,900
And listen to our show or perish.

746
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:57,060
Stop podcasting yourself on MaximumFun.org.

747
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,980
I got another question from a listener.

748
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,500
Every time I video conference with my co-workers,

749
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,140
they comment about the mirror on the wall behind me.

750
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,100
I like having the mirror there since it makes the room look bigger.

751
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,060
But my co-workers comments are starting to get annoying.

752
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,900
What should I do to hide that mirror

753
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,460
that won't start more conversations about the dang mirror?

754
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,540
And that's from the man in the mirror.

755
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,100
I have no idea.

756
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,540
Oh, yeah.

757
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,220
Like how do you move them?

758
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,820
Like how do you move a mirror?

759
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,420
What do you do with it?

760
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,300
Throw it in the garbage?

761
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,020
You break it?

762
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,460
No, there's nothing to be done.

763
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,980
I'm gonna have to call in some outside help.

764
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,740
You know, Elizabeth Gilbert's an author,

765
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,260
so she's probably just at home.

766
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,780
And she's strong.

767
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,820
Strong enough to move mirrors.

768
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,860
Strong enough to move mirrors.

769
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,980
Let me call her.

770
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,340
Elizabeth, I haven't called you yet.

771
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,660
Okay, let me call her real quick.

772
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,260
Bloop, bloop, blop, bloop, bloop.

773
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,620
Banana phone.

774
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,540
Hi, hi, hi, this is Liz.

775
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,180
Liz, hey, it's Justin and Travis and Griffin.

776
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,980
Oh, I didn't see your name come up on my ID.

777
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,340
That's incredible.

778
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,780
Yeah, you should get your phone fixed.

779
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,740
It's broken.

780
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,420
Yeah, it may be kind of messed up

781
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,620
because I think your phone number

782
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,140
does only have five numbers in it.

783
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,580
Just happened to be walking by the phone.

784
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,180
Just a delight to hear you.

785
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,900
I have her on my speed dial actually,

786
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,820
but she's in the 20,000s,

787
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,580
so it does take five button presses to get there.

788
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,180
Let me text you the question

789
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,860
so I don't have to read it again.

790
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,820
Yep, yep.

791
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,460
Got it?

792
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,260
Okay.

793
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,100
And Justin, what would that sound like?

794
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,180
Let me take you inside the vent for that.

795
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,540
Do some prop work.

796
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,820
Come on, anchor us.

797
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,860
Okay, I'll do it.

798
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,380
Hey Siri, text Elizabeth Gilbert.

799
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,700
Which Elizabeth Gilbert?

800
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,740
The only one in my phone.

801
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,620
Every time I video conference with my coworkers,

802
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,020
they comment about the mirror on the wall behind me.

803
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,100
I like having the mirror there since it,

804
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,300
no, I like having the mirror there.

805
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,740
Delete, delete, delete.

806
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,180
Okay, start up.

807
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:10,180
Siri, text Liz Gilbert.

808
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,420
Every time I video conference with my,

809
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,540
oh, it auto completed.

810
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,260
Okay, it auto completed with the entire rest of the question.

811
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:16,740
Perfect.

812
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,180
Okay, so there it is.

813
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,140
You should have it.

814
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,780
Liz, you're about to get like that exact text

815
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,860
from hundreds of thousands of our listeners

816
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,940
by the way, just because of the way that Apple's technology works.

817
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,060
It's weird, it came through,

818
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:32,580
but it came through as like a GoFundMe directly to you guys.

819
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,900
So I don't know what that is, but yeah.

820
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,500
Well, these are trying times, Liz.

821
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:42,260
I really like the sort of cyclical nature

822
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,940
of this question being pitched to Liz Gilbert

823
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,780
because the last time you were on the show,

824
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,140
400,000 years ago.

825
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,940
Many years ago.

826
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,380
You dished out some truly helpful

827
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,340
and I would say genuinely life-changing advice

828
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,180
about working from home and taking it seriously

829
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,180
and putting on clean pants every morning.

830
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:07,700
And here we are now 400,000 years later

831
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,260
in the grips of some, let's say nasty stuff.

832
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,900
And technology has changed.

833
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,500
Now we got video conferencing

834
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,580
and we got to worry about mirrors and stuff.

835
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,420
It's just, it's like a beautiful bookend.

836
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,460
You know what I mean?

837
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,020
And yet some things haven't changed, you know?

838
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,580
And one of the things that hasn't changed

839
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,860
and I think that I would say you guys would agree with me on this

840
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,580
is that people should be themselves still.

841
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,340
So this question asker is saying,

842
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,620
how can I hide my mirror?

843
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,140
Which sounds to me a lot like,

844
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,980
how can I hide my light under a bushel?

845
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,500
And we don't support that, right?

846
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,180
We want you to show your mirror.

847
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,140
If I may, and this is gonna go against,

848
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,300
I would say your entire aesthetic,

849
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:58,260
but maybe people shouldn't always 100% be themselves, right?

850
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:03,060
Like there's something, you know what I mean?

851
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,620
Like maybe hold 1% back isn't the worst.

852
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:10,020
You remember in Elizabeth's novel,

853
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,980
Eat, Pray, Love, the woman learns the lesson

854
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,900
which is on the back page and the front page

855
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,140
is be yourself within reason.

856
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,100
Unless other people are looking.

857
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,060
Unless other, yeah.

858
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,500
Dance like people that you sort of care about watching

859
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,700
are in fact watching you dance.

860
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,940
Dance like your coworkers are watching you.

861
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,700
Right, dance like your coworkers

862
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,740
who you've built up a kind of facade personality for

863
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,620
are watching.

864
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,140
You've seen them dance.

865
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,100
So like keep that in mind as you dance for them.

866
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,540
But I have two thoughts on this.

867
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,340
One is that I think you should write something

868
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,540
on the mirror backwards.

869
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,940
That's good.

870
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,860
And just not even make mention of it

871
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,620
and then pretend that you can't see it, right?

872
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,740
So you could just send,

873
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,140
have very dark satanic messages on the mirror.

874
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,900
Or happy ones.

875
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,060
Yeah, it could be a happy satanic message.

876
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,500
Hey, it's me, Satan.

877
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,380
Be safe out there.

878
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,580
Wash your hands.

879
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,900
What if you put their questions about the mirror

880
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,700
on the mirror, right?

881
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,060
Doug asks, you know,

882
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,740
and you just have it be like a whiteboard.

883
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,780
Could you paint a small child

884
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,540
in prison inside, really?

885
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,420
I'm home.

886
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,620
Can I take it one step further?

887
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,780
Cause my idea was to like,

888
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,700
I think if we combine that and my idea

889
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,700
which is to do that and then cover it

890
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,220
with some kind of black lace.

891
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,700
Oh, very nice.

892
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,180
So if I remove this,

893
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,180
no, you guys don't want to see the mirror anymore.

894
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,060
Trust me.

895
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,500
Yeah, cause you'll trade places

896
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,020
with whoever you see in there.

897
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,060
And then they're gonna take over this meeting

898
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,740
and they're gonna waste a lot of company time.

899
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,060
Yeah.

900
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,780
Could you make some sort of optical illusion

901
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,220
with your camera on your phone

902
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,980
or on your laptop or whatever you're using?

903
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,900
So when they complain about the mirror,

904
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,780
they mention the mirror,

905
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,540
you go, okay, you guys, I hear you.

906
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,340
I'm gonna move it now.

907
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,100
But when you go to move it,

908
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,860
your reflection doesn't show up in it.

909
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,820
Oh, there's gotta be some,

910
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,980
somebody, we'll get the top people on that

911
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,260
and see if we can't.

912
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,500
Hey, let's call David Blaine.

913
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,940
Someone get David Blaine on the phone.

914
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,660
Let me call him too.

915
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,940
Hey, it's me, David Blaine.

916
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,620
I'm not done calling you, David Blaine.

917
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,740
Oh, but I'm here to help.

918
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,460
Hey, I knew you were gonna call.

919
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,820
That's the magic trick.

920
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,660
Look inside the bottle.

921
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,940
That's where the mirror is now.

922
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,580
Hey, Liz, if I may call you Liz,

923
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,820
let me hit you with this.

924
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,460
What if you've crafted a lot of drama?

925
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,300
What do you think about the drama of this moment?

926
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,780
The next time your employee

927
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,420
or your coworkers mention the mirror

928
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,860
without missing a beat,

929
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,340
you pick up an ashtray that you have

930
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,380
there on your desk

931
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,660
and chuck it out the mirror

932
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,700
and smash it into a million pieces.

933
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,780
Oh, it's so good.

934
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,460
After that moment, right?

935
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:55,380
You are someone who is capable of anything.

936
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,700
And don't even respond beyond that.

937
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:58,500
Yeah.

938
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,140
Like, you're right back in that Zoom window

939
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,460
and you're just like,

940
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,940
you know, I've got the quarterly reports here now for Dan

941
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,220
and people will be more...

942
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,060
That's more terrifying than if your reflection

943
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:11,620
doesn't show up.

944
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,180
I bet.

945
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,860
There's one thing they're not gonna do again

946
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,380
and that's trifle with you.

947
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,820
There will be no trifling.

948
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,460
They also won't complain about the mirror anymore

949
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,500
because it will be described.

950
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:20,980
It's gone.

951
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,140
I would like to pitch something

952
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,100
along the lines of the optical illusion.

953
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,900
You made me think of this.

954
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,900
What if before the next meeting

955
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,420
you cut a hole in the wall,

956
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,580
the exact size of the mirror,

957
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,340
and then you put the mirror frame up

958
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,460
without the mirror in it

959
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,820
and then behind that hole

960
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,020
on the other side of the wall,

961
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,620
you put a mirror, right?

962
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,900
So it looks like it's reflecting

963
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,580
and the next time someone mentions the mirror,

964
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,940
you say, I've had enough of this

965
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,420
and then you step into the mirror world

966
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:46,820
and do the mirror.

967
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,460
The amazing thing that you just did, Travis,

968
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,900
is that sentence itself

969
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,060
sounded like a mirror reflected in a mirror.

970
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,620
Thank you.

971
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,140
I just got lost in there, like,

972
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,620
bouncing from the image to image.

973
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,140
But if you go back and track it,

974
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,260
it all makes sense.

975
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,540
It diagrams perfectly.

976
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,620
Someone has an absolutely banal problem

977
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,700
and Travis decides to build Pepper's ghost

978
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:08,820
behind them.

979
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,700
I think this is fun.

980
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,980
I think because, listen,

981
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,460
we could be in this mess for quite a while.

982
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,540
What I love about having a solution

983
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,700
is you can build on it every week.

984
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,460
Maybe the first week you go in and come out,

985
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,260
you're like, oh, that's weird.

986
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,700
Everything's in there, but it's backwards.

987
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,340
And the second week,

988
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,340
maybe you come out with a glowing orb.

989
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,660
And you're like, yo, this mirror world

990
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,260
is what I want you to build up.

991
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,980
I want you to make it as difficult as possible

992
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,060
for your coworkers to reconcile

993
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,500
your at-home fiction

994
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,740
with your in-the-office fiction

995
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,580
once you are headed back to the office.

996
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,780
Like, once you get back to the office,

997
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,060
do not mention the mirror world.

998
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,100
Do not mention the orb.

999
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,420
Don't be like, yo, we saw some wild shit

1000
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,620
when we were talking to you on Zoom.

1001
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,500
Are you okay?

1002
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,420
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1003
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,780
If you've got a friend among your coworkers,

1004
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,460
if you could coordinate it with somehow

1005
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,140
where you could send them a film

1006
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,300
so that you appear to be walking through the mirror

1007
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,660
and coming out into their home.

1008
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,460
And then you're like, right?

1009
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,540
Even worth risking COVID-19,

1010
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,260
I think, to actually go film that at your house.

1011
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,300
Let's be clear.

1012
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,820
You're going to be fired

1013
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,340
because your boss is going to put together

1014
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,940
how much time and effort you've put into this

1015
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,100
instead of, I don't know, reports or whatever, right?

1016
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,300
You're going to lose your job,

1017
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,620
but you're going to be a legend.

1018
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,900
Yeah, I think that's good.

1019
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,100
I've never had a job,

1020
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,300
so I don't know how these things work.

1021
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,060
Now, that's not true, Elizabeth Gilbert.

1022
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,700
You do have a job.

1023
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,180
You're an author, and you just published.

1024
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,300
Well, you didn't publish.

1025
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,820
I'm assuming you have people for this.

1026
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,860
Things are tough, but-

1027
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,820
I got a little printing.

1028
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,940
We're all doing it from home now.

1029
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,940
Just printing books by hand.

1030
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,420
The paperback copy of City of Girls,

1031
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,420
which I read and enjoyed.

1032
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,220
It's a rocking tale of life in New York City.

1033
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,500
I thought it was very...

1034
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,580
It painted a lot of beautiful pictures in my mind.

1035
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,980
Nice. Thanks, Vinny.

1036
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,220
What a great way to describe the reading.

1037
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,620
It's the power of books, as I like to say

1038
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,260
when I talk about the good things that books do.

1039
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,540
I made you hallucinate.

1040
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,700
That's the benefit of publishing

1041
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,340
out of your own Xerox printer at your house,

1042
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,660
is you can just douse each page

1043
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,900
in a hallucinogenic, touchable drug.

1044
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:20,820
Yes.

1045
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,780
I have a question.

1046
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,620
I know that was an off-ramp,

1047
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,140
but I do have a question for you.

1048
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,980
You're, as a creative person,

1049
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,860
and you've written and thought a lot about creativity,

1050
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,180
and this is a complete pivot,

1051
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,300
and I apologize to our listeners

1052
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,820
because this must be so jarring

1053
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,740
for a show as consistent and structured as ours.

1054
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:41,940
I tend to think of creativity as putting a bunch

1055
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,100
of different garbage in your mind

1056
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,900
and rearranging it in interesting ways.

1057
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,100
No, that's podcasting.

1058
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,500
Hang up.

1059
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,780
Hang up the phone.

1060
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,820
I can't with you.

1061
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,380
Let's go over.

1062
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:53,860
I can't.

1063
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,700
Okay, so...

1064
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,340
Okay, go ahead.

1065
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:56,980
I don't have...

1066
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,460
In this world of ours,

1067
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,300
I can still watch YouTube,

1068
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,060
and I'm loving it for sure,

1069
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,980
but I'm definitely feeling myself

1070
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:10,820
a little starved of the outside impulses of the world

1071
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:16,340
that feed into the creative engine.

1072
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,780
Is that something you're struggling with at all?

1073
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,220
And if people are,

1074
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,460
what do you think?

1075
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,660
Do you have a hot take?

1076
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,540
So are you saying that in order for you to be inspired,

1077
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,820
you kind of have to go out in the world

1078
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,500
and roll around in it,

1079
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,380
but you personally,

1080
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,820
that that's how it works for you?

1081
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,260
I didn't think so before

1082
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,340
because I do not like going out there.

1083
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,660
Well, that's what was surprising me about the question.

1084
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,380
But I'm forced out there frequently

1085
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,100
by touring and obligations, right?

1086
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,140
And apparently,

1087
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,700
I was drawing more on the outside world than I thought

1088
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,060
because I got nothing right now.

1089
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,500
Right.

1090
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,260
Well, I guess you have to just do like...

1091
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,900
It's kind of like the difference

1092
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,220
between Emily Dickinson's poems

1093
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,660
and like Walt Whitman's poems.

1094
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,340
You've chosen the exact right people

1095
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,460
to make this reference with.

1096
00:42:59,460 --> 00:42:59,940
Go on.

1097
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,900
Yeah.

1098
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,220
So Walt Whitman's poetry is all about

1099
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,460
going and rolling in the earth

1100
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,580
and taking it in.

1101
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,820
And Emily Dickinson never left her bedroom,

1102
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,860
but she still wrote an incredible body of work.

1103
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,140
I think you just have to start looking at the world

1104
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,900
through the eyes of a 19th century spinster poetess.

1105
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,900
You probably know way more about this than I do.

1106
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,500
I know, I think, one thing about each of those people,

1107
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,620
and it is this.

1108
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,260
Wouldn't you say Walt Whitman was, I don't know,

1109
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,260
happier than Emily Dickinson?

1110
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,540
Listen, Travis, do you want to be happy

1111
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,100
or do you want to make great, was it poems?

1112
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,980
Poems.

1113
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,500
It was poems that she made.

1114
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,980
I think you might have been a little bit happier yet.

1115
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,300
Yeah, I think, you know,

1116
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,460
I'm actually surprised by the opposite

1117
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,340
because I am a traveler

1118
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,740
and yet I'm finding that I'm quite enjoying

1119
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:58,020
my little quarantine time at home.

1120
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,420
Did you guys Freaky Friday?

1121
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,580
Maybe Freaky Friday.

1122
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,980
Yeah, it could be.

1123
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,420
Not sure, because I'm doing different kinds

1124
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,140
of creativity now.

1125
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:13,300
Like I've gotten, I ordered a bunch of watercolor paper

1126
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,820
and pens and I'm actually drawing.

1127
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,500
I've never, haven't done that since I was a kid.

1128
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,580
That's a good thing to do when you're inside.

1129
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,060
So do some art, do some art art

1130
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,980
and then make jokes about that, I guess.

1131
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,500
I don't know how that turns into,

1132
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,100
how you turn that into comedy gold.

1133
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,980
But that would be art, art, art at that point.

1134
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,780
Yeah, too many arts.

1135
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,340
Too many, okay.

1136
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,140
Too many love.

1137
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,220
Hey, can I just congratulate you guys

1138
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:40,180
on your 500th episode very recently?

1139
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,620
Thank you so much.

1140
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,900
That's incredible.

1141
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,860
I actually think this is for next week's episode.

1142
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,620
This is our 10 year anniversary celebration.

1143
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,420
Believe it or not.

1144
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,300
So incredible.

1145
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,900
We've been podcasting for 10 years.

1146
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:57,140
You have brought this woman so much joy

1147
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,740
over those 10 years.

1148
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,140
I can't even tell you how I've taken you

1149
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,420
all over the world with me.

1150
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,500
We've gone on extremely long walks together

1151
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,460
in interesting places.

1152
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,660
I'm so grateful that you exist.

1153
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,500
And I also wanted to say I was a little jealous

1154
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,140
on your 500th episode and your kids were on

1155
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,340
and you were interviewing your kids

1156
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,460
about what their favorite Bim Bam episodes were.

1157
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,100
And I was like, my hand was raised.

1158
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,100
We didn't call on you.

1159
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,060
So rude.

1160
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,780
Can I answer that just to get it out of my system?

1161
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,420
Sure, please.

1162
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,140
Please.

1163
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,900
It would be the Ballad of Tit Liquid.

1164
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,020
Oh, yeah.

1165
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,140
Thank you.

1166
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:31,780
Yeah, that was-

1167
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,460
I've listened to it several times.

1168
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,060
Whenever I need a lift, I go back

1169
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,500
and just listen to that little bit

1170
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,340
because it's so incredibly funny.

1171
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,380
So thank you for letting me get that off my chest.

1172
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,060
I'm glad that you could share that

1173
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,740
at great personal cost to me.

1174
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,300
What a generous host we are.

1175
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,940
So City of Girls is out in paperback.

1176
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,900
There's lots of other books you can buy by Elizabeth Gilbert.

1177
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,620
And you should probably buy-

1178
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,820
I mean, I'm glad you clarified

1179
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,980
because there are lots of other books you could buy.

1180
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,860
Yeah, no, buy Elizabeth Gilbert specifically.

1181
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,300
Buy City of Girls or don't.

1182
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,020
Travis, actually, I'd rather right now

1183
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,260
we just focus not on the lots of other books

1184
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,140
that people could buy.

1185
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,260
Oh, okay, right, right, right.

1186
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,460
Yeah, just these few books.

1187
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,980
Just City of Girls or another book.

1188
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,980
Just this little handful.

1189
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,820
Call your local bookstore.

1190
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,740
I bet they could maybe ship it to you.

1191
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,380
And that's nice that you're supporting two great people,

1192
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,300
your local bookstore and Elizabeth Gilbert.

1193
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:28,020
There's also a new really good alternative to Amazon,

1194
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,860
which is called bookshop.org.

1195
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,860
And you can just go to bookshop.org

1196
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,740
and you can buy books from independent bookstores online

1197
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,420
as easily as you could do it on Amazon.

1198
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,020
So if you don't know how to support

1199
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,060
your local independent bookstore,

1200
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,220
that's an easy way to do it wherever you are.

1201
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:41,620
Excellent.

1202
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,060
Hey, this is Jeff Bezos.

1203
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,500
I'm listening on all the podcasts

1204
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,220
while they're making them.

1205
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,220
I just need you to delete that one part.

1206
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,540
If you delete that one part for me, I don't like it.

1207
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,260
I don't want it.

1208
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,780
And delete that for me, please.

1209
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,540
Elizabeth Gilbert, this is Jeff Bezos.

1210
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,060
We're canceling all your books.

1211
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:59,060
Hey, Jeff, Elizabeth, pleasure to meet you.

1212
00:46:59,060 --> 00:46:59,940
I'm Jesse Thorne.

1213
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,620
I heard you guys are doing free ads

1214
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:03,940
without anybody paying for them.

1215
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,460
And I'm going to cut that out too.

1216
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,660
I listen to all the shows too.

1217
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,140
This is what I've always sounded like.

1218
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,300
While you're relaxing on your Casper mattress,

1219
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,700
you can buy yourself a book from Bookshop.org.

1220
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,260
You're giving away thousands of dollars.

1221
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,940
Please don't mention my mattresses

1222
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,900
unless I pay for it.

1223
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,580
I'm a very outstanding young man

1224
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,860
and I won't stand for it.

1225
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,820
That's robbing from you, the creator.

1226
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,260
And I respect you.

1227
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,100
Jon Casper, Jesse Thorne, this is me, Jeff Bezos again.

1228
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,100
I just wanted to say I'm excited to see you two

1229
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,300
at our secretive billionaires hunting party.

1230
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,620
And we'll catch y'all there.

1231
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:43,380
Hey, I love all this.

1232
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:49,140
Hi, this is Jimmy Squarespace.

1233
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,140
All right, Elizabeth Gilbert, thank you.

1234
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,180
You know, the standing offer

1235
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,420
to just permanently join the show still stands.

1236
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,580
Anytime you want to take us on.

1237
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,380
Anytime.

1238
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,020
I'll quit anytime to make room for you.

1239
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:00,820
I love you guys.

1240
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:01,540
Be safe.

1241
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:01,940
You too.

1242
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:02,500
We love you too.

1243
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,540
Okay, bye-bye.

1244
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,040
Bye.

1245
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,060
What?

1246
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:07,460
Yes.

1247
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,340
Okay.

1248
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:21,940
I want to grow, I want to heal, fix this failing planet

1249
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,500
with fast food meals.

1250
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:34,100
Welcome to Munch Squad, colon, brands are here for you.

1251
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:39,540
A lot of people have been thinking in this crisis,

1252
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,500
have the brands abandoned me?

1253
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:47,620
Have my favorite fast food brands abandoned me?

1254
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,060
And I've been feeling it too,

1255
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,500
because they stopped cranking out hot new menu items

1256
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,300
for me to discuss.

1257
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,420
So I felt abandoned.

1258
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:57,780
So I started digging and I realized that the brands

1259
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,140
haven't had time to make great new menu items for me

1260
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,260
because they're busy fucking doing their part

1261
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,420
to help heal this incredible crisis

1262
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,060
that our entire planet finds itself embroiled in.

1263
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:21,300
So with a spirit, a good-natured and a pat on the shoulder

1264
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,340
and maybe a slightly patronizing nod,

1265
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,660
I want to give you some of the updates

1266
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:31,460
on what our brands are doing to help sort of do their part.

1267
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,580
Carl's Jr's slash Hardee's are providing and eat.

1268
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,580
A lot of people are doing family meals,

1269
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,860
let you get a big old mess of food for a good price

1270
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,580
to take home to your family, save you a bunch of hassle,

1271
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,700
which is great.

1272
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,220
Carl's Jr and Hardee's are still charging you money for them.

1273
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,500
This is still a transaction.

1274
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,860
They've adjusted their product to meet the current demand.

1275
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,820
Carl's Jr and Hardee are providing, but they, boy howdy,

1276
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,900
do these brands feel pretty proud of the fact

1277
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,740
that they froze their food for you.

1278
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:03,700
Carl's Jr and Hardee are providing an easy solution

1279
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,580
for family meals in an effort to help people focus

1280
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,420
on taking care of their families

1281
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,500
while we take care of the burgers and biscuits.

1282
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,780
While we keep the burgers and biscuits safe,

1283
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:16,580
we're protecting the burgers and the biscuits

1284
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,740
in support of the families across the country

1285
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:21,380
that are coming together around mealtime.

1286
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:25,140
Carl's Jr and Hardee's are launching the new family bundles menu

1287
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,860
that includes signature items like charbroiled burgers,

1288
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,660
hand-breaded chicken tenders, and made-from-scratch biscuits,

1289
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,620
providing everything you love for everyone you love,

1290
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,060
bundled up, and priced right.

1291
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:39,940
I'm talking about little Jeffrey.

1292
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,500
I'm talking about sweet Susan, your wife.

1293
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,300
Let's get her filled up with these charbroiled broils.

1294
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,260
We love them.

1295
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,300
We love you.

1296
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,340
Please eat our broils.

1297
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,820
That's going to be kicking off Thursday,

1298
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,820
family menu bundle by drive-thru.

1299
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,620
You can pick them up as Carl's Jr and Hardee's

1300
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,700
remain committed to serving their communities

1301
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:03,380
for a reasonable fee and helping everyone to feed their happy.

1302
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:07,780
Boston Market, they got a little bit more of a religious focus.

1303
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,060
With all this, they got their own meal deals,

1304
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,340
their own frozen meal deals.

1305
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,340
With all that's happening around the world right now,

1306
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,700
we know that Easter celebrations will be different

1307
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,900
and smaller this year,

1308
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,700
says Boston Market Chief Executive Officer Eric Wyatt.

1309
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,420
Our team at Boston Market would like to help

1310
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,900
with any type of Easter meal you might be planning,

1311
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,460
with numerous convenient options available for pickup,

1312
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,860
home delivery, or home shipment.

1313
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:36,500
The health and safety of both our guests and our team members

1314
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,900
is our top priority, so we want to do everything we can

1315
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,580
to ensure everyone has a safe and healthy holiday this Easter.

1316
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,020
I appreciate you, Boston Market.

1317
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:44,420
Thank you.

1318
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,340
Zaxby's got their own meal deals.

1319
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,780
Quote, we wanted to create an affordable meal

1320
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,340
featuring our signature menu items for families

1321
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,460
during these challenging times, says Zach McLeroy,

1322
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,300
Zaxby's CEO and co-founder.

1323
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,500
Have you noticed how we never hear from the CEOs,

1324
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,540
but now that they've frozen a lot of food in big boxes,

1325
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,740
now they'll come down from their fucking sedans

1326
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,820
to waltz amongst us Cometers.

1327
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,380
Well, Justin, they did it for our families

1328
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,740
and our sick cousin.

1329
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,940
And our sick cousin. For the communities and the families.

1330
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:19,300
Our sick cousin, Dave, and everyone, all of them.

1331
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:25,300
Zaxby's is always focused on bringing people together

1332
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,980
with flavorful comfort food made with uncompromising quality.

1333
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,420
I have always said that.

1334
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,780
Zaxby's, their number one thing is bringing people together.

1335
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,220
Now, more than ever, we're all family.

1336
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:41,300
Just, you know, family that will charge you $20

1337
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,620
for a large tray of frozen chicken fingers.

1338
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,700
Oh wait, are you guys not doing that in your house?

1339
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,780
Like when BB comes to eat, I'm like, $12.

1340
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,620
$12 please.

1341
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,140
This is good.

1342
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,860
Zaxby's is like, this is all very well and good.

1343
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,380
What if they don't know our name?

1344
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,100
An alternative to fast food, fuck off,

1345
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,500
Zaxby's serves fresh, prepared at order,

1346
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,900
hand breaded chicken fingers with a Z

1347
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:06,180
and wings that can be tossed in a variety of nine sauces.

1348
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,820
The menu also features four salads.

1349
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,140
I'm not reading the rest of the things they have for sale.

1350
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:13,140
Next quote, Zaxby's has been serving up

1351
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,940
premium chicken fingers and wings for 30 years.

1352
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,500
Read a book.

1353
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,940
We want our guests to know we're here for you now

1354
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,380
and we're not going anywhere.

1355
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,820
Quote, we'll weather this storm together

1356
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,620
and come through it stronger than ever.

1357
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:33,620
Zaxby's, they're here forever for you.

1358
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:37,620
You can't kill Zaxby's by conventional methods.

1359
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,260
We are immune, we had it once, we got over it.

1360
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,380
We're an immune now.

1361
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:45,220
We have no lungs to infect with Zaxby's.

1362
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,660
We're all fingers and we don't wash them.

1363
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,740
At some point.

1364
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:50,980
Yeah.

1365
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:57,140
Lastly, the one that I do want to especially hold up

1366
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,220
as I tear down is White Castle

1367
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:02,580
because they are actually doing anything

1368
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:06,260
that is charitable from April 7th to April 30th.

1369
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,300
Healthcare workers and EMTs can go through

1370
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,500
the drive-through of any White Castle restaurant each day

1371
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,660
to receive one free combo meal or breakfast combo.

1372
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,260
They just have to show their work ID.

1373
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:18,820
Fuck yeah.

1374
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:23,140
So I want to say White Castle, that is wonderful.

1375
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,940
White Castle team members will be delivering

1376
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,820
crave cases of sliders to hospitals

1377
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,380
and other healthcare facilities in the regions

1378
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,380
where White Castle has restaurants.

1379
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:33,860
That's good.

1380
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,540
The alternative would have been insane.

1381
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:39,860
We're going to be air dropping White Castle all over this nation.

1382
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:43,060
We put them in a White Castle cannon and blasting them off.

1383
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,020
On April 6th, White Castle delivered 1200 sliders

1384
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,660
to four hospitals in the Detroit area.

1385
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,700
That is very good.

1386
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:54,580
Although I cannot imagine that the smell of 1200 White Castle sliders

1387
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,980
has made that situation a lot more appealing.

1388
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,460
It's about the taste, Justin.

1389
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,220
You don't smell these wet squares.

1390
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,100
They say that.

1391
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,380
They print that on the napkin.

1392
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,500
Don't smell our wet squares.

1393
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,940
Just eat them because they taste good.

1394
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:07,940
In the midst of this pandemic,

1395
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,340
healthcare workers have put it all on the line

1396
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,260
to serve and take care of us.

1397
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,180
Now it's our turn to serve them,

1398
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,820
says Jamie Richardson, vice president at White Castle.

1399
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:20,020
I'm hoping the president was extremely, extremely busy

1400
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,780
because they couldn't come out for this one.

1401
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,420
Providing free sliders and meals to healthcare workers

1402
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,340
is a way for us to show our appreciation

1403
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,020
for everything they're doing right now.

1404
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,340
So White Castle, a little good natured,

1405
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:34,820
funny expense, but good on you for really supporting people.

1406
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:38,980
And that's what's going on as our brands are taking care of us.

1407
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,500
So thank you, brands.

1408
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,660
I know we're going to get through this together.

1409
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:45,700
Stronger, stronger, stronger together.

1410
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,940
Zaxby's says stronger than ever.

1411
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:48,340
We're going to come through this one.

1412
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,500
It's going to be better after, even.

1413
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,940
Zaxby's is like, it's going to be even better after.

1414
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,620
You're going to be like, fuck all that.

1415
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,980
Zaxby's has been looking for its chance to grow, you know?

1416
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:06,260
And sometimes, sometimes that little tree in the forest

1417
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,900
needs another tree to maybe fall over

1418
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,540
to get a little more sunlight on that little tree.

1419
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:14,260
Zaxby's is hoping some of its big siblings

1420
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,500
maybe go down in this.

1421
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,980
So Zaxby's ends up being stronger than ever.

1422
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,860
More power, yeah, extremely powerful.

1423
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,060
Thank you, Zaxby's.

1424
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,940
Folks, thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1425
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,580
And sincerely, I know we got all mushy at 500,

1426
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:30,660
so we're not going to do all that again.

1427
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,300
I will say, though, 10 years, come on.

1428
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,180
You're too good to us.

1429
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:37,780
It's really very kind of you to continue to hang in there with us.

1430
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,300
We know our best years are behind us.

1431
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,420
We know that, you know that.

1432
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,740
But the fact that you've clung in here,

1433
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,540
even in the Twilight years, is very meaningful to us.

1434
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,500
So thank you so much.

1435
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:51,380
Yeah, I do not know what we can say that we did not say,

1436
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,260
like, what, five episodes ago at this point?

1437
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:58,100
But I feel like 10 years is a sort of different milestone,

1438
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:01,620
at least on our end, chronologically speaking,

1439
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,420
to it is easier for me to look back at where I was 10 years ago

1440
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,140
and where I am now.

1441
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:08,900
And where I am now is because of you all listening at home.

1442
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:09,860
So thank you all so much.

1443
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:15,540
Thank you to Elizabeth Gilbert, who is so good, just like the best.

1444
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,300
Just a good, just like a really good person.

1445
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,140
Good person, funny, and very talented.

1446
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:23,700
And I don't think we mentioned this during her segment,

1447
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,940
but if you are struggling with creativity during this time,

1448
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,380
check out Big Magic.

1449
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,180
It's another book of hers that she wrote just about being creative.

1450
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,020
Even if you aren't struggling with creativity,

1451
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,740
read Big Magic because it's a life changer.

1452
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,940
So this is a big thing we should talk about too,

1453
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,700
because with our 10 year anniversary,

1454
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:47,140
we decided to do a little bit of rebranding.

1455
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:48,980
Well, I'll get to that in a second.

1456
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,940
Some new designs, new logos, that kind of stuff.

1457
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,140
And you can check that out.

1458
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:56,020
We'll be sharing it and you'll see it on all our new stuff.

1459
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:59,620
Big credit to Sarah McKay, who did the redesign

1460
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:01,780
and it's just absolutely gorgeous.

1461
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,060
And I love it so much.

1462
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,260
Wild about it.

1463
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:08,580
We're gonna have some new merch up with that rebranded stuff

1464
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:15,300
up on McElroyMerch.com, including a 10 year commemorative plate

1465
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:19,940
that made a lot more sense to make three months ago

1466
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:22,660
when we started working on it.

1467
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,160
Right.

1468
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:31,860
Sometimes it's January and you come up with a funny joke

1469
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,660
that does cost money, right?

1470
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:34,980
Yes.

1471
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,540
And then it's April and the face of the world

1472
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,140
has been forever changed.

1473
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,740
But the plates are still there, huh?

1474
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:42,980
That you still made them.

1475
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,820
There's nothing you can do about it.

1476
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:48,740
You don't have to, listen, you don't have to buy the plates.

1477
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:49,300
We get it.

1478
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,940
We do have to try to, we have to put them up for sale

1479
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,500
because the alternative is just us hoarding plates

1480
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,860
with our faces on it.

1481
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,220
They're really, really good.

1482
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:00,340
But like, I just like before you, like, we get it.

1483
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,060
Okay, like, we get it.

1484
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,060
So anyways, check that out.

1485
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,340
McElroyMerch.com.

1486
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:10,180
We also have, for you stalwarts, there is a shirt

1487
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:14,260
with the old logo on it protesting the new logo.

1488
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,580
And I do want to thank, in that spirit,

1489
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:19,300
I want to thank Justin Russo, a friend of ours

1490
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:23,540
who 10 years ago made that original logo

1491
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,180
and he's still alive today.

1492
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,980
So thank you, Justin, for that shirt.

1493
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,300
You can support Justin.

1494
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,780
We're giving him, you know, he gets his beak wet

1495
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,380
when you buy one of these protest shirts.

1496
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,820
So they're there too if you want to.

1497
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,060
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1498
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:40,820
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1499
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,260
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1500
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,180
Fantastic little ditty.

1501
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,900
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1502
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,460

and a whole bunch more.

1506
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,780
And like Travis and Justin, I think both have said,

1507
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:03,620
we have other stuff at McElroy.Family.

1508
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:06,980
Hey, go check out the movie Trolls World Tour

1509
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,220
featuring your boys.

1510
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,060
And I think that's it.

1511
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:14,340
Yep.

1512
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:16,260
So here is a final Yahoo!

1513
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,820
that was sent in by a bunch of people.

1514
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,380
Graham Roebuck, Adrian Cowles, a bunch of folks

1515
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:22,420
sent this one in, thank you all.

1516
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,220
It's from Yahoo! Answers user Mike who asks,

1517
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:31,380
can science make a Spider-Man?

1518
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,300
My name is Justin McElroy.

1519
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,500
I'm Travis McElroy.

1520
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,620
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1521
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,220
This has been my brother, my brother,

1522
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:44,420
me, Kiss Your Dad, Square on the Lips.
