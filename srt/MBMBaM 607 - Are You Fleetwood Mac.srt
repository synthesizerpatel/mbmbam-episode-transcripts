1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
It's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better, it's better with you

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
It's better, it's better with you

8
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,300
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother and me. What a swing!

9
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:22,840
Justin, I'm sorry. Wow, that was intense. That was a wild shift in energy from the beginning to end. That was my like

10
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,540
The the the ball is going going it might be oh, nope, drop the outfield

11
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,840
And then the guy was gonna pick it up his pants ripped and then everyone saw his butt and his

12
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,260
Energy just dropped. Did I say I'm Justin? Yeah

13
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:47,500
Yeah, and I'm Travis I guess. Wow. Wow. I'm Griffin. This is some of our best work yet guys

14
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,980
And that is what we're here to celebrate a life in podcasting. Oh

15
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,580
That the bill has come to the Piper has begun to play his little tune his jaunty tune

16
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,500
That lures your wallet out of its protective case attached to your chain. Yes, and

17
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,620
It starts to sneak those five dollar bills out once a month. It's the max fund driver

18
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:18,300
Everybody welcome to this very special episode. We should say it is time to pay the Piper as Justin said. The Piper

19
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:26,940
He's got bills to pay guys. Like people never talk about this, but like yeah Piper and it's it's all reasonable stuff

20
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,780
You know, it's not like he doesn't have wild expenses or anything, but like piping's a job

21
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,260
It's a job and you have to pay him or else and we don't talk about this a lot when we talk about the Pied Piper

22
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,620
We talk about his great getting rid of rats or in this case as Justin has put it

23
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,460
Your money five dollar bills

24
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:44,660
Yes

25
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:51,900
But if if that doesn't happen if he does if he is not fairly compensated for that then he takes the kids, right?

26
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,300
He takes all the kids in town

27
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,900
He plays this wonderful flute and makes all the children leave and then the people in town are like are you fucking?

28
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,060
Kidding me Pied Piper. That is such an unnecessary

29
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,060
Escalation so we're not saying if you don't like support the max fund drive and support our shows

30
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,980
Then we'll play a magic flute that makes the kids leave. Yeah, but

31
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,320
It's not off the table. But here's the thing at the end of the day

32
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,380
They hired him to do a job get the rats out of town. Yeah, he did it

33
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,700
Yeah, and they're like, oh cool the rats are gone

34
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:28,140
Well, we're not paying you now the rats are already gone, which is pretty messed up pretty now taking the kids

35
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,140
you're right huge a

36
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:37,780
Lot of people make that like get a lot of people forget that the Pied Piper will play his beautiful music

37
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:45,820
For free for anybody to listen and enjoy and a lot of people will listen to his great music while they're washing dishes

38
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,300
You know, they'll open a window and they're like doing laundry and they sometimes

39
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,660
Take it for granted that you know, he's always gonna be there

40
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:01,820
All right that you know, then they're and they forget that it's you know that he relies on them

41
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:07,300
Yeah, just because it's free to listen. He relies on their generosity maximum fun drive

42
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:18,460
Maximum fun or no, it's not maximum fun drive. Don't listen to me. It's maximum fun org forward slash

43
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:26,900
Join, that's the URL go there right now because it is on the max fund drive the one-time

44
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,700
Year, we come to you and say hey these shows their artists owned

45
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,300
Their audience supported. That's you. Yeah

46
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,900
That's you

47
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:41,220
That's the only reason our shows exist is because of your generosity and we need you now if you never gotten on board

48
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:48,380
Then you need to head on over to maximum fun org for his last join for just five bucks a month

49
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:54,780
If you can pledge five bucks a month, you are going to be unlocking an absolute treasure trove literal

50
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,380
hundreds of hours of bonus content and there is a white

51
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,460
Truly wild assortment. Maybe the most unhinged D&D campaign that has ever existed as designed by my daughter Charlie

52
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,900
Yep, there is a pranky doodle dandy. What about this year Justin? What about this year this year? We?

53
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,660
This one's still evolving folks. This one is exciting

54
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,580
We did a special episode record

55
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,740
brainstorming a new

56
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,980
Transmedia property that we can sort of lean into that pays residuals

57
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,060
in a way the podcasting does not and then we pitched it to our agent Joel and

58
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:42,620
It's still an evolving story the details of which we hope to reveal to you

59
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,300
Yes at some point in the near future. I'll just put it this way

60
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,260
We thought it was so wildly unhinged that it would be we'd call Joel and Joel would be like

61
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,500
You guys are fired even though I'm your agent and dad. Joe was like, okay

62
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:02,040
I'll talk to people so you can hear all of that and more and all the other there's more levels if you're already a supporter

63
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,800
I mean, it's time to up that their support check that out maximum fun org slash join

64
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,200
Cuz the other thing about the Pied Piper is you think Pied Piper?

65
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,240
He's been out there tootin his horn and flute and stuff for 12 years

66
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,560
He's probably like doing doing the like the best he's ever done

67
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,800
But then you got to remember that the Pied Piper for the last couple years hasn't been able to toot his flute out in public

68
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:33,280
Because of the bubonic plague or what-have-you. Yeah, and so and so maybe the Pied Piper could use some

69
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,440
Some extra support that's true and ever

70
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,920
And also just one more thing if you do become a supporter make sure

71
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,400
Talk about on social media. We're so grateful for that and keep an eye on the NB NB AM slash

72
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,840
Macroy family account because we're gonna be announcing some special weird goals like we've done in the past

73
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:59,320
But that's not what I want to talk about right now guys. It's okay been a little over one week since you look to me

74
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,680
Thank you. It's been a solid 24 hours

75
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,120
We've all been living with the announcement of band versus be now and I just we don't have any new information

76
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:15,680
We haven't even released the episode or now. It's not out yet, but I just want to know how's your heart?

77
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,680
How's your walk going guys?

78
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,560
Yeah, what this is the the intro that you want to do to this episode is just redoing the one we did last

79
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,920
Which we recorded for the audience's clarification yesterday yesterday. Yes, exactly

80
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,800
I just want to know if you've marinated in it how you're feeling. I share I did share with my wife

81
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,080
I heard the image. She's like we're absolutely watching that I'll burn in hell first

82
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,720
But then I said of course we'll watch it because we're gonna be live-streaming every second now

83
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:49,240
It's green caps. Yes the whole thing when I told my wife. She said um. Oh, yeah, he's got baby now. He needs that money

84
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:56,000
Which was an excellent point? I think on Teresa's part. Yeah, he wants to make something the baby can enjoy cuz babies hate bees

85
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,680
Yeah, baby's do anything about

86
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,760
Suspicion we're gonna get a lot of feedback that we went a little hard on man versus be

87
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
Yeah

88
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,560
Yeah

89
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,480
Let's instead just as a thought experiment. Okay

90
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,240
Read a listener's question and then attempt to answer it. Oh weird. Okay. Okay. I mean just like I don't know

91
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
It's just something else do it

92
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:34,880
Recently I started a new job where one of the perks is that we have a cabinet full of office supplies that are free for

93
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,320
us to take

94
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:43,280
Sorry, it's just the idea of a office of that has cabinet with office supplies in it being a perk of the job

95
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:49,580
Send a chill up my spine. You have the essential tools. You need to do your work. There are pins. There are notepads and

96
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,820
Yes, and Jimmy clips. Yeah, you have to put on your penis. Yeah

97
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
Keeps you from finishing. What's it?

98
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:05,160
What's the Jimmy clip, huh? Well, you know how sometimes you finish too fast. Yeah. Yeah never

99
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,080
You understand the concept though that one could finish too fast a Jimmy clip just kind of

100
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,040
Prevents that by sort of closing everything up down there. Yeah. Yeah

101
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,560
Does it get in the way? Oh, absolutely. It does. Is it wildly painful? Oh, yeah

102
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
involved effective

103
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,580
I mean, yeah in a sort of brute-force way

104
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,160
Beloved listener a Jimmy clip is

105
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,040
Something that you is a piece of guitar paraphernalia

106
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:48,400
That tightens your tone by well you put it up near the the head of your guitar and it tightens your tone

107
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,220
I think it maybe makes palm muting easier. I don't know what you think a Jimmy clip is

108
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:59,900
This is a question the right. Yeah, there is no question. Where's the question raised? Yeah, this is not what a Jimmy clip is

109
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
What's a Jimmy clip?

110
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,140
Okay, what could it be could be a binder clip one of those that's like, you know

111
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:12,260
You squeeze the two sides and it opens up. Let's think of it a mouth. That's what I always think of it as

112
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,540
Yeah, and that is what I and that is what you would apply to the genitals

113
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:24,460
Is it possible that this listener maybe reply or refers to paper as Jimmy just in general?

114
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,340
Hand me that news Jimmy. I want to read the good news today. Is this a Xerox?

115
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,980
Slash copier kind of situation where we've been calling paper clips paper clips the whole time

116
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:42,860
But that's the like brand name and Jimmy clip is just the actual name like hook and loop instead of velcro

117
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,220
Is that what we're dealing with? I can't fathom

118
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,780
I've googled it in every way I could think of yeah

119
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:53,140
That's the best I've come up with so far is Jimmy Fallon a clip of Jimmy Fallon

120
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,020
Performing with Migos using office supplies. That's all I can get

121
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:02,900
I can't I can't get anything else now. Is it possible that they work in an office based around ice cream and

122
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,540
Jimmy's aka sprinkles. This is a clip to hold the jimmies together

123
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:14,460
It's possible be but who but I think it should be illegal to call sprinkles jimmies. Oh, that's an excellent point

124
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,300
Their name is James. Thank you. Now. I have found a single track on title

125
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,940
where an artist guest performed on a

126
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:31,920
Rap track called plan B and it guest stars a person named Jimmy paperclips

127
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:40,300
Maybe that's a reference to him being in there to one-time rapper Jimmy paperclips. Oh, I accidentally clicked it and I'm listen to it

128
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,740
Hey, this is good. This is good stuff. Jimmy. All right

129
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,180
It's good. Should we should we do the rest of the question or I guess I just that's the first piece of advice

130
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,020
It's just don't call them that they're not that they're not that whatever it is

131
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,520
And this is and and my friend as far as the Internet knows this is not a regional thing

132
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,520
I think it's a you think it's a you thing

133
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,660
However, there is a sign on the cabinet that discourages any hoarding of the office supplies

134
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,060
I do understand. They don't want us to clean out the cabinet, but my desk is nowhere near the cabinet

135
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:13,460
So I want to go ahead and take what I know I will use and not have to come back to the cabinet too frequently

136
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,580
My question is how much can I take before it's considered hoarding or how do I get all the supplies?

137
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,100
I need my desk that raises suspicions. That's from admin anxiety in Atlanta

138
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,140
I do want to I do want to put in a pitch right here that sitting is killing us

139
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,460
And maybe it's not the worst thing to have a little built-in like stroll

140
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:39,540
Yeah, just to get the circulation just to steady or so. Yeah, I'll say it sitting has been great for me

141
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,660
My whole lot me and sitting are very well acquainted and I am still

142
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,900
Such a huge I can't get enough of this stuff

143
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,640
I would actually go one step further and say that maybe Justin the problem is

144
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:59,220
Sitting isn't reclined enough and we should recline. We need more Shays lounges. Oh, that's good

145
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:06,820
Yeah, is that sitting is the problem Justin, but you know what so is standing? Yeah, what about lying down desks, huh?

146
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:12,860
Yes, though the opposite way. Yes. This is what I'm saying zero G desks

147
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,100
Yeah, you know those thing where it's just like not only is a VR helmet

148
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,020
Like I also walk on the little slippery disc and so it's like I'm walking in there a desk like that

149
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:27,140
But I'm laying down and I can maybe do a 360 spin in there gyroscopes

150
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,500
It just sort of sensory deprivation workstation. Yes, please

151
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:37,180
Also, is it so bad to have an excuse to get up from your desk and not work for the time?

152
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,780
It takes to walk over there and back and then if your boss is like he didn't get anything done today

153
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,140
You're like I just kept running out of Jimmy clips my dude

154
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,660
I'm gonna get more Jimmy's you don't worry you got me all anxious with this note about not hoarding the supply

155
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,860
So I only do take one Jimmy clip at a time and then I have to come back and that's my whole day

156
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,040
It's like 60 to 70 trips to the cabinet just to get 60 to 70 Jimmy clips

157
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,040
This

158
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,880
Sucks this sucks that this is a thing that you have to that any human being

159
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:14,920
Has to think about to the point of being even a little bit stressed is how many work supplies is too many work supplies to

160
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,560
Take to my desk. What do you think you're gonna do with them?

161
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,800
Do you think that you're gonna build some sort of mobile out of Jimmy clips?

162
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,080
Hey timeout Griffin. You've never worked an office job. Yes

163
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,040
I

164
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:34,160
Take it from me a person who has the idea of like well, it's 10 a.m. And I'm done with my work

165
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,540
I could go ask what else they need me to work on or I could make a decorative picture out of different colored

166
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,120
You know post-it notes arranged in a way that it looks like Mario's face. I

167
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,540
Know what I'll be doing today. Yeah, and do you work in Nintendo at this?

168
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:58,060
At not at that point, but then what's that? Oh, I made this collage out of post-it notes walking by

169
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:03,080
Well, it's Mario himself and he sees that he's like it's a me and I'm like, it's a you

170
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:08,060
And then he hires me and what's that now? I'm his bag man

171
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,440
Which I think I'm his valet, you know, yes

172
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,340
Yeah, and then pretty soon look at me I'm running the whole show so

173
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:26,100
Maybe it's not so bad. Everybody try that out. Yeah, that's the one way to get hired by Nintendo. Yep

174
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,340
This or also you push you could push Reggie Feasomey out of the way of a

175
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:38,540
Speeding bus and he doesn't work there anymore, but he is he needs you. He is very big and fun to think about

176
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:45,260
A certain Herman Munster as quality

177
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,060
Herman Munster is a beefcake. Yeah, Jerry O'Connell. Yeah

178
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,020
Jerry O'Connell seems fun. He does doesn't he?

179
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,940
Do they sound like he'd be fun and I tweeted him about my secret identity and he was like

180
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:07,540
You're a second person's asked me about that today and I was like you want to be my best friend or what's up?

181
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:12,100
It's nothing nothing so far like I just feel like he's nervous. He doesn't know how to respond

182
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:17,580
He doesn't want to embarrass himself. That is a treacherous balloon to float in the year of our Lord 2022

183
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,140
It is true, right? This person seems like a good

184
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,820
Yeah, anything anybody?

185
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,540
Good period um you another question. I

186
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Have

187
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:36,300
This is a great great opening to a question this I know everything about this person

188
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,660
I think I bet I could guess their social security number best on this first question. I have a fedora

189
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:48,100
It's actually a trilby, but who cares I think that's a I think that's a haiku. I'm pretty sure that's I have a fedora

190
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,860
It's actually a trilby, but who cares

191
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,300
We're just very close though silent

192
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:57,860
Yeah

193
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:05,580
It has been with me for 12 years even survived being stolen by a hurricane in 2012 and washed up in parking lot

194
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,180
What it's a state it's it wait

195
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,180
bounded yeah

196
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:17,400
Okay, it's a survivor from a bygone age ain't that the true. Oh, yeah, should I get rid of my hat?

197
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:23,180
I'm moving so it might be time. Yeah, here's a photo for the slack

198
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,420
Trilling for trilby in Los Angeles I

199
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
Don't know you that well. Oh

200
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,920
Oh really because you said earlier you could like give their social security number Justin so what I read I read you're right Travis

201
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,780
I'm I I don't know you for a very long time. There you go. Is that better? Yeah

202
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,880
Grammatically no, but conceptually yes, I feel like

203
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:54,440
From what I can read in this question. I feel like you and the hat have become inseparable at this point

204
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,240
Oh, yeah, I feel like the hat wrote the question

205
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,880
I mean really I mean at this point literally the hat was taken from you by an act of God and made its way back

206
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,920
To you. Yeah, God tried to take the the hat and and couldn't do it

207
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,800
Who are you to just casually toss it in the dumpster?

208
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,920
I will also say this no matter what the item is whether it be clothing or decoration or whatever

209
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
after 12 years

210
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,420
You then I don't think you have to justify to anyone

211
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,860
Why you have it because there's someone's like why you have that him?

212
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,740
Like I've had it for like a long time

213
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:34,500
I had it for 12 years right like that's just like oh at this point it's become part of your yeah your routine

214
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,740
That that hat exists. You've long passed that like

215
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,060
Awkward liminal space where you've had the hat for like five years

216
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:49,060
And so some people associate you with the hat but not everyone so you can get rid of it a 12-year hat my god

217
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:55,860
Yeah, the memories that's the the the juices you've imbued in this thing is it you can't

218
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,300
I don't think you can get rid of it now. Don't get me wrong

219
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,220
Aesthetically, I don't think many people unless you are Bob Hoskins in Who Framed Roger Rabbit

220
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,620
I don't think you can pull off this particular hat. It seems like a very sort of specific sees

221
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:18,460
That's your pole and not Indiana Jones, huh? Indiana Jones's hat didn't it was not quite as decorative as this

222
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,940
This was very straightforward more of a wide brim. This is a trilby not a fedora after all

223
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,860
Yeah, I do you look good in it hmm. Oh

224
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:34,500
That would have been a better image to send a hey. Yes, I will say this. I'm gonna read between the line

225
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
I'm gonna infer for a moment here. I

226
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,460
I would pose this as a potential backstories boys that they bought this hat and

227
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,160
They put it on they're like, I don't know and then someone gave him a hard time about it

228
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,240
So they doubled down on the hat and like no, I love this hat, right?

229
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,060
And then hurricane took it and they're like, oh, I'm free. I'm free from the hat

230
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,100
Well, it came back shit mask and now yes

231
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:01,500
This is a mask situation because moving is not a time or just like I have to get rid of this hat that takes up

232
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Let's be honest and not that much space

233
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,340
Right, so if they're asking about if they should get rid of it or not

234
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,580
I think they're looking for us to say yes, so they're like I had to get rid of it

235
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:17,220
I was a man always told me to yeah, I want to go back to Griffin's question

236
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,020
I and and say that I really hope this person thinks they look good in the house

237
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:27,500
Yeah, because the idea that you would do sort of like a self-shaming

238
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:34,420
You you know self-flagellation aesthetic flagellation. Yeah by wearing a hat you think looks bad for 12 years

239
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,460
Yeah is actually too sad for me to

240
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,380
To think on I I hope that's not unless the problem is you found yourself to be too beautiful

241
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,460
Sands hat and you got sick of all of the attention

242
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:51,340
I see people just flinging themselves at you offering you modeling deals left and right and you're like I gotta do something

243
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:58,420
They got horns off of there. Yeah, real horns like as a Brock. That would be a good look though. Is that what you're saying?

244
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:06,340
Yeah, I mean I guess so people want to fuck Darth Maul every day people do want to be fucking Darth Maul

245
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:11,280
I've noticed that it's I don't know when this thing started. He's a bad man who did hurt Qui-Gon Jinn

246
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:18,140
I well, I sure hope you like this hat cuz if not, this has been a terrible waste of our time

247
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:24,300
It's like thank you. Yeah, that was my next thought was that if you're not actually torn up about this and instead

248
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,020
You came to us with this very specific heat of I'm a hat owner

249
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,380
Man alive that's gonna really p.m. You know

250
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,740
Yeah, you could

251
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:45,220
Find some sort of acrylic box to put it in on a mantle and be like, that's the hat that God couldn't kill, right?

252
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,900
Yeah, or you could and then you can like screw in a little plaque on it

253
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,780
It says this is Bob Hoskins is his real ass hat from who frame Roger Rabbit

254
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,140
Oh, you know what? We need to start doing

255
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,660
I think that people at home should adopt what they do at like sporting arenas when a player retires

256
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,340
When there's a shirt where you're like, I love this shirt. It doesn't match my style anymore or whatever

257
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,700
We should raise it up into the rafters of your house, right? It's just like now it's on the ceiling. Oh, that's good

258
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:15,860
That's really good. Travis. Can I hit you with another idea? That is that I leapfrogged off that idea to get sure and I'm

259
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,420
Really happy about it. Get really into hockey

260
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:24,300
And then wait for a player on the team that you like to score three goals in a single game

261
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,500
And I goodbye fedora that well that one's going right out to celebrate the hat trick

262
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,340
And then they fly that fedora up into the rafters of the hockey area

263
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:38,220
No, you throw that fedora out and I think some teams they like put all the hats in a bucket

264
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,420
And then as you walk out of the venue, you can maybe try and grab your hat back

265
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,100
But I know what's gonna grab this busted

266
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,100
That can't be

267
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,580
You're gonna have to voluntarily leave it behind. Is that my trilby now? Someone else must have thrown that trilby

268
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,060
I don't know. I saw you throw it. I know you thought no, I wasn't

269
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,540
That wasn't mine. My trilby definitely looked way cooler than this drill

270
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,580
Do you see who frame Roger Abbott mine looked like that looked exactly it actually was that one

271
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:12,140
I stole it from the studio lot. I have an acrylic box for a while, but then I threw it

272
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,740
I mean fuck I know I didn't throw it. I'm I still at home in the box. Leave me alone

273
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,460
I'm going to Arby's

274
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:28,180
Hey, listen speaking of going to Arby's it would be great if you could support us in the max fun drive so that we can go

275
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:36,100
Get more Arby's. Yeah, your max fun membership pays to support the shows that you like on the network

276
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,740
This I feel like this past year we have

277
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:47,940
We have upped our game pretty dramatically. We started doing adventure zone weekly again, which has been a fucking lot of work

278
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,460
But we have enjoyed making the show, but we've had

279
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,880
Yeah, Justin and I are coasting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you guys are right

280
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:03,700
We've we've hired some more people to help we've hired a full-time editor for the first time

281
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,100
in in the history of our shows we talk about how the

282
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,700
Donations are essential to make the shows happen like we have missed a lot fewer episodes

283
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,460
Yeah of show

284
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:20,820
Since we have people who are helping us to make sure that they get since we hired bosses. Yeah

285
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:28,820
We hire bosses to tell us to do podcasts even if we don't want to or if our feet hurt and we're sad

286
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:34,060
And I mean not just that, you know, we wait our feet hurt. It's just not a big rock

287
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:41,200
Yeah, parking lot. I can't record my feet hurt. Tell me we have not canceled episodes for for less

288
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,660
That's true, sometimes it's like I don't know I meant to eat a sandwich and I ate

289
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,100
Half a sandwich and yeah, I can't do it today boys

290
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:57,140
And I mean there's also the very kind of bigger side of it of like this is our jobs

291
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,500
I mean the stuff what we make we

292
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:06,460
Make this a priority. It's important for us to do this and we know how much it means to people and this is the time

293
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:11,220
Of year where it means everything. It means I'm not gonna it means everything. I don't want to say that but yeah

294
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,660
Okay. Wow, what's again a rapid energy shift from Justin? What are the gifts?

295
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,860
Like what do you get like I don't want to do this for free besides like feeling good and like yeah, that's stew

296

Huh huge access huge access to over 350 hours of bonus content. I'm huge access

299
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:53,220
I want to say the amount of content just from us from our mini shows is like

300
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,980
Outrageous at this point. I cannot remember it all

301
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,700
But it's there's some really good shit in there

302
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,600
For $10 a month, you'll become a friend of the family

303
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:09,500
We have 35 embroidered patches for you to choose from for all of the different shows

You get the bonus content to you get a letterpress max fun membership card

305
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:21,340
But we teamed up with max fun fan Merritt Bondarou from frog and toad press who designed a bunch of very very cool

306
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:26,560
Patches that you can put on any kind of surface that you want that I mean, we'll work on patches

307
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,620
You can't put it on like steel. I bet I mean

308
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:34,660
There's glue. They're beautiful two-inch round patches with very very

309
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,420
Cute designs for all the shows and you're gonna look cool and get lots of cool comments for your great patch

310
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,380
and

311
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,940
Then at 20 bucks a month you get the diamond friendship circle

312
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:50,540
It's got the patches and the membership card in the bonus content and then you can choose your $20 a month gift

313
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:58,140
Between the max fun creativity pack or the rocket hat. The creativity pack is was designed by artist and max funster

314
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,900
Ellen van der meid and it's a deck of

315
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:07,260
54 cards in an inspiration deck and each one has an activity suggestion from your favorite hosts

316
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:13,140
It's got a set of some postcards

317
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:18,660
It's got some non hardening colorful modeling clay. It's got a custom blackwing pencil

318
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,140
And all of that can just help you make cool stuff

319
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:28,940
And if you don't want that you just opt for the max fun drive rocket logo hat instead. It's embroidered. It's eco-friendly

320
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,980
It's adjustable and it's gonna keep you cool and shaded while you listen to podcasts out in nature

321
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:40,140
There's other rewards to you. We'll talk about those more later, but I also would encourage you if you're already a max fun member

322
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:46,340
And you have been for a while. Maybe this is the time to consider upgrading your membership to a higher support level

323
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,540
Maybe you've been listening to more max fun shows

324
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:54,940
Maybe let's say your favorite actual play podcast started doing every week instead of just once a week and you're like, hey

325
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,100
That's why I'm even your second or third

326
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:05,380
Maybe and the actual play podcast that you have heard of started doing every week instead of just once a week or once

327
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,380
Every week instead of once. Okay

328
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:13,260
You stick with me, you know what? I mean? This is a great time. You can upgrade that to maximum fun org slash join

329
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,620
And I want to say one more thing because I think it's always important to mention

330
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:21,380
We know that not everybody is able to do a monthly support level and we totally get that

331
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:26,980
You know, we're we're asking you to consider if you can but there's other ways you can help you can help share the link

332
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,720
Maximum fun org slash join you could talk about why?

333
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,020
Max fun means a lot to you

334
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,860
Make sure everyone knows the max fun drive is going on all of that stuff is great

335
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:42,260
And if you're already a supporter you could talk about how great it is all the the bonus content

336
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,660
How how it feels to support the art and artists you love all of that stuff helping get the word out

337
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,020
Means a lot to us as well

338
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,660
just go to maximum fun org first last join and just

339
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,380
Do the right thing. We have a goal this year of two new and upgrading members

340
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:04,340
And so we're really hoping you can have us a 50% of that could be you so

341
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,660
We're gonna rock it past that goal within the first week

342
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:16,100
Well, I missed a zero it's 20 20 no, wait, I'm sorry and then there were three more zeros after that

343
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:23,380
Oh, I don't I don't count zeros. They're not real numbers. Yeah, it's just a demarcation between positive and negative value

344
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,100
Yeah, it's not actually

345
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,100
worth talking about

346
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:33,020
Maximum fund our success joint. I just yeah, but I wanted it to be I wanted it to be the last thing that we said

347
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,140
In this break, so now I have to say it again maximum fun org slash join

348
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:44,780
Hit it you want it there. Yeah. Do you want to hey, should we say hi to the wizard and just approach them quiet? Yeah, don't

349
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,020
Don't like jump out and

350
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,220
Thank you

351
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,180
this

352
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,860
Smart yeah, yeah

353
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:01,120
Gross, it's not gross. It's beautiful. You calm me down. You relaxed me. It's gross to give your brother

354
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,320
as there are a nice head gift from me Justin McElroy

355
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,480
ASMR I wouldn't say that you gave me tingles

356
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,360
I got tinky-winkies, but it's fine

357
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,320
And of course they originated from my nipples as all as they do

358
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,720
That's the that's what Travis calls the epicenter

359
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:32,160
Yeah, it goes then down under the armpit swirls around in there for a while then up the skull down into the nostril out

360
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:37,640
Of the mouth and down to the taint comes close to the taint, but then it swerves back the last thing

361
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,080
Anymore oh, yeah, what's wrong? Lots of people sent this one and thank you

362
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,480
We're comfortable talking about our bodies with each other. I'm field

363
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,640
I'm actually comfortable with the amount of comfort that we have about that particular subject

364
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,760
This is how to be okay at your first attention. I

365
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,840
I love that. I wish I would love an article. That was just how to be okay in general

366
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,440
Yeah, I think we could all use that wiki how article you never got

367
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,000
There's also lots of first things that I've done in my life that I wish I could go back and be okay at the first

368
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,480
Yeah, I don't need to name them, but you could probably fill in a lot of the blanks

369
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,840
You've never gotten a detention before right?

370
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,120
But today you just happen to lie about getting an A on an assignment that you never did and your teacher finds out oops

371
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,960
That's terrible. But today it won't be what what what kind of lie is that?

372
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,480
Also, why would your teacher care? Yeah enough to give you detention. I got an A on the math test

373
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,160
You were absent during the math test. You have detention now. That's not really a punishable

374
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,940
Thing. Yeah. Have you all ever had detention? Did you all ever get detention? Yeah me. Yeah

375
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,520
I got

376
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:50,320
Yeah, one time I got it one time me and Eric Stokes were cutting up in the library cutting up books damn

377
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
You must have been cutting up real hard

378
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,120
Yeah, it was pretty intense cutting up. I can't remember what I did, but I did

379
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:04,040
Justin do you remember the guy? I think was at our middle school Griffin to who on in spirit week always wore the Star Trek uniform

380
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,360
Yes, holy shit. Yeah, how's your memory that good Trav?

381
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,260
Oh, I don't remember his name Griffin, but I remember the guy who wore the Star Trek uniform at least once

382
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:21,720
Yeah, man, he is cordially invited to our podcast. Whatever whenever you want host into the zoom call. I was in

383
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,340
His room for detention once it was like an all-day thing

384
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:30,940
Which was also weird and I just remember I'd finished my work like two hours in and I had some comic books on my backpack

385
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,520
So I was a real cool dude and I was like I finished my work

386
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,600
Can I just sit here and read comic books and he was like, yeah

387
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,700
And it was not that bad all things considered everybody

388
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
detention kind of ruled

389
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,680
I'm I'm really glad to hear that mine was uneventful

390
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,320
It was in the art room and I got it because I accidentally

391
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,760
Knocked a table over and it hit Ashley filling her in the leg

392
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,040
I got they did not like that

393
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,360
her mom was a teacher and so I feel like there was like a little bit a little bit of like

394
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,600
I don't get she didn't get hurt or anything and it was an accident and then she wrote on the pink slip

395
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,860
In an attempt to try and be cute Griffin flipped a table over it

396
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,040
Is that fair like give me the detention but you don't have no I'm asking you now

397
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,040
Is that were you trying to be cute?

398
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,860
I was I was goofing but I wasn't like this will be cute. I'll hurt this girl's leg

399
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,540
Yeah, like that's not my sort of vibe. Anyway, you have anything you want to say Ashley?

400
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,960
I'm really sorry Ashley like I I didn't even hit you that hard

401
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:37,600
and it and it was an accident and you did forgive me right away and you actually felt bad that I got detention which was

402
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,920
That should matter that should count for something

403
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,680
There should be she wasn't person. She wasn't pressing there should be an option for that right?

404
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:54,360
Oh, I remember once my friend hunter went to sit down in a chair and because of ADHD and impulse control

405
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,920
I pulled the chair moved it and he fell on his butt and he literally said why did you do that?

406
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,920
I said hunter. I have no idea. I'm so sorry

407
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,440
Like what happened over there and honor was like nothing. Don't worry about it. It was fine. So solid hunter

408
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,440
It was a solid move hunter

409
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,520
Okay, so step one get the detention your teachers just talked to you and you are crying. This is bad

410
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,720
This is bad

411
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,080
Especially if it is at the beginning of the day because then you'll just have the worst day ever

412
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,880
You need to take a breath and dry your eyes

413
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:26,520
This time is about you ask if you may go to the restroom if you need a few minutes to yourself

414
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,640
That is so strong if you have a full fucking

415
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,480
Breakdown and you're like may I be excused to collect my thoughts for this heinous punishment that you have laid at my feet

416
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,880
Now I'm sorry

417
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,400
I could make the argument that it'd be way worse to get right at the end of the day when you think like oh

418
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,920
Only five minutes left and then I get to go home and play all the banjo-kazooie

419
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:51,200
I want and then the teachers like you have to stay an extra like hour and a half or whatever and you're like what?

420
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,640
To have the run if you have all day

421
00:34:53,640 --> 00:35:00,960
To get used to the idea and cancel your plans mentally. I don't write banjo and kazooie are waiting for me

422
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:07,880
Yeah, I have made commitments that I intend to keep teacher. You don't understand. They are they only get to live while I play the game

423
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,840
If a friend or acquaintance even an enemy asks what is wrong

424
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,240
Do not tell them the whole world does not need to know what just happened

425
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,280
That is your information for you to know and for them not to find out

426
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,640
Hey, I heard you flipped a table over on Ashley fillinger. I don't know

427
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,800
anything

428
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,520
Anything about that actually that does not sound like anything I would do does it you must have a response?

429
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,520
Oh, is that what's going around? Oh?

430
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,840
Interesting. I never thought that you would be one to fall prey to rumors and

431
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,760
Are you Fleetwood Mac because you're making a lot of rumors try to talk to the teacher

432
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,560
Don't make excuses and don't try saying you didn't do it because they might think you are lying

433
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,520
Just explain what happened and tell them that you're sorry

434
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,800
Let them know even if you don't truly that you understand why you're in trouble

435
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,800
Tell them and be true to your word that you will not let it happen again. I mean

436
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,400
You I've never known a teacher. That's like okay

437
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,840
Undetention no detention. I mean if you sold it hard enough

438
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,640
But also I like how a wiki had just slipped in there in the middle even if you feel nothing inside

439
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:16,020
Apologize anyway, even even if you don't understand why you got yeah, I won't do it again, or I will do it again

440
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,760
Which one is the is it? I'll do it the same amount

441
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,760
I just remembered that I this is not a particularly fun memory

442
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,240
But I got the tension on the last day of high school. I attended

443
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
Because they had started to crack down

444
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:39,840
Like really really really hard on being late for first period because apparently it was just like an epidemic

445
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,040
so they had like a zero tolerance policy that they

446
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,320
started doing this this one day and

447
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,080
The last day of school mom was no no no my last day of I didn't attend

448
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,560
The last like month of my senior year of high school

449
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,040
Because mom was in the hospital and I had stayed overnight

450
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:03,460
And so at the Alex that my friend who picked me up from school or picked me up and drove me to school

451
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,160
We were like coming in late and somebody was like, hey, I'm sorry

452
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,760
You got detention now and I looked at them with this look of like, oh, but oh man, you're gonna feel

453
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,240
Pretty bad about this later

454
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,800
I didn't say anything and the detention was I had to like clean up the lunch tables and like wipe them up

455
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,940
and so like I dutifully attended my

456
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:33,400
My table wiping at lunchtime and then the like vice principal of the school like came up was like you don't you can stop

457
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,680
You don't have to do that

458
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:40,160
And then I and then I called you Justin and you came to pick me up and I never went back to school

459
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,200
When you get home, especially if your teachers contacted your parent

460
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,040
They might be ticked off to say the least

461
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,720
Start start and this seems like bad advice by asking them how many detentions them and their spouse have ever gotten

462
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:05,480
Oh, wow, that's so good. Yeah, I flipped a table over on Ashley fillinger

463
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:12,160
What about what about you father and and what about you mother or father's spouse?

464
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,760
Tell me a mother and or father's spouse

465
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,600
Let them know Einstein even got in trouble every every night then

466
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,640
Table over on lots of other innocent students on Ashley phones your senior

467
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:30,640
If they won't quit interrupting you tell them respectfully, please let me explain I understand I made a mistake

468
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,640
Could you please let me explain what happened?

469
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,760
Step three. Yeah, step three. Keep your grades up. What step? Oh, yes

470
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,360
Codex 5a do remember to keep your grades up

471
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,960
Step six when explaining don't cry talking your big boy. Slash girl voice. Are they both ready to explain?

472
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,660
How the full story even the mistakes dad dad spouse. It's your mom. Just hey mom

473
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:02,480
Dad dead spells. No, I do want to say where the fuck do you two get off?

474
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,800
Did you flip?

475
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,560
First tell me of your sins

476
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah, you have to ask your parents to speak on their sins when you're not in trouble

477
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,200
Yeah, that's so essential them to admit to stuff that you can then store away and uses ammunition late

478
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,800
I hope my kids try to drop that on me

479
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,560
So I can inform them that the whole point is to try to make humans that don't fuck up as much as yeah, right?

480
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,480
That's humanity. It's just like incrementally fucking up

481
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:37,840
Let's see the problem for I would say all of us is that our children have I would say hundreds of hours of examples of us

482
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:42,320
Fucking up very yeah, right. They're gonna be like, let me go to YouTube. Give me one second

483
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,360
I'll find audio evidence of you doing this exact thing. Oh, what's that?

484
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,160
You're mad at me for flipping a table on to Ashley fit into the third one moment

485
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,080
Be respectful while you're in detention

486
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,280
If you're not that's a good way to get another detention and get grounded because it takes two

487
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,280
To get grounded it takes it takes two detentions to get grounded in pretty much your household

488
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,160
I think we can all agree with that. That's standard. Anything else is a violation the Geneva Convention. Absolutely

489
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:16,120
Um, that's it. That's it. I think that's a good thing. I had you don't want to break down at your first detention

490
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:22,600
because it's a sign of weakness and then they'll just want to keep giving you detention because they get off on whatever small amount of

491
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,380
Power that they can hold over over use you developing people, you know

492
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:31,280
What if you what would you guys think about if they were like you have detention and you were like awesome

493
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,360
Thank you, not since you're not a sarcastic way sincerely like oh, thank you guys. Thank you so much

494
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:41,800

495
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,800
You don't get more detention. Like I love it

496
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,440

This is busting makes me buy stuff and it's a segment that is not unlike haunted doll watch except it is the tools that you

521
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,140
These goggles well

522
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,860
These are their original and official copyright protected and trademarked brands established in

523
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:19,800
2004 the synthetic photo thermal dye used for highlighting auras, which is inspired by

524
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,380
Dicyanin dye is exclusive only to aura glasses and our goggles

525
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,920
Everyone is able to see auras naturally. Yeah, we know yes

526
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:37,000
But it can take a long time and effort to be able to do that the aura glasses enable anyone to see auras

527
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,400
Instantly, okay as well as looking at the human aura people use them for ghost hunting

528
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:49,980
Reiki scanning seeing orders in the environment such as animals and trees. That'd be this would be it might be great for hunting

529
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:56,160
That's my own editorialization, but it would be so nice to see a deer like I see you fuck

530
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,280
Oh, I mean, let's be a predator can see auras, right? That's

531
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,640
Predator sees the aura at a certain point. I'm seeing the auras of everything though

532
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:11,560
That might be is there a way to like filter to if I just want to see a squirrel aura or a bird aura

533
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,720
Or am I just seeing all auras all the time. They come with a neat

534
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,780
Official protective pouch cool. This is this is nice. I hear you guys got a lot of questions

535
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,760
Do you see the individual colors in auras through the aura glasses?

536
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:32,800
And now these glasses are designed to highlight the basic and this is in all caps shape

537
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:41,160
Okay, surrounding the edge of the physical body up to a few inches and presented as an electric blue color through the lens

538
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:46,080
Oh, I see. Okay, so you can't tell how angry or horny or tired

539
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:50,280
You know only through usual means right? I'm

540
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:56,560
Asking the aura glasses and you always see this on every product

541
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,440
but so you can tell that it's really

542
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,440
Effective here. The aura glasses are an honest product and they are not a scam

543
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:15,480
That's important to know or anything malicious and I personally am a spiritual person who does this for the passion and enthusiasm

544
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,700
So you can find a step-by-step user guide and then they have I mean

545
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:26,280
I will I'm gonna slack you guys the picture of the just so you can see the neat protective pouch

546
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,280
That is really pretty neat

547
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,500
Let me just slack your picture of the neat protective pal. Oh, there's that

548
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,660
That's all you can see all the you can hey

549
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:40,880
Why in that first top part does it look like someone's wearing a giant pair of glasses on their dick?

550
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,660
I don't know Trav, but we don't wait. I do want to I have even better news

551
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:52,760
If you guys will just be quiet for a minute and 20 seconds, this is just a special max fun drive bonus

552
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,780
Here we go

553
00:45:53,780 --> 00:46:01,280
Aura glasses see auras instantly if you want to see auras instantly even without any prior spiritual development

554
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,020
You can do so with aura views aura glasses

555
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:08,620
I've been a paranormal investigator for over 10 years and I'm part of a ghost hunting group

556
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:15,980
We visit lots of places and use all sorts of equipment and the aura glasses are by far our favorite as well as seeing

557
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:22,740
Spirit activity with the aura glasses they can be hooked up to other gear such as we recently mounted one onto our thermal camera

558
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:28,900
During a visit to an old mansion in England and the guys were literally left open-mouthed from what this thing captured

559
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,780
Absolutely incredible and for what they do. They are not at all expensive

560
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,540
Then now okay, let's pause

561
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:39,020
There's a lot this guy is a

562
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:48,420
Member of a ghost hunting group. Yep, and and oh, where did we use them? Oh, yeah, I remember it was some an old

563
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:54,700
Mansion just that it was no it wasn't just that no it was

564
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:02,780
Where ghosts come from like how we use the terminology you can hook them up

565
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:06,860
Which these are a pair of glasses and you put them on a camera you like taped

566
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:11,680
You like tape the glasses over the lens. Is that just held them up?

567
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,820
Yeah, you can connect them, okay, let's let's move on

568
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,940
The aura glasses work by the use of a groundbreaking

569
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:26,140
Synthetic photo thermo chemical compound this unique compound is what helps to instantly highlight

570
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:30,300
Subtle energy fields which otherwise are invisible to the naked eye

571
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:36,380
I do Reiki treatments and the aura glasses are my main tool for diagnosis and healing

572
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:41,020
Couldn't do it without them. Honestly, when you look through them, it opens up a whole new world

573
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,380
They're a quick way to sing auras without the need for years of self-development

574
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:52,940
Now I would like to know with this Reiki practitioner here before you had the org glasses. Yeah, what exactly?

575
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:58,940
I was just guessing just so it's just guessing before these my smell

576
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:02,420
I would have wave a hand and be like anything was that

577
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:06,620
Hey, Justin, wait, wait, wait 12 more seconds

578
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:17,740
The aura glasses are available to buy from official aura glasses calm and online marketplaces

579
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,500
Okay

580
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,200
I can't just say that I do not like that they invoked

581
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,780
Seeing like a whole new world or whatever it is because then it reminds me too much of that episode of are you afraid of?

582
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:33,900
The dark where they got some glasses from Sardos and then they could see yes za do

583
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:40,180
Accent on the dough. No, mr. Accent on the dough sent on the dough. They could see what look

584
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:46,780
Just watch this fucking episode. No, cuz I just watched it a week. Okay, cuz Cooper's like obsessed

585
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:52,140
Oh, I I just have that in my head all the time. Oh, and then you heat

586
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:56,300
You could see them and it was like a whole universe coming through to ours. I don't want that power

587
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:01,360
No, I think that was the curse of the secret the tale of the secrets back. I believe that's true. Yes. Yes

588
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,920
That one had a horrifying in the other way go back to Paramount Plus and go watch that bad boy

589
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:13,220
Fucked me. I'm good that one real real unnerving ball. What there's some of those that are like

590
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:17,500
They'll leave some leave some some fear inside of you. Yeah

591
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:25,860
Brutal it's brutal. So there's the aura glasses now now now now now now what would you pay? What would you pay?

592
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:30,960
Now what would you you're gonna see fucking those dude?

593
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,820
I'm gonna say only when I have them on I need prescription glasses unless these aura glasses come in prescription

594
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:42,020
I know you don't you wouldn't you would pay $20 because to you they're just sunglasses or perhaps in this case fun glasses

595
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:49,100
You don't think anything is really gonna happen with yeah, I'm asking griffin. Yeah that this seller by the way 99% positive feedback 1200

596
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,900
Transactions, so these things work a hundred percent. No, I'm not

597
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:59,780
I'm not saying this for the joke. I genuinely think that they cost $69 and 99 cents

598
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:06,060
Okay. Wow a huge range here. No, you are going to pay

599
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:14,800
A 39 99 pounds which is about 52 bucks and 17 cents, so

600
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:21,780
Huh a seal from griffin's point of view a ripoff from Travis's isn't that?

601
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:29,040
Well beauty is in the eye of the beholder or something if I could just I don't want to move on without

602
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,540
mentioning that there is a hundred percent a

603
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:38,300
If if these images if this this glasses that that price is a little

604
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,580
much for you to

605
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,580

It's 3d at Disney World

612
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:20,020
But rather like the paper ones that you might have gotten in the 90s to watch like an episode of Simpsons in 3d

613
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:24,300
These were delivered in a TV guide exactly. That's what we're looking at here

And the great thing is with these card bake these card or glasses. These are only $30

00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:34,240
Yeah, it's like a huge and

616
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:39,140
Without any context whatsoever. They're at the bottom of the picture five stars

617
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:47,020
There's just a picture of just five stars on no idea what that's from or out of or

618
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:53,340
Referencing but hey five stars. Yeah, and what's the price on these? Does it say these are 30 bucks?

619
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:58,580

00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,420

Fuck the goggles looks so good. That's a look dude. That's what I gotta get

I gotta get the aura goggles right like absolutely overnight them so we can wear them on tour

Do they have overnight delivery for maybe for June I can I can get them here in time. Sorry. They're coming over from

630
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:42,860
They're coming over from British, so they would take a while to get across the ocean

631
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:47,280
It's good too because that also works for what 13th doctor cosplay

632
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,500
Which is nice?

633
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:56,640
You can use oh, this is good because you can use the aura goggles for 13 you use the aura glasses economy model for 10

634
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:00,100

00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:04,440
You're covered in a three out of the what five modern-day doctors

637
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,860
five stars seagull

638
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,620
This is of course

639
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:23,460
You know us. We are we have proven in the last 30 seconds that we make great use of our money

640
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,960
We are responsible

641
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,700
People to give your money to because we're not gonna buy

00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,460

00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,300
Ghost-hunting goggles, and you can trust us

644
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:41,340
We're trustworthy well, and we deserve it. I'll just say we deserve five dollars a month

645
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,780
Okay, if that comes from you or somebody else

646
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:48,460
I don't care, but I do need my five dollars a month

647
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,540
And I'm sitting here in my studio with my hand literally extended

648
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:56,620
Open money, please

649
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:01,080
Um that's not part of the max one drive out by the way. That's just Justin

650
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:06,860
It does say to speak from the heart, and so I feel like that is what Justin has just done

651
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,100
No, I mean it. It means it means the world

652
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:17,780
We've been able to do this for most of our adult lives now at this point and that is a not like in in like

653
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:24,580
Most of the rest of our adult lives. You know what I mean like I fully plan on kicking it at least 12 more years

654
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:29,860
Can I speak from the heart for a moment? Yeah sure cuz me and Justin doing a real dog shit job of it

655
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:35,700
One of the things I've missed most over the last two years is going to live shows and going to conventions

656
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:39,840
Because sometimes when we are doing these shows it's easy to sit at our computers

657
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:45,700
we record in three different places even and feel very disconnected from the people that we were making these shows for and

658
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:50,540
Doing the live shows and having the people there in the audience and sharing that moment

659
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:56,860
We're doing like conventions where we get to do like meet and greets and stuff is a moment where we get to feel

660
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,260
you know connected to the people we're making the show for and

661
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,380
We haven't been able to do that

662
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:07,420
But we have still done the max fun drives and it's always such a great reminder

663
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:11,740
Once a year that we're not just like putting these things out into the void

664
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,700
And that you know

665
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:20,460
We get to make these for people who appreciate them and that we get to kind of share that connection with people and so

666
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:25,820
I always get really excited around the max fun drive time because it's very energizing for us

667
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:33,720
And it's it's just always nice to be reminded that the things we make matter to people and I really appreciate it. Yeah

668
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:38,180
Yeah, absolutely. Listen five bucks a month. You get all the bonus content

669
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:42,380
You know about that ten bucks a month you get the bonus content you get the membership card

670
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,120
You get a cool patch all our patches look really great

671
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:52,640
$20 a month you pick the creativity kit you pick the hat you get all the other stuff. It's it's uh, it's a sweet

672
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,960
I would say set of stuff. They've got planned for the

673
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:03,880
Max fun drive gifts this year and we have a bunch of other sweet stuff planned to a lot of stretch goal

674
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:08,760
content that we have either created or are about to create and

675
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:14,880
One of them is actually so rotten that I don't want it to happen

676
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:20,760
So like yes, don't hit the goal. There will be a part of me. That's like whoo. Thank goodness for that

677
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,960
I'm also I just say I'm especially excited

678
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,640

Quarterly virtual hang time with max fun hosts and staff and actually tonight as we're recording this

Teresa and I are doing one where Teresa will be showing people

683
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,880
different napkin folding techniques

684
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,680
My gosh, it's and I've seen her do them

685
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:57,920
They're all really cool while I like I'm going to be moderating with questions and stuff and I'm really excited about it

686
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:03,440
It sounds super fun. And we're excited to show people that stuff and like talk with people. It's really a great idea

687
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,120
a

688
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,500
Maximum fun org slash join is the link to go to please

00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:16,280
Please think about joining and helping us out. Maybe you've been listening to our shows for you know, since their inception

690
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:20,800
But you've always thought I asked somebody else. So somebody else will support them be the chain

691
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,620
They need to be the be the support for us

692
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,200
Please. Thank you

693
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,200
Maximum fun org Ford said

694
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:36,020
Yeah, but I wanted to end and like do it while people are thinking about it, you know what I mean? Yeah, exactly maximum

695
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,640
I've been learning to drive for the past year making slow but steady progress

696
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:45,680
Something I found I've been doing is watching how people drive when I'm walking along a road

697
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,360
Looking at how they handle roundabouts awkward junctions, etc

698
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:54,200
However, a couple of times I've been caught staring at these cars as if I'm glaring at the drivers brothers

699
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,320
How do I communicate? I'm just watching and learning not trying to give them a death glare

700
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:05,040
That's from slow, but sure in Southampton. I mean, this is easy double thumbs. Oh, yeah, that is good. Great work out there

701
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:10,160
Dumber thumbs up you're driving. Yeah, this is like we need a great job horn, but

702
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:16,720
For pedestrians. I actually cars how good they're doing at driving if I were the driver

703
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,600
I would rather see that from someone on the sidewalk than someone

704
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:26,120
Like in another car next to me because that's the thing. I also do this as a driver where sometimes

705
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:32,840
Oh you I you know get hyper focused or zone out or something and I'm looking at someone and then I forget like that

706
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:38,160
I'm not just looking into a void or a television and that's another human being and then they turn and look at me and we

707
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:43,280
Make eye contact for a minute and if they like parts and open their door and said why are you looking at me?

708
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,280
I would have no answer to that

709
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,360
And so I'd rather look over to the side of the road and just see someone give me a big thumbs up

710
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,720
Make my day if a pedestrian tells you you're doing a great job

711
00:58:53,720 --> 00:59:00,880
Mm-hmm driving that's got to be one of the greatest compliments you can receive because when you're in another car and

712
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:05,320
You see someone in a car. You're like doing a good job driving. It's like well, yeah

713
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,540
Because if I make an accident and smash into you

714
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:16,280
The airbags and everything like well, we'll be alright, but a pedestrian is like my life is in your hands right now

715
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,560
Mmm, because the opposite is definitely true

716
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:26,840
There's a lady in my neighborhood who I often pass and the look that she gives me is the most wither and at first

717
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:30,680
I thought it was just me but my friends who have like come over people I've talked to you like

718
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:38,160
Oh, yeah, that woman hates people in cars is the only thing we can determine and so I have drastically oh when I see her I

719
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:43,600
Become the most textbook like one mile under the speed limit

720
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:49,640
Like driver I can possibly be and yet still that with it. Well, it's not just her permanent face

721
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:53,560
Her face changes when she sees me in the car. I don't know what I can do

722
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:59,920
So you're saying that when she is not present and you're residential neighborhood

723
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,000
You absolutely rip shit down the lane

724
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:05,640
I'm just saying 20 20 miles an hour. That's

725
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:10,400
Is a joke. It feels like a fucking joke when I do that like

726
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,780
Anyone behind me is like he's not really doing 20

727
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:17,140
I mean like I know I know what the science is, but he's not doing 20, right?

728
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:21,860
We can do 25 and it's right like what's the fucking difference in a school zone?

729
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,860
I get it because their young brains

730
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:30,800
Aren't developed enough to know like I should not step in front of the big the big steel beast

731
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:36,940
Right that is that is car and I watch for children if I see that ball roll in the middle of the street

732
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:42,340
I stop it. I get it. I know what I swerve if I see a ball roll into the street two blocks away

733
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:48,220
I swerve into a tree. I say not not even gonna fuck around with ya. No way

734
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:51,220
I see a pinwheel like catching the breeze and but I know I

735
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:55,920
Get out and punch my own car in the front like the Hulk to save that kid

736
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,940
I see one of those signs that said that's like slow. There's children here

737
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:02,420
I will turn around and I will drive in the other

738
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:07,860
I'll sell my car just so that there's no risk if I know there's kids not in vehicles

739
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:10,300
Yeah within eyesight of me

740
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:14,020
I will stop the car park it get out and walk the rest of the way sometimes

741
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:19,820
I'll just 10 20 miles without a car just in case because I heard a child's laughter once in that city

742
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:24,940
Yeah, I mean just got to but in a residential area fucking

743
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,680
I'm gonna tear that shit up dog

744
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,180
Yeah, dude

745
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:32,260
The best is if you can get that swirl of leaves or a big splash of puddle and it's just like I'm doing it

746
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,460

755
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:20,600
Hi, I'm Justin McElroy from podcasts. You may remember me from podcasts huge important you slow drive around kids. Thanks

756
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:27,260
What's that you they told me this video had to be 15 minutes. So now I'm gonna show you how to

757
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:32,620
I got a bunch of nectarines here. I'm gonna squish them and you imagine that's your head in a fucking car

758
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:36,540
You did but I am gonna eat one of these because I did skip breakfast on my way here

759
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:41,060
Now this video is gonna start with the 10-minute me unwrapping and eating a nectarine

760
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:44,500
But you imagine that's a like head blood from a car accident

761
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:50,340
I'm gonna be a brick wall. Oh this neck green is you my hand is the car. I guess in this scenario

762
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:54,140
I'm joined by professional footballer Willie refrigerator Perry

763
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,260
He's gonna run into me at 35 miles an hour to show you

764
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:01,860
Something about cars and impact and when I'm okay

765
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:05,980
And the next readings if you were eating a smaller person at the time of the impact, okay?

766
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:08,780
Here we go. I'm gonna make fridge Perry step on one of these nectarines

767
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:11,580
You imagine that's your head cuz you were trying to Doug you while driving

768
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:17,340
Okay, here we go. Wait, where are you going fridge? I remember one of those videos where they were like

769
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:23,860
Um it with Rex are so like forceful and terrible

770
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:26,220
That danger lurks all around

771
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:32,100
they said I once came upon a scene where a box of Kleenex in a head-on collision had

772
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:40,400
Rocketed up from where they were being laid on the backseat in the window had rocketed forward and like killed somebody and it's like

773
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:45,980
What do you want me to do with this? I mean step one don't put your Kleenex back there

774
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:52,220
so I can't okay like I took the Kleenex down but like are you really trying to like send me into a spiral of like

775
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:56,340
I don't nobody fucking knows man box of Kleenex. That's not you could go out

776
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:00,420
Final destination movie and be like don't smoke

777
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:08,080
In your car near a sewer pipe on the opposite end of a field where somebody is grilling some chicken

778
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:12,580
Or else it'll explode and the fence will go through you and cut you into a bunch of pieces

779
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:15,540
It's like I've been there all been there

780
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:19,140
Do you guys ever think about final destination and wonder if it okay?

781
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:24,980
Wonder if it was just a PSA on behalf of truck drivers who have logs on the back of their truck

782
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:29,800
And it's just like the whole movie was paid for by those drivers to keep people from tailgating them

783
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:33,260
Yeah, that was I think the biggest result of that movie. Yeah

784
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:33,580
I mean

785
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:39,340
I was already pretty scared of a truck carrying a bunch of logs on a place that logs aren't supposed to be like we destroyed

786
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:44,380
The logs so we could put down a road there right and I don't like that. The logs are kind of coming back

787
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:51,380
Yeah, but yeah that I mean it was an effective sort of marketing tool for the anti log sort of Lobby

788
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:56,180
