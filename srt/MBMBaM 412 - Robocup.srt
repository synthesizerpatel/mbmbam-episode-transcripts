1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,640
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Being Advised Show. For the modern era,

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,680
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,720
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,520
I was thinking about how around Halloween, when I do that hello,

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,840
I might stop before I get to the oh.

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,120
Oh yeah, I'd be like, imagine it's Halloween okay.

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,780
Halloween...

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,520
Yeah, no I'm definitely scared because I'm seeing,

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,440
I'm seeing the hell demons, I'm seeing skeletons and you know, blood volcanoes,

14
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,480
and I'm getting real uh quite spooked and it's June, so how could you do this to me now?

15
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,480
I am literally vibrating with anticipation

16
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,640
because we got ourselves a watch, Jurassic World,

17
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,120
Lost World Kingdom of Dinosaurs coming out.

18
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,360
Who knows when?

19
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,360
That's what makes this watch so exciting.

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,960
I don't even know when the movie comes out.

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,680
We've all seen the posters that just say, Jeff's in it.

22
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,520
Yeah.

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,720
Everybody's so excited about Jeff coming back,

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,200
doing his thing.

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,960
Jeff's in this one, folks.

26
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,600
He's in it, confirmed.

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,400
Yeah, we got a lot of sort of classic stuff in here.

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,160
We got Jeff in it, and he says the great line

29
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,200
about how everything can get all fucked up sometimes,

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,440
and Richard Schiff comes back.

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,680
He gets chomped by another Tyrannosaurus Rex.

32
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,040
Well, he got robotic legs after he was chomped

33
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,360
in half the first time.

34
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,220
Yeah, his top half lived inside the T-Rex for a long time,

35
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,600
but then he got out of the Sarlacc pit like Boba Fett,

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,520
and then they gave him new legs,

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,060
and then he shows up to the park like,

38
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,320
I think I'm really gonna be able to,

39
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,960
and then a pterodactyl comes, picks him up,

40
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,840
drops him in a T-Rex's mouth,

41
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,440
and it's supposed to be funny, I guess, that he dies.

42
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,640
So Jeff wasn't in the first one.

43
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,480
Wasn't in the first Jurassic World.

44
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, it's hard to say

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,780
because there was a lot of jungle in there.

46
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,400
And there was a lot of wide shots.

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,740
He might have been hiding in the forest living his new life.

48
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,480
Jeff wasn't in that one.

49
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,560
Jeff's in two.

50
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,240
Jeff's in Jurassic World.

51
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,760
It done fell back.

52
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,960
But the thing that I found out today,

53
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,640
Jeff is also the tutorial voice in Jurassic World Evolution.

54
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,800
The video game is Dr. Ian Malcolm.

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,300
So he just reignited the passion for the role, I guess,

56
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,920
and is willing to just do it.

57
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,600
Jurassic World brand toilet paper is very good.

58
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,720
Take it from me.

59
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,640
Life finds a way.

60
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,280
And so he's doing a commercial for it.

61
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,920
Hi, I'm popular actor Jeff Goldblum from apartments.com.

62
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,120
If you have to lay an egg,

63
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,280
and then he looks at the camera for a minute straight,

64
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,320
and then that's the end of the commercial.

65
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,760
He says, if you have to lay an egg,

66
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,140
and then he slowly lives up the TP.

67
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,980
Here's the thing.

68
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,080
I think what happened was he did that Thor movie.

69
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,600
He did the Thor movie and he was like,

70
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,800
you know what, I like being in these big movies.

71
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,200
I missed being in the movies.

72
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,160
These apartment.com ads are very good.

73
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,200
And I am making a good amount of money.

74
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,960
Jeff Goldblum plays a character called Brad Bellflower

75
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,160
in the apartments.com ads.

76
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,340
And we were watching one.

77
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,860
This campaign has been ongoing for several years now.

78
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,040
We were watching one and Siddy said,

79
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,200
why does it say his name is Brad?

80
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,480
I said, well, and she said,

81
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,360
I thought he was just playing Jeff Goldblum.

82
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
I said, you thought he was just playing Jeff Goldblum,

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,840
popular actor, showing people

84
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,100
how to find the best apartments for them?

85
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,400
Is that something you would trust Jeff Goldblum to do?

86
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,980
And the answer of course is,

87
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,120
yes, in a heartbeat.

88
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,320
Yeah, that's fair because the Travago guy

89
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,880
isn't playing himself, I assume.

90
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,760
No, that's not true.

91
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,320
His name's David Travago.

92
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,960
Oh, can I tell you,

93
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,320
I got two theories about Jurassic World, Lost World.

94
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,280
You don't want to talk about Travago guy?

95
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,760
No, well, my theory number one is he's in it

96
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,200
as Travago guy.

97
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't like how when you search

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,560
for any hotel accommodations on Travago,

99
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,560
the first result is always my guest room

100
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,000
and it's a picture of the Travago guy

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,720
trying to get you to stay at his crib.

102
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,320
The picture of the bed has him lying in the bed,

103
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,120
kind of like head up on one hand,

104
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,240
you know, on his elbow kind of thing.

105
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,920
Harris Tassel as if you've just awoken him from a nap.

106
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,160
And there's a big paragraph in there

107
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,180
about how he lost all his shirts in a fire

108
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,960
and that's why he's not wearing any of the pics.

109
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,200
That's weird.

110
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,320
It's so strange.

111
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,280
But it is a good way to demonstrate the size of the bed

112
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,320
to give me some sort of context.

113
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,220
My house is four Travago guys tall.

114
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,060
Yeah, right?

115
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,840
And there's plenty of room for you to stretch out

116
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,760
in my one and a half Travago guy size bed.

117
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,000
Here's my theory about the Jurassic World lost world.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,800
One, they're finally gonna show the dinosaurs in this one.

119
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,080
This one, oh, it's gonna have them.

120
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,920
Been waiting.

121
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,080
I think we're finally gonna see them.

122
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,760
Unfair that Richard Schiff got chopped in half off screen.

123
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,600
Yes.

124
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,440
I needed to see that to finish.

125
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,280
I have to.

126
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,140
Ha ha!

127
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,860
Number two, my theory is at the end,

128
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,520
it's gonna pull back, camera pulls back,

129
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,720
and all of that was inside a dome

130
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,840
with super intelligent dinosaurs looking in

131
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,840
and saying like, yes, our experiment

132
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,960
to breed extinct humans is going very well.

133
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,520
Yeah, into phase one.

134
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,660
Onto phase two.

135
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,500
Yes.

136
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,440
Let's get Chris Pratt up here.

137
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,280
Let's get him nude.

138
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,620
Your thing would make more sense, I think, Travis.

139
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,320
Your thing would be more logical

140
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,560
if the humans were the animals in this world.

141
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,240
It would make more sense than the fact

142
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,040
that they done did the park again.

143
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,400
They did it again.

144
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,080
They did it again.

145
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,060
You know how in the first one, Jeff is like,

146
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,400
this is so whack, and everybody's like,

147
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,680
hey, Jeff, can you calm down?

148
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,280
We're just really excited to see dinosaurs.

149
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,960
And I think at that point, even the audience is like,

150
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,560
hey, don't listen to him.

151
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,160
I really wanna see a dinosaur.

152
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,920
And then when everybody starts getting eaten,

153
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,600
he's like, let's go faster.

154
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,000
Like, he's like, yeah, I told you so.

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,720
Wouldn't it be rad, I haven't seen the film,

156
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,480
wouldn't it be rad in this one if he was like,

157
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,280
super jazzed about it?

158
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,640
Like, he's just like.

159
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,280
My old friend's dinosaurs.

160
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,680
Are you shitting me?

161
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,600
Hell yeah, I'm so stoked.

162
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,440
Who wouldn't wanna see a fucking dinosaur?

163
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,520
This is incredible.

164
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,760
This is amazing.

165
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,400
The claws, the teeth.

166
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,400
He sees a big pile of dookies, like, that's a lot of shit.

167
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,640
I love it.

168
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,480
I like it this time.

169
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,660
I'm very excited.

170
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,680
My roommate and I do not get along.

171
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,820
Our relationship went downhill

172
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,920
when she bought a Jenga board.

173
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,560
We're gonna talk about it, just wait.

174
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,560
She'd ask casually from time to time,

175
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,000
usually I would be cooking dinner

176
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,080
when I'd play Jenga with her.

177
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,760
I have a nine to five job,

178
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,380
but I'm often at home at varying times.

179
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,300
So I was hesitant to make plans with her to play Jenga

180
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,080
that I probably couldn't keep.

181
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,040
I told her just to ask me when I'm at home

182
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,920
and not cooking and I will play Jenga with her.

183
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,980
The shit really hit the wall one night.

184
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,440
I came home and all the lights in the house were off.

185
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,800
I walked in the living room looking for the light switch

186
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,520
when I heard something moving in the dark.

187
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,280
When I turned on the lights, it was my roommate

188
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,040
playing Jenga by herself in the dark.

189
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,320
I don't really want to play Jenga with her anymore,

190
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,260
but I feel like she might light my room on fire

191
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,520
if I don't indulge her.

192
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,760
What do I do?

193
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,320
That's from Gmail.

194
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,160
So I was very thrown by this question

195
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,840
because I've never heard anybody in my life

196
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,240
say a Jenga board.

197
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,760
I don't know even what that could be

198
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,840
and I thought maybe they meant a Ouija board.

199
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,200
And just fucked up the worst.

200
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,040
Yeah, but no.

201
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,860
And just fucked up the words,

202
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,120
but it got weirder because I've also never heard somebody

203
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,800
say they're going to play Ouija.

204
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,680
I've never heard that.

205
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,400
So I think that it is a Jenga.

206
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,520
I don't, but a Jenga board.

207
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,520
I mean, I don't know what I would call it instead,

208
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,240
but it's certainly, there's nothing board like

209
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,040
the Jenga play set, I guess.

210
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,880
I don't know.

211
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,960
It's certainly not a board.

212
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,920
I also, not to nitpick a little bit,

213
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,280
I've also never heard the phrase the shit hit the wall.

214
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,800
Though I get, listen, through context,

215
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,840
I totally understand what it means.

216
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,200
Unless it's being used literally.

217
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,680
We missed the fan.

218
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,040
We threw it at the fan and the fan moved

219
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,400
and then it hit the wall.

220
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,380
Because the lights were off.

221
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,220
Because the lights were off.

222
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,540
Because they were in the dark.

223
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,540
They were using the Jenga in the dark to hone their senses.

224
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,720
You don't need your eyes, your sight,

225
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,480
in order to get a really good Jenga going.

226
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,160
You just need to sort of feel it out.

227
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,640
And the more you can kind of hone that,

228
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,080
I think the better a player you're going to be.

229
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,920
So I wouldn't be too freaked out about that.

230
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,900
They're probably not going to set your room on fire.

231
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,680
They are, I guess the worst case scenario,

232
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,840
going to kick your ass so bad at Jenga so bad

233
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,000
that you'll never be able to leave the house again.

234
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,920
Seems like the more likely scenario.

235
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,280
Would you guys play Jenga right?

236
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,280
If I was like, you want to play some Jenga right now?

237
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,120
Would you guys play Jenga right now?

238
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,120
I mean, I would get on some sort of gig economy service

239
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,080
to have somebody come to my house

240
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,880
and set up the board for me.

241
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,520
Because I couldn't possibly be,

242
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,960
oh, and I just called it a board.

243
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,040
So it's catching on.

244
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,000
But I would love to play Jenga with you right now, Justin.

245
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,160
I don't have the prerequisite, you know,

246
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,400
40 minutes required to set up the Jenga game

247
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,340
only to have your dumb unskilled hands

248
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,240
topple the whole shit over

249
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,080
and sending it crashing down to the floor.

250
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,560
And you're laughing like, uh-oh, guess I did a bad job.

251
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,120
And then I'm crying actual tears because I have to-

252
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,300
Because you're so excited for the game.

253
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,260
I guess in my mind, I'm kind of,

254
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,640
I would just love to play Jenga so much right now.

255
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,520
Yeah. Really?

256
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,520
Well, listen, Justin, everyone loves to play Jenga,

257
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,360
but Griffin is dead on.

258
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,400
You know, and everyone's fine playing Jenga,

259
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,440
but nobody wants to do the work to set up Jenga.

260
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,280
Nobody wants to put in the hours to set it up.

261
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,200
Yes.

262
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,280
There was a bar here in Cincinnati

263
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,160
since closed called Neon's.

264
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,680
And they had like giant Jenga sets.

265
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,920
The big Jenga, yeah.

266
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,880
And it was like huge blocks, right?

267
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,340
And the thing would like, it sat on a table

268
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,520
and the board itself was often, you know, four feet high.

269
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,880
And that's really great because it takes Jenga

270
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,400
as not only a game of skill,

271
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,120
but also turns it into a truly dangerous game.

272
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,680
Dangerous for everyone in the bar,

273
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,040
no matter how close you are to it,

274
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,780
because you could be sitting at the other end of the bar,

275
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,420
having a drink with your friend, just like,

276
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,840
I'm so sorry he left you.

277
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,200
I know that y'all were trying to make it work out.

278
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,000
And please, if there's anything,

279
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,060
I know this feeling, if there's anything I can do,

280
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,440
just as the Jenga board falls over.

281
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,080
And it does sound like two buildings

282
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,160
collapsing into each other,

283
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,040
like the Rampage Monster squished them together.

284
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,500
And it sort of scares the living shit out of everyone.

285
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,520
It's not a fun environment.

286
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,720
Quickly, tell me the truth.

287
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,640
At what point do you say Jenga as it's falling?

288
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,760
As it's falling, do you say Jenga?

289
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,080
You screamed it for everyone to dive out of the way

290
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,620
as one might yell timber.

291
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,460
Yeah.

292
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,280
Jenga!

293
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,120
And you dive.

294
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,960
That's right.

295
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,780
See, that's not right.

296
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,960
Do you chant Jenga to try to psych someone out?

297
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,500
Do you say, uh, do you say it when you're done saying it up?

298
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,840
Like, uh, Jenga!

299
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,120
Well, is Jenga good or is Jenga bad?

300
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,960
Oh, no.

301
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,920
Nobody's ever really dialed into that,

302
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,800
where do you yell it when you're excited

303
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,280
because the Jenga's about to happen?

304
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,040
Or do you use it, as Justin suggests,

305
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,400
as a sort of, you know, wizard's curse?

306
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,120
Jenga is derived from kujenga,

307
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,360
a Swahili word which means to build,

308
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,640
according to the pedia.

309
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,640
I think as it's falling does not, does not trap.

310
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,480
That's an un-Jenga.

311
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,640
De-Jingas.

312
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,200
Let me try this, let me see what you think about this.

313
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,820
The board falls, it's scattered,

314
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,840
everyone looks at it in silence for a moment,

315
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,500
and the person who knocked it over just whispers,

316
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,920
Jenga.

317
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,820
And it's just kind of admitting defeat,

318
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,440
and it's time to build again.

319
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,500
Yeah, I guess the cycle begins anew.

320
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,480
I mean, I wouldn't, I would leave the situation.

321
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,920
I used to date the situation,

322
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,680
but he loved playing Jenga so much.

323
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,520
Yeah.

324
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,360
But it didn't work out.

325
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,640
You used to date the situation?

326
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,920
And the situation from Jirish, or he loves Jenga.

327
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,160
And he loved me for a time, but he loved Jenga more.

328
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,000
He loved it so much,

329
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,440
because each of the big, big bricks

330
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,360
look like one of his individual strong fingers.

331
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,520
And so Justin, did you give the situation an ultimatum,

332
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,040
and you said like, it's me or the Jenga?

333
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,880
I thought you were gonna ask

334
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,160
if I gave him his first Jenga set,

335
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,720
because a lot of people say that, and it's not true.

336
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,840
He already had one,

337
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,560
we found it in a lake house that we rented together,

338
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,760
and he got so into it at that point,

339
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,680
and it's when I really started to lose him.

340
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,120
But so you found it at the lake house,

341
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,480
but you did show him how to play?

342
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,200
Everybody knows how to play Jenga.

343
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,440
It's very obvious.

344
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,640
If you see it set up, all you can think is,

345
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,960
I'd love to knock this down,

346
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,280
but I'd love to make it look like it was an accident.

347
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,560
That's your main reaction when you see the Jenga thing,

348
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,680
is how can I knock this down

349
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,740
and make it look like I didn't mean to?

350
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,360
And so everybody knows the rules of Jenga in their heart.

351
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,400
Do you ever hear from the situation now?

352
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,620
Yeah, when was the last time you talked to a situation?

353
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,460
You know what?

354
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,080
I always hear from him when there's a new

355
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,680
limited edition set released.

356
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,660
Because he thinks that I'm gonna be excited about it too.

357
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,040
Like, hey, did you hear there's Donkey Kong Jenga?

358
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,840
Hey, did you hear there's Jenga blank?

359
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,880
Or there's giant, giant Jenga.

360
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,160
You remember Sex Jenga,

361
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,440
where they would write like a little sexy things

362
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,120
you're supposed to do when you pull the bricks out?

363
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,840
Is there any less sexual situation imaginable on earth

364
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,640
than playing Jenga?

365
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,600
I don't like conflating that at the act

366
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,600
of beautiful lovemaking with a lot of brick removal tension.

367
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,120
So, oh wait, the question, of course.

368
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,620
Yes, of course, all apologies.

369
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,960
You should just play Jenga,

370
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,880
because it's fun and I love to play Jenga.

371
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,280
If I have time, I'll get over there.

372
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,840
If you want me to play Jenga with your roommate

373
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,420
instead of you, I'm happy to do it.

374
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,640
Let me ask you guys this.

375
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,260
Is there a level of bad you could be at Jenga

376
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,880
that the roommate would no longer want to play with you?

377
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,720
Yes.

378
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,540
Oh.

379
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,640
Can you hide or burn one of the Jenga bricks

380
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,600
and they'll never be able to play with that set again.

381
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,800
Especially if you can get the bottom ones.

382
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,640
Well.

383
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,540
Or every night, every night burn three Jenga bricks.

384
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,040
Right, so that way the tower just gets shorter

385
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,880
and shorter and shorter.

386
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,720
Oh, that's good.

387
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,240
That's shortening the length of the game or extending it.

388
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,480
Or are you extending the length of the game by doing that?

389
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,000
Okay, so every night add three Jenga bricks.

390
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,480
Add three Jenga bricks

391
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,040
and then they'll get tired of setting it up.

392
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,560
Well, eventually it gets pinched

393
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,920
between the table and the ceiling.

394
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,640
And then the friction is such that nobody can remove

395
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,840
any bricks and now you just have

396
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,920
sort of a cool wood column in your home.

397
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,760
And that's gonna raise the property values.

398
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,400
I would give any amount of money for you to read Yahoo.

399
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,880
Here's one from Merit Palmer.

400
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,280
Thank you Merit, it's Yahoo Answers user question mark.

401
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,120
We'll call him.

402
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,100
Bev asks, what makes something food?

403
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,560
Huh.

404
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,560
The fact that this had to be asked by this person

405
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,920
makes me wonder what their last say hour has been like.

406
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,200
You know what I mean?

407
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,800
What the hour leading up to them getting on Yahoo

408
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,360
and typing this question in was like.

409
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,160
Let me pose this to you two.

410
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,820
Is paper food?

411
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,800
I mean, maybe it would be better

412
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,760
instead of Travis going down the list

413
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,680
of all inanimate objects that are extant,

414
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,080
we could come up with some baseline filmmakers.

415
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
I was gonna make a point.

416
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,680
I wasn't just speaking hypothetically.

417
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,520
I'm talking about-

418
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,600
Okay, yes, paper is food.

419
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,280
You could season paper in such a way

420
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,480
that it would be pleasant to eat.

421
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,360
Like a fucking paprika cigarette?

422
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,200
What are you talking about?

423
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,120
No, you could just like, you could make it pretty good.

424
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,000
You could season it and make it good to eat

425
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,200
and then it's got fiber in it and probably a vitamin.

426
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,880
Justin, you are fucking with my point on purpose

427
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,400
because you know I was gonna say,

428
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,160
oh, it's not food, but you can eat it.

429
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,520
And now you've taken that away from me with your-

430
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,200
You just raised the specter of the question.

431
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,960
The bounds of the question are what is food?

432
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,640
What things are food?

433
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,980
How did food do it?

434
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,520
Just because you don't wanna eat paper

435
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,180
doesn't mean it's not food.

436
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,640
But here's my point is if you got a burrito

437
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
wrapped in paper and you took a bite of it

438
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,320
with the paper still on, you would go to jail.

439
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,280
Yes, it would not be pleasant.

440
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,600
Not all food is pleasant.

441
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,440
That's a good point.

442
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,440
See, I was thinking here, if you wanna eat it,

443
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,580
put it in your tummy, it tastes good,

444
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,440
then that's the sort of three things you need for food.

445
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,240
But there's a lot of things that are food,

446
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,240
like for me, a vegetable that I don't think it tastes tasty.

447
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,160
I don't want it in my belly.

448
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't think I want it in my mouth.

449
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,860
I don't desire it, but it's still food, isn't it?

450
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,380
So shit.

451
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,640
Yeah, it's still food.

452
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,400
I mean, everybody's talking about a hot dog sandwich or not,

453
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,320
but I think we can all agree,

454
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,840
these things are food.

455
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,320
Maybe food is completely subjective.

456
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,640
One man's food is another man's treasure.

457
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,720
Yeah, I look at grass and I'm like, no, thank you.

458
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,560
But a cow looks at grass and a cow's like, yum, yum, yum.

459
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,960
Now that's what I call food.

460
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,440
And then I look at the cow and I say, well, do you know?

461
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,160
To the cow, the cow thinks I'm just me.

462
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,000
But I see the cow and I say, that's like 10 hamburgers.

463
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Cause I'm a fucking big, big wild animal, just a big idiot.

464
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,000
Who also can't measure how big a hamburger is

465
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,800
compared to a cow.

466
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,640
Yeah.

467
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,800
All right, Travis, how many hamburgers

468
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,760
can you get out of a cow?

469
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,280
Answer me truthfully at all times with your heart.

470
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,160
They're not sliders.

471
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,780
35.

472
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,620
That's right.

473
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,440
35 hamburgers for a single cow.

474
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,280
No, he's right.

475
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,120
He got it right.

476
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,320
God, he got it right.

477
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,120
He got the right answer.

478
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,460
It's like, what is food?

479
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,560
What is food?

480
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,160
Is toothpaste food?

481
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,240
No, stop.

482
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,400
You gotta stop asking these dumb questions for the jokes.

483
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,320
No, listen, toothpaste isn't food.

484
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,280
And I can back that up.

485
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,140
Cause if you, it has chemicals in it that make you sick

486
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,560
if you eat more than a portion of it.

487
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,400
Sure.

488
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,080
And a portion is a deck of cards or the palm of your hand.

489
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,840
So if you eat more,

490
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,880
you should be able to eat a portion,

491
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,720
which is a deck of cards or the palm of your hand.

492
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,880
That's about the size of a portion of any food.

493
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,360
And you should be able to eat a portion of anything.

494
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,120
I thought you were saying that's how much toothpaste

495
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,040
you're putting on your brush every time.

496
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,280
No, that's how much food you should be able to eat

497
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,060
of something for it to qualify as food.

498
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,320
There should be nothing where if you ate more

499
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,200
than a deck of cards size of it, you would be sick.

500
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,040
You'd be dead.

501
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,080
What if you ate a deck of cards of salt?

502
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,040
Here's what's fucking me.

503
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,960
Salt is food.

504
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,060
Here's what's fucking me up.

505
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,940
Salt is food.

506
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,320
Eat a deck of cards of salt, you're good.

507
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
Here's what's fucking me up.

508
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,880
I don't think so.

509
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,400
I think you'd get very sick.

510
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,080
Here's what's fucking me up though.

511
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,080
You take the sticky stuff of dough, that ain't food.

512
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,160
No, that's not food.

513
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,160
You put it in the hot area, get it out, now it's food?

514
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,500
What?

515
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,500
You have, by cooking it and killing some of the latent

516
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,080
bacteria in it by cooking it, you have made it qualify

517
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,320
for food of rule number one.

518
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,680
Sorry, rule of food number one.

519
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,160
You could eat a deck of it and be okay.

520
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,120
What about a novelty size deck of playing cards?

521
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,800
No, a deck of it, a portion.

522
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,760
This is the rule.

523
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,240
If you eat a deck of raw dough,

524
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,560
that you could still get salmonella, get sick.

525
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,240
That ain't food, cousin.

526
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,160
Hey family, that ain't food.

527
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,000
Let me ask you this, Justin, is drink food?

528
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,920
Stop, you're just being a pisser right now, Trav.

529
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,760
I'm just trying to create new rules for food.

530
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,860
I've got one for you, where if you eat a deck of it,

531
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,920
if it makes you sick, that ain't food, nephew.

532
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Does one must derive some form of nutrition

533
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,660
for it to be food?

534
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,720
Nope, because cotton candy's food.

535
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,640
Shit.

536
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,920
Can I cook a deck of toothpaste?

537
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,760
Ooh.

538
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,760
No, you would just exacerbate, that's not food.

539
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,680
We need more rules.

540
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,260
If you eat a deck of it and you're healthy still,

541
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,100
that's food.

542
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:31,920
That's fucked up though,

543
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,980
because I can't do that for cheese.

544
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,280
No, there has to be rules, Justin.

545
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,000
There can be other rules.

546
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,360
What other rules, Justin?

547
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,200
You're founding a new religion here, Justin.

548
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,440
You can't stop at one rule.

549
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,200
I came up with the one, like my rule is great.

550
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,560
I could eat a candle.

551
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,200
I could eat a playing card deck size of candle,

552
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,840
and I think I would live.

553
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,400
Probably not though.

554
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,880
I didn't say live.

555
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,700
Oh.

556
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,920
I said get sick.

557
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,960
And I think my friend, my young friend,

558
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,240
I think that if you ate a candle the size of your fist,

559
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,080
you'd probably not be feeling tip top

560
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,120
for the rest of the day.

561
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,800
That isn't food, brother.

562
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,840
I'm looking around my room,

563
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,240
thinking about things I could eat

564
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,040
a playing card deck size of.

565
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,000
I'll give you one.

566
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Some playing cards.

567
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,800
Uh-huh.

568
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,160
It's rule two.

569
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,280
If someone, no, it can't just be someone,

570
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,000
because there would be people that would eat a candle

571
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,240
and say like, I loved it.

572
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,040
I'm gonna say if there's 20 people anywhere on Earth

573
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,360
who do enjoy eating the thing,

574
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,920
it also then is food.

575
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,160
Does that include like YouTube prank videos?

576
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,560
Ah, shit, yeah.

577
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,880
You don't, you would be so sick.

578
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,080
If you ate a deck of playing cards, they're waxed.

579
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,360
You would be sick.

580
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,800
It's not food.

581
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,120
I'm not gonna tell you how my fucking trick works, dude.

582
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,320
I ate a deck of playing cards

583
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,920
and I'm still here alive to tell the tale.

584
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,320
You figure it out.

585
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,800
Does anybody have another rule for food?

586
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,600
I already fucking gave you one.

587
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,520
My esoteric one.

588
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,640
Would you eat this in front of the Pope?

589
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,480
What food?

590
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,120
Hey, let's pretend for a second.

591
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
Because I would eat some ribs in front of the Pope.

592
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,080
Oh, hell yeah.

593
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,080
What is the number one food

594
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,040
that you at least want to eat

595
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,760
in front of a potential employer?

596
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,320
My own resume.

597
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,720
Yeah, probably a cake

598
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,640
with pictures of their family on it.

599
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,480
You guys are the pits.

600
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,000
You're not even applying yourselves

601
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,640
to the context of the question.

602
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,600
I wouldn't want to eat their lunch.

603
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,960
Okay, but like, you all are like,

604
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,360
if the man had seen the sawdust,

605
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,560
he wouldn't have died lateral thinking, puzzled me.

606
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,400
Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

607
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,800
I just want a good answer.

608
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,040
Yeah, I got a good answer.

609
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,240
It could be a hot dog

610
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,560
that you've written the word dickhead

611
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,000
and mustard on the top of it.

612
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,560
How about Taco Bell?

613
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,240
A big bag of Taco Bell.

614
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,800
And there's, instead of a receipt inside,

615
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,080
there's a piece of paper that says I stole this.

616
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,640
How about a big bag of Taco Bell

617
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,200
and also you're at Qdoba?

618
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,760
Oh, you're applying for a job at Qdoba.

619
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,600
Yeah.

620
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,320
Let me, I would like to suggest

621
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,400
a pretty dynamic change

622
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,360
to the way we are thinking about things.

623
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,600
I would like to suggest we split this into two categories.

624
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,080
Food, F-O-O-D, and that's where your sandwiches,

625
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,320
you know, your salads,

626
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,240
what you would think of when you think of food goes.

627
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,840
And then food, F-U, with an umlaut over it, C,

628
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,480
where we can put stuff like some paper,

629
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,120
a leaf you found outside.

630
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,200
You can't, okay, the word you're looking for is edible.

631
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,680
We have two rules for food, Travis.

632
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,120
Yes, but no rules for feud.

633
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,640
Everything else is feud.

634
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,880
If it's edible and not food, it's feud.

635
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,120
Yes, this is what I'm saying.

636
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,400
Okay, here are the two rules we have for food.

637
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,240
If you can eat a deck of it and not get sick

638
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,240
and 20 people anywhere like it.

639
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,160
But it can't be the same 20 people

640
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,920
who are just like stunting to expand the list.

641
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,240
I think we're on it, we got a good start here.

642
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,040
And then everything else is feud.

643
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,280
Everything else is feud, a new food-like product

644
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,880
from Travis McElroy.

645
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,480
Gang, I'm thinking it might just be easier

646
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,600
to just do a list.

647
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,440
See?

648
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,920
All the things that are food.

649
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,040
Listen, I'm just saying that I think we will find

650
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,120
less things that aren't food.

651
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,080
So if we went, can we get the folks down at MIT on this?

652
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,040
Recently, I moved to a small town

653
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,880
that's about three by three miles long.

654
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,600
Nine square miles, next question.

655
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,640
Nice try.

656
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,680
How big is my town?

657
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,040
How big's my town in square mileage?

658
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,200
There's your answer, next.

659
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,320
Sometimes while I'm working at my retail job,

660
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,280
I'll see customers with a nice cold Jamba Juice

661
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,640
and think about treating myself to one.

662
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,600
The problem is that there isn't a Jamba Juice

663
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,960
in my town at all.

664
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,800
Yeah.

665
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,960
Ha ha ha ha ha.

666
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,120
The closest neighboring town that has one

667
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,120
is about a 40 minute drive.

668
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,560
I spent all my time Googling

669
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,360
and can't find one in my or my neighboring towns.

670
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,280
Would it be okay for me to ask a customer

671
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,800
where the Jamba Juice is?

672
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Do my customers drive 40 minutes for juice?

673
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,720
Should I?

674
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,440
This is from Jamba Juice Junkie.

675
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,640
Well, let me make one quick correction.

676
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,640
Your customers drive 80 minutes for a Jamba Juice.

677
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,760
Sure.

678
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,800
That's a fucking great point, Travis.

679
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,000
Thank you so much.

680
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,040
How is there even juice left in the cup

681
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,160
by the time they get to you?

682
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,480
How do you not immediately drain one of these?

683
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,560
Maybe they take like a cooler with them.

684
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,800
They buy eight Jamba Juices at once,

685
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,840
put it in some dry ice, have it all week.

686
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,740
Do you know how far I would have to drive

687
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,920
to get the Jamba Juice?

688
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,760
Uh oh.

689
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,540
Ooh, how far Justin?

690
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,500
Well, it wouldn't be 40 minutes, my man.

691
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,280
Our town is a little bit bigger

692
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,940
than nine by nine square miles,

693
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,040
but your boy Hoops would need to drive

694
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,400
three and a half hours to get the Jamba Juice.

695
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
So I'd have to really be craving that.

696
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,360
I don't know if I've ever had this juice.

697
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,000
Is it good?

698
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,680
I mean, it's not three and a half hours.

699
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,160
Sorry, as Travis and Riley points out, seven hours.

700
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,840
I mean, just so you don't feel bad, Justin,

701
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,520
here in Cincinnati, which I would call

702
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,460
a smallish major city.

703
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,640
That's a juice town.

704
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,480
That's a juice town.

705
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,640
The closest one is in Lexington, 81 miles away.

706
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,840
Maybe what we're really realizing here right now

707
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,960
is that maybe Jamba Juice needs to open some more locales.

708
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,280
Or Question Asker needs to.

709
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,360
Oh my god, Travis.

710
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,200
Yes.

711
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,360
The universe has been speaking to you

712
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,480
with these brave pilgrims and their delicious juice.

713
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,040
The universe is telling you,

714
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,960
Dilip, listen, it's time to open a Jamba Juice.

715
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,820
Quit your job. The market is here.

716
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,360
The market is here.

717
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,800
Your town is full of people that love Jamba Juice

718
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,040
and hate driving.

719
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,700
The time has come.

720
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,960
And maybe if you want to save on some fees

721
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,800
and some negotiating with Jamba Juice,

722
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,320
just open a Jumbo Juice.

723
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,960
Same exact everything else, but now it's you

724
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,200
and you don't have to pay for a franchise.

725
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,740
Open a Jambi Juice.

726
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,900
And you're gonna work with your friend Paul Reubens.

727
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,040
You're gonna open a Jambi Juice.

728
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,200
And John Paragon, I guess, would have to get in on it

729
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,000
to do like VO and stuff.

730
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,320
I don't think you can ask them

731
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,360
where they got the juice, though.

732
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,720
You don't think-

733
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,520
Cause that conversation would go,

734
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,600
hey, where'd you get that?

735
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,680
And they would say, Jamba Juice.

736
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,520
Or maybe they're getting it from like a Speak Juicy

737
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,840
and they can't tell you where,

738
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,200
cause it's like an underground Jamba Juice here in town

739
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,440
that you're not allowed to know about

740
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,360
cause you just moved there.

741
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,120
Or maybe it's not a real Jamba Juice

742
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,320
that they're getting their juice from.

743
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,020
It's an old foot locker

744
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,720
that somebody is just crushing up some oranges and apples

745
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,560
and what have you in.

746
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,360
And then they say, they sell it to them

747
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,080
and they say, this will be $60.

748
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,360
And they say, that seems stiff.

749
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,040
And they say, well, can I tell you, we're a real Jamba Juice.

750
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,900
And you don't wanna burst their bubble

751
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,040
that they're drinking bootleg Jamba Juice.

752
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,160
Haven't you noticed that it's just like solo cops

753
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,320
with the words Jamba Juice written onto it?

754
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,800
And it's got a lot of seeds, like many seeds.

755
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,560
It's so seedy.

756
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,360
It's pretty much all seeds.

757
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,240
How far would you guys drive for juice?

758
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,280
How far would I drive for juice?

759
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,440
I wouldn't go to my kitchen for juice, Justin.

760
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,440
If I handed you a cold juice right now,

761
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,600
you would just upturn the cup, huh?

762
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,200
Yes, onto your head.

763
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,080
Hey folks, it's just sugar.

764
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,920
Whoa.

765
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,740
You're welcome, yeah.

766
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,600
Didn't even think political would happen on this show.

767
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,320
But Justin got political.

768
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,680
I'm just mad because I tried to do a juice fast once

769
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,080
on the day of trick or treat,

770
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,720
and I only made it four hours.

771
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,480
Did you try to juice a bit of honey?

772
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,240
And you're like, this is not producing much.

773
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,240
Nothing.

774
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,160
This is nothing.

775
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,740
Oh boy, it was bad though.

776
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,060
Let's take a quick trip over to the money table.

777
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:16,060
Hey, can I tell you about Blue Apron?

778
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,120
Can I tell you about Blue Apron?

779
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,660
Yeah, Justin, you do it.

780
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:30,660
Every Friday, I go out on, and I open my front door,

781
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,200
and you know what's waiting for me?

782
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,720
Don't say a cardboard box.

783
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,700
It's so much more than that.

784
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,460
It's a world of cuisine.

785
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,620
Now this is all food, not the box.

786
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,420
Not the box, not the frozen elements.

787
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,700
Well, the box is feud,

788
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,220
and the frozen elements are probably feud too,

789
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,740
but don't take my word for it.

790
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,460
And they're really delicious food at that.

791
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:56,140
Blue Apron delivers fresh, pre-proportioned ingredients

792
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,980
with step-by-step recipes right to your door

793
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,320
that can be cooked in under 45 minutes.

794
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,980
I have been a Blue Apron customer

795
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,280
since they started advertising with us,

796
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,060
and I pay for all my Blue Apron meals now.

797
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,460
I say that with a point of pride.

798
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,700
I'm happy that I can continue to support

799
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,180
this great organization

800
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,980
because they deliver such fantastic food.

801
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,980
Sidney made one yesterday that was like a noodle dish,

802
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,300
like a chicken noodle dish

803
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,660
with some semolina in there and some seasoning.

804
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,900
Oh boy, I know I'm not describing it very well,

805
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,020
but hachi-machi was it ever good.

806
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,420
You're gonna love this stuff.

807
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,140
They're chef-designed recipes,

808
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,500
and you're gonna feel like you really know

809
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,380
what you're doing around the kitchen,

810
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,380
and if you do it for long enough, you really will.

811
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,540
I've worked with so many ingredients

812
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,820
that I wouldn't have worked with otherwise,

813
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,220
and I feel like, honestly, I know, Griffin,

814
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,340
you feel the same way,

815
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,340
just I have learned a lot about cooking.

816
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,180
Yeah, it's very.

817
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,380
Which I would never try otherwise.

818
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,740
It's a very good skill to know.

819
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,120
Thank you, Blapron.

820
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,460

821
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,400

No, blueapron.com slash my brother.

824
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,580
You fucked that up so bad.

825
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,580
We say that at least like six times an episode.

826
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,620
This is why we created the different one.

827
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,760
This is my brother and my sitter.

828
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,800
Go to blapron.com.

829
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,620
That's our private vanity URL

830
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,140
that we registered much to their chagrin.

831
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,000
That'll take you to blueapron.com slash my brother,

832
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
or you can go to blapron.com

833
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,220
and get your first three meals free.

834
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:42,220
Blue Apron is, quite simply, if I do say so myself,

835
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,460
a better way to cook.

836
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,580
Can I tell you about Wink?

837
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,100
Fuck me, I wanna do one of the ads.

838
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,220
Here's the thing about Wink.

839
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,620
I love wine.

840
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,940
But for a while there,

841
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,780
I thought I just kinda sorta liked wine.

842
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,500
Cause basically I was just being introduced

843
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,760
to the same like three bottles

844
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,940
over and over and over again.

845
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,780
But with Wink, I type in a couple of things.

846
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,340
They ask me a couple of simple questions,

847
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,060
like how do you take your coffee

848
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,580
and how do you feel about blueberries?

849
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,380
And frankly, I don't trust them.

850
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,300
With just those simple answers,

851
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,780
they will then recommend to you

852
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,060
and send you some wines

853
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,220
that are well-suited to your palate and your taste

854
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,580
without you having to know anything

855
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,380
about your palate and your taste.

856
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,640
It's incredible.

857
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,740
And these wines come

858
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,220
and they're new and interesting brands

859
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,640
I had never seen in a store,

860
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,740
but I'm now falling in love with.

861
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,780
And you can personalize, you know, what bottles you get.

862
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,220
And there's no membership fees.

863
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,720
You can skip any month.

864
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,060
You can cancel any time.

865
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,220
Shipping is covered.

866
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,740
And if you don't like a bottle, they'll replace it.

867
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,840
No questions asked.

868
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,220
It's a great deal.

869
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,240
Have you tried Jason Biggs Power Wine?

870
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,060
No, that one hasn't come yet.

871
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,320
You gotta, I think, request it.

872
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,660
Well, it takes a specific sort of profile answer.

873
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,320
And it's one that you wouldn't normally

874
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,280
sort of fill in there.

875
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,620
You have to really be looking for Jason Biggs Power Wine.

876
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,380
But they ask you things like, what's your favorite movie?

877
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,320
And you do have to say, you know,

878
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,880
American Pie, Saving Silverman, something like that.

879
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,760
And it's like, name one word, one adjective,

880
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,740
how you want your wine.

881
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,720
And you said, you have to say like psyched up.

882
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,380
Or just big, but two Gs.

883
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,260
Or you just put in, it says any additional details

884
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,540
and you can just type in there,

885
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,380
I wanna drink the Jason Biggs Power Wine.

886
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,720
And that'll usually get it to you there.

887
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,300
And I know you're probably wondering, is it red?

888
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,700
Is it white?

889
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,700
It doesn't have a discernible color.

890
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,620
It's kind of opalescent, I guess,

891
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,120
would be the word I would use.

892
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,100
Yeah, chunky.

893
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,920
So you can discover great wine today

894
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,960
if you go to trywink.com slash my brother.

895
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,960
That's trywink, T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com slash my brother.

896
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,820
And when you do, you'll get $20 off your first shipment.

897
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,980
That's trywink.com slash my brother for $20 off.

898
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,920
Go check it out.

899
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,060
I wanna tell you about a podcast.

900
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,340
This one's called I Hate It, But I Love It.

901
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,180
That's the name of it.

902
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,180
It is not my review of the show.

903
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,860
It's called I Hate It, But I Love It.

904
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,020
You can find it at hatelovepodcast.com

905
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,500
or wherever you get your podcasts.

906
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,980
I Hate It, But I Love It is a super fun podcast

907
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,900
about the pop culture you love and hate simultaneously.

908
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,780
Each week, hosts and best pals Kat and Jocelyn

909
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,140
discuss a movie or TV show that they both love and hate,

910
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,780
like Game of Thrones, Armageddon, The Devil Wears Prada,

911
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,860
or anything J.J. Abrams ever made.

912
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,220
Then they try to figure out why they feel that way.

913
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,060
Oh, and did I mention they're Canadian?

914
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,240
That's not really important,

915
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,080
but any Canadians listening right now

916
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,440
just got a little bit excited.

917
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,720
You should listen.

918
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,040
I think you should listen no matter where you live,

919
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,180
but Canadians, you're gonna love

920
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,460
all of the great Canadian sensibilities

921
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,340
present in this show, I bet.

922
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,020
So that's I Hate It, But I Love It.

923
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:52,280
You can find it on your podcast destination.

924
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,540
We have a message for future Annie,

925
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,860
and it's from present Annie, and it says,

926
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,460
Annie, I hope you aren't driving to work right now

927
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,540
while you hear this.

928
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,060
It's okay if you are.

929
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,660
I'm not disappointed in you.

930
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,800
All things take time.

931
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,940
You're probably absolutely crushing it

932
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,420
no matter what you're doing.

933
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,780
I hope things are better then than now.

934
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,620
Don't settle.

935
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,500
You can always do better.

936
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,760
Also, Madison, I hope you're good.

937
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,860
This was for me, though.

938
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,860
They wanted this to air in March,

939
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:29,580
so I super duper hope that things are going well for you

940
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,180
because it's been a few months.

941
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,620
Yet a few bonus months there tacked on to the end

942
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,140
where things have almost certainly started doing better.

943
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,540
I have to imagine they've gotten better at this point.

944
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,340
I mean, the span, I mean, the events

945
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,340
of everything that's happened between March and June

946
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:47,220
is nothing but just no clouds in the sky,

947
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,140
beautiful, bright, sunshiny day.

948
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,780
Yep, yep, yep.

949
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,020
Annie, I think you're great,

950
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,580
and I bet you are crushing it no matter what you're doing.

951
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,420
And Madison-

952
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,540
We're proud of you.

953
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,660
And Madison, quit trying to jump in on Annie's thing.

954
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,420
Yeah, yeah, Madison, back off.

955
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,680
This is for Annie.

956
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,860
I actually don't, I actually wonder about Annie's situation

957
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,660
because since Annie, I hope you aren't driving to work

958
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,380
right now while you hear this.

959
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,000
It's okay if you are.

960
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,520
Are they disappointed?

961
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,140
There's a few things that can be disappointing to you.

962
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,980
One, that they're listening to the show still.

963
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,740
They have maybe wanted to stop.

964
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,180
I hope that's not the case.

965
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,640
Or disappointed that they heard it.

966
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,060
It could be they wanted to stop driving to work,

967
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,180
and they promised themselves they would start walking

968
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,600
or riding their bike.

969
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,180
That may be another thing.

970
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,660
Or it could be that they wanted them to have a different job.

971
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,040
I think Matt, I thought I took it as,

972
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,160
I'm disappointed in you for listening to anything

973
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,140
while driving to work,

974
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,380
a time when you should be focusing on driving.

975
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,700
Yeah, you should be driving, pay attention to driving.

976
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,620
This is for Pat, and it's from Sam.

977
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,740
Hi, Pat.

978
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,780
I know we said we weren't gonna do this,

979
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,400
but you're proposing to Rebecca today,

980
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,460
so that seems like a big deal.

981
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,220
So since this is going to be in the future, happy wedding.

982
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,420
Congrats on that coming up.

983
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:11,020
Unless she says no, which would be a colossal bummer.

984
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,160
Not that I need to tell you that.

985
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,820
In that case, keep your chin up, bud.

986
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,740
I love you.

987
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,060
And that's for whenever, man.

988
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:24,100
Okay, a lot going on.

989
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,120
Yeah.

990
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,660
A lot going on.

991
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,260
I feel like I need some sort of Reddit fan club

992
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,420
to break down the timeline for this.

993
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,780
I need an Inception flow chart to sort of follow.

994
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,860
What I love about this Jumbotron

995
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,820
is what this makes me think

996
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,580
is that Sam was talking to Pat,

997
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,540
and Pat was like,

998
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,140
yeah, I'm gonna propose to Rebecca today.

999
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,980
Whatever you do, don't get me a Jumbotron

1000
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,820
that wishes me a future happy wedding.

1001
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,180
And Sam says, okay, I won't do this,

1002
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,940
and then jumps onto the phone,

1003
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,780
and it's like, I know we said we weren't gonna do this.

1004
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,700
It seems like Pat has been wronged before by Sam

1005
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,380
in this exact way,

1006
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,460
because I don't know why else

1007
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,460
they would need to warn them otherwise.

1008
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,220
Well, Adam, we're still putting out

1009
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,060
the Greatest Discovery podcast

1010
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,700
while we wait for season two.

1011
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,620
What are we doing with these episodes?

1012
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,060
We've talked to a whole bunch of interesting people,

1013
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,460
like the Wall Street Journal's Ben Fritz

1014
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,580
and MaximumFun.org's own Danielle Radford.

1015
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,900
We're kind of using this time to find ways

1016
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,340
to entertain ourselves and you

1017
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,460
while we wait for the next season.

1018
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,820
So catch yourself up with Star Trek Discovery

1019
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,860
and join us Tuesday on The Greatest Discovery.

1020
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:43,500
It's on MaximumFun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.

1021
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,380
How about a Yahoo?

1022
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,420
Yeah, actually, no.

1023
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,620
Okay.

1024
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:52,620
It's time to play the game that's shaking up America.

1025
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:57,340
We return to it every week or so.

1026
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,340
What do you got?

1027
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,780
Celebrity Wine.

1028
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,180
Why not?

1029
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,500
Welcome to Celebrity Wine.

1030
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,340
Why not?

1031
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,180
It's a very good show.

1032
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,140
Did you know you were gonna do this

1033
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,380
before I talked about Jason Biggs' Power Wine?

1034
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,620
Celebrity Wine, Why Not is a new show.

1035
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:18,180
It's a quiz show with my brother, my brother, and me

1036
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,740
where I'm gonna tell you,

1037
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,940
I forget how we, how did we, what were the rules?

1038
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,580
I think you gave us the name of the wine

1039
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,300
and we tried to guess the celebrity and the rating.

1040
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,140
Okay.

1041
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,980
If I remember correctly.

1042
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,980
I am going to, okay, the list is still shared with you

1043
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:39,820
and I'm gonna hit you with the name and the score of a wine

1044
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,580
and you're gonna tell me which actor from our list

1045
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,060
is responsible for it.

1046
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,260
I mean, don't tell us the score though.

1047
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,260
That's half the fun.

1048
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,660
Yes, you will guess the score after.

1049
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:54,260
So I'm going to say our first one today,

1050
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,300
our first one, let me open up this bottle.

1051
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:01,300
Hello, gentlemen, I, my name is Smalley A. Justin

1052
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,140
and I am so happy you came to our restaurant.

1053
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,980
Today we have a fine bottle for you.

1054
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,980
It's a Ferguson Crest 2014 Private Reserve Syrah.

1055
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,660
It's from the Santa Ynez Valley.

1056
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:21,340
And it's, oh, half of the label has worn off here.

1057
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:25,060
I can't read the celebrity, but I knew that a very

1058
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,600
considerable celebrity was attached to this wine.

1059
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,140
Oh, I know it.

1060
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,100
Yeah, I do too.

1061
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,500
It's not the hardest one you've given us before.

1062
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,060
It did take a second.

1063
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,380
Is that by Fergie Furr?

1064
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,220
Is that Fergie's wine?

1065
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,540
Fergie Furr, that's Fergie's wine.

1066
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,580
Give me the score.

1067
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,420
Oh man.

1068
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,940
Now to remind you of the scale here,

1069
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,660
really between 80 and 100 is really the score.

1070
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,460
I'm gonna say 87.

1071
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,780
I'm gonna say 83.

1072
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,820
Well, that's a 90 on this one.

1073
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,940
Hey, great wine Fergie.

1074
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,980
Fergie did a good job.

1075
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,980
She tried her best and she was very, very, very pleased.

1076
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,940
I'm gonna Google just to real quick,

1077
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,340
see how original our nation sort of wine critics are.

1078
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,780
Fergie wine fergalicious.

1079
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,300
And see how many people sort of led with that.

1080
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,320
Yeah, yep.

1081
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,940
Len, it looks like my computer just imploded.

1082
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,980
It just sort of disappeared in my desk.

1083
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,100
It Googled it too hard and died.

1084
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,220
So gentlemen, please enjoy the Ferguson Crest 2014.

1085
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,060
Look out for candied blackberry and black currant.

1086
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:33,260
Meet with lilacs on the concentrated gooey nose

1087
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,580
of this bottling.

1088
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,020
Gooey nose?

1089
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,060
That's what wine enthusiasts fucking said.

1090
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:38,900
I kid you not.

1091
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,100
A gooey nose?

1092
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,340
Just a gooey nose on Fergie's wine.

1093
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,820
Fergie, this one's got a gooey nose.

1094
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,120
Next up, gentlemen, if you'll follow me over

1095
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,860
to Tuscana, Italy.

1096
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,220
We're going to be sampling the Il Pallaggio

1097
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,220
2012 Sister Moon Red.

1098
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,780
Say it again.

1099
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:02,780
This is the Il Pallaggio 2012 Sister Moon Red

1100
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,240
from Tuscana, Italy.

1101
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,900
You're gonna be looking for a polished palate

1102
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,300
showing mature red plum, tobacco, and vanilla.

1103
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,060
I'm going to say Lorraine Bracco.

1104
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,180
Um, I don't know who that is.

1105
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,820
I don't either.

1106
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,740
I mean, as bad as I want it to be, Mike Ditka.

1107
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,900
I don't think it is Mike Ditka.

1108
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,360
It sounds fancy.

1109
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,460
So I'm going to say either Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie

1110
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,020
or Sting.

1111
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,580
I'm going to say Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie.

1112
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,540
Oh, it was Sting, sir.

1113
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,180
Oh, sir, it was Sting.

1114
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,140
Ah, fuck.

1115
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,500
I'm actually, I have to be honest with you guys.

1116
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,940
I'm at a bit of an advantage here

1117
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,060
because while on vacation this summer,

1118
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,500
I did have a bottle of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's wine.

1119
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,460
Ah, shit.

1120
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:55,700
So here's the question for all of you here on the call.

1121
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,660
Who's better at wine, Sting or Fergie?

1122
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,220
Oh no, I'm going to say Sting is an 82.

1123
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,460
I'm going to say Sting didn't make good wine.

1124
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,180
I think Sting, 82 feels right to me, Trav.

1125
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,420
You know, it's 88.

1126
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,860
He did a great job.

1127
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,620
It wasn't as good as Fergie did.

1128
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:18,620
But yeah, we got one more in Celebrity Wine, why not?

1129
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,660
Really excited about this one.

1130
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,860
Gentlemen, let me summon my character back up.

1131
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,700
Thank you.

1132
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,780
Gentlemen, our last wine,

1133
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:29,460
because I can tell you're getting a little inebriated

1134
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,620
here at the table.

1135
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,780
Our last is a 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon,

1136
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,780
a Cab Sav in the lingos from Columbia Valley of Washington.

1137
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,060
And it is called Pursued by Bear.

1138
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:47,460
It's a 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon Pursued by Bear.

1139
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:50,060
It's a little Shakespearean pun.

1140
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,860
It provides plenty of immediate appeal,

1141
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:58,420
but will only benefit from some time in the cellar.

1142
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,500
If I can go down the list here.

1143
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,540
This isn't the Jeff Gordon Speedwine.

1144
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,340
It's not the Mario and D'Andretti Speedwine.

1145
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,900
I want to say Kyle McLaughlin,

1146
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,100
because Pursued by Bear seems like somebody

1147
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:13,500
who has a fun like understanding of Shakespeare

1148
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,940
and also the fact that I think it's in Washington state,

1149
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,460
which is where I think Twin Peaks is.

1150
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,300
Wait, is it from Washington?

1151
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,020
I'm sorry, gentlemen, the owner says I cannot-

1152
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,180
Oh, this game stinks.

1153
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,900
My descriptions.

1154
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,860
I'm gonna say Kyle McLaughlin.

1155
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,100
It is from Washington.

1156
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,100
I've checked with the owner.

1157
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,000
He said I could share that from you.

1158
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,100
It is from Columbia Valley of Washington.

1159
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,540
It's probably Kyle McLaughlin.

1160
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,340
So sirs, just so I can quantify this,

1161
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:45,340
you think Kyle McLaughlin decided to make a wine

1162
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:48,860
of Washington because he was in a TV show there

1163
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,260
25 years ago?

1164
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,100
Yes.

1165
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,940
Is that sort of-

1166
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,180
No, they did the reboot.

1167
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,340
This is, I told you it was a 2012.

1168
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,460
It was a 2012 Cab Sav.

1169
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,400
Someone from Washington said,

1170
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,860
you know who I bet is a big fan of us

1171
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,900
because he shot a TV show here

1172
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,780
and they reached out to Kyle McLaughlin.

1173
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,620
All right, I'm gonna change it.

1174
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,460
That's my logic.

1175
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,580
I'm gonna change it to-

1176
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,420
You're a coward.

1177
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,380
Sam Neal.

1178
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,300
The answer is Kyle McLaughlin.

1179
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,140
Yes! What the fuck?

1180
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,180
Yes, I stuck with my gut, Griffin.

1181
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,340
You are rewarded.

1182
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,700
You get a second pour here. That's bullshit.

1183
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,300
Here you go, sir, enjoy.

1184
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,980
I told you it had a fun, actor-y name,

1185
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,260
pursued by Bear.

1186
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,620
I know, but Justin came at me

1187
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,020
with all this negative energy

1188
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,540
and it ruined my vibe.

1189
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,740
Don't be bullied by our older brother.

1190
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,620
Who is better at making wine,

1191
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:42,300
Agent Dale Cooper or Fergie Ferg?

1192
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,020
Probably- I'm gonna go high

1193
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,980
because I'm betting that Kyle McLaughlin

1194
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,820
really got involved in the process

1195
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,180
and was a stickler for quality.

1196
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,860
I'm gonna say a 95.

1197
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:54,220
I'm gonna say that I've doubted Fergie in the past

1198
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,340
and it has not served me well.

1199
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,700
I think her wine's better.

1200
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,140
Kyle McLaughlin's pursued by Bear 2012 Cab Sav

1201
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:03,420
comes in at 93 points from my enthusiast.

1202
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,420
Second only to Earth's best celebrity winemaker,

1203
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,820
Boz Scaggs.

1204
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,620
We all remember Boz is the best.

1205
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,140
What's my dick-cause-fucking-wine call?

1206
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,700
Sir, if you want me to-

1207
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,380
I'm gonna get kicked out of this fucking winery.

1208
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,220
I'm Googling it.

1209
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,060
Fuck you, Samoyed.

1210
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:25,500
If you want my dick-cause-2011 Cabernet Sauvignon

1211
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,740
called The Icon.

1212
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,260
I'm sorry, no, he's got three.

1213
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,900
He's got a Merlot called The Player

1214
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,540
and he's got a Cab Sav called The Coach.

1215
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,100
I want a Coach wine.

1216
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,380
Order all three of those right now.

1217
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,620
Hi, Mike Ditka.

1218
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,420
It's me, your wine producer.

1219
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,940
We need a name for this wine.

1220
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,420
What are some words you know?

1221
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:48,820
The player?

1222
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,980
The coach?

1223
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,660
And the ball.

1224
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,540
No, we can't, we're not gonna do the ball wine.

1225
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,180
It's Mike Ditka's ball wine.

1226
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,180
Freshly sweet.

1227
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,820
It's got notes of currant,

1228
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,740
it's got notes of strawberry in it,

1229
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,500
and a little bit of pigskin, baby.

1230
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,780
Can we do DeWine?

1231
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,940
No, we can't do DeWine, sir.

1232
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:12,740
Congratulations to Kyle McLaughlin and Fergie

1233
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,500
for shocking the haters

1234
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,620
and producing a better wine than Sting.

1235
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,980
How about one, Yahoo?

1236
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,820
Yeah, I'd love that.

1237
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,340
This one's sent in by Allen.

1238
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,580
Allen, thank you, Allen.

1239
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,180
Sorry, I almost attributed it to you.

1240
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,100
It's Yahoo Answers User?

1241
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:33,100
So Mike Ditka asks, what to wear to laser tag?

1242
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,980
I'm Mike Ditka.

1243
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,020
From Family Guy.

1244
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,220
From Family Guy.

1245
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:42,940
It is really hot,

1246
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,620
and I haven't got any black tanks and stuff.

1247
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:48,260
Could I possibly wear a play suit, blue,

1248
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,140
or is that too much?

1249
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:50,980
What?

1250
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1251
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,780
What's a play suit?

1252
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,100
Mm-hmm.

1253
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,740
A play suit, Travis, I'm glad you asked.

1254
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:58,580
I googled it.

1255
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,420
It's not anything.

1256
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,260
It's not anything that exists in the world.

1257
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,140
This is so tough,

1258
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,380
because you have to find something

1259
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,700
that is both resistant to lasers

1260
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,460
and nacho cheese afterwards.

1261
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:12,420
Yeah, something hydrophobic and laserphobic.

1262
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,500
What it, oh, I've got it.

1263
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry to answer this one so quickly.

1264
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:17,940
We'll have to do another one,

1265
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,700
but I have the answer,

1266
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,580
and the answer is you're gonna wanna dress

1267
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,780
like an employee of the laser tag place.

1268
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,620
Okay.

1269
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,860
Okay, kind of a covert.

1270
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,620
Sure, and you get blasted.

1271
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,460
Peer-peer, and you're like,

1272
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,780
what the fuck are you doing?

1273
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,300
Can you see my clothes?

1274
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,580
I'm a journalist.

1275
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,660
I'm covering this laser war.

1276
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,300
Are you trying to get yourself thrown out of here?

1277
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,260
Because I have that power.

1278
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,500
Could you do like a RoboCup outfit?

1279
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,980
Did I say RoboCup?

1280
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,300
You did. RoboCup.

1281
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,140
Pfft.

1282
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:48,980
Pfft.

1283
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,800
Pfft.

1284
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,640
Pfft.

1285
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,480
Pfft.

1286
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,300
Pfft.

1287
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,140
Pfft.

1288
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,220
This police officer got killed by a big gang,

1289
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,460
and they're like, we can save him,

1290
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,180
make him even better than before.

1291
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,700
And he wakes up, and he's like,

1292
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,180
uh-oh, wait a minute, uh-oh.

1293
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,140
What did you do to me?

1294
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,460
You're like, well, you got a little handle there,

1295
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,420
cute little floral pattern.

1296
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,740
You got your own saucer.

1297
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,740
You got a saucer.

1298
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,860
This is your partner.

1299
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:14,700
Saucer.

1300
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,320
He used to be a firefighter,

1301
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,460
but we fucked him up too.

1302
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,620
So anyway, do I have any cool robot powers?

1303
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:25,780
You can hold different beverages inside.

1304
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,220
And is it gonna hurt when it's a hot,

1305
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,060
oh, it'll hurt.

1306
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:28,900
Yeah.

1307
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,720
It'll hurt.

1308
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,560
Yeah.

1309
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,400
How long will they stay hot or cold?

1310
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,100
Not long, you are not insulated.

1311
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,740
You're sort of a guy cup, so.

1312
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,700
Sorry about that.

1313
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,300
Sorry about all of it.

1314
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,620
They, listen, we tried to order RoboCup parts,

1315
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,900
but Jeff over here fucked up the order form,

1316
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,620
did a typo on it, so you're gonna get what you get.

1317
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,540
Hey, at least this, you're not dead.

1318
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,860
Yeah, I guess.

1319
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:50,860
I guess.

1320
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,860
I'd rather be.

1321
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:55,220
Well, the bad news is we don't know how to kill a cup.

1322
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,020
So what do I do now?

1323
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,620
Am I supposed to fight crime?

1324
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:02,220
Oh, well, if you want, I guess.

1325
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,820
I mean, you're not suited for that, if we're being honest.

1326
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:07,740
You're a cup, it feels like a tall order.

1327
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,820
And let me check this out.

1328
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:12,180
I heard Dizzy's making a live action Beauty and the Beast.

1329
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,420
Now we're gonna get you down there casting.

1330
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,700
Can you do a chip?

1331
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,700
Oh, wait, they made that like four years ago.

1332
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,060
Fuck, man, I don't know.

1333
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,020
You might have a job on Sunset Boulevard,

1334
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,020
get your picture taken with Chip the Cup

1335
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,740
from Beauty and the Beast.

1336
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,980
You know, you could make $20 a day.

1337
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,460
No, sorry, you can't charge for those.

1338
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,420
They might have a sequel in the works, you never know.

1339
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,900
Might be uniquely suited.

1340
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,940
Now get on out of here.

1341
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,220
We're gonna turn someone into Tupperware.

1342
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,300
Well, hold on, a sequel, that would be Beauty

1343
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:44,620
and the Handsome Dude and all of his human house servants.

1344
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:45,900
Everything still good?

1345
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,380
Yep, okay, roll credits.

1346
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,980
No, it's just called Gaston's Funeral.

1347
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,820
Don't nobody wanna go to that.

1348
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,140
Anyway, you're a cup now.

1349
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,660
Get on out of here.

1350
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:00,740
We had a conversation about this, we were talking about.

1351
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:04,900
Okay, so we are doing some shows in Orlando,

1352
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,340
and one show, no?

1353
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:12,220
Yeah, one show in Orlando at the end of August.

1354
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:15,380
So we're thinking about like ducking our heads in to Disney

1355
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,700
for a few days while we're down there.

1356
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:21,660
And the one thing that Charlie was really firm on

1357
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,180
is that she does not wanna see Gaston.

1358
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:29,180
She wants to, she does not wanna see Gaston.

1359
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,540
And she said, and we, Sydney and I were talking,

1360
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:35,020
and I guess in the same room as her,

1361
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,260
and Sydney very briefly said like,

1362
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,460
well, sweetie, you realize that's not the same,

1363
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,220
and then she stopped herself.

1364
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,100
We can't really go down that road.

1365
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,580
We can't go down the you know what's not the same

1366
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:51,260
Gaston road because you take that one brick out

1367
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,220
and it all sort of tumbles around you.

1368
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,900
And then I very helpfully jumped in and said,

1369
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,940
well, Gaston died, so that's a different Gaston.

1370
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,500
That was not better.

1371
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,020
So helpful, Justin.

1372
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,340
That was not better, actually.

1373
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,500
So it's a cyborg Gaston, nothing to be afraid of there,

1374
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,900
or brought back to life with dark magics.

1375
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,140
Again, not- An unstoppable Gaston zombie.

1376
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,220
Not anything to be afraid of there.

1377
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:18,340
Why do they have that pervert Gaston even at the park?

1378
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,280
I hate that guy.

1379
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,100
Why does he get, he's a very bad per,

1380
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,100
and you know what, he's not bad in the traditional,

1381
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,460
I'll steal your voice and then become the,

1382
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:34,460
no, he is a racist, and he gets killed for it.

1383
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,620
Whatever, but it's wild that he's like,

1384
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,660
everyone pose with me, expectorating.

1385
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,900
I'm a cool guy who tried to force a woman

1386
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,980
to marry me against her will by imprisoning her dad.

1387
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,140
Yeah, I gaslighted her dad, it was great.

1388
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:51,980
I ate all of Griffin's eggs and spit on his car,

1389
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:53,900
and it's like, Jesus, dude.

1390
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,580
You know, here's the thing though, listen,

1391
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,700
I don't want to blow this whole thing wide open,

1392
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,900
but if you think about it,

1393
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,100
the beast also imprisoned Belle's dad

1394
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,700
in an attempt to try to force her to marry him.

1395
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,620
So it seems like both of them kind of suck.

1396
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,340
I mean, there should be maybe a bad Disney World

1397
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:14,020
where Gaston, the beast, the bad guy from Pocahontas,

1398
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,740
who was like real bad.

1399
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,060
Real, real, real bad, pretty bad.

1400
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:22,340
Not fun bad, like a lot of the, you know, Ursula.

1401
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,140
This is a different podcast.

1402
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,380
This is not our podcast.

1403
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,540
I mean, I just, it's a different park.

1404
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,740
It's Nasty Disney World where bad kids go.

1405
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,980
Nasty Disney World where all the villains are kept

1406
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,460
and the bad kids can elect to go to it.

1407
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:39,620
They are, they haven't been redeemed.

1408
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:42,740
You know what, it's sort of a heaven and hell situation.

1409
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,820
Are there still rides?

1410
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,620
Yes, the rides are way cooler.

1411
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,020
The rides are so much cooler,

1412
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,660
so much more dangerous and action packed.

1413
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:53,100
The food's all nachos, more or less just all,

1414
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,460
just big spicy beef nachos, pretty much all over.

1415
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,340
And you can just shit anywhere.

1416
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,660
It's Nasty Disney World.

1417
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,580
It's where all they,

1418
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:04,420
it's where good Disney World keeps all the mosquitoes.

1419
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,060
Listen, it's not pluses and minuses.

1420
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,380
The rides are cooler.

1421
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,580
There are mosquitoes everywhere.

1422
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,420
It's fine.

1423
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:13,020
Their mouse buddy Sid from Toy Story, it's cool.

1424
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:13,860
It's really cool.

1425
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,060
You get a paintball gun when you go in.

1426
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:16,980
And that's nice too,

1427
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,460
because then if you're an employee at regular Disney World

1428
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,300
and they're like,

1429
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,520
Todd, I noticed that you were taking 40 minute breaks

1430
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,340
instead of 30 minute breaks.

1431
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,980
You don't want to have to work Nasty Disney, do you?

1432
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,340
Yeah. No, of course not.

1433
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,580
But then it's okay,

1434
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,440
cause Jafar will sell you some skunk weed.

1435
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,440
It's not all bad.

1436
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,380
Folks, that's gonna do it for us.

1437
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:44,980
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

1438
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:48,980
If you came out to see us in San Francisco or Phoenix,

1439
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,740
thank you for coming out.

1440
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:55,300
Tragic news, or I guess, I don't know,

1441
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,220
depends on your perspective.

1442
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,540
Yeah, maybe you don't care.

1443
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,060
If at the Phoenix show,

1444
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,700
that audio was...

1445
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,660
Just fucking mulch.

1446
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,580
Just fucking mulch.

1447
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:09,260
So that show will never be released.

1448
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:13,020
That is your show to treasure and enjoy.

1449
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,020
If you made a secret pirate copy of it,

1450
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,500
please let us know,

1451
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,740
cause otherwise it's lost to the ether.

1452
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:23,500
So don't, sorry about that.

1453
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,860
But you know, it's a special show

1454
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,140
that you get to treasure in your heart now,

1455
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,900
and no one else will ever hear.

1456
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,220
But thank you for coming out.

1457
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,060
Like I mentioned,

1458
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,460
we do have some other appearances coming up.

1459
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,500
If you want to come see us,

1460
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,780

1461

We're doing like live read and graphic novel stuff in July.

1466
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:55,420
And then throughout July and August,

1467
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,780
some combination of us and our dad

1468
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,140
and the artist, Carrie Peach,

1469
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:00,620
are going to be stopping

1470
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,060
at our kind of local bookstore establishments

1471
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,420
for meet and greets and signings.

1472
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,700
So if you don't want to miss that,

1473
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,460

1474
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,380
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters

1475
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:12,300
for these for our theme song,

1476
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,140
It's a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1477
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,100
It is a, it's a choice cut.

1478
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,340
As we say in the music industry,

1479
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,260
you're gonna just love these tunes.

1480
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,420
And hey, thanks to MaxFun for having us on the network.

1482
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,620

You're gonna find something that you're gonna enjoy.

1484
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,620
Maybe it's Bubble,

1485
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,660
the new sci-fi sort of fiction podcast

1486
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,660
that Jordan Morris wrote

1487
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,220
and a bunch of folks starred in.

1488
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,780
We have guest spots in an episode

1489
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,260
that I don't think has come out yet,

1490
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:43,580
but it's a very fun show that I bet you're just gonna dig

1491
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,900
because everybody worked really hard on it.

1492
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,300
It's called Bubble and all that's at MaximumFun.org.

1493
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,820
I've done a couple quick guest spots.

1494
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,180
Well, I've done a couple of guest spots

1495
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:57,020
on a D&D live stream show called Dice Camera Action.

1496
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,340
It's from Wizards.

1497
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:01,860
You can find it twitch.tv slash D&D,

1498
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,820
or it's on the D&D YouTube channel.

1499
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,460
You can just search for Dice Camera Action.

1500
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,140
And it's just been a real blast.

1501
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,420
I brought Magnus back to play with them

1502
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,280
and it's been fun playing Magnus again

1503
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,760
and playing with these folks.

1504
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,740
And Chris Perkins is the DM

1505
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:17,020
and he's one of our inspirations.

1506
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,500
So I'm a big fan of it

1507
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,620
and I recommend everybody check it out.

1508
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,380
Yeah, how about that final?

1509
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,220
Hit me.

1510
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,260
This one was sent in by Allen.

1511
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:27,960
Also, it's Yahoo Answers user, Jack M who asks,

1512
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,380
I accidentally shifted the upper case.

1513
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,100
How do I get back to lower cases

1514
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,980
so my passwords will work?

1515
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:38,820
My name is Justin McElroy.

1516
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,220
I'm Travis McElroy.

1517
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,060
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1518
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,180
This has been my brother, my brother,

1519
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:45,020
may kiss your dad's around the lips.

1520
00:57:45,020 --> 00:58:12,540
I'm Travis McElroy and I'm Travis McElroy.

1521
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:15,900
Whether you are a parent or just know kids exist

1522
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,580
in the world, join us each week

1523
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:21,160
as we honestly share what it's like to be a parent.

1524
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,220
Turns out it isn't what we thought it would be.

1525
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,580
For example, stickers on car windows.

1526
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,800
It's no longer about what type of monster

1527
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,840
would let that happen

1528
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,880
and more like realizing you are that monster.

1529
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,060
So join us each week as we judge less, laugh more,

1530
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:38,260
and remind you that you are doing a great job.
