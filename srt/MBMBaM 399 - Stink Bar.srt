1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,280
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,960
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,640
I'm that sweet baby and 30 under 30 media boy Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,520
I've got it. The next branch of the expansion of the McElroy brothers franchise, we of course are

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:10,000
going to appear in the Trolls 2 film coming out in April 2020. We've got that already sort of locked

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,840
down. That's in the back. It's practically in the can. We didn't mention this, we've got an

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,880
episode of that show up if you want to listen to that about how we're going to be in Trolls 2.

12
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,280
But that that is then and happening. That's already in the books. The important thing is

13
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,480
that you don't rest on your laurels. It's the future past part of that ball.

14
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,520
It will have already been done. We're basically in Trolls 3 at this fucking point.

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,880
Yeah, well with the continuity and the story and shit, you know?

16
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,960
Yeah. We do, for what I'm talking about, we do need to

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:51,680
sort of watch on the profanity for a little bit. Because my thing is, a couple weeks ago,

18
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:00,400
Nickelodeon announced that he's coming back. Who? Blue. Or she? Blues or she? Blue's coming back,

19
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,440
folks. And that's the important thing that we want to talk about here.

20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,800
Blue of Blue's Clues?

21
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:11,360
Blue of Blue's Clues is coming back and they're looking for new Steve.

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:23,360
Yes. So you see sort of where I am talking about now. They're looking for new Steve. Now,

23
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,560
I know what you're saying. Joe is already new Steve. Well, that's fine. But Joe is Steve 2.

24
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,880
Now they're looking for Steve 3, the third Steve.

25
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,920
Joe's out? Joe's been out since O7 when the show was canceled.

26
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,920
Yeah. They solved the case. Blue got all the clues. They solved the murder.

27
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,680
They finally caught the murderer that murdered Blue's family. And now they're back for a new

28
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,280
run at Blue's Clues. And who's the new Steve gonna be? And I submit it is us, the McElroy brothers.

29
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,080
Now, when you say you submit, did you actually take any steps?

30
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,400
Of the secret, like, vision board? You submitted it to God and the universe and stuff?

31
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,160
I feel like I'm using all my sort of, like, God and vision quest praying that energy I'm

32
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,240
using on Trolls 2 currently. I want Nickelodeon to do this one because it's gonna make them a

33
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,960
lot of fucking dosh. Okay, Justin, what did we just say? What did we just say?

34
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,640
Yeah, again. Double damn it.

35
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,200
We'll just have to replace him with, like, meh.

36
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,760
Yeah, like the male. Every time we cuss in this episode, I'll edit in the male song.

37
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,280
Probably you won't, I would think.

38
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,840
No, because then the show would end up being four hours long.

39
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,200
It's a long ass song. It's a long butt. See, there it is. It's a very long,

40
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,680
here's the male, it never fails, it makes me wanna work with him.

41
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:59,840
It might be a little soon to start this, but let's start the negotiation with Nickelodeon.

42
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:09,840
We will cut it back to one f-word per episode. We will restrain ourselves to one f per episode.

43
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,400
And sometimes we'll hide it. We'll do it real quiet and fast and so the kiddos may not even

44
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,600
be like, here's the male, it never fails, fuck, it makes me want, and they may not even get that

45
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:32,800
it was there at all. Now, one problem that I found with Steve Quest, there are three boys on this

46
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,560
show. Yeah, on this one there's three. Oh, you know, I never think of us as separate people.

47
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,680
I know, but there's three boys and only, Steve is only the one boy.

48
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,960
So, we're gonna have to solve that first. Do you think like an Olsen twins thing?

49
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,960
No, let's see who's gonna be the best Steve. I'll be Blue first and Travis you be Steve

50
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,920
and Griffin you be a Clue, okay? Whenever you're ready.

51
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,560
What's that, Blue? I'm a skull on the ground.

52
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,000
What's that, Blue? A vicious murder?

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,160
What do you smell, Blue? Semen? Oh, no.

54
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,560
Someone got semen on the dang skull. Someone got semen on the fucking skull.

55
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,240
That's my one. There's your one.

56
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,840
Okay, very good. All right, now I'm Steve. I was about to have a big dramatic monologue

57
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,640
about how my parents were killed and this is bringing back too many memories.

58
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,760
But then I was gonna CSI that stuff and like, you interrupted me too soon.

59
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,600
I had a monologue memorized. Oh, great. Well, go ahead and perform that now.

60
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,280
I'll give you complete silence. Thank you.

61
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,720
Oh, no. I don't want this.

62
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:57,600
The semen, it reminds me of that terrible day in the alley when that person tried to mug my parents

63
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,160
and kill them and on that day I became Steve. I became the thing that scared me so I could scare

64
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,400
villains. Steve. I'm a Batman. You look in the mirror and you're like,

65
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,360
what scares me? Well, Steve. Steve.

66
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,160
Steve scares me. A Steve flew into the room.

67
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,600
I found the Steve trapped inside that old grandfather clock.

68
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,080
I fell into the old Steve Guttenberg cave behind our house. There were Steve's everywhere.

69
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,640
Chocoblock with Goots. Steve's. And on that day, that's when I became Steve.

70
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,520
Steve. Okay, that's very good. Griffin,

71
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,080
do you want to try being the Steve and I'll be a clue and Travis, you be Blue?

72
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes, I'm gonna be the reboot Blue though. This feels okay, but you saying that makes

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,440
me think that this is gonna be sort of a Travis-led skit.

74
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,520
What? How dare you, sir?

75
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,920
No, I feel like this is- Three classes at UCB.

76
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,280
Yeah. I'm ready to yes and you,

77
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,400
I'm gonna build you up. This really feels like it's gonna be

78
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,320
a Travis skit featuring Griffin. Okay, to be fair,

79
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,400
my Blue is going to speak English, but I will. Yeah, again, that's-

80
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,120
I will do basic Blue. I will be a basic Blue.

81
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,760
Let me try. All right. Hey, you kids want to learn some maths?

82
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,720
Today, we're gonna be talking about- Hey, stop it. Get out of here.

83
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,600
I'm talking and teaching the kids about multiplication. Dog?

84
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,560
Dog, I will not with you again. Not today. It's math day.

85
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:34,800
It's math day, dog. Get, get, get. I love you. I love you, but get.

86
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,800
It's math day, not dog day. That's mine. I'm done.

87
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Okay. That's very good.

88
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,400
Yeah, it's like he's very focused, mine is, and he doesn't have time to-

89
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,680
Oh, wait, hold on. Fuck. Okay, great. Thank you.

90
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Justin, you want to play? Yeah.

91
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
All right. Who wants to be- I'll be dog.

92
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,680
All right. We'll try to share a clue. Yeah.

93
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:05,680
Oh, my God. What's- Blue, what's wrong? Blue, what-

94
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,680
The Lego. I'm the Lego.

95
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Steve, say something funny. All right. I'm going to draw a picture of

96
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,680
a Lego in my notebook. No, a hospital.

97
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,680
Please free me from this shit prison. Guys, I'm drawing. Give me just a second.

98
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,680
Fuck. Oh, wait. I used yours. Sorry.

99
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,680
But it doesn't have his. All right. So that's fine.

100
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,680
Yeah, jeez, I think this one's a real surefire dinger.

101
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:49,680
Who do you think should be the ste- We'll have to vote. We'll put a poll up.

102
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,680
Yeah, yeah. We can't decide this. We got to leave it up to the listeners.

103
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,680
So if you look around on the internet, you'll find a poll about which of us should be Steve.

104
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,680
And then make sure to send the results of that poll to Nickelodeon.

105
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,680
Yes. All right.

106
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,680
I also have another branch for us, but we can talk about it later.

107
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,680
I think I've got an inroad at the Lifeway Christian bookstore.

108
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Oh, nice. Yeah, we can rap about that later. We'll do it off the air.

109
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,680
Perfect. This is an advice show where we try to help people.

110
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,680
I'm recovering from a cold, so if you hear me, drop off at any point.

111
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,680
The coughs are rough today. They're rough and ragged.

112
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,680
And I'm just hanging in there, folks. I'm just trying to stay alive.

113
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,680
Are we listening to our ailment? I've got two torn ACLs.

114
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
I feel great.

115
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,680
Okay. Podcasting's too hard. Blew them right the fuck out.

116
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,680
I don't feel bad. What about your scholarship?

117
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,680
Yeah, I'm worried about the scholarship, Trav. I don't think Purdue's going to have me.

118
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,680
What about your Steve audition?

119
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,680
Yeah, I don't think Purdue's going to have me on that one either.

120
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,680
So as a result of my wife's employer's strange bonus slash giveaway strategy,

121
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,680
I'm in possession of $35 gift cards to a grocery store chain.

122
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,680
And I don't know how to spend them. If I spend them all at once,

123
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,680
I'll surely earn the score under the cashier and impatient customers waiting behind me in the checkout lane.

124
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,680
If the checkout process is already stressful enough,

125
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,680
any advice on how to use these gift cards in a respectful yet efficient manner?

126
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,680
And that's from Gotta Get Rid of These Gift Cards in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

127
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Well, I went to that combination Babies R Us and Toys R Us over the weekend.

128
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,680
I think it's going over there.

129
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
Oh.

130
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Have you seen 28 Days Later?

131
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
Yeah.

132
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,680
Wait, that's not the romantic comedy with-

133
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,680
No, that's 28 Days with Sandra Bullock and Alan Tudyk.

134
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Talking about 28 Days-

135
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
I mean, I'm sure there's other people in it too, but those are the only two that matter.

136
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
And 28 Days Later is the sequel.

137
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
Right.

138
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
With zombies in it.

139
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,680
Where Alan Tudyk is a zombie and eats Sandra Bullock for the entire two hours.

140
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
We go there to get-

141
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
It's just that scene.

142
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,680
We go there to get baby food because they got the choice selection.

143
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,680
They got that gourmet shit, that Wolfgang-

144
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,680
They got that dank baby food.

145
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:16,680
That Wolfgang Puck genuine baby food that he cooks up in his kitchen full of.

146
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,680
And we pulled up in the parking lot and we're instantly like, oh no.

147
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,680
And we went ahead with our mission because baby gotta eat.

148
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,680
Baby gotta eat.

149
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,680
You can't just give the baby a hamburger from a Wendy's.

150
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,680
You have to give them the special stuff that Wolfgang's made for them.

151
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:45,680
And that checkout process, folks were bringing out some gift cards from 1983 that they have just been chilling on.

152
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,680
I watched somebody buy a stroller with approximately 15 gift cards.

153
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
It was horrible.

154
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,680
It was a get out of line and just go start over someplace else.

155
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,680
Nomadic sort of Oregon Trail method of finding a good aisle.

156
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,680
It was so bad.

157
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,680
Please do not be this person.

158
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,680
You have to find another strategy.

159
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,680
To continue a conversation that Griffin started long, long ago on this show.

160
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,680
It is only at those points when I seriously consider just shoplifting.

161
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,680
Mostly just to make it easier on the cashiers.

162
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
Like, you know what?

163
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
You're doing enough.

164
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
I'm just gonna-

165
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
I have this one thing.

166
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,680
I'm just gonna take it.

167
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
They're not gonna do inventory.

168
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
Very consider shoplifting.

169
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,680
Yeah.

170
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Well, especially they're going out of business.

171
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,680
What are they gonna do with it?

172
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Going out of business and they got fucked over by the whole corporate sort of architecture of Toys R Us.

173
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,680
And Jeffrey, he was in on it too.

174
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,680
No.

175
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,680
The execs got themselves a $14 million bonus.

176
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,680
Just made sure to get themselves a little thing.

177
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,680
A little taste.

178
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,680
A little taste of it.

179
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:52,680
Like, I mean, I think you can track it back to the fact that Toys R Us belligerently didn't open a website for about 20 years.

180
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
Just like, nah.

181
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,680
Yeah.

182
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,680
Nah, the web's a flash in the pan.

183
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
Kids are always gonna want to come into the store.

184
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
And then Jeffrey did an interview.

185
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,680
You can't ride a bike around the web.

186
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,680
And this is from a former Toys R Us employee.

187
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,680
If you're a Toys R Us staffer who's about to lose their gig, I fucking hear you.

188
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
Listen, it's not your fault.

189
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,680
I want you to leave that place with your head held high.

190
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,680
You're great.

191
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,680
If you have any training tapes there that you can steal for me, they were fucking hilarious.

192
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
Yeah.

193
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,680
You could steal some of those.

194
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
That would be glorious.

195
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,680
I mean, we know whose fault it is because Jeffrey, it wasn't Jeffrey.

196
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
It was some executive in the company.

197
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,680
But I think it's just sort of a shadow organization for Jeffrey's Dark Machinations.

198
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,680
They did an interview where he did blame millennials for not having enough kids who buy all the toys.

199
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,680
So thank you on that one.

200
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
We made sure to get one in there right.

201
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,680
Oh, it's three seconds left in the last round.

202
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,680
Jeffrey comes out swinging with one last punch.

203
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
At millennials for not buying enough toys.

204
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,680
Eat my entire asshole, shithead giraffe.

205
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,680
Especially, hey Jeffrey, millennials don't need kids to buy toys.

206
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,680
They buy toys for themselves.

207
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,680
Buy them like wild.

208
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Okay, Griffin, I need you to clarify something.

209
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
Take me inside the bit for a second.

210
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,680
You seem to be getting pretty worked up about an interview you imagined that Jeffrey the giraffe gave.

211
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,680
It wasn't Jeffrey the giraffe.

212
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,680
It wasn't Jeffrey the giraffe, like the CEO of Toys R Us or whatever actually said this.

213
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,680
Actually said this.

214
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Said this thing.

215
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
Said this dumb dumb thing.

216
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
Oh, okay, now I understand.

217
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,680
Hey, it's because your website fucking sucks and you didn't open one for a hundred years.

218
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
Okay, okay, okay.

219
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,680
Also, adult toys.

220
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,680
Adult toys, yeah.

221
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,680
You have Babies R Us, you have Toys R Us, how about like Sins R Us?

222
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,680
Here are the-

223
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,680
Don't go down that aisle, Derek.

224
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,680
Derek, you stay away from the curtain dial, Derek.

225
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,680
That's for Mommy and Daddy.

226
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,680
That's Toys R Us.

227
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,680
That's Toys number four us.

228
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,680
And there's a bouncer.

229
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,680
It's a person in a big Jeffrey outfit.

230
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,680
He's got a nightstick because the kids are curious.

231
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,680
How is this person going to spend their gift cards?

232
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,680
I mean, you could do it very slowly.

233
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
Just every time you go into the grocery store, you burn.

234
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,680
I mean, I think you could burn three, right?

235
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,680
And not be too much of an impediment, right?

236
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
Three is fine.

237
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
Three's still pretty bad.

238
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,680
Three's still pretty bad.

239
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
What if you did it like a bit?

240
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Like a magic trick where you're like, what?

241
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,680
And just kept pulling them from different pockets all over your person?

242
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:25,680
Oh my God, Travis, that would make their ramability with my shopping cart full of baby food so much higher.

243
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,680
If you did it well, I think the cashier would enjoy it at least.

244
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,680
How many more can there be?

245
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,680
And then in the last one, you just look them square in the eye and say, that's it.

246
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
Oh shit.

247
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
You got 30 gift cards.

248
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Yes.

249
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,680
The cashier isn't going to care.

250
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
I've watched Extreme Couponing.

251
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
The cashier don't give a shit.

252
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,680
Unless they got a break coming up and that, you know, go ahead and ask.

253
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
They don't care.

254
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,680
They're leaving at five regardless.

255
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,680
One customer, 20 customers, no skin off their nose.

256
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,680
So the person you got to worry about like from a society point of view is the person behind you in line.

257
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,680
Here's what you're going to do.

258
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,680
You ready for this?

259
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:07,680
You go ahead and use 10 of your gift cards, but you give the person waiting behind you one of them.

260
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
There it is.

261
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,680
You say, listen, I'm about to do something annoying, but I'm going to give you this gift card.

262
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,680
It's five bucks.

263
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,680
If you would just kick it with me for like five to seven minutes while I use these crazy gift cards,

264
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,680
this wild number of gift cards I've collected, then you are also going to benefit.

265
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,680
So like we're all going to win here.

266
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,680
That's good.

267
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,680
We're going to bring in their step.

268
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,680
Oh, five bucks off?

269
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,680
I could buy myself a whole box of Gushers or something.

270
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,680
Sure.

271
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,680
Gushers don't come in boxes.

272
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,680
What you just said is wild.

273
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,680
And the other wild thing you said.

274
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,680
Excuse me.

275
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,680
The six pack, 12 pack, and 20 pack of Gushers packages are all collected in one single collected box.

276
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:53,680
As much as you might like up in them and just have packages of Gushers strewn about your home like some sort of pack rat,

277
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,680
the Gushers are sold in boxes in grocery stores.

278
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
That is fair.

279
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,680
That is fair.

280
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,680
You did say something wild and that the cashier won't care about this situation.

281
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,680
It won't care.

282
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,680
I don't know if you've ever seen an episode of extreme couponing.

283
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,680
I just said that I did.

284
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,680
I clarified while I was talking.

285
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,680
Every episode of extreme couponing is also in secret an episode of making a murderer.

286
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,680
Because when somebody comes to these people and says like, here's 50 coupons, get to work.

287
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,680
This is your next hour and you are not going to know how to handle this situation.

288
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,680
And you are definitely going to think that I am fucking taking the house on this one.

289
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,680
And that you will definitely get fired if you scan in the wrong shit.

290
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,680
And that you will definitely get fired because you have given me all this toilet paper for free.

291
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:41,680
The look in those people's eyes is one of just like, it's just complete murder.

292
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
Just absolute murder.

293
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:51,680
So you have to find a way to maybe, first of all, let's talk about the science of these cards.

294
00:17:51,680 --> 00:18:00,680
If you just rub them all together real hard, does the money go from one to the other?

295
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,680
Probably not, right?

296
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,680
Well, you don't know until you try, Griffin.

297
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,680
Or what if you tape them all together?

298
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,680
Tape them all together, try to swipe them all through once.

299
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:14,680
I mean, I think this is what Bitcoin actually is.

300
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:22,680
Is there some way for you to slide it through a dongle and now it's Bitcoin?

301
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,680
And then you take the Bitcoin to the Sam's Club?

302
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Can you use Bitcoin at Sam's Club?

303
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
They love it.

304
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,680
Yeah, they love their cryptocurrencies.

305
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,680
Yeah, I mean, you could just also go there.

306
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,680
I don't like to use cryptocurrency because it seems too spooky to me.

307
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,680
Yeah, it is very spooky.

308
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,680
I don't know anything about it except it's got crypt in there.

309
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,680
Yeah, I mean, they're covered in cobwebs and spiders and each one has a little ghoul inside of it.

310
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,680
I don't fuck with that.

311
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,680
But can you go to a store right when it opens and say, here's $35 gift cards.

312
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,680
I would like to use these to purchase one $150 gift card.

313
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Ooh.

314
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,680
And then you're done, then you're free.

315
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,680
It's going to be a bad morning, and don't get me wrong, it will take an entire morning, 9 to noon.

316
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,680
And maybe you give a few to the employee.

317
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,680
That's insulting, I feel like, maybe.

318
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,680
You got to throw them away.

319
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,680
It is not worth it.

320
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,680
There's no suggestion we can give you that it's better than throwing them in the garbage.

321
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:32,680
Or melt them into some kind of beautiful statue and just know that it is inherently worth $150.

322
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,680
Oh, yeah.

323
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,680
And it's a protest statue against the Toys R Us.

324
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,680
And it's the giraffe, but he looks like a big idiot.

325
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Morgan Davey sent in this Yahoo, keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

326
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,680
It's Yahoo Answers user Carol who asks,

327
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:54,680
How come Dorothy's dress never got dirty all the way to Oz?

328
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
Huh.

329
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,680
Got some answers on this one, but it's an interesting concept.

330
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,680
This is a young woman.

331
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Lives on a farm, should have been dirty before the whole thing.

332
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Before this whole zany, improbable adventure even got started.

333
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,680
Also got caught up in a tornado in Kansas.

334
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,680
That's dusty work, friends.

335
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:20,680
She should have been just sort of coated in a thin layer of grime before she even rolled up.

336
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,680
And then the scarecrow would have been like,

337
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:28,680
Whoa, my brain, or whoa, you got a little dirt on you.

338
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,680
You cool or what's going on?

339
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,680
But then certainly as she traipsed through the poppy fields and,

340
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:43,680
you know, the dirt zone, the dirt village and muddy swamp.

341
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
And the candy cane forest.

342
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,680
The candy cane forest.

343
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,680
Can you imagine the candy cane forest?

344
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,680
The debris on one of those candy canes.

345
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
Don't drop lane.

346
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,680
You don't actually see the monkeys hurling their own feces,

347
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,680
but we do have to assume.

348
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,680
It's implied.

349
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
I think by the time she shows up to the Emerald City,

350
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:11,680
her and her squad of companions should just be yucky.

351
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,680
Well, they are.

352
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
I'm sorry.

353
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
I have to save us from tweets.

354
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
They are.

355
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,680
They go through a whole cleanup process at the Emerald City.

356
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,680
There's wash, wash, wash, scrub, scrub, scrub.

357
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:28,680
It's true, there aren't a lot of movies where our characters arrive

358
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,680
at the paradise that they've been pursuing,

359
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
and the very first thing that has to happen is like,

360
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
y'all stink like shit.

361
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,680
You cannot even be in our whole thing right now.

362
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
Ew, gross.

363
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,680
Yeah, you're so disgusting.

364
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Oh, hey, this is Utopia, and you all are doo-doo.

365
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,680
Yeah, you're like, can we talk to the, you can talk to no one.

366
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,680
You can talk to this brush.

367
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,680
Open up, because you are so wack right now.

368
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,680
I can taste your sweat.

369
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,680
You have been walking through this wonderland for days,

370
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,680
and I can taste the sweat on you, and on the Tin Man, which is wild.

371
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,680
Did trees throw apples at you, and then maybe some monkey shit on you?

372
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,680
What are you doing?

373
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,680
What are you doing here, Dorothy?

374
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,680
I love the Lord of the Rings movies for so many reasons.

375
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Also, just looking at Orlando Bloom puts me at ease.

376
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
They're so long.

377
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,680
They're very long, and you get a lot of...

378
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,680
One of the best snaps I ever had.

379
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,680
A lot of bloom out of those features.

380
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,680
That's not to say the Lord of the Rings movies are boring.

381
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,680
Just one time I went to a late night showing,

382
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,680
I fell asleep in the middle of the first one.

383
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,680
It was the third time I'd seen it.

384
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,680
And I fell asleep, and I slept so good.

385
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,680
But here's what I love.

386
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Into the trilogy, climbing Mount Doom,

387
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,680
little Samji and Frodo.

388
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Samji and Frodo.

389
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,680
Samji and Frodo.

390
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,680
These two boys are so fucking nasty.

391
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,680
Do you remember?

392
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Covered in grime and stink, and I can feel the stink through the film,

393
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,680
through the celluloid.

394
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,680
I know these boys reek, and I know they're fucking filthy pigs.

395
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,680
And I love it, because it's like, now that's fantasy.

396
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,680
Now I'm taken away.

397
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,680
They would get filthy, nasty, dirty, eating raw fish with their friend Gollum.

398
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,680
Filthy, stinky, gross pustules of boys.

399
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,680
Stinky, gross, nasty pigs.

400
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,680
And I love that.

401
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
And I love it.

402
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,680
Orlando Bloom, they never get him dirty.

403
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,680
And I also think that's a good creative choice from Peter Jackson,

404
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,680
because I think they did put the stink makeup on him.

405
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,680
And Peter Jackson was like,

406
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,680
nobody's going to fucking believe this.

407
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
I want that actually in every movie.

408
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,680
The effect that they do in Lord of the Rings,

409
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,680
they cut between dirty ranger man and then the elves.

410
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,680
And the elves are glowing.

411
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,680
They are transcendent.

412
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,680
And it cuts back to dirty man.

413
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,680
And then it's like,

414
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,680
just very clearly, this person has not been stinking themselves up

415
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,680
for the last 24 hours.

416
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,680
There's no way to communicate the stink through the film.

417
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,680
And I think that smell-o-vision is a bad joke.

418
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,680
And I think that stink lines,

419
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,680
we reference that in virtually every episode of every podcast we do.

420
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,680
There's a filter, like just a brown filter.

421
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,680
Oh, a stink.

422
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,680
Well, the whole movie kind of has a stink filter on it already.

423
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,680
Gandalf stunk so fucking bad,

424
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,680
that in order to communicate it, they had to kill him.

425
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,680
And then change his name.

426
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
They're like, hey, it's Gandalf the Great.

427
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,680
Don't call me by my stink name.

428
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,680
I have a new clean boy name that I want you to call me by.

429
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,680
Gandalf the White, because I smell great,

430
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,680
and I'm not filthy anymore.

431
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,680
It's kind of how much that dude stank from his tobacco smoke.

432
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,680
And his big fight with the fireman.

433
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,680
Adventure dirt.

434
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,680
Don't you always think by the end of a James Bond movie,

435
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,680
James Bond probably smells like shit, right?

436
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,680
It fucking stinks.

437
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
Absolutely.

438
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,680
So many of these characters, don't get me wrong,

439
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,680
he probably still has a hint of aftershave

440
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,680
and deodorant and cologne and stuff.

441
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,680
But also, he's been tied up.

442
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,680
He's been sweating.

443
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,680
He's been fighting people in the mud and dirt and stuff.

444
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,680
He probably, underneath his veneer of grooming,

445
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,680
stinks like shit.

446
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,680
Let me hit you guys with this.

447
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,680
I just had a killer idea.

448
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,680
The McElroy Brothers movie UI.

449
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,680
And this is a UI that we will put onto movies.

450
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,680
And not as like a fun thing that you get

451
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,680
and you download it and you listen to it later,

452
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,680
like riff tracks.

453
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,680
I'm talking about this is baked into the cinematic release.

454
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,680
And it shows a stink meter on the screen

455
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,680
as they go along.

456
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,680
And we could do this with other stuff, too.

457
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,680
You can drop it back down if there's a scene of them

458
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,680
washing their hands.

459
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,680
On that scene, that always happens where it's like,

460
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,680
oh, I'm so stressed out by these terrorists or whatever.

461
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,680
And they go splash water in their face.

462
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,680
It just drops down like five percent.

463
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,680
The stink meter goes down a little bit.

464
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,680
And then we can have kind of pop-up video

465
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,680
implied between these two scenes.

466
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,680
They change clothes.

467
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,680
And that, or in The Lord of the Rings.

468
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,680
These two boys are climbing up the mountain

469
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,680
and they're crying because they love each other so much.

470
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,680
And their stink meter is all the way full.

471
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,680
And imagine the...

472
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,680
Sorry.

473
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,680
I'm getting choked up thinking about it.

474
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,680
The emotional impact.

475
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,680
Knowing these boys stink so bad.

476
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,680
And the journey they've gone through together.

477
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,680
And the way they support each other.

478
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
It's powerful.

479
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,680
And they still hug even though they stink

480
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,680
like eight kinds of shit.

481
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,680
I think that would make the end of Die Hard

482
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
even more sort of moving.

483
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Because if you watch Die Hard,

484
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,680
before Hans Gruber even hits the ground,

485
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,680
Holly basically is like enveloped John McClane

486
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
in the most passionate embrace.

487
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,680
This motherfucker has been crawling around

488
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,680
a dirty building, bleeding everywhere.

489
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,680
In the red.

490
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
His tank top literally goes from white to like green.

491
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,680
It goes from white to like green

492
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,680
by the end of the movie.

493
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,680
It is kind of the first stink meter.

494
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,680
It's his tank top in that movie.

495
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,680
It's like a lit mist has to stink like shit.

496
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,680
There's just no...

497
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,680
The only movie I've ever seen actually...

498
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,680
The Jerk deals with this.

499
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,680
I guess a little bit.

500
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,680
When Bernadette Peters reunites with Steve Martin,

501
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,680
she tells him he fucking stinks.

502
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,680
And he needs to go sit in a different car.

503
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,680
Thank you. Thank you Bernadette.

504
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,680
Thank you for being brave enough.

505
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,680
And then you watch a movie like Hope Flows.

506
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,680
And that stink meter never really...

507
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,680
What if it started off high?

508
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,680
And you're like, oh it turns out this whole time

509
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,680
Harry Connors Jr.'s character stank like shit

510
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,680
from the beginning of the movie on.

511
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,680
I think it's just low the whole time,

512
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,680
but it is there letting you know

513
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,680
these characters do not stink.

514
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,680
What about if like in phenomenon, right?

515
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,680
Like, oh it's amazing.

516
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,680
John Travolta's character can like levitate stuff.

517
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,680
He does stink like doo doo.

518
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,680
And it's just things that we don't know.

519
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,680
Things we never knew about the characters

520
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,680
that gives them a much richer story.

521
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,680
And then we can do this with all kinds of meters.

522
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
We can have full blown Sims moodlets on the screen

523
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,680
where it's just like a horny meter.

524
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,680
And that one's going up and you're like,

525
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,680
uh oh, here comes, here comes, here comes.

526
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,680
And hungry meter.

527
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Hey, why is Hans Gruber being such a dick?

528
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,680
Oh, he's hungry.

529
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,680
You see John McClane shoot three guys

530
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,680
and his horny meter goes up and it's like, damn, John.

531
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
Whoa.

532
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Hey, Johnny.

533
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,680
He's climbing through the vents and you're like,

534
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
oh man, this seems really scary.

535
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
But his horny meter's off the charts.

536
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,680
And it's like being in the small vent

537
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,680
makes you very horny, John.

538
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,680
Oh no, Gruber's going to kill Ellis.

539
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,680
John? Hey, John, what's up, dude?

540
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Oh, dude.

541
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
I shot a kid.

542
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Whoa.

543
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,680
His hog is wild right now.

544
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Oh no.

545
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,680
As Hans Gruber is just

546
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,680
falling to his death, it's just getting

547
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,680
higher and higher and higher.

548
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,680
It catches him.

549
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
Like, I was the kid.

550
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,680
That's why I did all of it.

551
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,680
It turned out.

552
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,680
Hans Gruber hits the horny meter on his way down

553
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,680
and bounces off.

554
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,680
That's so great.

555
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,680
Oh my god, we can include this in every film.

556
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
And then Die Hard 8,

557
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,680
he's fucking tied to a chair or whatever

558
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,680
with a room full of bad guys.

559
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,680
And he's like, you're outnumbered.

560
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,680
And he breaks the ropes.

561
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,680
And I'm like, okay, you broke the ropes, now what?

562
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,680
And he reaches down and he grabs the horny meter

563
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,680
in one hand and the stink meter in the other hand

564
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,680
and he kills them all with it.

565
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
You can do that once

566
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
in Hot Sharts Part 3.

567
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
In the scary movie 13.

568
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,680
You can do it once before the whole convention

569
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
is like, yeah, we get it.

570
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,680
We've seen that before.

571
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,680
Fuck.

572
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,680
Let's take a quick break right now

573
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,680
to hear from our sponsors

574
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,680
in a little segment we like to call

575
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,680
The Money Zone.

576
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,680
Hey, I want to tell everybody about Blue Apron

577
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,680
if you wouldn't mind me talking about Blue Apron for a little bit.

578
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,680
Yeah.

579
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,680
They're really cool.

580
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,680
They deliver you boxes and the boxes got stuff in them

581
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,680
and I've used it for a while

582
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,680
and it taught me how to cook

583
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,680
and that's a very valuable skill that I treasure

584
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,680
and so I treasure Blue Apron

585
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,680
and the meals are very, very tasty

586
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,680
and I like it just a lot.

587
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,680
You open a beach box and it's like, what's even in here?

588
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,680
I don't know.

589
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,680
Except you do know because you can pick it

590
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,680
from a list of recipe options.

591
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,680
But anyway, they're the leading

592
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,680
meal kit delivery service in the US.

593
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,680
They've got incredible ingredients and chef designed recipes

594
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,680
like quick bucatini with broccoli

595
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,680
and chorino cheese and Italian style shrimp

596
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,680
and sweet pepper.

597
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,680
They let you see what the power of food can do.

598
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
They got fresh, non-GMO, pre-portioned ingredients

599
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
and step-by-step recipes.

600
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
They deliver right to your door and can be cooked in under 45 minutes.

601
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,680
There's 12 new recipes each week

602
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,680
based on what's in season

603
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,680
and all the recipes are designed by Blue Apron's

604
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,680
in-house culinary team.

605
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,680

Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

611
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,680
I was gonna make a joke about like what's in the box

612
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,680
and then I started thinking about the stink meter

613
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,680
on 7.

614
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
Oh my god. Oh come on.

615
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,680
It'd be off the charts.

616
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,680
They would need a second stink meter.

617
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,680
It would be like stink meter and then right below that

618
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
just be like, I don't know guys, it was too big.

619
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,680
The limit break stink meter.

620
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Limit break, yeah.

621
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,680
Some did an omni slash of the stink.

622
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,680
I wanna tell you about stamps.com.

626
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,680
I'm lazy.

627
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,680
I'm right now looking at a thing

628
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,680

Friends of Zero Life become a little

654
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,680
mundane. Yes. Then join us for

655
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,680
a bit of the arcane. Whoa.

656
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,680
The mundane and the arcane

657
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,680
is a homebrew D&D 5E

658
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,680
podcast focused on

659
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,680
expansive world building, intensive role playing

660
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,680
and very good puns. Now I hear what

661
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,680
you're thinking. Blah.

662
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,680
But trust me, maybe it'll

663
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,680
be good. Have your imagination tickle

664
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,680
by a tickle dungeon minstrel.

665
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,680
That was fucking whack dude.

666
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,680
Clever girls and troublesome twins with

667
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,680
sticky fingers. No the joke

668
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,680
there was that we

669
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,680
also do one of these. What? Yeah.

670
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,680
We used to. We used to

671
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,680
do a D&D podcast. But I'm

672
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,680
saying that was the joke. It was like

673
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
because we used to do one. Oh.

674
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
You know what I mean? It wasn't a great joke but

675
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,680
there'll be better ones on the mundane

676
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,680
and the arcane. Would you find anywhere

677
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
that you find fine podcasts?

678
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,680
They come out every

679
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,680
other Wednesday. Do they?

680
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,680
They do. It says it here.

681
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,680
Geez you swinging a miss bud.

682
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
Our boy is sickly.

683
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,680
I know. I'm trying to. I'm

684
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,680
hanging in there. Give me another shot. Please put

685
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
me in coach. No I'm going to read this next one.

686
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
I don't trust you anymore. This is Jumbotron.

687
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,680
It was for Anna Whiteside

688
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,680
and Michael Watson.

689
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
And it's from Loretta and

690
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Atticus who say Meow Meow

691
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
Meow. Meow Meow.

692
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,680
And there's a translation here but I don't

693
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,680
think we need to read it because I feel like folks really

694
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,680
sort of got the nug of that one.

695
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,680
But I'll do it anyway. Translation.

696
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,680
Happy two year wedding anniversary

697
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,680
and thank you for feeding us so much.

698
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,680
We are both overweight. Now here's the weird thing.

699
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
Loretta and Atticus are their kids.

700
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,680
Yeah. They're feral.

701
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,680
No these are two kitties.

702
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,680
And I think

703
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,680
these kitties are

704
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,680
beautiful and I think

705
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,680
love the skin you're in. Or the fur

706
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,680
that you're in. And that's all I have to say about that.

707
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,680
Skin and cats Griffin.

708
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,680
You're the one who did that so. What?

709
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,680
There's a message. The next message is

710
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,680
from Kelly and it's from Maureen.

711
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,680
It's not from both of them

712
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,680
so it's two one

713
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,680
We are really firing on all

714
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,680
Don't say we. Don't say we. I'm bringing

715
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,680
my fucking A game

716
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,680
100 percent batting average

717
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,680
and you two are just dropping the ball.

718
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,680
Do you want to start the episode over again?

719
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,680
I'm Emile's brother. This is

720
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,680
for Maureen.

721
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,680
It's from

722
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
Kelly.

723
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
Hello beautiful. Happy two year

724
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
anniversary. I'm so lucky

725
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,680
to be your girlfriend. I wouldn't

726
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,680
trade a moment of our time together.

727
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
Thanks for putting up with my haunted

728
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
doll collection. It's hard to believe

729
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
that by the time the brothers read this

730
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
we'll have seen them in person at least

731
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,680
once. Lots of love

732
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,680
Kelly.

733
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
LOL.

734
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,680
You say you wouldn't trade a moment of your time together. That's fine.

735
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,680
But what about for these

736
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
eight rubies?

737
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
And I hold out eight magic

738
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
rubies. Not

739
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,680
the magical rubies Griffin. That's our family's

740
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,680
inheritance. I will

741
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
take your most precious day.

742
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,680
It shall be mine.

743
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
Taste the rubies.

744
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,680
They're real. They're skittles.

745
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,680
Tastes like rubies, don't it?

746
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,680
My name is Adam and I love Storybreak.

747
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,680
I'm Megan and I love My Bim Bam.

748
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,680
What really first got me into the show

749
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,680
was the idea of creating

750
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,680
a whole story out of a very simple concept.

751
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
I super love haunted

752
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,680
doll watch. I just want to see what they come up

753
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,680
with next. I realized I was

754
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
listening to almost every podcast you guys

755
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
put out. But when I realized I was

756
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
consuming almost everything you produced

757
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
I felt that it was like unfair of me

758
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,680
not to give you something because you

759
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,680
were giving me so much. Honestly

760
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
Maximum Fun, they get me through my work week.

761
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
It makes me laugh every day nearly getting

762
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
several cries.

763
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
That's

764
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,680
on me. These are listeners

765
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,680
just like you and they support Storybreak

766
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
and my brother, my brother and me with a Max Fun

767
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,680
membership. The 2018

768
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,680
Max Fun Drive is April 2nd through 13th

769
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,680
and if you want to support your favorite shows

770
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,680
too it is the best time to

771
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
sign up or upgrade your membership.

772
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,680
Just tune in starting April 2nd and we'll give you

773
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,680
all the details.

774
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,680
Here's another question.

775
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,680
I

776
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
only did one question last time.

777
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,680
Well we talked a long time about

778
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,680
the stink UI on movies.

779
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,680
Well I'm going to stop

780
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,680
feeling bad about stuff like that because honestly

781
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,680
that's valuable.

782
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,680
That's valuable.

783
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,680
That's where our

784
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,680
profits are going to come from.

785
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,680
Do you know what I'm saying?

786
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
That's something. Are you talking about

787
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,680
like our question to minute ratio?

788
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,680
We need to get that as low as

789
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,680
possible. That's where the profit comes from?

790
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,680
Because we're only spending money on one or two

791
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,680
questions an episode now.

792
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,680
You know it's got low overhead.

793
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,680
Yes. Like those

794
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,680
we have to pay so much for

795
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,680
and the fewer we use

796
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,680
the better it is.

797
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,680
I work at a job where I'm often

798
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,680
traveling for long periods of time with my

799
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,680
boss in the car. I'm not a chatty

800
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,680
guy so this often means long stretches

801
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
of time where we sit in silence.

802
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,680
I'm actually okay with this but I still feel like

803
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,680
I should probably do something about it.

804
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,680
How can I make our drives more interesting

805
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,680
without jeopardizing my career?

806
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,680
That's from Taciturn in transit.

807
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,680
Well maybe there's something you could both

808
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,680
listen to that you would enjoy

809
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,680
both sharing and enjoying.

810
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,680
This is literally it.

811
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,680
This is why we do what we do.

812
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,680
This is why we do the thing we do.

813
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,680
Are you talking about like a book on tape?

814
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,680
No. No. I'm not.

815
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,680
I'm talking about like Star Trek novels.

816
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,680
There's one I think all about the Q-contemnum

817
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,680
that Dad made us listen to once.

818
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,680
Sorry can you just say that word one more time?

819
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,680
The Q-contemnum.

820
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,680
Laughter

821
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,680
You know.

822
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,680
Yeah. There's the Red Rising series.

823
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,680
The new one of those. Iron Gold

824
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,680
just popped off. Fourth one in that series.

825
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,680
It's great. They got four different

826
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,680
sort of narratives. No! Podcasts!

827
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,680
Just get a podcast and listen to it.

828
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,680
Find some shared interest

829
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,680
and enjoy it together.

830
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,680
And then afterwards you make a little conversation about it.

831
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,680
It's possible though. It's why we do what we do.

832
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,680
I take this very personally.

833
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,680
Getting people out of

834
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,680
conversations is the main

835
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,680
thing that we do. Whether it's a conversation

836
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,680
that you will have with yourself in your

837
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,680
brain and can't stop having no matter what

838
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,680
or a conversation that you have with someone else

839
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,680
we are there to have the conversation

840
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,680
for you so you don't have to do the heavy lifting.

841
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,680
That is why we are here every single week

842
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,680
for you to avoid

843
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,680
chatting. But this is the question.

844
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,680
The question I have is when you say sit in silence

845
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,680
do you mean literally?

846
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,680
Do you like no music

847
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,680
no podcast

848
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,680
nothing on? Or you just mean that's

849
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,680
going and you feel like you should be talking?

850
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,680
Because you are worried

851
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,680
about nothing. If music or

852
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,680
a podcast or something is playing

853
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,680
that's what you do.

854
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,680
You say music but is there

855
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,680
anything? Nothing.

856
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,680
Anything more touch and go

857
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,680
than when you get into

858
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,680
somebody else's car and they are like

859
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,680
I'm going to turn on some tunes.

860
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,680
In that moment I am suspended

861
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,680
in the fear dimension

862
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,680
because I don't know what the fuck they are

863
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,680
going to put on. No way.

864
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,680
It ain't going to be my music.

865
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,680
The inverse is maybe

866
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,680
the fear dimension inside

867
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,680
the fear dimension. It is the sunken place

868
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,680
of just like hey put something

869
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,680
on and it's like

870
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,680
do you like chip

871
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,680
tunes?

872
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,680
And not only that

873
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,680
I also guess that when it comes down to it

874
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,680
listening to music is rarely a

875
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,680
like passive thing.

876
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,680
It becomes performative so

877
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,680
quickly of like I

878
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,680
am enjoying, see how much I am enjoying

879
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,680
this. I have

880
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,680
a friend named Badkins and

881
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,680
I remember distinctly he was at

882
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,680
our place in Chicago when I was living there

883
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,680
just visiting and he was like

884
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,680
my roommate had a record player with like

885
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,680
an AV hookup and I had my

886
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,680
iPod or whatever plugged in

887
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,680
and he was like hey play something. And I was like

888
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
okay my friend Badkins is kind of a music

889
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
aficionado. Let's see what I should put

890
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,680
on. And I put on what I was most recently listening to

891
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
which I think was one of those old team

892
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,680
teamwork mashups. He takes like

893
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,680
cool game music and then

894
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,680
puts like hip hop and

895
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,680
stuff over it.

896
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,680
And I put it on and he was like ah

897
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,680
this stinks. And I was like this is

898
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,680
the first time that I have ever been like

899
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,680
in a situation where somebody is like hey put

900
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,680
on some music. I put something on and they were instantly

901
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,680
like you picked, you chose wrong.

902
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,680
You picked wrong. This is

903
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,680
bad music.

904
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,680
The first time I ever went on, and this is

905
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,680
more about

906
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,680
us than the Smurls really

907
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,680
but the first time I ever went

908
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,680
on a road trip with them they

909
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,680
didn't turn on

910
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,680
the radio

911
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,680
because they

912
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
were, and it

913
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,680
took me a while to understand

914
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,680
like why

915
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,680
no one turned on the radio

916
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,680
literally before

917
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,680
you pull out of the driveway

918
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,680
or engage the parking

919
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,680
brake or anything. Like you just disengage

920
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,680
the parking brake. You just turn on the

921
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,680
radio. Nothing. Like they didn't turn

922
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,680
it on at all.

923
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,680
And eventually I realized I looked around in sort of

924
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,680
dawning horror as they continued to

925
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,680
chat idly and not

926
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,680
turn on the radio that the plan

927
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,680
was to

928
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,680
chat idly.

929
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,680
For the entirety

930
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,680
of the journey.

931
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,680
Where's the buffer? Where's the buffers?

932
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,680
Where's the buffet?

933
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,680
I mean anything.

934
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,680
I gotta have my tunes man. How am I supposed to

935
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,680
jam back here?

936
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,680
Maybe this is about us because like

937
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,680
even now when Teresa and I get in the

938
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,680
car, even if we're going somewhere five

939
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,680
minutes away, I won't

940
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,680
move the car until like a podcast

941
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,680
is playing our music or something and

942
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,680
she's like we're going to be there in five minutes.

943
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,680
And I'm like yes that is five minutes of

944
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,680
my life. That is five

945
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,680
minutes of crushing

946
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,680
nothingness.

947
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,680
Music's my soul dude.

948
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,680
I've been thinking about it. Music's my fucking

949
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,680
heart and my soul. Thank you.

950
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
I live

951
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,680
for the tunes.

952
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,680
I just like podcasts I guess.

953
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,680
I've been re-listening to Magic Tavern

954
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,680
starting at the beginning.

955
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,680
I mean like a week of 75 episodes in

956
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,680
and that drive time, hey that drive

957
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,680
time, that's time when I can be

958
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,680
accomplishing my listening goals.

959
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,680
You know? Thank you.

960
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,680
That's time for me.

961
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,680
They can buy a fucking Jumbotron.

962
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,680
There's much free advertisement on YouTube.

963
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,680
Well I was on an episode of it.

964
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,680
Here's a yahoo.

965
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,680
Here's a yahoo sent in by Lauren McGregor.

966
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,680
And if this is too similar to one we did

967
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,680
last week please just let me know. I can't

968
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,680
remember last week's episode. Okay yahoo

969
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,680
answers user Brianna asks,

970
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,680
how did the person that invented the microscope

971
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,680
think of the microscope?

972
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,680
Whoa. We had the one last week that was

973
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,680
how did the person who invented the clock know what time

974
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,680
it was? And I'm just so curious

975
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,680
I guess about inventions.

976
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,680
And this one really drills down into it.

977
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
In that somebody invented a microscope

978
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,680
and then. It's like they looked at something

979
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,680
and thought I want to see that bigger

980
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,680
but I'm not going to move my head closer.

981
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,680
Yeah it's like somebody made a telescope

982
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,680
and they were like this lets you look

983
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,680
up at the stars but it makes them

984
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,680
real big in your eye. And you're like

985
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,680
well I want to do that for

986
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,680
my blood.

987
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,680
What I assume is that

988
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,680
they got

989
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,680
a telescope

990
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,680
and they're like this looks at big

991
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,680
stuff that's far away. And the

992
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,680
they looked at a slide

993
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,680
that they had prepared. And

994
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,680
why did someone know how to prepare a slide before the invention

995
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,680
of microscopes?

996
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,680
Don't worry about it. So they

997
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,680
just got the telescope and they turned it upside down

998
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,680
and then they looked at it and they

999
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,680
were like well this is

1000
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,680
this is nothing. And nothing happened

1001
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,680
but they were like but there's something like

1002
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,680
this that we could

1003
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,680
definitely make work. But they had to

1004
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,680
know that there was something in there.

1005
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,680
So like they had a

1006
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,680
slide with blood on it and they were like

1007
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,680
I bet there's

1008
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,680
this is just full of little guys.

1009
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,680
I bet this is full of shit. Look at it.

1010
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,680
There's like little guys in there.

1011
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,680
I'm gonna call them amoebas for no reason.

1012
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,680
I bet that

1013
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,680
following the invention of both the telescope

1014
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,680
and microscope there was a lengthy

1015
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,680
period of time of trying to convince

1016
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,680
somebody that it wasn't a prank

1017
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,680
if you put your eye up against it.

1018
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,680
Like it probably was like

1019
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,680
yeah look through this. I'm not gonna look.

1020
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,680
I'm gonna look through that and like

1021
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,680
something's gonna like poke me in the eye

1022
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,680
or there's gonna be something in there that's like

1023
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,680
spooky. No thank you.

1024
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,680
I'm like no really. Like look in it.

1025
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,680
Whoever invented

1026
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,680
the microscope the day after definitely invented

1027
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,680
a prank microscope that like you look through it

1028
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,680
and it's their butt. Has anyone

1029
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,680
ever asked you to look into something and

1030
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,680
you've thought this is probably fine?

1031
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,680
No there's always a fear moment. They've probably

1032
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,680
invented the prank microscope

1033
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,680
first. Yeah. And people were like

1034
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,680
um no? Like that's

1035
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,680
like it's obviously a

1036
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,680
prank of some sort. So they had to

1037
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,680
invent the microscope

1038
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,680
next. Then.

1039
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,680
Oh we forgot they built the setup.

1040
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,680
Yeah yeah. It's like they had the punchline

1041
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,680
first. They're like well we gotta have something we're

1042
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,680
pretending that it is. What if we could like

1043
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,680
look at cells

1044
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,680
clothes or something.

1045
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,680
And then they did.

1046
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,680
And you know

1047
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,680
telescope gets invented. Probably a week later

1048
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,680
microscope gets invented. And then a week later

1049
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,680
after that some dude named Jeremy

1050
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,680
or something was like I got a new

1051
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,680
one and it's called a middle scope.

1052
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,680
What's it do Jeremy?

1053
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,680
It lets you look at middle sized stuff.

1054
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,680
It's got the one for big

1055
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,680
stuff in the heavens. And

1056
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,680
like moon. And then we got the one

1057
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,680
for blood and

1058
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,680
amoebas and stuff.

1059
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,680
But what about like a nice shirt?

1060
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,680
Don't have one for that.

1061
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,680
I'm Jeremy. This is my middle scope.

1062
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,680
And it's basically just

1063
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,680
a toilet paper tube.

1064
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,680
And it doesn't make things bigger or smaller.

1065
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,680
It helps you focus on

1066
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,680
a little bit. It really lets you dial in

1067
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,680
Travis.

1068
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,680
I also think probably the person who invented

1069
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,680
the telescope when they saw

1070
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,680
somebody be like I invented binoculars.

1071
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,680
And it's like you just taped two of mine.

1072
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,680
That's two of mine. You taped two of mine

1073
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,680
together. You asshole.

1074
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,680
Well here's a

1075
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,680
three eyed

1076
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,680
binoculars.

1077
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,680
They're trinoculars.

1078
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,680
One million dollars please patent office.

1079
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,680
Oh you don't want this one.

1080
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,680
Okay. What about a quadroscope

1081
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,680
so you and a friend can get cheek to cheek and

1082
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,680
really check out some birds.

1083
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,680
Really get up in those birds.

1084
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,680
Find out. Do you think the person who invented

1085
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,680
the magnifying glass was mad at the person

1086
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,680
who invented the microscope? I was like I did

1087
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,680
this already. I did this already.

1088
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,680
We finished this. Fat chance.

1089
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,680
Amoebas? I don't think

1090
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,680
so. Oh there are?

1091
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,680
Well fuck. Well shit.

1092
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,680
I don't know why I did that.

1093
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,680
I should have put two of these together.

1094
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,680
At my office there's a room

1095
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,680
called the wellness room. It's a small

1096
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,680
room near one of the break rooms

1097
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,680
that has a comfy chair and a lamp.

1098
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,680
I didn't think much of this room initially until I overheard my boss

1099
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,680
and coworker talk about how they knew someone

1100
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,680
who would reserve the

1101
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,680
wellness room for up to an hour and use it

1102
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,680
to take naps during the work day.

1103
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,680
Aw hell yeah.

1104
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,680
Now I'm incredibly interested in using this room

1105
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,680
to get in small naps during work

1106
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,680
days. I'm particularly tired but I don't know how to

1107
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,680
go about getting more information on how to reserve the room.

1108
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,680
I don't want to ask my boss or

1109
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,680
my coworkers as I don't want to give the people

1110
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,680
in my unit the impression I'm eager to

1111
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,680
nap during the work day even though you

1112
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,680
totally are. Yeah. Help me brothers.

1113
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,680
How do I get into this sweet nap room?

1114
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,680
That's from Overtired in Oklahoma.

1115
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,680
I mean I don't know what the chart looks like.

1116
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,680
You just gotta use the chart.

1117
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,680
That's why the wellness room is there.

1118
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,680
The

1119
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,680
sort of like

1120
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,680
corporate

1121
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,680
like way of thinking about

1122
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,680
wellness is changing in a

1123
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,680
really positive way

1124
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,680
where folks know that you gotta take care

1125
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,680
of yourself and they're trying to bake that

1126
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,680
I mean at like a cool

1127
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,680
a cool modern workplace.

1128
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,680
With like segways and

1129
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,680
cubicles that look like cabanas

1130
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,680
and stuff.

1131
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,680
And so you gotta. When we worked at AOL

1132
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,680
when we used to work at AOL a long

1133
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,680
long time ago they had a room

1134
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,680
full of

1135
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,680
nap pods and

1136
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,680
the room was called NapQuest

1137
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,680
and I got a big kick

1138
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,680
out of that but how's it going here Will?

1139
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,680
Very bad

1140
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,680
it does seem.

1141
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,680
I think I would be afraid if I heard

1142
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,680
somebody talk about the wellness room

1143
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,680
and they were like planting rumors that you

1144
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,680
could use it for naps cause the wellness room

1145
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,680
sounds like some Orwellian shit

1146
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,680
where I'm gonna go in there and then my eyes are gonna be

1147
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,680
held open while I watch training videos

1148
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,680
about like committing my time harder

1149
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,680
to working better and so like

1150
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,680
maybe the nap thing is just a lie that your

1151
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,680
boss said near your cubicle cause they know you're a real nap freak.

1152
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,680
No the wellness room

1153
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,680
is real and it's good and you gotta

1154
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,680
just do it and you gotta own

1155
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,680
it and you gotta assert yourself

1156
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,680
and you gotta take those good naps.

1157
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,680
Somebody else is already using it for that.

1158
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,680
It's not like you're breaking the wellness room.

1159
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,680
No I know but they're using it for one hour a day

1160
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,680
there's lots of hours in the day. 24 of them.

1161
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,680
No but that's what I'm saying. It's not like you're cheating

1162
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,680
with the wellness room if you wanna take naps in there.

1163
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,680
Like someone's already doing it you should feel free

1164
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,680
to take naps there. Like if you say I wanna take a nap

1165
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,680
in there your boss will be like yeah, yeah

1166
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,680
that's literally why we put it there.

1167
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,680
And here's the thing

1168
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,680
about the nap room.

1169
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,680
No one's gonna fucking wake you up

1170
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,680
if your nap goes a little bit longer. Your boss isn't gonna

1171
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,680
come in and you know

1172
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,680
push your shoulder while

1173
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,680
you're unconscious and be like hey

1174
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,680
hey sweet baby it's time to wake up

1175
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,680
rejoin the workforce. Hey

1176
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,680
it's time to get going on your day.

1177
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,680
So if you sleep through the alarm and you make it

1178
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,680
a good three hour nap

1179
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,680
I don't think anybody's gonna say shit

1180
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,680
cause it's the wellness room.

1181
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,680
This actually reminds me of a thing

1182
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,680
that I was working

1183
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,680
nah fuck it I'll say it. I was working at Sears

1184
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,680
and it was near

1185
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,680
near the end. I didn't know you worked at Sears.

1186
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,680
I worked at Land's End. I worked in the Land's End department

1187
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,680
near the end of my time

1188
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,680
there and Griffin and I lived very close

1189
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,680
to the Sears

1190
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,680
like five minute drive and one day

1191
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,680
I looked at my coworker in the Land's End

1192
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,680
it was a particularly slow day and I said

1193
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,680
we only get a half hour for lunch

1194
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,680
but I'm going to leave

1195
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,680
and you're gonna cover for me

1196
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,680
and I'm gonna be gone for like an hour

1197
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,680
and then I'm gonna come back and then you

1198
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,680
can do the same

1199
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,680
and we just won't tell anybody.

1200
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,680
Oh that's good. And we did that

1201
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,680
and the thing is is like

1202
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,680
the number of times I looked my boss

1203
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,680
square in the eye and said

1204
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,680
yeah I just forgot to clock back in but I was

1205
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,680
definitely here after half an hour

1206
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,680
they kept being mad at me

1207
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,680
but also nothing

1208
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,680
came of it and that's

1209
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,680
where I kind of learned that like rules

1210
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,680
are nothing. There is

1211
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,680
there is no enforcement. So just like

1212
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,680
go take your nap

1213
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,680
stay asleep whatever

1214
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,680
don't even set an alarm and then come back

1215
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,680
and be like I guess I must have slept

1216
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,680
you won't get in. Nobody cares

1217
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,680
nobody cares. They'll care

1218
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,680
as much as they think they need to for

1219
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,680
a second and then it will be over

1220
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,680
because nobody really cares all that much.

1221
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,680
Every office I've

1222
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,680
ever worked in has

1223
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,680
your right

1224
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,680
except one person

1225
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,680
who does care a lot

1226
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,680
and they could be the wild thing about this

1227
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,680
person is they could be in any position.

1228
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,680
You don't know. At the newspaper I worked

1229
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,680
at one time she was the photographer

1230
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,680
and she was the one who cared very

1231
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,680
much about everything that was

1232
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,680
happening at all times everywhere.

1233
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,680
There's one person like that at every job

1234
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,680
I think. Yeah I'll tell you one

1235
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,680
who doesn't love it

1236
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,680
is Mr. Tommy Sperl

1237
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,680
he really

1238
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,680
really wants you to

1239
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,680
he really really wants you

1240
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,680
to make sure those time cards are

1241
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,680
legit

1242
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,680
like good

1243
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,680
good time cards. Also at the

1244
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,680
movie theater in downtown Huntington

1245
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,680
I won't name names

1246
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,680
but they really want to make sure that

1247
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,680
those punch cards are

1248
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,680
really exact and a couple minutes

1249
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,680
late don't do that ever again.

1250
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,680
I'll put you

1251
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,680
in the stocks. So it's not

1252
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,680
universal like you said Travis. Tommy Smerl

1253
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,680
and the movie theater person

1254
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,680
really just

1255
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,680
want to ensure that no

1256
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,680
time crime.

1257
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,680
Tommy Smerl great dude but also

1258
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,680
time cop. But hard on time

1259
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,680
crime. Hard on time crime and so

1260
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,680
just make sure if you do work

1261
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,680
at Tridata Incorporated you

1262
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,680
are being

1263
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,680
not listening to Travis.

1264
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,680
Naps are important though. They're good.

1265
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,680
You have to take them.

1266
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,680
Carve yourself out a half hour. Get

1267
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,680
your pizziz going.

1268
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,680
And just take that nap. You do need it.

1269
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,680
Go to HR probably.

1270
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,680
They're in control of the wellness room. I would think

1271
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,680
you're gonna just find the chart

1272
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,680
where every day at

1273
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,680
like 12 is written

1274
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,680
on it like Dave sesh

1275
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,680
for like an hour where Dave is gonna get in there and have

1276
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,680
his sesh. And you can just pencil

1277
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,680
in after it Doug sesh

1278
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,680
or whatever. Whatever your name is.

1279
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,680
That's what you need. You need

1280
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,680
I think what has made

1281
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,680
my sneaking off from work and napping

1282
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,680
possible through all of my different

1283
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,680
retail jobs was I had a

1284
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,680
partner in crime. I had somebody

1285
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,680
that was like you look out for

1286
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,680
me and I'll look out for you. I'll go take

1287
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,680
a nap behind the refrigerator boxes

1288
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,680
at Best Buy and you

1289
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,680
do my work and then you can take a nap behind

1290
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,680
the refrigerator boxes and I'll do your

1291
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,680
work. And like

1292
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,680
you have to coordinate it out a

1293
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,680
little bit. So I think

1294
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,680
that maybe that's what I mean when I say nobody

1295
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,680
cares. You just need enough plausible

1296
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,680
deniability.

1297
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,680
It's also important to note that

1298
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,680
after they do that once they're dirty.

1299
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,680
And once they're dirty

1300
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,680
they cannot bring you

1301
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,680
you've got the juice on them

1302
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,680
and even though they've got the juice on you they can't

1303
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,680
bring you down. It brings you closer

1304
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,680
to his friends and criminals.

1305
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,680
Time criminals.

1306
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,680
Y'all ever watch the

1307
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,680
Office?

1308
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,680
Yeah.

1309
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,680
It's on Comedy Central now

1310
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,680
24 hours a day. That's funny.

1311
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,680
I don't think it's funny but I think

1312
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,680
Jim is very mean to Dwight.

1313
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,680
Although I did have a really

1314
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,680
intense and detailed dream the other day

1315
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,680
that I was traveling with.

1316
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,680
Hey Trav let me stop you.

1317
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,680
I don't want to hear about your dream.

1318
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,680
But I was traveling with.

1319
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,680
If you would do it actually

1320
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,680
that's you doing time crime on me and Justin.

1321
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,680
But I was traveling with the

1322
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,680
entire Office crew Griffin.

1323
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,680
Well I've changed my mind.

1324
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,680
Now I gotta know.

1325
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,680
We were trying to check into a hotel but.

1326
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,680
I'm taking a nap on the middle of this podcast.

1327
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,680
Michael hadn't reserved

1328
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,680
the hotel and it was all booked up.

1329
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,680
And it was me and Jim

1330
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,680
trying to fix everything.

1331
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,680
Yeah.

1332
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,680
For sure.

1333
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,680
And it just didn't pan out in the end.

1334
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,680
It didn't pan out.

1335
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,680
It's funny dude.

1336
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,680
I love that shit.

1337
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,680
Stanley's doing his thing.

1338
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,680
Stanley's off in the corner doing whatever.

1339
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,680
I love it man. More seasons.

1340
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,680
They're bringing it back.

1341
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,680
Loving that.

1342
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,680
More of it please.

1343
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,680
And they need a new Steve.

1344
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,680
Good.

1345
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,680
Closure. I love that Travis. Thank you.

1346
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,680
Thank you. I like to book in.

1347
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,680
So fun to book in.

1348
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,680
They do like Ricky

1349
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,680
come back and

1350
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,680
does a guest spot on it but then at some point

1351
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,680
he falls into a toilet.

1352
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,680
In real life. And flushed down.

1353
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,680
Book ending is better than

1354
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,680
having a good joke.

1355
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,680
Remember from the beginning?

1356
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,680
Uh huh.

1357
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,680
That's better and easier.

1358
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,680
Is this whole episode time crime that we did to our

1359
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,680
listeners?

1360
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,680
They can't get it back one way or the other.

1361
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,680
Thank you for listening.

1362
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,680
We got you.

1363
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,680
To our greatest heist yet.

1364
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,680
Our greatest most ambitious time heist.

1365
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,680
We

1366
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,680

1367
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,680

00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,680
next week and we are so excited.

1369
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,680
We are going to have

1371
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,680
to coincide with episode 400

1372
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,680
which is going to be a

1373
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,680
buck wild.

1374
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,680
That's next week right Griff?

1375
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,680
We are going to drop it next week?

1376
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,680
Max fun drive if you are a new listener

1377
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,680
it is an annual thing we do for two weeks.

1378

00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,680
weird stuff.

1385
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,680
It is the best time to support our show.

We have different pledge gifts coming down

00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,680
stuff like exclusive bonus content

1400
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,680
if you give $5 a month, $10 a month

1401
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,680
you get a cool

1402
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,680
pin.

1403
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,680
Is that pin by the way? The my brother

1404
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,680
my brother only one? I

thing that we started doing

1427
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,680
eight years ago become a career

1428
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,680

00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,680
our lives with that and we call on you

00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,680
kind words in the promo that we ran

1437
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,680
earlier. Again

1438
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,680
Max Fun Drive starts next week

1440
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,680
I have got

1441
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,680
let's do some plugs. I'm going to do them real

1442
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,680
fast. One, we have

1443
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,680
My Brother, My Brother, Me and Adventure Zone

1444
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,680
tour dates up

1445
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,680
on mcroryshows.com

1446
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,680
slash tours. That tour is about

1447
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,680
75% sold out. Like the whole

1448
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,680
thing on average is about 75% sold

1449
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,680
out. So don't wait to get your tickets.

1450
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,680
However, I will say the Houston

1451
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,680
show which is coming up very soon

1452
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,680
it's a little light.

1453
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,680
Houston! Houston!

1454
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,680
Here's the thing. I said boys come to

1455
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,680
Texas. So I won't have to travel very far

1456
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,680
and this is something

1457
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,680
that's very important to me is not having to travel

1458
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,680
very far. Houston needs your help to prove

1459
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,680
my thesis correct.

1460
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,680
So please go to mcroryshows.com

actors and writers to sell

01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,680
