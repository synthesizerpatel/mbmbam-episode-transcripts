1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,160
She's a grand old flag, she's a high-flying flag,

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,120
forever may she wave over the land of the free, hum of the brave.

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,520
Welcome everybody to our fourth of July celebration.

8
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,840
I'm excited. Did you say hum of the brave?

9
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:08,560
He's like a super patriotic girl talk. He's just like jamming together all the old standards

10
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,080
written by Francis Scott Key. Is that who did it?

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,800
Yeah.

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,160
If these remix artists are so keen to save us time, like they're always saying,

13
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,120
let's mash up two pop tunes so you can listen to two at once,

14
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:29,920
shouldn't they have mashed up every holiday theme into one super theme for each holiday?

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm saying like one Christmas song that's like jingle bells, home for the holidays,

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,680
baby Jesus, just hit all the high notes.

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,880
Right. See, what's funny is even after doing this show for so long,

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,120
I still have things to learn because I had no idea that DJs did remixes for efficiency sake.

19
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,960
They're just trying to save us time.

20
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,280
Okay.

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,920
Is that inaccurate? I mean, what other reason could there be?

22
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:06,080
If Dr. Girl Talk, if DJ Deadmouth wanted to really save us time,

23
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,720
he wouldn't do a mashup for each holiday.

24
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:16,000
There would be a single, almost like happy birthday-esque tune that you would just do

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,280
at any kind of holiday celebration.

26
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,760
And it would just be like, you know, it's time to celebrate, it's time to feel good.

27
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,080
But then like Halloween, that's kind of weird.

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,280
Right.

29
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,160
It's time to feel bad.

30
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,280
Oh, what if we just made it like, it's time to observe.

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,520
Oh, that's good. It's not a normal day.

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,040
It's not a normal day.

33
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,200
Unless you're Jewish for some people and some days.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
Just some days overlap.

35
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,040
Let's not cut them out.

36
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,320
Everybody's welcome, but you may not show up.

37
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,360
Here's the verse about Hanukkah.

38
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,880
Some of you can turn it down or just keep listening.

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,160
It's got some good rhymes.

40
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,600
Obviously.

41
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,120
Clearly the rhymes are on point.

42
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,120
Maybe you check it on P for this song.

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,240
It would be the Hanukkah verse where it would just catch you up and tell you what you missed.

44
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,960
So this is My Brother, My Brother, Me.

45
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,760
It's an observant show for the modern era.

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,320
I'm your oldest, most observant brother, Justin McElroy.

47
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,840
I'm your middle-est brother and I'm not that observant, Travis McElroy.

48
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,920
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

49
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,600
And I don't care about labels.

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,120
You don't care? No?

51
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,440
When it comes to observance.

52
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,600
You care about labels for like expiration dates.

53
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,200
Oh yeah, and like clothes and shit.

54
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,960
Yeah, all that.

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,160
Griffin only wears name brand clothing.

56
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,400
Yeah, I'm into Abercrombie and Fitch because it's like the more people protest and boycott it,

57
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,440
it is becoming precipitously more stylish for me to wear it.

58
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,760
Griffin, do you like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch?

59
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,960
Yes, but if I had one wish, it would probably be for like, you know, a billion bucks or something like that.

60
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,760
Oh, I see.

61
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,400
If I had that-

62
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,480
You think it's fly when girls stop by for the summer?

63
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,880
No, that's actually- I wish they would call ahead.

64
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,080
I don't think it's too much to ask them to call ahead first.

65
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,520
How long are you staying?

66
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,560
I kind of thought you were just going to swing through.

67
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,480
For the entire- for three goddamn months until the middle of August?

68
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,040
No, no, no.

69
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,280
That's not gonna- listen, I have plans.

70
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,800
I'm going to Myrtle Beach soon, soon.

71
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
I can't have you staying there.

72
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,400
Will you at least feed the dogs?

73
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,080
You won't? Damn it.

74
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,080
I like girls that feed my dogs for me when I'm at Myrtle Beach.

75
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,680
They water my plants and bring in the paper.

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,360
Please don't steal my Reggie Jackson baseball.

77
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,160
Biceball?

78
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,320
What's he in baseball?

79
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,480
God, was Reggie Jackson a baseball player, please?

80
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,800
I'm sure we'll find out.

81
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,920
Please. I'm sure we'll find out in the post.

82
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,480
I want to help somebody.

83
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,200
Here we go.

84
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,280
I find myself in the need of some advice.

85
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,720
In several weeks, a very good friend of mine is leaving our city to pursue

86
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,320
a Ph.D. or through- I am quite sad he is leaving-

87
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,160
That was a though, not a through.

88
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,080
Though I am quite sad he is leaving my general vicinity,

89
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,240
I am also excited he got into his number one college

90
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,320
and will be studying his favorite subjects.

91
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,120
Here's my problem.

92
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,400
I want to get him something meaningful,

93
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,560
but I don't know what the man version of frame college-

94
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,520
Oh, sorry.

95
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,880
Jesus, Justin.

96
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,200
I don't know what the man version of frame photo collage

97
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,720
of some of our favorite memories with a thoughtful letter written on the back.

98
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,120
What can I get him that will be meaningful but won't be too girly?

99
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,160
P.S. I'm a gay lady, so this isn't about a sad loss of love that could have been.

100
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,520
Thank you, Megan, for clearing that up.

101
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,160
Yeah, because our fucking stupid troglodyte brains would have just been like,

102
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,920
oh, I tell you, you love thing.

103
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,040
You wait, time may stop, baby, let's get this done.

104
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,200
Like, I'm glad that you cleared that up for us.

105
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,000
See, I think that would be a very nice gift.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,880
Yeah, you're kind of casting some dispersions right now,

107
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,960
because like, guys like that shit too.

108
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,120
Is this straightophobia?

109
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,720
Is something going on here?

110
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,920
I think it is.

111
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,000
Is this a case of straightophobia?

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,480
What do you call it when you're prejudiced against straight dudes?

113
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,320
I think I just termed it.

114
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:30,640
Nothing.

115
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,920
It's called nothing at all.

116
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,680
It's called not a thing at all.

117
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,240
It's called not anything that anyone should worry about.

118
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,400
Not a problem.

119
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,240
Everybody's medicine.

120
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,120
You just have to take it.

121
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,520
I mean, I do think that this is one time where, I mean,

122
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,880
she would probably know her friend better than us, one would hope.

123
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,720
So maybe she knows that he wouldn't necessarily be the sort of dude

124
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,560
that would enjoy a frame photo.

125
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,120
He's a Brock Stone chin type.

126
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,560
He's just not interested in frills.

127
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,080
He's too afraid to feel.

128
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,960
Maybe this is the doorway into his emotions, though.

129
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,040
Maybe you give him this key and he's like,

130
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,440
he's just going to feel everything all at once.

131
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,960
Oh, that could be scary, though.

132
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,880
Yeah, that might be a little frightening.

133
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,160
I can get intense.

134
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,840
Can you get him a football or a basketball?

135
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,280
A set of shoulder pads, maybe.

136
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,200
Get this to your new college and dunk it.

137
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,920
Give him a football and write hometown on it.

138
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,360
Why would someone always remember his hometown?

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,160
Yeah.

140
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,760
For all the touchdowns you're going to score.

141
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,840
Oh, what if you just say like,

142
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,640
make a touchdown in your doctorate studies.

143
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,480
That's not good.

144
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,680
He's going to get beat up.

145
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,040
Yeah, and also, it's a good point.

146
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,400
Anybody who's getting their doctorate

147
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,680
probably doesn't like football.

148
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,880
I would think maybe not a photo collage, okay?

149
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,120
That's probably a bit much, but maybe a photo.

150
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,840
Something that he could remember you by.

151
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
I think that would be kind of nice, actually.

152
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,880
If you guys have a joint favorite movie or TV show,

153
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,760
you could always get him that and that way he'll watch it.

154
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,040
That's such a lazy gift.

155
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,000
More than just printing off a photo and pumping in a frame.

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,280
Now, here's the thing about the photo versus photo collage.

157
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,880
If I go to someone's home

158
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,120
and I see a photo of them with a person,

159
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,600
I'll probably won't even ask about it.

160
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,480
I'll probably just think like,

161
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,440
oh, that's a special person.

162
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,400
If I see a photo collage, in my mind, that person died.

163
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:29,680
Oh, okay.

164
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,320
That's a altar.

165
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,240
Can we do a collage of something that's not photos?

166
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,280
Like words cut out of magazines?

167
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,480
No, not like a fucking-

168
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,680
There's a word for that.

169
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,840
Yeah, that's a ransom note.

170
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,320
I'm thinking more along the lines of lunch meats.

171
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,960
I guess what I'm saying

172
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,640
is that you should get him a tray of lunch meats.

173
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,160
Framed?

174
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,840
Framed if you want,

175
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,920
but it's really just gonna add an extra step

176
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,480
between him and getting partying down on those lunch meats.

177
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,800
If you think about it, that's how Lunchables really are.

178
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,720
Just frame Lunchables.

179
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,040
Get him a box of Lunchables right home town on it.

180
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,840
And send him on his way.

181
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,240
Make it like a bulk box,

182
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,520
because you don't want to get him just one.

183
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,480
You'll look cheap.

184
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,560
Get him a big box from the Costco.

185
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,280
Get him something that's really gonna help him

186
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,920
establish a character at his new college.

187
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,120
He could be the Lunchable guy.

188
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,080
Well, I was gonna say a snake.

189
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,880
Oh, okay.

190
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,160
Get him a snake, and then he's like,

191
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,600
that guy, that's gonna help him get his-

192
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,160
Does anybody want to be that guy?

193
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,360
Does anybody want to be Snake Guy?

194
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,480
Jake the Snake Roberts.

195
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,760
Nobody wants to be Snake Guy,

196
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,880
but somebody has to be Snake Guy.

197
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,800
Jake the Snake Roberts didn't want to be Snake Guy.

198
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,200
He unintentionally built a career around being Snake Guy.

199
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Like, being Snake Guy paid the fucking bills,

200
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,280
but as soon as Jake the Snake Roberts got home,

201
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,880
he threw that snake in the garbage

202
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,080
and bought a new one the next day.

203
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,480
And that kind of frivolity

204
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,800
is what made snake prices go up so high.

205
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,120
And it also ruined Jake the Snake Roberts.

206
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,480
Because he had a house full of snakes.

207
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,440
Well-

208
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,840
They're not gonna stay in the garbage can.

209
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,120
He had a bank account full of snake receipts,

210
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,840
but not money.

211
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,480
And he can't spend snake receipts at the-

212
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,760
at the Piggly Wiggly, you know?

213
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,080
He must have been so excited when he figured out

214
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,440
that Jake and Snake run.

215
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,960
Jake the Lake.

216
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,840
No, no.

217
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,800
Jake the Quake?

218
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,920
Uh, gotta get fat.

219
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,600
That's actually pretty good.

220
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,640
Jake the Quake Roberts?

221
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
He would have to get fat for that to work.

222
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,480
You can't be skinny and be the quake.

223
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,000
Jake the Fake.

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,960
Oh no, no, no.

225
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,760
It could have been Jake the Quaker and then-

226
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,520
Jaker the Quaker Roberts.

227
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah.

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,040
Oh, he outed him.

229
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, he's been outed.

230
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,320
He just dumped oats on him at his finisher.

231
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
Okay, we can't keep fucking propagating these stereotypes.

232
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Like Quakers are into way more shit than just-

233
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,600
I just meant-

234
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,360
I just meant that they don't listen.

235
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,200
You don't know that?

236
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,080
That's probably true.

237
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,720
So I think we're saying-

238
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,640
Listen, if I can't make fun of anybody,

239
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,520
can it be the people that don't listen?

240
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,640
Yeah.

241
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah, because you know what?

242
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,560
Yeah, you know what?

243
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,200
Fuck those people.

244
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,960
They're not even going to give us a shot.

245
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,880
They're not even going to try our podcast.

246
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,240
I'm saying-

247
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,440
I'm not even making fun of Quakers.

248
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,320
I'm saying they're horde.

249
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,840
Quakers are horde.

250
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,240
Oh, by the way, question, Meaghan.

251
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,200
You're welcome.

252
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,360
Yeah.

253
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,880
So give him a photo collage of Jake the Snake Roberts.

254
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
Oh my god, that would be awesome.

255
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,680
Ooh, ooh.

256
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,240
Give him the photo collage of Jake the Snake Roberts snake

257
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,240
that got killed by, I wanna say, Brett the Hitman Hart.

258
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,720
Thank you, everybody, for sending in Yahoo's.

259
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,000
This Yahoo was sent in by Scott Ackerman.

260
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,000
Thank you, Scott Ackerman.

261
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user ARJ2288, who asks,

262
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,440
how does Shaq have mental conversations?

263
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,560
What?

264
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,200
Shaq claimed at the 2009 NBA draft

265
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,400
that he had mental conversations with LeBron James.

266
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,840
Quote, I haven't had any verbal conversations with LeBron,

267
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,320
but I've had many mental conversations with him.

268
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,360
How is this possible?

269
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,400
The obvious answer is that they are both Tomorrow people.

270
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,160
If you remember that.

271
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,200
Maybe they're both fey.

272
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,320
Maybe they're each half fey.

273
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,800
They might be of-

274
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,960
I've always said that Shaq does seem of the fey wild, but-

275
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,160
If you look at-

276
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,760
If you kind of catch him out of the corner of your eye,

277
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,800
his eyes are all black.

278
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,760
Mm-hmm.

279
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,520
And vampires are always trying to get him.

280
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,020
Yep.

281
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Could it be that they are the same person separated at birth?

282
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,640
No, wait, that doesn't work.

283
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,840
Or time travel.

284
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,840
When Shaq time traveled-

285
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,960
Dimensional travel.

286
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,040
I don't think that's-

287
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,200
I think that's just like movement in space.

288
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,920
I think just walking is dimensional.

289
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,280
I meant like other dimensions.

290
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,760
I know he's a number one jokester of the entire league,

291
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,280
but I think there's probably some truth to this.

292
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,200
I think there's probably-

293
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,120
I don't think you get to be the hugest man on earth

294
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,920
and not also be evolved in other,

295
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,240
perhaps more supernatural ways.

296
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,880
So what are you implying here, Griffin?

297
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,760
I am implying that

298
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:25,120
Shaquille O'Neal is a mutant.

299
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,320
He is homo superior, is what I'm saying.

300
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,820
I see.

301
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,160
Not only in terms of dunking,

302
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,360
but in terms of like,

303
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,720
he can probably move shit with his mind.

304
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,760
Now, here's the thing, though.

305
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,240
If you believe in a fair and just God,

306
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,720
do you honestly believe that he would create a human being

307
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,280
that is both gigantic and has hyperkinesia?

308
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,640
Hyperkinesis is ADD, so do you want something else?

309
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,200
Yes, it did.

310
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,120
But I can't remember the word,

311
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,960
so I'm sticking with hyperkinesis.

312
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,920
Okay, cool.

313
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,480
Griffin, I think if Shaq could move things with his mind,

314
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,800
then he'd probably be able to hit one from the three.

315
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,280
What?

316
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,040
If you guys know what I'm talking about.

317
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,000
Taco nexus.

318
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,280
You know what you're talking about?

319
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,040
Griffin, I didn't hear what you were saying.

320
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,000
I said taco-

321
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,920
I thought you said taco nexus.

322
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,000
I said taco nexus.

323
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,840
I thought you said taco nexus.

324
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,840
I said taco nexus.

325
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,880
Taco nexus syndrome.

326
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,120
You remember that commercial where Shaq eats the tacos?

327
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,000
You guys not remember taco nexus syndrome?

328
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,920
I can't believe I have to explain to the two of you.

329
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,400
Of all people, what taco nexus is.

330
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,760
Prominent watchers of television and eaters of food.

331
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,440
Known Taco Bell enthusiasts.

332
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,000
There's a commercial where Shaq was shooting threes.

333
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,040
This is gonna be funny.

334
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,640
He's making all of them.

335
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,040
He's making all the threes, which he's not known for.

336
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,640
I guess it's not his core competency.

337
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,760
Right.

338
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,360
And it pans back-

339
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,720
Or is it foul shots?

340
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,760
Is that what he has a problem with?

341
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,400
No, it's a three.

342
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,760
It's hitting it in the paint.

343
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,280
I think it's hitting it in the paint.

344
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,480
Well, he takes it to the paint.

345
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,720
He keeps it in the paint, but he doesn't-

346
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,520
Once he's there, he has no fucking idea what to do with it.

347
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,080
Except just like run at the basket as fast as he can

348
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,360
and just sort of bull rush it.

349
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,800
And he's the size of two full grown men.

350
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,560
So like there's no stopping him.

351
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,560
But if he has to make it from the paint,

352
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,840
then he's in a world of trouble.

353
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,040
Anyway, cuts back to him-

354
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,240
You're talking about taco nexus.

355
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,680
He's making all these sweet threes and pans back,

356
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,360
and his neck is like tilted to one side.

357
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,000
And they're like, what?

358
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,720
How did it happen?

359
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,520
And some doctor is like, he's got taco neck syndrome.

360
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,920
And when you tilt your head so you don't tilt the taco,

361
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,000
you tilt your head so you don't lose any of the sweet meats in there.

362
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,480
He has Doritos Locos taco syndrome.

363
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,520
Do you mean diabetes?

364
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,240
Yes, I do.

365
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,720
No, that's just when you get crumble fingers.

366
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,320
America, it's your friend Justin McElroy.

367
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,880
Just tilt the taco.

368
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,400
Trust me, you can lose-

369
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,800
We have to stop taco neck syndrome.

370
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,160
Of the cheese shreds.

371
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,280
Man, can you imagine how funny this would have been

372
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,600
if that commercial was still on or had been on

373
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,200
in this presidential administration?

374
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,400
Do you think-

375
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,600
Hey guys, where's the beef?

376
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,600
Fuck.

377
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,760
Cut it out, Justin.

378
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,960
Cut it out.

379
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,240
Do you think that playing basketball with somebody enough

380
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,760
sort of gives you that sort of instinctive,

381
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,600
like sort of gives you a form of extra sensory perception

382
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,440
as to what that person is thinking?

383
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,160
Because like if the three of us played basketball with each other

384
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,040
our entire lives as opposed to just the four or five times

385
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,480
that we did it in the basketball court

386
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
that we had in our backyard for some reason.

387
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,600
Like whenever we get on the court,

388
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,640
like I would know if Travis wants me to get free

389
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,800
and get in the paint, you know what I mean?

390
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,520
I would know when Justin is about to run up for a dunk

391
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,280
and needs me to set him up for a layup.

392
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,640
Maybe you should just always assume

393
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,480
that I want you to get free and get in the paint.

394
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,720
If I'm going to run in for a dunk,

395
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,840
why are you going to put me in for-

396
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh, so I'm going to dish you the rock, basically.

397
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,080
Or you could fake dish it, you could fake left

398
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,360
and then dish right.

399
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,160
You know how in NBA Jam, sometimes you go up

400
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,240
and you jump up in the air to like dunk it

401
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,480
and then you somehow throw the ball behind your head

402
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,760
without moving your arms at like 200 miles an hour?

403
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,560
Uh-huh.

404
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,680
That's the kind of maneuver that I'm banking on you doing.

405
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,280
But I don't need to fucking tell you this

406
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,680
because we've been playing basketball together for so long

407
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,400
that we have a psychic tether.

408
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,960
Wait, maybe Kobe and Shaq are communicating-

409
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,520
LeBron.

410
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,440
But LeBron doesn't play on the same team, does he?

411
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,600
LeBron, and it doesn't matter.

412
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,520
LeBron and Shaq are communicating,

413
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,960
but the way this communication is actually through basketball.

414
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,440
Maybe when he was missing all those sweet threes,

415
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,600
Shaq was actually using an advanced form of communication

416
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,480
to send a message to LeBron.

417
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,200
You know what I'm saying?

418
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,920
Like a code.

419
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,600
It's a code, right?

420
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,480
Like he misses three threes in a row

421
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,080
and LeBron's like, ah, sense of disturbance in the basketball force.

422
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,000
I know that I can't, I forget what we were saying,

423
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,080
get drafted by somebody.

424
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,600
I don't really understand basketball.

425
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,520
I actually, I prefer to think of it

426
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,000
like with them not being on the same team

427
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,440
that like Shaquille misses a three and like thinks really hard.

428
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,360
Like I'm really sad that I missed that three

429
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,080
and LeBron from like across the country thinks back like,

430
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,200
it'll be okay, man.

431
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,240
You'll get it next time.

432
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,840
And he feels a little bit better.

433
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,440
Yeah, because they're all a lot better.

434
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,800
They're not on the same team.

435
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,080
They're not on the same team,

436
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,760
but they're, you know, they're all on this together.

437
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah, they're on a team I like to call the human race.

438
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,720
Yeah, I'm also the National Basketball Association.

439
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,680
There's that.

440
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,080
That's a slightly smaller fraternity, but sure.

441
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,480
Hey, I wanna help somebody else.

442
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,280
Here we go.

443
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,120
I'm a full-time yoga instructor.

444
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,160
I have dated a few girls who come into the yoga studio

445
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,760
and it always ends up not working out.

446
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,720
I get the impression they expect me to be different

447
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,080
from other guys they've dated.

448
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,600
And in a lot of ways I am.

449
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,720
I mean, I'm pretty great.

450
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,160
I'm pretty great and I'm bendy and shit, I guess.

451
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,800
I think in their mind, I sit around and meditate all day.

452
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
How do I give them a reasonable expectation

453
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,040
of who I am outside the yoga studio?

454
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,600
Or should I stop dating girls from there all together?

455
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,880
And that's from Let's Namaste Friends.

456
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,640
Question of the year nominee.

457
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,240
Yeah, 2013.

458
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,440
Pretty good so far.

459
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,120
Hey, listen, just from me to you,

460
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,040
as somebody who's been down the show before,

461
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,440
maybe you start by thinking of them as women.

462
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,080
Oh, nice.

463
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,840
Think about it.

464
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,720
Next question.

465
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,160
Hate to put you on blast.

466
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,440
I hate to put you on blast.

467
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,960
Could you sneak it into your yoga lessons

468
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,640
where you're like, okay, we're gonna do downward dog.

469
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,760
Everyone breathe.

470
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,000
Also, did anyone check out Breaking Bad last night?

471
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,280
That's pretty cool, right?

472
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,960
Anyways, and just move on.

473
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,280
I mean-

474
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,720
That's a lot of pressure

475
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,960
because I think that what he's ignoring

476
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,320
is not his behaviors so much as they're gonna,

477
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,040
they're gonna expect him to know some positions.

478
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,880
They're gonna expect him to give them some predicaments.

479
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,200
I don't think that's what he's talking about.

480
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,680
I don't think-

481
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,120
I don't think it is either.

482
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,400
That is not the context of the question.

483
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,040
Sometimes I don't think about things before I say them.

484
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,440
Sure.

485
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:19,920
Come on.

486
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,680
You know me better than this.

487
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,640
I was using basketball telepathy to tell you I was sorry.

488
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,080
You were trying to take it to the paint.

489
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,960
What if while he was teaching yoga,

490
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,760
periodically he would stop and just like,

491
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,440
chomp some Pringles?

492
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,680
Just like in the middle.

493
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,600
I mean, if it's like Bikram hot yoga,

494
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,240
like you're probably not gonna want a salty snack

495
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,520
in the middle of it.

496
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,040
I can't imagine doing hot yoga

497
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,320
and wanting to smell Pringles,

498
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,280
let alone eat them.

499
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,740
I-

500
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,360
And can you do it when they're in a position

501
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,800
and they're not facing you?

502
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,640
So they're waiting for you to tell them?

503
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,760
They just hear-

504
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,800
Well, first they'll hear that pop,

505
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,760
that telltale pop.

506
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,600
Just go from ear to ear whispering,

507
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,480
listen, I popped.

508
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,760
Now I can't stop.

509
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,440
I'm gonna need like 15, 20 minutes

510
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,400
to clear the cache here.

511
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,280
They'll hear the pop,

512
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,000
they'll hear a whiff,

513
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,200
they'll hear yummy.

514
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,000
That's all they're gonna hear.

515
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,880
And then just walk by

516
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,720
and like gently adjust their positions,

517
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,120
but really you're wiping your fingers off on their shit.

518
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,160
That's a good way to set the bar real low.

519
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,080
I got some sour cream dust.

520
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,200
I'm just gonna-

521
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,320
Okay, great.

522
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,760
You're gonna want to wash this, Matt.

523
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,840
You can call me though if you want to.

524
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,200
I'm just like every other guy.

525
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,000
Hey, do you want a date?

526
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,240
Do you want a chip?

527
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,640
Just kidding, I popped,

528
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,480
so I legally couldn't stop.

529
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,720
I slammed all those delicious Pringles.

530
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,880
They have a lot of flavors of Pringles.

531
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,120
They do.

532
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,160
When was the last time you guys checked?

533
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,720
They have like spicy dill pickle.

534
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,600
It's extreme dill pickle, Justin, please.

535
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,720
Aww.

536
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,920
I fucking love Pringles.

537
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,800
Here's what you do.

538
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,120
You get the extreme dill, right?

539
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,920
Can we not do a Pringles cooking segment

540
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,000
in the middle of our show?

541
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,680
And then you shuffle them together, right?

542
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,960
So you get dill and ranch in the same bite.

543
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,200
I just think we're gonna enter a future

544
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,680
where all of our meals are delivered via Pringles.

545
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,800
I mean, it is the best way to do,

546
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,200
to transfer that particular food stuff,

547
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,280
but can we just not put,

548
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,320
can we not wait?

549
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,720
Can we not just enjoy these last remaining years

550
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,440
before all of our things come in cans

551
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,560
in convex shapes?

552
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,960
You know, technically,

553
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,440
Pringles aren't chips, they're crisps.

554
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,160
Oh, come on.

555
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,720
They're reconstituted potato flakes.

556
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,160
And that was, they used to call them chips

557
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,800
in the potato chip.

558
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,680
There was a big lawsuit.

559
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,080
Yeah, it's got really bad.

560
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,280
Who the fuck eats a Pringles like,

561
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,560
oh, what the fuck?

562
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,320
I was told there would be chips.

563
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,520
Nobody, but thanks lobbyists, you know?

564
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,680
You know, Griffin, if you ever watched Unwrapped,

565
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,480
you would know that.

566
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,120
Yeah, well, I mean, if they,

567
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,560
I understand that they would think that,

568
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,120
but also that's kind of on them.

569
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,800
I mean, why would they assume

570
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,720
that you would just yoga all the time?

571
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,720
My girl likes to do yoga all the time.

572
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,520
Yeah, you can't live a yoga lifestyle

573
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,400
24 hours a day.

574
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,080
I mean, I know some people are out there doing it,

575
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,080
but he's just like any other guy.

576
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,600
And if they assume otherwise

577
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,560
because of one facet of their personality,

578
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,720
you know, I think that they're not the person

579
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,840
you were gonna end up with anyway.

580
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,960
But I totally get it,

581
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,400
because this is like the one,

582
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:30,640
this career is completely characterized

583
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,560
by soft speech and like a sort of enlightenment.

584
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,000
Like, I don't do yoga, of course.

585
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,760
Like, look at my, just look at my body.

586
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,880
Look at what I'm working with.

587
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,960
This is not a yoga body.

588
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,680
It just isn't.

589
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,040
I tried to do yoga.

590
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,040
Day one, the instructor was like,

591
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,120
I'm sorry, that is not a yoga body.

592
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,920
I need you to go.

593
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,200
You're making everybody else feel bad for you.

594
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,560
Isn't that something you build to?

595
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,440
No.

596
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
You just have it or you don't?

597
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,920
No, it's like, are you an endomorph or an ectomorph?

598
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,520
Like, it's based entirely on your body shape.

599
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,480
I'm an o-morph.

600
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,120
It means my body, like I can maintain,

601
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,760
but I can't get any better than where I'm at right now.

602
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,600
Anyway, I don't want to talk about that anymore.

603
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,560
What I'm saying is that this is a career

604
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,480
determined by enlightenment.

605
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,240
And so you put out this facade of enlightenment

606
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,960
that people, like you can't just like get in your car

607
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,800
and like throw in a Brooks and Dunc cassette.

608
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,760
Like, people are gonna-

609
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,600
But the difference is like, you're not,

610
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,440
you're not like a Buddhist Zen teacher.

611
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,080
You're a yoga teacher.

612
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,520
Right, but you still have to-

613
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,920
Like, that's where I get confused by the like,

614
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,560
kind of assumption of enlightenment.

615
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,840
I don't think that it's the same deal.

616
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,680
But there's no yoga instructor who's like,

617
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,600
all right guys, let's fucking do this.

618
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,920
I would go to that yoga class though.

619
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,320
Throws on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack and is like,

620
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,280
bend your butt.

621
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,920
Put your butt on your back.

622
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,400
Liu Kang.

623
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,200
Put your butt in the air and hold it there.

624
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,920
Coward.

625
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,840
Make sure to maintain your breathing.

626
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,200
Right in.

627
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,360
There's one part of the email that I neglected to read

628
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,400
that sort of disproves his question.

629
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,000
Because he says, I'm still a guy.

630
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,240
I like to watch the Simpsons, pro sports,

631
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,960
and sometimes when I nap, I fart in my sleep.

632
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,800
And you know what, I thought about it,

633
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,880
and you have got to be really in touch with your body

634
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,480
to know if you fart when you sleep.

635
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,880
You just wake up and just write in your dream journal,

636
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,240
six, six of them today.

637
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,680
Oh no, the number is increasing.

638
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,080
Every time he toots, he has to say namaste.

639
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,640
And so he wakes himself up.

640
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,560
I think he probably says namaste.

641
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,160
Stupid.

642
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,240
Let's take it from an urban setting to a more rural.

643
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:01,940
Fuck.

644
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:07,060
Let's take it from an urban setting to a more rural one

645
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,180
with farm wisdom.

646
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,700
You know, I really can't introduce the bit

647
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,020
and then sing the theme song and then take it up.

648
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,540
That's like a three person job

649
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,460
that I'm trying to take on to myself.

650
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:23,700
It's uniquely American, but farm wisdom, farm wisdom.

651
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,820
Pick up your pitch for farm wisdom.

652
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:28,740
Are you done?

653
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,420
I can never tell when you're done.

654
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,860
You end with upward inflection.

655
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,820
Like you're asking a question in song.

656
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,460
This first one comes from Johnny and Johnny says,

657
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,180
if you have a problem with rabbits messing your garden up,

658
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,580
spread human hair throughout the soil.

659
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,580
Rabbits hate the smell of human hair.

660
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,820
Hey, this is some pretty cool stew you made.

661
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,060
This is some really cool vegetable stew that you made.

662
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,940
One issue though.

663
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,460
It looks like a dad's chest in my bowl right now.

664
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,540
And I don't know what the fuck's going on.

665
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,860
You could probably like go to a barbershop

666
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,380
and get like their clippings like that.

667
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,580
You have to use your own hair.

668
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,100
And I imagine you wash the vegetables before you use them.

669
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,700
Yeah, do you mind if I just come to the barber?

670
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,660
Hey, barber.

671
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,220
Hi, barber.

672
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,660
Thanks for taking my call.

673
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,140
Real quick.

674
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,540
I was wondering if I could do one thing

675
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,940
that might be a little strange.

676
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,700
Can I have all the hair?

677
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,900
I brought my own bag.

678
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,780
It's reusable.

679
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,140
I brought my own bag and a little scooper.

680
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,740
Just get in there.

681
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,260
I, does it twist anybody else's perception

682
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,300
of the human rabbit relationship?

683
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,220
If you know that every time like a child

684
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,060
picks up a little bunny, that bunny is thinking,

685
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,580
ugh, you stinky bastard.

686
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,940
Oh, what is that smell?

687
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,300
Oh God, is that you?

688
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,580
Oh, he's going to kiss me.

689
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,660
Oh, I'm going to smell like this for days.

690
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,940
I can't get this out of my snoot.

691
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,980
This next one comes from Alyssa who says,

692
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,620
did you know that if you see a bull snake around your house,

693
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,940
that means you don't have any rattlesnakes around?

694
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,580
Bull snakes will murder the fuck out of them.

695
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,300
Thank you, Alyssa.

696
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,900
If I see a bull snake around my house,

697
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,820
it also means that I don't own that house anymore.

698
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,220
Yeah.

699
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,940
My reaction whenever I see a snake is never like,

700
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,820
oh, great.

701
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,820
Fantastic.

702
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,060
Because what that basically is telling you

703
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,500
is the thing that can kill,

704
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,180
the thing that can kill you,

705
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,300
it lives in your house.

706
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,780
Let me identify that so I know how to react to it.

707
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,660
No, can't I just have a ricky-ticky-tabby

708
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,700
running around my house?

709
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,060
That would be fine.

710
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,540
Yeah.

711
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,900
Adorable little mongoose.

712
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,780
Now somebody's going to tell me the mongooses are mean.

713
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,740
They're probably not monkeys, first off.

714
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,700
And they're also probably not like the friendliest creatures.

715
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,820
They're bred to, they are bred to fight.

716
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,780
You know what I mean?

717
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,300
They're bred to kill snakes.

718
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:43,940
Yeah.

719
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,420
Anything whose main diet can,

720
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,180
if like, if the only thing I ate was great white sharks,

721
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,340
you probably wouldn't want to like chill with me.

722
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,180
I disagree.

723
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,460
I think you'd be like the coolest.

724
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,140
I'd have so many questions.

725
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,380
Yeah.

726
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,980
What's it taste like?

727
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,260
How do you get a steady supply?

728
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,860
Can I have some?

729
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,100
No.

730
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,340
Aren't those endangered?

731
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,780
Are you in prison?

732
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,780
They're endangered-er now.

733
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,380
With every bite, with every bite.

734
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,660
A little more endangered.

735
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:19,300
There are only a hundred thousand and eight point four left

736
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,100
because I am halfway through this meal.

737
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,100
You could actually come back.

738
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,500
I think they're big enough that you could just catch one,

739
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,540
grab a couple of fillets, ice them down,

740
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,060
and then release them back in the wild.

741
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,700
Let him heal up.

742
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,620
Now the great white's going to be pissed.

743
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:33,780
Yeah.

744
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,020
He's going to be, that's why they're all so angry

745
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:50,100
because Griffin keeps stealing fillets from them.

746
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,540
Pat, who's this first message for?

747
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,060
This first message is for Wilson.

748
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,260
Well, then it could only be from Ryan, I assume.

749
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,620
They're like buds forever.

750
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,940
Griffin, I want you to read this with the appropriate inflection.

751
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,420
Hey, Wilson.

752
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,060
Yeah, you, Wilson.

753
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,820
I don't know what to write.

754
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,700
What do you want me to do?

755
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,420
You're doing great.

756
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:08,980
Yeah, keep going.

757
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,700
You're doing great.

758
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,540
Is this freaking you out?

759
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,340
I bet it is.

760
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,500
Happy 21st birthday, you magnificent son of a bitch.

761
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,220
I like to imagine that right now they're in the same car

762
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,820
and Ryan just staring at him with a knife.

763
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,340
This is the last thing that happens.

764
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,180
Can we get one money zone that's just like,

765
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,140
this is how it ends.

766
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:29,940
Happy birthday.

767
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,460
Okay.

768
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,980
I'll be waiting for you at home.

769
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,100
The trap is sprung.

770
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,220
Thank you.

771
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,260
Thank you to both of you.

772
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,900
Your friendship sounds deeply, grossly rewarding.

773
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,980
Speaking of grossly rewarding,

774
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,860
let's talk about ExtremeRestraints.com.

775
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:55,220
It's an adult superstore where you can find a whole cornucopia of sexual delight.

776
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,860
H-O-L-E.

777
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,380
H-O-L-E.

778
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,220
H-O-L-E. Travis, you have a list, right?

779
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,980
Of our new coupon code, by the way.

780
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,700
It's going to save you 20% as sexabunga.

781
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,740
And Travis, I feel like you have heard,

782
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,820
you've gotten a communique from the ExtremeRestraints.com

783
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,660
of some of the items that have been purchased with this coupon code.

784
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,500
Now, of course, they don't attach names or anything,

785
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,220
so we don't know which one of you is the friend.

786
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,900
I also want to say, this comes straight from James.

787
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,820
This is market research, people.

788
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,420
My brother, my brother and me

789
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:32,420
has the sexiest, most adventurous listeners of anyone out there ever.

790
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,300
This is my life's fucking greatest accomplishment.

791
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,980
That we have created something

792
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:46,340
that is like a burning flame to all these fucking sex models.

793
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:46,900
I love it.

794
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,740
I think my favorite item on this list,

795
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,300
only because of the word choices,

796
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,980
is silicone derriere plug.

797
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,500
Oh my, how dignified.

798
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,060
I know.

799
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,780
That's also with a tea set, which is weird.

800
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,660
Oh, Daryl, Daryl, would you be a deer

801
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,820
and insert that plug into my derriere?

802
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,020
The one sitting on the doily, yes.

803
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,460
It's the one on the doily,

804
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,700
protecting the table from my natural oil.

805
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:24,500
If it won't fit, feel free to use some of my wig powder

806
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,740
to reduce the friction, Jeremy.

807
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,900
I also see on here that somebody bought a joint purse dress

808
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,020
of a male masturbation device and a strap-on.

809
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,340
They're not planning on doing anything

810
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,540
except putting the strap-on into the masturbation device.

811
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,580
I mean, that would seem like the obvious option here.

812
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,820
Maybe they'll be out of town for a while

813
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,300
and they want robbers to think someone's in there fucking.

814
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:59,140
Right, the flashlight is just a holster for the strap-on.

815
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,660
Like a sheath, a scabbard, if you will.

816
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,700
There's also a set of stainless steel kegel balls

817
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,060
purchased by itself,

818
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,540
and I want to say to whatever lady purchased that,

819
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,180
good for you.

820
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,540
Good for you.

821
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,140
You may not even have a man right now,

822
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,060
but when you do, you gonna be ready.

823
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,380
And?

824
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,020
You're gonna be ready to tear him apart.

825
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,820
And not only that,

826
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,820
but when you're not enjoying them in the traditional way,

827
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,300
you can take a couple fushigi lessons.

828
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,500
Perfect.

829
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,020
Perfecto.

830
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,660
Perfectamundo.

831
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,220
Perfecto.

832
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,860
So go to ExtremeRestraints.com,

833
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,020
use the coupon code Sexabunga, save yourself 20%,

834
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,580
and maybe you'll be sort of secondhand famous.

835
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,460
Who knows?

836
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,420
It's impossible to say.

837
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,820
But don't, you know, don't worry.

838
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,580
We're never gonna blow up your spot.

839
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,020
It's your secret, but you know what?

840
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,460
It shouldn't even be a secret.

841
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,540
Everybody just try something new.

842
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:54,900
You're worth it.

843
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,540
You've earned it.

844
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,580
Spice it up in there.

845
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,540
Easy, pretty, beautiful.

846
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,100
Hi, this is Biz.

And we host a show about being new moms.

849
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,620
Have you ever pretended to be a sleeping rock

850
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,860
to make your three-year-old play by yourself?

851
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,940
How about scream singing to make yourself think

852
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,300
you aren't screaming?

853
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,740
You're singing really, really loud!

Please.

861
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,900
This Yahoo was sent in by Wayne Rowan.

862
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,460
Thank you, Wayne.

863
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,500
It's by Yahoo Answers user Sophie who asks,

864
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,100
do horses have any emotions that humans don't have?

865
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,900
I am actually doing a horse behavior presentation

866
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,420
for an equine class I'm in.

867
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,340
But I was wondering if horses had exactly the same emotions

868
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,700
that we humans do.

869
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,180
Humans as in parentheses, as if like,

870
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,340
you didn't fucking know.

871
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,220
As we humans do.

872
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,020
I went on a website that told me the types of behavior

873
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,900
that horses have.

874
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,820
Buckle your asses in.

875
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,420
Can I make one quick point before you tell me

876
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,220
that horses have any emotions that humans don't have?

877
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,740
Quick point before you tell me the behavior,

878
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,700
the things that horses have.

879
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,540
I want to see if you did get something valuable from this

880
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,900
before your presentation.

881
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,460
I definitely, definitely can't wait to see

882
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,460
this line on the bibliography.

883
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,820
I can't wait to see how you cite the information

884
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,180
you received from Yahoo Answers.

885
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,740
Acceptance.

886
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,900
That's fair.

887
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,980
If you're professionally being ridden,

888
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:44,500
it's not ideal, but I don't have a noticeable bum, so.

889
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,700
I love oats and apples.

890
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,220
Affection, sure.

891
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,780
This is my favorite.

892
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,860
Anger one and anger two.

893
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,620
Anger one is like a quiet, reserved anger,

894
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,340
and anger two is like an explosion of biting.

895
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,020
It's just spurs.

896
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,460
That's the only thing that the,

897
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,660
if they see spurs like, ah.

898
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,020
Ah, no.

899
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,380
I am angry one.

900
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,820
Breaking out the dose today.

901
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:12,900
Annoyance.

902
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,780
Who doesn't?

903
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,340
Apathy.

904
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,660
Well, fine.

905
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:18,980
Oats.

906
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,180
I accepted too much.

907
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,380
Oats, I guess.

908
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,820
Another ride, ugh.

909
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,300
Yeah, sure.

910
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:23,700
Perfect.

911
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,500
Whatever.

912
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Jumps, tricks, it's all the same.

913
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,700
Beautifully soaring through nature

914
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,940
like an earthbound dragon, sure, why not?

915
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,780
Anxiety.

916
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:38,180
What if I run out of oats?

917
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:38,740
Could happen.

918
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:42,660
Boredom.

919
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,380
Well, what?

920
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,420
Okay, I can't blame them too much for that.

921
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,660
Right, it's like they can't even watch Game of Thrones.

922
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,300
Like, what?

923
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,180
Like, they don't get HBO.

924
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,340
Could you turn the TV towards the window, please?

925
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:54,660
Right.

926
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,180
Towards the window.

927
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,380
I got a big day today.

928
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,260
I'm either gonna stand in grass or run in a loop.

929
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,860
I can't wait to see what fate has in store.

930
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,060
Well, I mean, that's okay.

931
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,020
Tame horses, yes.

932
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,700
I could see them falling prey to boredom.

933
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,700
Wild horses, are you fucking kidding me?

934
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,700
Are you fucking kidding me?

935
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,220
Boredom for a wild horse, it can't happen.

936
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,220
Wild horses aren't familiar with this emotion

937
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,140
because they can just go jump over a brook

938
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,580
they've never jumped over before.

939
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,260
I have to imagine that for a wild horse,

940
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,740
it's mainly about anxiety because they're very fast

941
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,020
and I can see a situation where you're in a conversation

942
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,700
deep with another horse friend

943
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,700
and then all of a sudden you look at them and you think,

944
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:39,860
hey, Rodrigo, have you seen any grass for a while?

945
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,180
And then Rodrigo's like, oh my God, you're right.

946
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:42,980
There's no grass.

947
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,740
And they're in the middle of a parking lot.

948
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,860
They're in a parking lot.

949
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,500
Oh, great.

950
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,460
This is gonna be on the news.

951
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,660
Was no one paying attention?

952
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,220
Who was following who?

953
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,740
I'm feeling annoyance right now,

954
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,660
which could be upgraded to anger one

955
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,700
if something doesn't change.

956
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,700
If you keep running your fucking mouth, Rodrigo,

957
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,140
it's gonna get upgraded to anger two

958
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,100
and you don't want to see that.

959
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,180
So maybe just relax while we figure this out.

960
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:02,820
Compassion.

961
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,380
It's got a fat rider.

962
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:06,900
It's too bad.

963
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,420
You see Lucy?

964
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,780
Lucy's got a fat rider.

965
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,180
I know.

966
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,180
Poor thing.

967
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,100
If you are a being that is mainly bred to be ridden

968
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:20,260
and you can still work up compassion for anything else,

969
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,620
like, God bless you.

970
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,820
That is a beautiful, beautiful reserve of goodwill.

971
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,660
Well, they feel bad for the burros.

972
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,340
For the burros.

973
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:28,840
Sure.

974
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,380
Sure, they do.

975
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,180
For the burros.

976
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,060
Yeah.

977
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,460
No, roll the R's because it's not authentic if you don't.

978
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:35,860
Thank you.

979
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,740
I don't know what animal you're talking about

980
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,860
if you don't roll the R.

981
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,060
Uh, contentment.

982
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,620
Very few horses, I imagine, feel this.

983
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,100
Orb definitely feel, orb appreciates the fact

984
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,980
that he has reached the physical fucking apex

985
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,140
of possibly any creature on the planet.

986
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,780
That's just anxiety, right?

987
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,260
And even if you win the Kentucky Derby,

988
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,780
it's like, well, am I going to get the triple crown?

989
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,380
That's what everybody starts asking.

990
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,500
That's a lot of pressure.

991
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,940
Am I going to be able to fucking keep up

992
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,780
this perfect body until the preakness?

993
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,820
They're going to shower me in oats after this fucking thing.

994
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,300
What if I can't perform my stud duties?

995
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:11,780
Right.

996
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,500
Oh, man.

997
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,500
I bet orb-

998
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,140
That's rough.

999
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,940
I bet orb fucks like a cylinder.

1000
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,740
Like a stallion.

1001
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,780
There's a whole saying where someone says

1002
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,980
they're hung like a U.

1003
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,460
Yeah, that's a lot of pressure.

1004
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,060
Curiosity?

1005
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,160
Doubtful.

1006
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,980
Based on what?

1007
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,020
Why is that doubtful?

1008
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,980
Like, what are they curious about?

1009
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,860
They have everything they need.

1010
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,260
I wonder what driving a car is like.

1011
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,540
Right.

1012
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,420
If they are curious about it, I refuse to-

1013
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,620
If they're curious about anything,

1014
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,220
like, they're not-

1015
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,660
They're certainly not acting on it

1016
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,980
because they seem to be kind of in a rut as a species.

1017
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,300
Yeah, nobody's ever said curiosity killed the horse

1018
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,860
because a horse will see like-

1019
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,860
A fucking helicopter could land next to a horse

1020
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,660
and a horse would be like,

1021
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,460
that's not an apple.

1022
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,180
Is that an apple?

1023
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,020
You check for a stem.

1024
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,900
Nope, no stem.

1025
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,380
No, thanks.

1026
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,260
Come back when you're hay.

1027
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,200
Fear?

1028
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,300
Sure.

1029
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:09,800
Yeah.

1030
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,220
Yeah, daily.

1031
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,020
If there's a bull-

1032
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,380
If there's a bull snake around,

1033
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,740
those things are terrified.

1034
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,380
Loneliness?

1035
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,980
Not if I have anything to say about it.

1036
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,100
Physical suffering.

1037
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,060
Yes, sure.

1038
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,180
Definitely, 100%.

1039
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:22,680
Absolutely.

1040
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,340
Their entire being is suspended

1041
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,420
in a state of constant suffering.

1042
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,060
So, yes.

1043
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,380
Think about how sad-

1044
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,060
When horses get the spurs

1045
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,420
and then they run faster,

1046
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,660
they're trying to run away from a danger

1047
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,820
that is like physically attached to them.

1048
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,300
Right.

1049
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,140
That's the saddest thing in the world.

1050
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,180
Which most humans have,

1051
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,660
but do horses have any emotions that humans don't have

1052
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,260
or that humans can't relate to?

1053
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:46,660
Thanks.

1054
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:47,460
Prance?

1055
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,180
A ladder?

1056
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:48,660
Yes.

1057
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,140
What?

1058
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:49,700
Prancing?

1059
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,900
Prancing is my-

1060
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,400
Okay.

1061
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:52,820
Yeah.

1062
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,500
I've never felt prancing.

1063
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,780
I don't think that's beyond human-

1064
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,180
It's beyond you, yes.

1065
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,740
Just because of like your physique.

1066
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,140
No offense.

1067
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,180
Wouldn't you think, though,

1068
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,420
that if the horses did have an emotion

1069
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,540
that we don't have in humankind,

1070
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,420
then we probably don't have a human word for it, right?

1071
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:10,740
Right.

1072
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,460
It's sort of like-

1073
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,580
It's kind of like the flavor umami.

1074
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,260
Sure.

1075
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,060
It's an indescribable thing.

1076
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,620
It's like if there were any new colors that we didn't know,

1077
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,020
we would know about it.

1078
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,740
You know what I mean?

1079
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,660
Are there any suggestions from Yahoo answerers

1080
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,780
as to some emotions that horses might feel

1081
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,220
that we might not be able to detect?

1082
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,580
Yahoo answers user MsEquine responded and said,

1083
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,540
all that you listed-

1084
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,460
Wait, hold on.

1085
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,340
I don't know if they're saying that her list was comprehensive

1086
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,620
or that MsEquine is incapable of feeling acceptance,

1087
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,340
affection, anger 1, anger 2, annoyance, apathy, anxiety,

1088
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,340
boredom, compassion, consent, and curiosity,

1089
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,020
fear, loneliness, and physical suffering.

1090
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,060
First I've heard of it.

1091
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:53,860
What is this stuff?

1092
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,500
Compassion.

1093
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,260
Go on.

1094
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,620
Oh, MsEquine.

1095
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,980
Yahoo answers user Zakit says,

1096
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,140
I do not believe they have compassion.

1097
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,540
I've seen some horses do some cold ass shit.

1098
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,700
If anything happens to another horse,

1099
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,220
the horse is unlikely to help out.

1100
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,500
He might just continue to graze

1101
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,340
or to watch with mild interest.

1102
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,740
What do you want the horse to do?

1103
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,020
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1104
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,540
Fucking cut it out, man.

1105
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,100
To be fair, it says compassion.

1106
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,620
That doesn't necessarily mean that

1107
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,220
they're going to do anything about it.

1108
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,700
They could just feel real bad about it

1109
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,660
and be like, well, what am I going to do?

1110
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,380
I don't have thumbs.

1111
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,100
Just got these hooves.

1112
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,940
If you have a hoof related debacle for me to fix, maybe.

1113
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,540
Am I supposed to pull a rock out of your shoe?

1114
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,740
What am I supposed to do?

1115
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,300
I'm a horse.

1116
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,300
I'll give you some hay.

1117
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,300
No, I need it.

1118
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,460
Yahoo answers user blackcatmagic says,

1119
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,380
I think it's foolish to think that

1120
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,980
we know exactly what horses feel.

1121
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,500
Maybe they do feel all the things that we do,

1122
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,780
but have different ways of showing it

1123
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,700
that we can't begin to understand.

1124
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,220
Maybe they don't show certain emotions at all,

1125
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,740
but that doesn't mean they aren't feeling.

1126
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,500
Until horses learn to talk,

1127
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,860
we'll never know, smiley face.

1128
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,220
Until.

1129
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,420
Yeah, I like the conditional.

1130
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:10,900
Until.

1131
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,900
The conditional in that statement is wonderful.

1132
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,100
Until.

1133
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:14,740
Until.

1134
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,300
For now.

1135
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,540
Much like man used to stare into the skies and wonder.

1136
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,860
By 2017, think how foolish this question will appear.

1137
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,580
God.

1138
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,020
Horsebizgirl says,

1139
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,900
horses don't feel guilty about things.

1140
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,780
Humans feel regret.

1141
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,500
Horses don't.

1142
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,660
Horses lost a big race.

1143
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,180
Oh well, oats.

1144
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,980
Trampled that kid.

1145
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,700
Oats.

1146
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,620
I have a question.

1147
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,100
If horses don't feel bad about anything in their past,

1148
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,060
why are they running?

1149
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,300
Think about it.

1150
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,700
Are they running to something?

1151
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,060
No, they're running away.

1152
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,580
I want to know if a horse can feel shame.

1153
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:03,860
What would a horse-

1154
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,020
Plenty of opportunities to feel that, if so.

1155
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,020
What could a horse possibly be ashamed of?

1156
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,100
Like, hey, you just pooped in the middle of the street.

1157
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:11,700
I guess.

1158
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,380
You're dragging a cart for a living.

1159
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,100
You're majestic.

1160
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:14,900
What are you doing?

1161
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,180
I know I'm ashamed.

1162
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:20,420
There's an emotion that I've never felt that I bet horses could feel.

1163
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,740
Like, there might be some based on their understanding of the world.

1164
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,740
Like, there might be a feeling of,

1165
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:30,740
can someone please learn how to cook oats?

1166
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:33,460
There has to be a way to cook oats.

1167
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,060
I would never have that emotion.

1168
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,420
And that's why I don't have an English way of translating it,

1169
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,860
but I bet that feeling is kind of a present part of their day.

1170
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,340
They think-

1171
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:46,020
You're saying that they are constantly disappointed in oats.

1172
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:47,300
Right.

1173
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,780
Oats because we keep giving them,

1174
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,020
but they can't express a preference for one or the other.

1175
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,140
Maybe they're sitting there like,

1176
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,300
can I please just have like a hamburger or something?

1177
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,060
See you doing it.

1178
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:57,860
Is there-

1179
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,660
Do you think horses feel disappointment in us?

1180
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,420
In humanity?

1181
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:02,920
Yeah.

1182
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,740
I should hope so.

1183
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,460
I mean, we've not been great custodians at this time.

1184
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,500
No.

1185
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,260
In fact, I think they're kind of getting the shitty end of this deal.

1186
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,860
The deal we struck up between us and-

1187
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:19,540
We looked at horses gallivanting across the plains of the American West and thought,

1188
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,500
I'm gonna sit on that.

1189
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,700
Hey, do that for me now.

1190
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,100
I could break that.

1191
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,580
I'm gonna sit on that forever.

1192
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,380
You could-

1193
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:27,780
I'll tell you-

1194
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,940
Even after I develop an automobile,

1195
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,980
which is by all means much more efficient than my stool,

1196
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,100
I'm still going to keep horses and sit on them.

1197
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,660
I'm saying-

1198
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,580
There may be an emotion for knowing that you're the first horse

1199
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,180
to ever let someone sit on them.

1200
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:48,420
And now your children's children's children's children's children

1201
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,140
are gonna have a human being strapped to their back.

1202
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,420
The first horse that got caught.

1203
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,780
What is that feeling like?

1204
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:56,420
You have to carry-

1205
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,300
I don't have a word for that.

1206
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,660
Well, let's just try this out.

1207
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,780
Let's just try this out for a bit and see if we both like it.

1208
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,620
Surely human beings will recognize how inefficient this is.

1209
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:05,780
Right.

1210
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,140
Surely they'll invent cars.

1211
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:12,260
Don't you have to think there was a horse very near to the Ford plant

1212
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,980
and like the first Model T comes out and they're like,

1213
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,300
whew!

1214
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,060
All right, guys, great news.

1215
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,660
I just saw the most wondrous sight.

1216
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,420
We're gonna be free now.

1217
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,940
We're gonna be a-okay.

1218
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,500
I hope they make these cars big enough for us horses to drive.

1219
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,020
And even if not, at least we'll be able to run free again.

1220
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:30,500
I hope-

1221
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,180
I hope they give us a nice, some like a big area that's just for us.

1222
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:38,580
A whole state just for horses as a nice way of saying we're sorry

1223
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,580
for sitting on you for eternity.

1224
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,900
Guys, I can't feel anger too.

1225
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,620
I just don't-

1226
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,260
I don't-

1227
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:50,980
Let me sit up.

1228
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,700
Let me sit on you and sit on everyone you've ever met.

1229
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,420
That would fucking do it.

1230
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,180
We'll see if you can't work it up.

1231
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:56,420
Yeah.

1232
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,660
Coming this summer, the sequel to everyone's favorite emotion.

1233
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:04,260
I have an office job, and a new employee was recently hired on.

1234
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,460
He seems like a nice normal guy, except for this one thing.

1235
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,780
He keeps winking at everybody all the time.

1236
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,260
Oh, man.

1237
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,380
In almost every conversation he has, usually when he's making a joke

1238
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,420
or saying something that could be considered amusing, he winks.

1239
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,460
It's making me and my other co-workers a bit uncomfortable.

1240
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,860
What should we do about this wacky winker?

1241
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:22,740
Winked at.

1242
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:28,900
Do you know what would make this already hilarious situation even funnier?

1243
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,820
I can't stop thinking about it.

1244
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,420
It's giving me a Google fit.

1245
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:38,980
What if every time this dude winked, his eyeball made like an audible squishing sound?

1246
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:44,660
Like, just like that, every time he winked.

1247
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,780
You know what I'm talking about.

1248
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:50,580
Someone just threw up in their mouth.

1249
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,140
Sorry, everybody.

1250
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:51,620
Sorry.

1251
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:58,660
This person is the most confident person that I've ever met.

1252
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,460
That has ever lived.

1253
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:04,980
This person is a beautiful soaring eagle, and I don't want you to do anything to change him.

1254
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,740
I do not know that I have ever unironically winked at someone ever.

1255
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,980
When was the last time you winked at anybody?

1256
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:16,420
I mean, sometimes I'll do it as a joke and actually say the word wink when I do it.

1257
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,820
But I've never been like, I'm going to convey a secret message or confidence

1258
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,740
via a closing of my eyeball.

1259
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:29,060
Right, you've never hatched a plan in an impromptu nature, unspokenly.

1260
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:34,980
Now, I'll lay my finger to the side of my nose and kind of do like a flick, you know, kind of thing.

1261
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,620
Right, but then you think people are asking you to do cocaine.

1262
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,500
Okay, that does explain a lot, actually.

1263
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:45,380
If you think about it, a wink is pretty much the boldest gesture you can give.

1264
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,620
It's really like setting a wild animal free.

1265
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,500
You have so little control over how that is perceived.

1266
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:52,900
Right.

1267
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:53,540
By people.

1268
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,460
I don't think I've ever...

1269
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,620
If I have winked at someone, I don't think I've ever done it without worrying like,

1270
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,300
did they think that was sexual?

1271
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,060
Did they think that I was lying?

1272
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,100
Did they think that I was having a seizure?

1273
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,700
Could you do it?

1274
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:12,180
Okay, this is completely off topic, but do you think that you could wink in like a threatening way?

1275
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,700
Or like just in like a wink that conveys nothing?

1276
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,260
Just like a neutral wink?

1277
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,860
I think if I'm in the ring, if I'm in the boxing ring,

1278
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:26,500
I'm a professional boxer and I'm about to go up against Mayweather.

1279
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,180
If I'm going up against the Santa Maria and the Pinta,

1280
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,540
if I'm about to fucking lay into some dude with punches

1281
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:41,380
and right before I get to him in the ring, he winks at me, I'm done.

1282
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,540
TKO right there.

1283
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,820
I don't know what the fuck...

1284
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:48,740
Yeah, I think you can get in an opponent's head in that manner,

1285
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:51,540
in a manner that could be described as threatening.

1286
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,060
You have to partner, I think...

1287
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:57,300
I think if you were in the ring with somebody right before the punching was to commence,

1288
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,580
you looked at them and said,

1289
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,500
hey, I'm not going to punch him.

1290
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,380
Wink.

1291
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:01,880
Wink?

1292
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,660
Because then it's like, does he mean it?

1293
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,460
What does that mean?

1294
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,660
Should I not punch him?

1295
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,100
Is this an agreement?

1296
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,780
I was expecting him to punch me,

1297
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,460
so I don't know why he would be letting on that the punching was going to commence.

1298
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,220
Are we just going to use our words?

1299
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,300
And you would have thought that far before it's like,

1300
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:22,820
haymaker on the mat, one, two, three, four, I'm just going to skip him because you're clearly done.

1301
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,320
Ten.

1302
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:28,340
What would you do if you paid big money to get front row seats for a boxing match in Vegas,

1303
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:34,180
and then you got there and then within seconds you realize that they've just turned it into forensics?

1304
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,700
They're just getting up there and they're going to do monologues.

1305
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,220
With the wink heard around the world.

1306
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:39,720
Right.

1307
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:47,480
Um, I have never received a wink from a stranger and not like felt it,

1308
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,600
like physically like it like pushed me back a little bit.

1309
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,520
How would you define the physical conduct that you felt from the wink?

1310
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,520
Like a smack in the face or like a poke?

1311
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,000
It takes my breath away every time.

1312
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,500
Wow.

1313
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,680
Just because like the power move?

1314
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,480
It's just startling because like both of their eyes were open.

1315
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,920
You know what I mean?

1316
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,800
And they didn't blink.

1317
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,600
I would have been fine if both of them had gone down, but I just saw one of them.

1318
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,680
And they're going to be off sync for the rest of the day.

1319
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,680
You're going to have to be individually winking.

1320
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,840
Also, do they want to see my like genital?

1321
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,920
Like what, what does it mean?

1322
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,840
What are they trying to get across?

1323
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,280
What are they trying to tell me?

1324
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,160
That, that is what throws people about winks, I think.

1325
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,200
Because you...

1326
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,600
Can we take back, can we take back the wink so that it's not,

1327
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:39,080
it's not seen as a seductive measure as much as it is like a high five.

1328
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,080
Like a, hey, we're all in this together.

1329
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,380
You know?

1330
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,440
If someone says we're all in this together and then they wink at you,

1331
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,560
do they mean that you're not?

1332
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,400
Oh, okay.

1333
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,480
Is it a subterfuge like double back thing?

1334
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,040
I always think a wink means you're lying.

1335
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,400
Like that to me is what that like, oh, we'll see if we can go.

1336
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,240
That only works if you're facing some kind of like international terrorist

1337
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,400
and he's got a gun on you and you look at your partner and go,

1338
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,080
oh, I guess, you know, we have to give up wink.

1339
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,040
I don't think it works if you're like, you did a really good job on this project.

1340
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,400
Right, but then the terrorists will be like,

1341
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,920
is this guy trying to, is this guy trying to bone down?

1342
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,420
Like...

1343
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,440
I'm trying to think back to the times that I've been winked at.

1344
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,560
And in retrospect, I'm pretty sure I've never been winked at

1345
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,280
and I haven't made a face like I just smelled rotten yogurt.

1346
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,680
It's, it, I think it would be like, oh, okay, fine.

1347
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,960
Wink at me, I guess.

1348
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:37,960
If a grandpa does it to me, then it reads as like a symbol of familiarity.

1349
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,600
Maybe even feigned familiarity, but I don't read it like

1350
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,720
this grandpa's trying to get in my jorts, you know?

1351
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,240
You're saying it's grandpa safe.

1352
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,920
It's grandpa safe. Grandpas can do it.

1353
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,800
If a person who has been hired on is winking and is also a grandpa,

1354
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,720
then everything I just said is okay.

1355
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,440
Okay, what if this, what if it's...

1356
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,800
Or a grandma.

1357
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,080
What if it's used as a means to convey approval

1358
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,120
that you don't want to say out loud?

1359
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,200
Like you're talking to someone at a party

1360
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,040
and your friend from across the room is,

1361
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,400
doesn't want to do like a thumbs up because that's too, that's too much.

1362
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,880
But you're saying like, oh, you guys seem to really be hitting it off.

1363
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,240
You can convey that with a wink, right?

1364
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:15,640
Where you're like...

1365
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,440
If I'm at a party and someone from across the room winks at me,

1366
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,200
I'm going to assume they put a bomb in there.

1367
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,800
I'm going to assume there's a bomb in the building.

1368
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,360
But if it's like your best bud, if it's like your best bud

1369
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,560
and kind of does like a half nod, like wink, like you're doing it.

1370
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,280
If it's a good party, Davey, and then he winks at me,

1371
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,440
I'm like, oh God, you're going to kill everybody in here, aren't you?

1372
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,960
Fuck, this is a party.

1373
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,000
You will reflexively just mouth back to him.

1374
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,640
Upstairs.

1375
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:39,880
Upstairs.

1376
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,720
Why are you doing this to me?

1377
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,960
What if every time he winked at you, you winked right back?

1378
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,160
Twice.

1379
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,440
Twice.

1380
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,640
Let him know what it's like.

1381
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,520
Cause I think this guy maybe doesn't have a world view

1382
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,120
where people have winked at him a lot.

1383
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,920
So if you wink at this guy, then he's going to feel those.

1384
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,360
Let him know how weird it is.

1385
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,400
Also, only do this to this person in the restroom.

1386
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,240
That'll really break him of this habit.

1387
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,680
Hey, hey.

1388
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,920
Nice penis.

1389
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,800
Boink, boink.

1390
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,000
Is it appropriate to leave a small party?

1391
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,880
Six people.

1392
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:20,360
When someone puts on Gangnam style and asks everyone to start dancing.

1393
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,800
That's from Unsure in Oklahoma.

1394
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,920
Oh, this is the shittiest.

1395
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,920
Oops, you're in the shittiest party.

1396
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:29,320
I would actually argue that six people does not constitute a small party.

1397
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:33,640
Well, it's not a party until Gangnam style comes on and then uh oh, it is.

1398
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,360
It is a small party in the Dungeons and Dragons sense,

1399
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,560
but not in the typical social sense.

1400
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:44,440
Here's, okay, the verbiage in this question that really throws me off.

1401
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,160
He said, if you had asked, is it appropriate to leave a small party

1402
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,840
when someone puts on Gangnam style and everyone starts dancing?

1403
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,040
Yeah, if you leave that, if you leave that, then you're a stick in the mud.

1404
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:54,760
Uh huh.

1405
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,920
But if you, when someone puts on Gangnam style and asks everyone.

1406
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,200
Attention, please.

1407
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,880
Attention, please.

1408
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,320
Can we all rise to our feet?

1409
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,040
I'm going to teach everyone the dance.

1410
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,360
I learned it from YouTube.

1411
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,120
Lever up.

1412
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:15,160
Move your legs from side to side as if you were straddling an invisible pony.

1413
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,520
Dance, you beautiful bastards.

1414
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,280
This, we are golden gods.

1415
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:29,320
There, the fun thing about this question is that this person has already lived this scenario

1416
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,000
and one of two things happened.

1417
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,840
Either they, they feel bad because someone said everyone start dancing to Gangnam style

1418
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,080
and they said, I'm leaving.

1419
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,080
And then they walked out the door and never looked back.

1420
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:45,800
Or they did do it and they dance and they're wondering, was there another way?

1421
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,400
Was there an alternate option?

1422
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,240
Now, I think it was the former and I think the next day the host of the party,

1423
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:56,920
this, this psychopath who dictates when the dancing occurs,

1424
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,120
she came up to them and was like, hey, what the fuck, man?

1425
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,880
Like we were having a great time last night.

1426
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,480
That was inappropriate, Dave.

1427
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,640
You left and then there were only five people

1428
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,880
and that definitely doesn't count as a party anymore.

1429
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,000
You ruined my birthday.

1430
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,080
Oh, what if the host of the party was Psy?

1431
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,080
Oh, that is egomaniacal.

1432
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,520
And he put on his own song and he said, please, it's all I have.

1433
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:23,400
I don't think there's an organism on earth that is more sick of that song than,

1434
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,560
than Dr. Psy.

1435
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,440
I think I have to assume nobody likes his ballads.

1436
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,080
You know what I mean?

1437
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,440
Nobody likes his likes his tender lovemaking stuff.

1438
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,120
Everybody will try to get into gentlemen, but they're not feeling it.

1439
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:36,520
People.

1440
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:36,760
Yeah.

1441
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,640
People, people listen to gentlemen out of fucking courtesy.

1442
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,200
You know what I mean?

1443
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,160
But the hook, the hook, we owe him this one.

1444
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:43,640
Yeah.

1445
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:47,320
He's given us so much and we in turn have also given him quite a bit.

1446
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:47,880
Yeah.

1447
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,560
But the hook on that one does not bring me back.

1448
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,640
It's sort of like, it's sort of like how people continue to listen to

1449
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,640
If It Makes You Happy by Sheryl Crow

1450
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,080
because they, they really appreciated all I want to do so much.

1451
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,040
And it was like they, they did all they could do for all I want to do.

1452
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,120
They bought the single, they bought the album.

1453
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,920
And then when that next album came out with It Makes You Happy,

1454
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,880
they thought, well, you know what?

1455
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,840
I still owe her.

1456
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,360
I am still in debt to her for all the fun that first song brought me.

1457
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:12,520
Right.

1458
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,480
Yeah, it's exactly, it's exactly like that.

1459
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,520
Yeah.

1460
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,680
There's so many similarities between Psy and Sheryl Crow

1461
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,360
that I feel like a lot of people just like goes right over their head.

1462
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,280
Have you ever seen them in the same room together?

1463
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,160
I have not.

1464
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,120
No, I have not.

1465
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,360
Could it be a Phoenix rebirth?

1466
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,040
You think Sheryl, did Sheryl Crow fucking die?

1467
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,400
No, I'm saying that Sheryl Crow met with like her advisors

1468
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,000
and she said, I need a new persona.

1469
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:35,320
And they said-

1470
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,080
She went to Phoenix online university.

1471
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,760
Took some classes in Korean.

1472
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:44,200
And she took a minor in hammer dancing.

1473
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,880
Did you guys see that mashup?

1474
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,880
Oh, that went down good.

1475
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,480
When the two of them performed that together,

1476
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,600
that's when I knew it wasn't Sheryl Crow

1477
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,120
because she's a notorious racist.

1478
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,520
A lot of people know that.

1479
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,280
All I want to do is have fun with white people.

1480
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,560
You probably wouldn't know that she's not a terrific racist

1481
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,640
by looking at the crowds at her shows.

1482
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,200
You would assume that this is just a place

1483
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,800
where non-white people are not allowed.

1484
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,960
But that does explain all the Sheryl Crow laws.

1485
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,680
Fuck, I've got some history into it.

1486
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:25,560
Good work, Travis.

1487
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,320
Hey, Travis, Travis, I'm proud of the reference you just made.

1488
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,040
Thank you, Griffin.

1489
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,840
That's an emotional word that's never experienced.

1490
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,360
I'm proud of your Sheryl Crow joke.

1491
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,720
That's one they don't know.

1492
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,760
Hey, listen, thank you so much for spending an hour with us,

1493
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,120
my brother, my brother, me.

1494
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,960
We really hope you've had as much fun

1495
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,440
as we pretended to have listening to the show.

1496
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,120
Thank you to people tweeting about it.

1497
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,280
Kembo Soup tweeted,

1498
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,240
Sexabunga, it's Pride weekend in SF.

1499
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,480
What did we fucking say?

1500
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,760
What did we explicitly say?

1501
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,000
We explicitly said, don't type that out.

1502
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,080
Don't ever put it in text.

1503
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,000
But he's on blast and he knows it,

1504
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
so I'm sure he feels terrible.

1505
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,760
Michael Harrison, thank you.

1506
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,040
Vincent Perea, maybe.

1507
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,280
Mason Church, Claire, Large Demon,

1508
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,920
Brianna Cole, Kat, Josh Renner,

1509
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,400
Trevor Wattman, Paul Peacock,

1510
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,240
Eric Edens, Justin Blankenship.

1511
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,560
Thank you so much, everybody tweeting about the show.

1512
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,800
Hey, maybe tweet out a sampler of our show.

1513
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,640
It's bit.ly forward slash mbmbam2013.

1514
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:37,160
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1515
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,120
for the use of our theme song

1516
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,320
instead of departure off the album,

1517
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,680
Putting the Days to Bed.

1518
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,960
Did you buy that yet, folks?

1519
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,000
Did you, hey, go get that album.

1520
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:43,960
Let me just really quick,

1521
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,720
can I look at your bank statement

1522
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,000
and see if there's a Telltale iTunes receipt on there?

1523
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,600
Thank you, John Roderick.

1524
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,280
Also, Juice, mention the PO box.

1525
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,320
We haven't mentioned that in a while.

1526
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,560
Oh yeah, we have a mailbox

1527
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:03,320
where you can send us physical objects of your affection.

1528
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,840
Please don't send any more weird things.

1529
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,680
We got another weird envelope

1530
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,760
that just had like six unrelated items in it

1531
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,360
and that really skeezes me out.

1532
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,480
Please don't do that.

1533
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,800
And don't now do it as like a joke about that.

1534
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,080
Like I won't enjoy it.

1535
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,800
We have expressly said that's our least favorite thing.

1536
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,360
But if you want to send us wedding invitations, go for it.

1537
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,880
Yeah, those are always sweet.

1538
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:28,920
PO box 54, Huntington, West Virginia, 25706.

1539
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,960
We got one from Morocco.

1540
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:36,200
It's in the Sahara from Bill, Bill Andrews.

1541
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,800
He's in Marrakesh, Morocco.

1542
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:40,920
Awesome.

1543
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,360
Oh, I had no idea what you were talking about.

1544
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,080
You said Morocco.

1545
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,440
Nobody shortens that to that.

1546
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,520
I'm just telling you what it says.

1547
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,800
Why wouldn't you say Rocco?

1548
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,080
I'm in the co.

1549
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,520
He's in the, and it's real

1550
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,720
because there's like weird stamps I don't recognize.

1551
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,080
So thank you to Bill.

1552
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,080
That's a really cool postcard to get and I'll put it.

1553
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,320
I've been looking at it and brings me great joy.

1554
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:01,880
Thank you, Bill.

1555
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,640
Also, everyone should check out our other max fun podcast.

1556
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,400
We're growing every, it seems like every day.

1557
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,480
And most recently, we've added a new podcast called saw bones

1558
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:17,480
featuring our own Justin McRoy and Sydney McRoy, his wonderful wife.

1559
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,680
The latest episode is about Mercury.

1560
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,400
It's really great.

1561
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:25,320
Check it out and thank you so much for listening.

1562
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,080
We got one more question from Griffin

1563
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,400
and he's going to drop it on us and then we'll come back

1564
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,640
and revisit it next week and give you the secret answer

1565
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,280
that we've been cooking.

1566
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,360
That joke has got to stop because people are going to start expecting.

1567
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,520
No one's noticed yet.

1568
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,080
It is.

1569
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,640
If you buy our iPhone app, you too could hear this.

1570
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,720
Don't buy the iPhone.

1571
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,080
It's called the MBNBA app.

1572
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,200
It's great.

1573
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:46,920
Don't worry.

1574
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:47,960
We won't.

1575
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,680
We won't say it out loud, but you can find it hidden.

1576
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:51,960
If you look hard enough, I'm not going to.

1577
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,960
I'm not going to send you your portion of the money.

1578
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,320
If you keep saying three and a half dollars that we've made with it.

1579
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,240
All right.

1580
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,280
I'm keeping it for myself.

1581
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,720
Taking myself out to a nice steak dinner.

1582
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,640
