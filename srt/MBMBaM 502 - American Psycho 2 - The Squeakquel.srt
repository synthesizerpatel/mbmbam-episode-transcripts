00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Hi, it's Jesse, the founder of MaxFun.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,760
We promised you a MaxFun drive this week,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,800
but things haven't exactly gone how we expected.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,320
So given the pandemic,

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,200
we're gonna postpone this year's drive.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,160
Events are still fluid,

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,880
so we're hesitant to give you specifics about new dates.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,240
Right now we have late April penciled into our calendars.

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,280
We'll keep you posted about that.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,440
As it stands,

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,120
a lot of our drive machinery was already cranked up.

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,480
So for one thing,

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,640
you might hear a reference or two to the drive in our shows,

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,200
which might've been recorded before we made this decision.

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,440
And here's some good news.

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,720
There's a bunch of great bonus content

17
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,160
available for all of our MaxFun members.

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,960
If you're a member and you missed the email

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,560
with instructions on how to listen,

20
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,240
check your spam folder,

21
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,240
or log in at maximumfun.org slash manage.

22
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,440
Also at maximumfun.org slash manage,

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,000
you can change your membership.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,360
If your circumstances have changed,

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,600
we know this is a tough time for a lot of people

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,240
and we understand.

27
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,920
You can also go to maximumfun.org slash join at any time

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,520
if you'd like to become a member.

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,200
During the next couple of weeks,

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,240
what would have been the drive,

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,320
we're going to do our best to be extra available to you.

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,120
We've got some streaming events planned,

33
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,760
some social media stuff.

34
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,480
We know a lot of folks are isolated right now

35
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,160
and we wanna help provide comfort

36
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,200
in the best ways that we know how.

37
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,960
You can follow us on social media

38
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,600
and we'll let you know what's up.

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,560
During this tough time,

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,000
I have been feeling really grateful

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
for my community of colleagues here at MaxFun

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,600
and for you, the folks who make our work possible.

43
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,680
Goofy as that work may sometimes be.

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,160
Stay safe out there.

45
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,520
We're thinking of you.

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,160
The McElroy brothers are not experts

47
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,040
and their advice should never be followed.

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,400
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

49
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,800
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

50
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,120
Also, this show isn't for kids,

51
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,520
which I mentioned only so the babies out there

52
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,840
will know how cool they are for listening.

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,240
What's up, you cool baby?

54
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:36,040
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

55
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,520
Hello everyone and welcome to, hold on, let me open this book

56
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,840
to a new chapter.

57
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,680
Welcome to a new era of my brother, my brother and me,

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,560
a lifestyle experience guide.

59
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,520
Ooh.

60
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,720
My name is Justin McElroy.

61
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,160
I'm your oldest guide.

62
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,240
Hey, this is Griffin.

63
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,680
I go second now and yeah,

64
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,520
I'm all about just sort of these orbs, guys.

65
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,000
Hi, I'm Travis.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,840
All right.

67
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,200
Yep, you see it's so weird.

68
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
I will wait for three hours for Griffin to do his now.

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,640
Hey, it's me Griffin again.

70
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,280
Just checking in about these orbs.

71
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,760
You touched these orbs yet?

72
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,600
No, you got to get with these orbs, man.

73
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,840
Hi, I'm Travis.

74
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,600
I'm kind of the CFO of our lifestyle brands.

75
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,480
I'm not so much on the creative,

76
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,800
but I make sure everyone gets paid

77
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,600
and that their health insurance stays current.

78
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,440
He's afraid of these orbs.

79
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,160
I keep telling him nothing to be afraid of

80
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,920
unless you drop one on your foot.

81
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,840
I appreciate the orbs, but I am looking at the books

82
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,120
and it does say here in our ledgers

83
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,760
that we still use for some reason

84
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,120
that it is time to pay the piper.

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,320
Oh, that's right.

86
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,160
Yeah.

87
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,000
Oh boy.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,720
Thank you, Travis, for bringing up this awkward.

89
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,200
Now listen, we begged Travis not to do this.

90
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,120
I didn't beg him.

91
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,960
We said it's a new era.

92
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,240
Creatives over here, they were saying like,

93
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,360
we're focused on these artisanal paper

94
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,320
and artisanal glasses.

95
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,880
Artisanal air, Griffin, you said at one point,

96
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,720
which I didn't get.

97
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,080
Well, it's inside the orbs, isn't it?

98
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,000
I guess.

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,480
Something's gotta be in there.

100
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,320
There's a piper here.

101
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,080
There's an artisanal piper that you guys ordered

102
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,760
and someone needs to pay them.

103
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,080
So we're gonna talk a little bit more about it

104
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,560
later in the show, but should we just start

105
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,160
telling people about what kind of a new body slime?

106
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,160
We're into and what kind of acupuncture needles

107
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,080
we're all about these days.

108
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,760
Do you know what's way in, Griffin?

109
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
What is it?

110
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,320
It's getting wet and rolling around in sand

111
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,320
and then just getting dressed over that

112
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,520
and going about your day.

113
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,880
It's like a natural exfoliant.

114
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,000
Just having a little gritty time in the city.

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,040
Yeah.

116
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,040
I like this.

117
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,320
And then at the end of the day,

118
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,400
your boss is riding your freaking jock

119
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,880
trying to get you to file those reports.

120
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,440
You get home, you take a shower,

121
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,000
Pearl falls out of your butt crack.

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,240
Yep.

123
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,280
It can happen.

124
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,760
It does happen every day to people like you

125
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,600
and now can happen.

126
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,040
I'm afraid Justin died.

127
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,920
We're gonna start out with kind of a retro vibe

128
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,160
and take a question from our listenership

129
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,520
and then we'll ease into some of the bigger changes.

130
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,200
We should point out, and you know what?

131
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,840
We should also point out, we are recording this

132
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,480
for the first time ever weeks ahead of time,

133
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,320
which is why our first question is about Valentine's Day,

134
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,200
which will seem weird when you hear this in mid-March.

135
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,720
I collected money for a Valentine's Day singing gram

136
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,000
for one of my professors and got $1 from one girl

137
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,920
and $2 and quarters from a guy.

138
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,920
The gram is $5.

139
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,280
Then I got so dang busy,

140
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,760
I didn't find the time to buy the gram

141
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,680
and their money is sitting on my desk.

142
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,240
It's been three days.

143
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,160
They haven't asked,

144
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,320
but I know they didn't get a singing gram.

145
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,000
Do I steal their $3 or awkwardly give it back?

146
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,200
Now, I just want to clarify,

147
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,120
because Justin used the wrong word there.

148
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,680
They know that the professor didn't get a singing gram.

149
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,960
So the two people that this question asker

150
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,560
collected money from are well aware

151
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,800
that that money was not spent on a singing telegram.

152
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,720
Okay.

153
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,440
Is this not why Venmo was invented?

154
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,120
Or PayPal or whatever your-

155
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,000
Oh, Sharon just sent you $2

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,040
with the note, I fucked up Valentine's Day.

157
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,880
Like, yeah.

158
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,720
Like, yes.

159
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,440
It's how you send money when you're embarrassed.

160
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,800
It's how you pay for things you're scared about, you know?

161
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,520
You could call it an investment in next year's gram.

162
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,120
Thank you for your early support

163
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,960
of building on a layaway plan, a layaway gram.

164
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,800
There you are.

165
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,160
Listen, it's been a while.

166
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,960
I've been out of the game for a while now

167
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,240
when it comes to singing telegrams for professors,

168
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,880
but $5 seems awfully low, doesn't it?

169
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,880
It seems like not very much money.

170
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,440
I don't think you can buy,

171
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,080
this may be the only thing you can get with $5.

172
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,480
Yeah, a human being is gonna have to use their mouth

173
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,880
to sing in public in front of another human being

174
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,680
who is looking at them for $5?

175
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,760
You could uncut gyms it

176
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,080
and put this three-ski on the horsies, on the ponies,

177
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,760
let it ride, and say like, if they come to you,

178
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,560
like, hey, I do need those quarters back,

179
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,760
you can be like, listen, it's all,

180
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
it's not liquid right now.

181
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,000
It's tied up in the ponies, isn't it?

182
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,520
Tell him it's not liquid.

183
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,160
I gave this $3 to the singing guy

184
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,360
as a deposit for him to start learning

185
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,880
the hit song he wanted to sing,

186
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,440
Drops of Jupiter by Trey,

187
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,200
because he's one of those planet professors, you know?

188
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,040
Oh, yeah.

189
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,400
Planetology.

190
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,160
He gets up there day one, he's like,

191
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,320
my very energetic mother just served us nine pizzas.

192
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,520
That's the acronym, and I'll see you guys next year.

193
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,000
You know what's weird about that, Griffin?

194
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,440
It's not pizzas anymore.

195
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,800
We can't talk about fucking Pluto.

196
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,280
Nobody cares about it.

197
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,320
It's a planet. Clearly.

198
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,120
I like it, it's small.

199
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,960
It's a big rock in space, guys.

200
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,200
There's lots of them.

201
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Not enough.

202
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,120
Would you guys like a singing telegram?

203
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,960
Like, would you like one of that shit up at your place?

204
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,400
Not for me right now,

205
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,520
but like, if you got one in your day-to-day.

206
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,200
I would feel threatened if that happened.

207
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,500
If someone came up to me and said,

208
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,960
hey, I have to tell you something,

209
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,440
and started singing at me,

210
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,520
I don't know that the feeling I would feel

211
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,500
would be one of love or gratitude.

212
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,720
Like, this is the thing, right?

213
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,300
Can we all just be honest with ourselves

214
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,640
that this kind of thing,

215
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,180
or like delivering a big bouquet of balloons,

216
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,560
while part of it, yes, is sweet and thoughtful,

217
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,640
the other half is like, I want to embarrass you a little.

218
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,120
I want to fucking shame you.

219
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,960
Right?

220
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,060
Like that, I'm going to make a big spectacle,

221
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,800
because if you just stand there nodding,

222
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,720
like, yes, I deserve this, and I appreciate it.

223
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,900
Like, that's not how that's supposed to go.

224
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,480
You're supposed to kind of cover your face

225
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,720
and be embarrassed by this thing happening.

226
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,320
Why is that how we're choosing

227
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,880
to show our love to one another?

228
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,480
Yeah, for three dollars.

229
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Let's see what we can,

230
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,200
Huey, what can we do for three dollars?

231
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,680
It's that we can dump a bunch of paint on them.

232
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,720
Do you want that?

233
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,660
We can accidentally squidge some toothpaste on their pants

234
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,800
and make it look like they did have a naughty accident.

235
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,760
Do you like that?

236
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,900
This is embarrassing.

237
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,900
About, probably, oh boy, it's been about 16 years ago.

238
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,240
For the first Valentine's Day, we were together,

239
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,820
my now wife and I, then girlfriend, Sydney.

240
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,100
My now wife?

241
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,940
Nah.

242
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,220
No, you can't, I didn't even open the door to it.

243
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,300
That's actually a bat.

244
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,340
You have to turn around three times

245
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,220
and throw salt over your left shoulder or more,

246
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,920
and it'll kill you in your sleep.

247
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,920
For Valentine's Day, there was this group

248
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,540
that was doing these sorts of things,

249
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,300
but they called it a VLQ, or a very large quartet.

250
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,300
And basically, just a grip of the oldest fellas

251
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,420
you've ever seen in your entire life

252
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,920
show up at a place and sing a song, right?

253
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,540
And it was beautiful, it went perfectly.

254
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,420
Sydney was at rehearsal for a play,

255
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,860
and they showed up at rehearsal and just dazzled,

256
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,660
and it was very romantic, and it was really lovely.

257
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,920
About six months ago, I started thinking,

258
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,540
did I pay those guys?

259
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,700
It was not a money up, hold on, don't rush to judge it.

260
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,140
It was not a money up front kind of deal,

261
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:40,140
it was you do it and make a little deposit,

262
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,460
and then we'll do the singing

263
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,500
and you can make it right later.

264
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,860
That's a bad business model, old dudes, by the way.

265
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,380
Yeah, but they're so old and trusting.

266
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,640
So I did this, and I got to thinking about six months ago,

267
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,260
I never paid these fucking guys for this thing.

268
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,140
And then I started thinking, I gotta make this right.

269
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,340
I can get it liquid.

270
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,100
I can get it liquid, however much it costs,

271
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,380
and then I started thinking,

272
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,900
this was unpleasant to consider,

273
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,600
but most of those guys are probably,

274
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,680
but a lot of them are probably dead,

275
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,140
and that is when I started to feel really bad,

276
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,660
because at this point, I'd be paying money

277
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,420
to their sons, their singing sons.

278
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,500
Their estates, kicking in a few bucks here and there.

279
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,020
Or it might be a tontine situation,

280
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,580
where the very large quartet has just been saving

281
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,180
all the money that they make, and the last one kicking,

282
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,580
which will probably be the baron's son, let's be honest.

283
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,900
The only source of income the surviving members

284
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,580
of this group need to worry about

285
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,060
is Justin's unpaid deposit, plus the juice.

286
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,920
Oh yeah, the juice has been flowing.

287
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,700
My man, we're talking six figures, bud.

288
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,860
Their page is still active.

289
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,700
I mean, their website is still active,

290
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,140
but there's no online option.

291
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,420
So I would have to come, I would have to make a phone call

292
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,900
that's like, hello, this is Justin McElroy.

293
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,260
You probably know me from how they talked about me

294
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,940
at the meetings for a decade,

295
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,900
but how's the juice right now?

296
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,820
Do you want us to sit here on the phone,

297
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,460
on the call with you while you call them?

298
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,140
We'll be here for emotional support if you want.

299
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,380
Oh, that could be really good.

300
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,740
That would be a really special thing

301
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,740
for the Max Fun Drive episode.

302
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,780
Yeah, okay, hold on.

303
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,380
All right, but hold on.

304
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,540
This can't be our prank episode.

305
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,580
Travis, you and I have to button it the fuck up, dude.

306
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,420
Yep, yep, yep.

307
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,580
Can you guys talk about that for a second while I do this?

308
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,900
And let's have Justin do a very good phone call

309
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,340
while me and Travis really button it up.

310
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,180
Hello?

311
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,900
Hi, I had a question regarding the Thundertones.

312
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,940
Yes, what would you like to know?

313
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,960
Well, okay, I didn't think anybody would answer,

314
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,260
so I'm a little nervous, but in, I think it was-

315
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,820
No reason to be nervous.

316
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,780
Well, you haven't heard, okay.

317
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:10,780
So in 2005, you all did a singing telegram

318
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,820
for my, she was my girlfriend then,

319
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,420
and she's my wife now.

320
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,180
She was very touched by it,

321
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,740
and I realized about six months ago

322
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,300
that I never paid for it,

323
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,180
and I feel really, really bad about it,

324
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,060
and I have for quite some time,

325
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,400
and I know that there's juice on it.

326
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,460
I know the interest has been collecting for many years.

327
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,780
I'm sure you all have been talking about it a lot,

328
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,420
and I just wanted to make it right and get-

329
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,360
It's up to $3,000.

330
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,720
No, that's not true.

331
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,900
I was not in the group at that time,

332
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,900
and I don't even know what kind of record.

333
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,620
We don't have any records, I don't think,

334
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,140
that go that far, or if we do, they're so buried.

335
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,580
I will tell you this.

336
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,220
If you want to make that right, just so your conscience

337
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,180
will be soothed, you may send a check.

338
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,820
Let's see, 2005, do you remember how much it was for?

339
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,140
Because it's now $50.

340
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,220
I don't know what they were back then.

341
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,340
I mean, $50 sounds, that sounds more than fair.

342
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,540
There was a whole lot of people there.

343
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,740
I mean, there was a VLQ, they called it,

344
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,580
a very large quartet, which is a good joke.

345
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,400
Oh, okay.

346
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,900
And $50 sounds fair, but if you want it to be more,

347
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,980
I mean, I feel so terrible.

348
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,180
You really got me over a barrel on this one.

349
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,460
No, not at all.

350
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,940
I appreciate your honesty, and that is no problem at all.

351
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,940
Why don't you just send a $50 check to the Thundertones,

352
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,380
make it out to the Thundertones,

353
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,220
and just send it to my address.

354
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,500
I'm the president of the group.

355
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,060
My name is, but you don't need to know that.

356
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,620
Just make out the check to the Thundertones,

357
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,860
and then my address is as follows.

358
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,300
I will thank you so much.

359
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,900
I really appreciate you letting me get my conscience clear.

360
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,540
I feel like a new chapter has begun,

361
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,460
and I'm ready to move forward with a clean conscience.

362
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,620
I mean, for this, there's lots of other terrible things,

363
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,680
but for this one thing, I feel better about.

364
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,420
I was gonna say, now you can go back

365
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,340
and return all those books that you checked out

366
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,220
of the library that you never returned.

367
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,220
So, thank you very much for your patronage.

368
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,500
By the way, we just finished that up,

369
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,940
and we did 38 Valentines this year.

370
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,460
Had two quartets go out.

371
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,260
It was very successful.

372
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,460
Keep us in mind for next year,

373
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,460
and I'm sure that she wouldn't remind a reprieve

374
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,820
on something like that.

375
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,620
I love that you can trust me again.

376
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,780
History is not on my side.

377
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,660
I'm impressed that you're willing to forgive and forget.

378
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,140
Well, that is no problem at all.

379
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,580
I wasn't expecting it in the first place,

380
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,660
and like I said, we don't have a record of it,

381
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,500
so don't worry about that.

382
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,220
But hey, y'all must be rolling in it now, though.

383
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,580
38 times 50, I'm loving that math.

384
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,020
Well, I tell you what, it is our largest fundraiser.

385
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,580
Even we make more off this than we do

386
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,580
even our annual show that we do in the fall.

387
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,780
Is that one spookier, kind of a scary thing,

388
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,980
lots of like haunted jump scares and stuff like that?

389
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,900
We did, no, no, we did one of those.

390
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,020
We did a show that was kind of had that theme,

391
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,300
but no, it varies from year to year,

392
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,220
and recently we've been going with songs

393
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,140
that are songs that everybody's familiar with.

394
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,940
This last one was the British Invasion,

395
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,300
and we did a bunch from Beatles and Herman's Hermits

396
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,340
and stuff like that, so it's a lot of fun.

397
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,500
And if you sing, heck, come by and see us.

398
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,300
Okay, I'll give you just a sample

399
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,460
and let me know what you think.

400
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,140
Stay a while with me,

401
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,980
just stick around and see what happens,

402
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,380
what will be, will be,

403
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,780
and wills. We can work with that.

404
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,340
Yeah, we can work with that, that's excellent.

405
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,700
Hey, Rick, you've been so cool, thank you so much.

406
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,620
My brothers put me up to this.

407
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,700
I told them this story and they forced me to call

408
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,140
for our podcast, and you will,

409
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,580
that check will be rolling your way here in a couple days.

410
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,540
Tell me your name.

411
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,220
Justin McElroy.

412
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,500
Justin McElroy, well, thank you very much, Justin.

413
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,220
I'll look forward to that check and that amount.

414
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,940
And also, give me your contact information as well.

415
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,100
Yes, now this is for the lawsuit, isn't it?

416
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,940
Because I've had the juice running too long.

417
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,420
All right, thanks, Rick, take it easy.

418
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,980
Okay, you too, thank you, Justin, appreciate it.

419
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,820
Bye-bye.

420
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,900
No, no, no, no, you just got pranked, baby!

421
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,220
I can't believe they had forgotten about it.

422
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,900
No, Justin, they didn't.

423
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,540
I can't believe Rick acted like he had forgotten about it

424
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,300
so convincingly.

425
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,860
Yeah, and did you also hear how when you gave him your name

426
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,420
with a little bit of a smile,

427
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:13,220
as if he was then gonna be like, oh, damn, Justin McElroy?

428
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,500
And then there was no recognition at all,

429
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,940
and I got a shiver down my spine.

430
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,340
I didn't think he'd be like,

431
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,860
oh, shit, Justin McElroy from podcasts.

432
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,660
I literally thought he was looking for a list

433
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,100
of like shitheads.

434
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,100
I expected him to remember me from the shithead list.

435
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,940
Yeah, when he said Justin McElroy.

436
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,380
What, do you think he's a fucking

437
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,540
Things I Bought at Sheets fan?

438
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:39,540
I was expecting Rick to be a fan of my YouTube series.

439
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,260
Come on.

440
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,500
When you said Justin McElroy,

441
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,700
he just reached over to the notepad in his passenger seat

442
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,220
and marked off your name under people I need to kill.

443
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,060
Yeah.

444
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,780
There's also, he's from Huntington.

445
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,780
If I said my name, it was not that he would know me.

446
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,460
It was probably that thinking that he'd know my dad

447
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,580
and would say like, oh, this fucking figures.

448
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,100
Hey, you're gonna like bleep out his address and stuff,

449
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,860
right, so we don't box Rick.

450
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,700
I hope so, I hope so.

451
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,900
Ooh, I hope so.

452
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,780
But sometimes I don't pay very close attention

453
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,620
to these, don't I?

454
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,380
Hey, maybe this could become like a new segment

455
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,100
where Justin just clears his conscience

456
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,340
like one thing at a time.

457
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,460
Even out the closet, I like that.

458
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,080
Only bad thing I ever did, though.

459
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,020
That's the only one.

460
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,900
Okay.

461
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,860
Hey, I've got a Yahoo here.

462
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,020
Do you wanna hear it?

463
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,860
Sure.

464
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,680
Sent in by Jeanette.

465
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,520
Thanks, Jeanette.

466
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,360
It's Yahoo Answers user.

467
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,780
Oh, they're anonymous.

468
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,620
They're anonymous.

469
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,460
It was Rick.

470
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,060
It was Rick asks,

471
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:36,060
should the queen move to America to get a new experience?

472
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,120
Yes.

473
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,300
I know.

474
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,380
Thank you.

475
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:47,380
I know so very little about the monarchy or anything.

476
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,820
Really, government.

477
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,760
To speak of, worldly speaking.

478
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,920
So this may be coming from an uneducated place.

479
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,240
In fact, I can confirm it is,

480
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,580
but it seems like maybe if the queen came to America,

481
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,300
she could have a new experience.

482
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,180
Not just came here, not just came here to visit.

483
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,700
Got a flat, you know?

484
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,940
Took a Lyft, but we call them elevators.

485
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,780
Lyft.

486
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,220
Oh, well, I thought you were talking about rental car.

487
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,920
Oh, no, we call those cars.

488
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,860
Yeah, or buggies, lorries, whatever.

489
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,500
Maybe she started calling them different shit, right?

490
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,340
Yeah.

491
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,500
Yeah, what if she went back to Britain

492
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,140
and was just like, hey, from now on,

493
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,340
we're calling them elevators and apartments and shrimp.

494
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,460
Enough of this shit, right?

495
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,800
Sorry, I bumped my shopping cart into your shopping cart.

496
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,100
And that's what we now call them.

497
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,700
Look, there's a truck.

498
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,100
Bring me some cookies.

499
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,480
And if you don't know what I'm talking about,

500
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,460
I'm going to behead you.

501
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,660
Hey, can I ask you guys a for real serious question?

502
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,500
Uh-huh.

503
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,580
I'm sure that there's like, you know,

504
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,060
some courtesies extended to her

505
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,260
and like diplomatic immunity and stuff,

506
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,540
but if the queen were to come to the US of A

507
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,860
and I were to offend her,

508
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,300
she's got no power over me, right?

509
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,940
Like she couldn't get me in trouble.

510
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,780
No.

511
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,580
I mean, okay, she could get you in trouble, probably,

512
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,820
if she told an adult or a teacher.

513
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,660
Okay.

514
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,020
But not like in Britain where I didn't bow right

515
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,620
and now I'm going to go to prison or something.

516
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,700
Right, right.

517
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,500
You know, I made that joke about the queen

518
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,460
having someone beheaded

519
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,340
for not knowing what cookies are.

520
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,940
And maybe you start to think about something.

521
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,780
Okay.

522
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,340
Back like several hundred years ago,

523
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,020
the queen could definitely have someone beheaded

524
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,860
if she felt like it.

525
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,700
No doubt.

526
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,520
We agree on this, right?

527
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,360
Definitely.

528
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,900
Today, the queen would say like off with her head

529
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,700
and everybody would be like, I don't think so, right?

530
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,660
So my question is this, the last time that happened,

531
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,620
do you think there was a sense of like, been a good run,

532
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,940
but I think this is the last one.

533
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,900
I think we're wrapping up on being able to do,

534
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,320
this has been extremely satisfying and fun,

535
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,820
but I think we are wrapping,

536
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,460
like the last one must have felt pretty bad

537
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,080
for everybody to be like,

538
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,100
I don't think we do this anymore, actually.

539
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,860
I don't think it was a switch flip, Jamie.

540
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,300
I don't think it was like, oh, you know what?

541
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,140
I don't want to do it.

542
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,540
I think it was more of like a fade out

543
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,540
of just like over time,

544
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,820
people were getting less and less okay with it.

545
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,220
And then there was one where it was kind of a squeaker

546
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,100
where I was like, ooh, are we gonna?

547
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,940
Ooh, yikes.

548
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,780
Ooh, are we gonna do it?

549
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,340
And the person's in the guillotine and they're like,

550
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,500
this feels unnecessary to me.

551
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,700
You all agree, right?

552
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,500
We probably shouldn't.

553
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,340
We should do jail.

554
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,860
Hey, what do you guys think about jail?

555
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,300
We got them.

556
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,020
It's not perfect, but I think it might be better than this.

557
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,660
I think instead of a fade out, Travis,

558
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,940
I think it's possible that there was a sort of crescendo

559
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,620
where there was one day where they just beheaded

560
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,500
like so many people and they're like,

561
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,940
it's not even fun anymore.

562
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,300
Like, I can't, I don't even feel it.

563
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,500
It's like jazz, you know?

564
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,660
What's fun is the beheadings you don't do.

565
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,540
Right.

566
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,220
Because that's, think of the joy on someone's face

567
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,980
when you get them into the guillotine

568
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,380
and like they're blindfolded or something

569
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,980
and you go like, do it.

570
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,300
And like, you have the sound of like a lever going

571
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,140
and like a sound of a thunk over there.

572
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,380
But then you're like, hey, guess what?

573
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,540
You're not gonna get beheaded.

574
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,380
That's fun.

575
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,820
That person's never gonna do something wrong ever again.

576
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,340
It's basically the premise of Undercover Boss.

577
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,700
Yeah, it's exactly like Undercover Boss.

578
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,060
A friend and I often work together during class

579
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,500
and I wanna ask for his number

580
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,940
so if I have any questions, I can just text him.

581
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,060
However, I don't want him to get the wrong idea

582
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,120
and think that I'm getting his number

583
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,020
for any sort of romantic purpose or ulterior motive.

584
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,380
What is a completely normal way to ask for someone's number

585
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,600
without perpetuating the wrong idea?

586
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,860
That's from Gmail.

587
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,340
You cannot do this.

588
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,220
Don't even try.

589
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,420
Griffin is right.

590
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,980
You just can't do it.

591
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,060
It's not, it's not, this is very relatable

592
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,000
because I had this exact scenario

593
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,140
and it's just, it's not, it's just not possible,

594
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,460
I don't think, right?

595
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,940
We can all agree that anytime you've ever had to say

596
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,060
to another human being like, can I get your number?

597
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,580
It's so hard and it's so much, I would argue,

598
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,900
harder to say when it is not for romantic intent, right?

599
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,820
Because then you worry, you have to then explain yourself

600
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:28,460
and say like, in case you wanna play video games together,

601
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,620
I don't wanna smooch.

602
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,460
Do you know what's fucked up?

603
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,700
And this is, I genuinely cannot answer this.

604
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,800
If I asked for, you know, if I was in college or whatever

605
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,100
and needed to get in contact with somebody

606
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,820
that I was like working with on something,

607
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,820
I would feel zero pressure to ask for their email address.

608
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,320
But it's still like, it's still like talking, innit?

609
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,380
So like, why does that, why is phone just like

610
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,260
the sexy one, I guess?

611
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,100
Yeah, I don't know.

612
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,580
I think it's because of the connotation of like,

613
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,780
can I get your number?

614
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,440
Yeah, but I think there's more to that.

615
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,220
In this modern era, I think that it's because

616
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,060
it's so private, like I don't even know

617
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,380
your guys' phone numbers, you know?

618
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,380
Like, it's extremely private.

619
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,140
I definitely gave you my phone number.

620
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,220
My phone knows it, but I don't know.

621
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,860
Yeah, my phone knows it.

622
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,660
I don't know it, so it's private to you.

623
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,500
You know what I'm saying?

624
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,740
It's a private thing.

625
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,460
Yeah, but I'm gonna stick with my point

626
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,780
because I've never seen a movie where somebody

627
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,320
like looked at their friend across the table at a bar

628
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,320
and like cockily said like, she friended me on Facebook.

629
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,660
I mean, that's what You've Got Mail is about,

630
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,740
so what are you saying?

631
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:44,520
And the second thing, maybe it's just that the phone,

632
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,780
with the phone, it is intimate because you're saying,

633
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,260
give me the buttons to press on my phone

634
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,040
so that I may gently nestle your warm voice

635
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,520
close to my face.

636
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,540
There's really no way to talk to somebody on the phone

637
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,420
without confining the fact that you're doing whispers

638
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,740
into each other, like directly into each other's ear,

639
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,140
basically. Now that's fair.

640
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,980
That is fair.

641
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,420
Well, you also, I think there's an immediacy to this

642
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,860
of like, give me your phone number.

643
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,180
That's like saying like, hey, if I need help with school,

644
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,780
I want you to, the second that it crosses my mind,

645
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,700
I want you on fucking call.

646
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,740
I don't wanna send an email that you'll respond to

647
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,300
in a couple of hours.

648
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,740
I wanna know that you know I need you then.

649
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,200
Here, it's 2020, it's 2020.

650
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,400
Can I pitch an idea that you've just given me, Justin?

651
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,740
Every phone.

652
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,700
Wait, hold on, you didn't even let me think about it.

653
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,540
Okay.

654
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,140
Yeah.

655
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,780
Okay, every phone should have two numbers.

656
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,860
One that you can call and one that you can text,

657
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,900
and you should like only give out the one that can text

658
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,780
and reserve the one that can call for like,

659
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,580
if you are dying, you are allowed to use this number.

660
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,580
That's great.

661
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,940
That's great, Travis, because you set

662
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,420
Drops of Jupiter by train as your ringtone,

663
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,400
and then you're out at dinner with your friends,

664
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,620
and you hear, now she's back in the air.

665
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,320
And you gotta be like, oh shit,

666
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,260
something happened with my uncle.

667
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,660
Oh shit.

668
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,420
Oh no, my dad, I gotta go.

669
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,260
Yep.

670
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,160
As I understand it, though,

671
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,100
this is already how people are using phone.

672
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,260
No one calls on phone, right?

673
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,100
Yes, right.

674
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,460
This draws the line, though.

675
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,940
Instead of getting a friend's number to work on homework,

676
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,140
you got the number all at once.

677
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,220
What if you did it in stages,

678
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,420
where you're like, okay, I'm comfortable enough with you

679
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,420
to so far give you my area code?

680
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,260
Yeah.

681
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,300
We're doing it, right?

682
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,140
That's good.

683
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,740
That way it doesn't feel like a commitment yet.

684
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,120
The real answer to this is, you know,

685
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,780
you gotta reel in a third person into this,

686
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,840
and be like, hey, we should all exchange numbers.

687
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,460
That's great.

688
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,660
That's powerful.

689
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,580
Maybe just plan a big group hang

690
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,300
to all go see that new movie together.

691
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,580
We'll work on the paper at some point.

692
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,740
Hey, you guys like Outback Steakhouse?

693
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,580
Yeah, maybe we can work on it.

694
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,220
I was just walking by.

695
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,780
I'm not even in your class.

696
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,200
We should all exchange numbers,

697
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,420
the three of us, equally.

698
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,260
The same number.

699
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,080
Who are you?

700
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,920
Yeah.

701
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,900
Here is the best advice.

702
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,180
Okay, I've got this.

703
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,020
Okay.

704
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,380
You need to give them your phone number,

705
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,740
and give them a reason to reach out to you

706
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,380
that is not romantic, okay?

707
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,220
Picture this.

708
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,060
If you ever need a break.

709
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,580
This is like toilet paper.

710
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,980
You walk up to this person.

711
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,300
You'd be like, hey, listen, I'm not spreading this around,

712
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,380
but I got a fucking choice sourdough starter

713
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,780
that I would love to slice you off a bit of.

714
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,460
Here is my phone number.

715
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,320
Here is an empty jar.

716
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,140
Let your imagination run wild

717
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,380
of how a little sourdough starter would look in here.

718
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,780
The price, that's not between friends.

719
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,420
We're not gonna worry about that.

720
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,540
But you go ahead and give me a text to Rooski,

721
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,460
and this beautiful bread baby

722
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,100
could be headed to your house, a media mente.

723
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,020
And then the cool thing about that is

724
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,860
you get their number, and they owe you

725
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,860
for the sourdough that you hooked them up with that one time.

726
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,660
Okay, Justin, just to clarify,

727
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,580
just so I don't do this wrong when I attempt this,

728
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:19,140
do I need to actually have a sourdough starter to use this?

729
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,420
Travis, if you do not have a sourdough starter,

730
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,100
they will assume you are American Psycho 2 this week.

731
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:30,020
There is fucking no reality

732
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,260
in which you cannot also have a sourdough starter

733
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,460
on hand, ancient grains ready to rip,

734
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,460
ready to turn that beautiful sugar into carbon dioxide

735
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,460
and crank that bread up to its maximum fluffy potential.

736
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,740
Now here's the thing, I do have a sourdough starter.

737
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,300
I just don't know if I'm ready to give it away.

738
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,580
Like that just seems like such a big commitment.

739
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,740
I think this works on the platonic level, yes, Justin.

740
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,660
Can we tweak it a little bit for a different person

741
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,980
who wants it for a romantic level?

742
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,260
At the bar, hanging out, someone catches your eye.

743
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,380
Can you wander over there with an empty jar

744
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,380
and a promise of fermentation?

745
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,180
I think in that case, the sourdough starter

746
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,980
has to already be in the jar.

747
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,580
And you just say, I'm like, if you wanna know more,

748
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,580
give me a call.

749
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,980
My number is written on the sourdough starter.

750
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,100
They're not gonna buy the baker

751
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,100
when they got the starter for free, you know?

752
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,620
Maybe you have a nine out of 10

753
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,740
of the sourdough starter ingredients in there.

754
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,060
And you're like, the missing piece is me.

755
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,300
Give me a call and we'll start something together

756
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,100
and feel the power of sour and let the dough flow.

757
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,900
Not how sourdough starters work, but okay.

758
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,580
I don't know anything.

759
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,420
Yeah, that's kind of thematic.

760
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,740
Yeah.

761
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,540
Yeah, how about a Yahoo?

762
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,380
Yeah, I love that.

763
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,380
This one was sent in by level9000.

764
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,300
Yadru drew a drew to have important thank you drew.

765
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,460
It's from Yadru answers user.

766
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,780
They're anonymous.

767
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,300
So let's call them Jamothy asks,

768
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,460
why do Siberian tigers need to be so huge?

769
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,420
Their prey seems much smaller.

770
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,940
They need to fight Kodiak bears.

771
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,140
Huh.

772
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,620
So I don't know enough about, I think,

773
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:14,580
animals in general to answer why the Siberian tiger,

774
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,940
like what environmental sort of like challenges

775
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,780
they had to overcome by becoming just fucking jacked,

776
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,180
these Siberian tigers.

777
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,900
But I'm extremely here for the idea

778
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,460
that the Siberian tiger, big and powerful and beautiful

779
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,700
could challenge itself a little bit, like more.

780
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:45,060
Like it's going after small rodents and rabbits

781
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:50,060
and probably unlucky birds, unlucky slow birds.

782
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,500
Yeah.

783
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,460
Or just like sleepy birds.

784
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,140
Sleepy birds, unfortunate explorer, adventurer.

785
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,260
Whatever beef it finds on the ground just laying around.

786
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,340
Just random beef.

787
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,180
Ground beef.

788
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,020
Ground beef.

789
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,780
Yes.

790
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,820
But you know what,

791
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,780
and I think about this all the time with Gryven?

792
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,620
No.

793
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,960
The panda.

794
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,800
Well, okay.

795
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,300
Panda, well, hear me out.

796
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,140
Okay.

797
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,300
It's just eating bamboo.

798
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,500
It's not built to do that.

799
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,260
It should be eating meat.

800
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,560
That is a bear, huh?

801
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,100
That's why it's sleepy all the time

802
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,240
and does so very little

803
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,340
and doesn't really have the power

804
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,980
or the energy to make love

805
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,220
because it's so sleepy all the time.

806
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,340
And so at some point a panda must've been chasing

807
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,420
like a bird or a rabbit or something

808
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,700
and be like, this fucking sucks.

809
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,780
That plant is just sitting there.

810
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,420
I'm gonna eat that from now on.

811
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,540
There's so much of it everywhere.

812
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,340
What if that was food?

813
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,140
I'm just gonna sit here and do shit all

814
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,780
and eat this stick and not bone anymore.

815
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,620
That's the problem.

816
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,700
Pandas aren't boning.

817
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,960
So the numbers are going down.

818
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,660
If we could get one,

819
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,460
just fucking battle horny,

820
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,680
come back from defeating the huge Siberian tiger,

821
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,260
which there are billions of probably.

822
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,540
You know, an unlikely victory.

823
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,240
And it comes back home and they're like,

824
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,900
oh shit, Ron, what's up?

825
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,540
You look like heck.

826
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,820
And then Ron can be like, oh, I'm different now.

827
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,420
Who's ready for Ron?

828
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,900
And then they would fucking pork,

829
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,920
like they've never porked before.

830
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,220
And then like all of a sudden pandas are back

831
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,060
and they are-

832
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,880
There's too many.

833
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,860
They're like pigeons and squirrels.

834
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,660
Squirrels, pigeons for all the,

835
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,300
you can talk shit about pigeons,

836
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,380
but pigeons are out there, aren't they?

837
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,180
The pigeons are working out there

838
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,180
and they are up against forces that are so hysterically

839
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,580
beyond their control.

840
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,500
Like what ass can a pigeon kick?

841
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,820
Probably not any.

842
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,980
So they go and they like sit on the third rail of a subway

843
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,720
and they get like totally just bamboozled out there.

844
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,900
And then they fly home to their nest

845
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,980
and it's like, oh shit, rough day in the city.

846
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,860
And they're like, yeah, it was a rough day in the city.

847
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,260
I'm battle horny.

848
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,660
Now let's go.

849
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:10,780
Has anyone told pigeons that like 10 miles that way

850
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,620
is probably just a bunch of corn

851
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,220
that they don't like have to just be there

852
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,740
in the middle of New York city?

853
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,900
Do you think of a pigeon like heard someone mention

854
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,500
like they're just fields of corn?

855
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,220
They'd be like, what the fuck?

856
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,940
Travis's been like mistaking cigarette butts for food

857
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,780
for the last like 30 years.

858
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,420
For the last 30 generations.

859
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,180
Travis, farmers are listening to this right now,

860
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:34,300
like sweating, like please don't tell pigeons about farms.

861
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,140
Please no.

862
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,980
Please don't tell pigeons about my farm.

863
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,380
Hey, where did all the tomatoes go?

864
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,460
We had them last night.

865
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,460
Let's look outside.

866
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,980
Uh oh, it's two million pigeons.

867
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,940
They're all just here now looking for statues to sit on.

868
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,620
Do you think pigeons in the city

869
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,540
regularly get letters from their country cousins?

870
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,120
They're like, well, shit still sucks out here

871
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,760
in the country, fucking nothing to eat.

872
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,220
I wish I was living it up with you

873
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,540
eating one fourth of a hot dog butt out of a gutter.

874
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,060
God, that sounds good.

875
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,220
Anyway, yeah, it's all bullshit out here.

876
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,360
Yeah, anyway, I gotta go.

877
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,540
I gotta use the bathroom.

878
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,780
I mean, look for food.

879
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,160
Yeah.

880
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,980
That's all I get to do.

881
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,820
Man, I'm just gonna be thinking,

882
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,140
everybody's talking about unlikely animal pairings.

883
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,060
And when they say that traditionally, they mean friendships.

884
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,940
I'm thinking about it like top 10 anime battles.

885
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,780
Because Kodiak Bear versus Siberian Tiger,

886
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,140
boy, that would be one for the ages, wouldn't it?

887
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,580
That'd be pretty good.

888
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,400
The problem with Jamothy's question is like,

889
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,940
once you start going down the road of like,

890
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,820
why is that tiger so big?

891
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,260
You do that with pretty much every animal.

892
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,900
But like if that animal is smaller, it could eat less food.

893
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,780
Yeah, that's a good point.

894
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,180
Hey, why is the blue whale eating krill?

895
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,060
It should be eating like smaller whales.

896
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,060
Oh my God, we need a worthy challenger for the,

897
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,900
we all need to team up and breed something

898
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,980
for the blue whale to sharpen itself against.

899
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,620
It is time for the killer whale to live up to its name.

900
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,020
Yeah, you've got it, you don't have it in size, right?

901
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,620
But you got it in ferocity for sure.

902
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,220
You are an X-wing like going up

903
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,300
against a Star Destroyer at that point.

904
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,580
But this Star Destroyer, guess what?

905
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,700
It only eats like little weird barnacles.

906
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,700
You are totally good.

907
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,580
This is my pitch for Free Willy 6.

908
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,220
Where Willy just goes ham on a blue whale.

909
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,500
Right, and it's two hours long,

910
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,620
and it's really hard to watch that.

911
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,580
But then what's that?

912
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,700
The blue whale and Willy team up to fight a giant squid.

913
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,660
Animals are great, I love nature.

914
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,060
Yeah, and we know a lot about them.

915
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,380
I love nature too.

916
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,820
Yeah, we're very smart about them.

917
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,980
Da da da da da da da da.

918
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,820
Okay.

919
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,660
Da da da da da da da da.

920
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,500
Oh.

921
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,660
Dee dee loo loo loo loo loo loo loo loo loo loo loo.

922
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,180
I want a munchwad!

923
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,260
Slad.

924
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,180
Wub bub bub bub bub bub bub.

925
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,920
I want a munchwad!

926
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,260
Do do do do do do do do do.

927
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,660
I'm sorry I got a cold and I realized it sounded weird,

928
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,500
like Alfred E. Newman or something.

929
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,420
I kind of loved it.

930
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,540
I kind of enjoyed it too.

931
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,260
I got a munchwad mini,

932
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,780
and then a full munchwad for you.

933
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,140
I got combo.

934
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,500
Duncan adds snacking bacon to the menu.

935
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,460
What?

936
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,620
Please tell me they used apostrophes in there.

937
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,860
Oh yeah, they did.

938
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,180
Duncan, snacking, bacon.

939
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,020
Is bacon apostrophic?

940
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,740
What is this, two?

941
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,140
Nah, bacon's not.

942
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,460
That'd be wild though.

943
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,980
They missed a trick, huh?

944
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,860
Yeah, so Duncan adds snacking bacon to the menu.

945
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,340
This one's bacon in a little bag, my friends.

946
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,540
It's just bacon in a little stinky, greasy bag.

947
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,500
I'm glad it's not just loose bacon though.

948
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,820
That is better.

949
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,860
It is basically loose bacon, Travis.

950
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,860
It's as close to loose bacon as you can get

951
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,260
without being loose bacon.

952
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,660
Without going to prison.

953
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,500
Yeah.

954
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,560
Here's how it starts.

955
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,260
Sack the sad snacks with the new snacking bacon.

956
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,100
Oh God.

957
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,340
For anyone who's seeing a satisfying snack,

958
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,020
seeking a satisfying snack,

959
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,940
but this one seems designed to fuck me up.

960
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,780
I see you, Duncan.

961
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,300
We got him.

962
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,900
For anyone who's seeking a satisfying snack

963
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,220
but is stuck with a sad selection at their desk,

964
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,180
office, kitchen, or vending machine,

965
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,100
Duncan is adding some extra sizzle to its menu.

966
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:24,060
Hey friends, if there is a sadder snack than bacon

967
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,760
from a greasy little bag that you bought at the store

968
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,900
and carried to your office, I don't know what it is.

969
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,300
Duncan Wednesday unveiled new snacking bacon

970
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,840
and with sweet black pepper seasoning

971
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,140
to help on-the-go customers conquer nothing.

972
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,260
It's not help.

973
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,820
Help is the wildest word you could have picked.

974
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,680
You're not helping them to do anything.

975
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,120
They say they're helping their customers

976
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,600
conquer their cravings without settling for tired

977
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,460
and typical snacking choices.

978
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,580
Hey, Roger, what are you snacking on

979
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,260
out of that bag there?

980
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,780
Bacon.

981
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,220
Just some bacon in a bag, huh, Roger?

982
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,780
Are you okay?

983
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,620
Hey, Roger.

984
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:09,340
Yeah, the only thing that you have to imagine with this

985
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,060
is actually walking up to the counter

986
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,740
and they're like, what food do you want here at Duncan

987
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,600
that you've gone into willingly?

988
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,500
And the person says, I want a bag of snacking bacon

989
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,600
for the road.

990
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,440
I actually think saying, for here, would be worse.

991
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,620
That would actually, I'm gonna sit in the corner

992
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,460
and listen to a podcast.

993
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,460
Here's the full one.

994
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,420
Einstein Brothers is gonna launch

995
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,580
a bagel and burrito mashup.

996
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,420
Huh.

997
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,960
Is it just gonna jam it in the fucking hole?

998
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,940
Basically.

999
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,140
They announced, Einstein Brothers announces launching

1000
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,920
a first-of-its-kind bagel innovation, bagel-rito.

1001
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,160
Ah, a bagel and burrito mashup, the bagel-rito,

1002
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,360
was available at five test locations in the Denver area

1003
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,960
for a limited time on October 29th.

1004
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,200
And it's gonna shock you all, but it fucking cleaned up.

1005
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,440
It sold out within hours of its announcement to the world.

1006
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,200
Why did you announce it to the world?

1007
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,920
Let Denver get a fucking crack at that beautiful bastard.

1008
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,560
Do the wild success of the test launch

1009
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,880
and countless requests from guests

1010
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,320
who wish they could try the bagel-rito.

1011
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,080
Valerie, how many requests have we got about the bagel-rito?

1012
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,000
I can't count them.

1013
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,080
There's too many.

1014
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,960
They're pouring in.

1015
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,560
They're throwing them through the window.

1016
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,320
The bagel-matic is broken.

1017
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,040
It's like it just exploded everywhere.

1018
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,360
Can't count that high.

1019
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,760
It's like the end of Miracle on 34th Street in here.

1020
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,120
Why did we set up a complex system of pneumatic tubes

1021
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,520
from every Einstein Brothers location into our home base?

1022
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,480
So the Einstein Brothers bagels

1023
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,920
is making the game-changing breakfast item

1024
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,480
available to guests across the US at participating locations.

1025
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,240
And the tone of this announcement

1026
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,320
is that they think they're ready for bagel-ritos,

1027
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,480
but they're not fucking sure, okay?

1028
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,480
They're on the very edge.

1029
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,320
Quote, we heard our guests loud and clear,

1030
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,040
says Takeo O'Rourke, VP of Marketing

1031
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,680
for Einstein Brothers Bagels.

1032
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,360
They always have to clarify what company

1033
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,880
they're the VP of marketing of.

1034
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,160
It'd be wild if the VP of marketing at Ford

1035
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,880
is like, they got nasty new bagels.

1036
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,440
This place got nasty new bagels.

1037
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,120
Cars are still cool, but check out these nasty bagel tubes.

1038
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,640
Given the popularity of the bagel-rito

1039
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,280
during the Denver test,

1040
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,440
we knew we couldn't keep this breakfast innovation

1041
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,400
from the rest of the country for too long.

1042
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,520
We just needed a bit of time to ensure our bakeries

1043
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,320
are set up to meet the volume of orders we're expecting.

1044
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,320
On February 27th, we will be ready.

1045
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,520
Constantly pushing the boundaries of the classic bagel.

1046
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,600
Einstein Brothers bagel has taken it to the next level

1047
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,440
with the bagel-rito.

1048
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,720
Has taken it too far.

1049
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,400
Too far, they've crossed the Rubicon

1050
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,760
and made a shame before God.

1051
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,240
It's loaded with two cage-free eggs,

1052
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,240
for that animal-cruelty-conscious consumer

1053
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,920
that also wants to eat a bagel shaped like a fucking tube.

1054
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,040
And it's got thick-cut bacon from, I'm assuming,

1055
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,140
inhumanely raised pigs and turkey sausage.

1056
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,880
Let's get them all in there.

1057
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,220
The pigs watch the chickens run around.

1058
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,200
Come back here, Cal, you don't get out.

1059
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,760
We need three cheeses from you and potatoes.

1060
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,760
Your non-sentient state will not preserve you.

1061
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,440
There's hash browns in this bad boy

1062
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,320
and salsa and green chilies and a flour tortilla

1063
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,880
all hand-wrapped in an Asiago bagel dough and baked fresh.

1064
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,720
And what a relief that machines aren't involved

1065
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,960
in this process.

1066
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,520
I'm glad humans have to use some of their time

1067
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,600
here on this big blue globe to roll these bagel tubes for me.

1068
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,080
It's substantial size, high flavor, and portability

1069
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,920
has earned it.

1070
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,800
High flavor is a good term.

1071
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,040
I like high flavor.

1072
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,880
The high flavor and portability.

1073
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,720
Folks-

1074
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,560
Thank God.

1075
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,040
Bagels have been so cumbersome up till now.

1076
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,040
And burritos too.

1077
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,000
Yeah.

1078
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,700
Yeah, friends, I'm here to ask you,

1079
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,240
what is the last item that you bought at a fast food place

1080
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,120
where you're like, well, I can't take this anywhere.

1081
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:26,960
Look at this.

1082
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,160
Look at this heavy, I can't carry,

1083
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,300
what am I, to carry it to another location?

1084
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,360
The high flavor and portability has earned it its slogan,

1085
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,920
big, bold, and easy to hold.

1086
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,760
Oh, boy.

1087
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,880
Who are these people that have a regular bagel

1088
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,000
and they're like, whoop, drop the damn thing.

1089
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,480
Oh, fuck.

1090
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,300
Now it's rolling away.

1091
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,620
Again?

1092
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,460
Again?

1093
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,920
And hey, friends, I'm looking at this thing.

1094
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,120
It's a big, loose tube full of garbage.

1095
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,200
This is not a portable solution.

1096
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,960
Just as it's closed at the bottom,

1097
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,360
you're gonna have bagel juice slipping out.

1098
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,840
Anyway, that's the bagelrito.

1099
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,680
Looks pretty good.

1100
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,920
I would probably eat one

1101
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,640
and it's available at Einstein Brothers now.

1102
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,160
Next time I'm out to eat at a restaurant,

1103
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,360
I'm just gonna silently open up the salt shaker

1104
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,980
and dump it all over my meal.

1105
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,520
And then when Rachel asks like, hey, what are you doing?

1106
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,260
I can now confidently answer,

1107
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,340
I am turning the flavor too high.

1108
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,200
The flavor is not at high right now.

1109
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,200
I need maximum flavor.

1110
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,760
It's what I deserve as a consumer.

1111
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,100
I deserve no less.

1112
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,680
We rarely go out.

1113
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,880
It's hard to find a babysitter.

1114
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,240
What am I gonna eat?

1115
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,840
Regular flavor?

1116
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,520
I deserve high flavor.

1117
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,040
Well, we'll get out of your hair now.

1118
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,880
Once again, maximumfun.org.

1119
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,680
That sounds like we're backing out the door.

1120
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,360
We've been trying to sell you some brushes and combs.

1121
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,240
All right, well, you've been a gracious host.

1122
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,520
Maximumfun.org slash join.

1123
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,520
Thank you so much.

1124
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,760
And thank you to John Roderick in the long winters

1125
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,800
for the use of our theme song

1126
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,760
and to departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1127
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,680
And we're about to put this episode to bed

1128
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,080
because fish and friends go bad after three days,

1129
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,920
right guys?

1130
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,880
What is that?

1131
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,160
Are we fish?

1132
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,240
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo?

1133
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,080
We're friends.

1134
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,700
This one was sent in by Yohannes.

1135
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,680
Thank you, Yohannes.

1136
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,600
It's from Yahoo Answers user T.

1137
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,440
Who asks?

1138
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:32,440
Dude, I just recently discovered a new way to eat oats.

1139
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,360
My name is Justin McElroy.

1140
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,920
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1141
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,080
It's been my brother, my brother, me.

1142
00:45:39,080 --> 00:46:04,080
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.
