1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:31,200
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:40,960
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

6
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:55,760
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to Kayfabulous, your source for wrestling news.

7
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:04,000
What is the name of our radio station? Kayfabulous. I do not.

8
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,400
As you know, in pro wrestling, Kayfabe is the portrayal of events within the industry as real

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,600
or true. It represents a suspension of disbelief required to watch wrestling. So Kayfabulous is

10
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,160
the name of our wrestling show that we're doing. If you have to look at Urban Dictionary to decipher

11
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,240
a goof, then. Like I don't, but like if you're in the world, this is a show for true fans. I am,

12
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:38,480
ever since I am watching Wrestlemania tonight, I have been really into the world, the mythos,

13
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:46,960
if you will, of Wrestlemania, or as I like to call it, the big slam. And Kayfabulous is a new

14
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,960
direction for my brother, my brother and me in Advice Show for the Modern Era, that represents

15
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,600
that new direction, that bold new direction that I'm taking our show in. This is not an April fool.

16
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,480
So basically what you're saying is we've, we've picked a fake sport for fake sport people.

17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,520
What? Who's your favorite slam man right now? People who are working right now. I mean,

18
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,480
all time, obviously, uh, Brett, the Hitman Hart, uh, right now. Is he the one who fell and died?

19
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,000
No, no, no. That's his brother, his dear departed brother, Owen. Uh, right now I'm really into

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Fancy Dan, the turnbuckle man, who is sort of a, he's kind of a, um, he's kind of like that berries

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,400
and cream guy from the Starburst commercials, except his leg muscles are just palpating,

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,800
you know, he's like, he uses them to kick. I understand. Yeah. He'll kick anything that

23
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,400
they don't let baby snare him anymore. Cause he will just kick. He, it's like blind,

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,600
it's like blind instinct in there. It's like working with a Puma. Uh, I miss, uh, you know,

25
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:52,240
I miss, I miss, uh, I miss Jimmy Jean shorts. He was the rest. He was the rest. He was the slam man

26
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:59,120
who would, uh, he would wear like sweat pants into the ring and just get the ever loving shit

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,560
just beaten out of him or kicked out of him. Um, and then when in his hour of need,

28
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,240
he would rip his sweat pants off and there'd be some jorts on under it. And then he would,

29
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,560
he would find his strength inside of himself via using the, the gene shorts as some sort of focus.

30
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,880
I, uh, I do know who I miss who's that? Travis, the karate kid. Yeah. He was very good. He was

31
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,360
really weird. He had a weird thing about him. I do want to introduce ourselves, uh, before we get

32
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,800
too deep into fabulous. I am your oldest brother, Justin, the reconciler McElroy. And I'm your

33
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,960
middle is brother hacks all Travis McElroy. And I am your baby brother, uh, Griffin, Daisy Dukes,

34
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:54,400
McElroy. I was Jimmy Jean shorts. Uh, second. I was his, his foil. That's what they use. That's

35
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,000
what they call it. Sort of like Paul bearer was the foil of the undertaker. I am the one part of

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,480
this goof in this advice show for the modern era that we do every week. The one part of this, this

37
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,280
is not goof. I am indeed watching WrestleMania this evening and I have been attempting to

38
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,640
educate myself, to catch myself up on some of the various storylines and plot lines that will be

39
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:22,320
represented this evening. Um, I rec I, uh, I, I hear the rock is coming back to fight our friend,

40
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,520
our, our dear friend, John Cena. That will be the athletic contest. He is the, the reigning champion

41
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,360
from last year's WrestleMania, even though he was the fucking referee. Right. WrestleMania,

42
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,480
you are the craziest. You are so crazy. Speaking of crazy, what I was really shocked by is that

43
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:50,240
there are men in this athletic contest that were adult men wrestling when I was a baby, a baby boy.

44
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,840
And now I'm a grown man. I've grown into my body. You know, I have my own muscles and my own take

45
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:04,240
down moves, but these guys are still out there doing their thing. They're still out there. The

46
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,680
undertaker is literally 78 years old now, right? How hard must it be to retire from this sport and

47
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:17,360
do something else? Well, like what do you do after this? Well, you become an undertaker. I mean,

48
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,240
your business, your business, you will not be able to control how, how much work you get there,

49
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,640
but he, I mean, so he's four, the undertaker's 47 years old. He's basically, I saw him in last

50
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:36,720
year's WrestleMania. He looked 96. You could stack two dads on top of each other. And depending on

51
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,640
the dad, they still might not be as old as the undertaker. He's the oldest person basically in

52
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,000
the world. And he is out there tonight at the wrestling event that I'm going to be a very big

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,040
fan of. He is out there tonight, just dealing out, you know, the classic Texas red style justice that

54
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,760
he's known for. He's, he's going to be dishing it out and then driving his kids to school.

55
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,840
Yeah, I don't want him to, I don't want him to, I don't want him to hear me because he could

56
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,480
probably just obliterate me. He could just erase me from existence with one slam, but I watched him

57
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,640
last year and his, his, his skin looked so brittle wrapped around his muscles. It looked like at

58
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,400
any time, like if he gets slammed the wrong way, that his skin would just like pop and his insides

59
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,640
would just, he would just spill out. I would just spill out onto the canvas. That would be,

60
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,440
I mean, that's the ultimate power move. If you're talking about intimidation,

61
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,280
if you, if your opponent goes into a match knowing that with the wrong slam,

62
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,400
You could burst. They could split you wide open like a balloon full of spaghettios.

63
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,880
That's a horrifying image to try to put on somebody.

64
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,440
That's why Jimmy Jean Schwartz isn't allowed to play anymore.

65
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,840
Oh yeah?

66
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,200
He burst, he burst open Rey Mysterio. That's why he has to wear that mask.

67
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,800
Poor Rey Mysterio. He's, he is inspired by luchadors.

68
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,920
CM Punk saw the event, got so scared he went straight edge.

69
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,240
These are all wrestling goofs. How do I know all this shit?

70
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
I don't know. How do you know this shit?

71
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,880
It's terrifying. You have these deep pools of knowledge within yourself. Like the only thing,

72
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,480
I know some assorted, like I knew I was going to bust out one of the,

73
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,520
I know one of the undertaker's moves is the, I'm so sorry for your loss. That's one.

74
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,920
That's a smelling salts.

75
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,400
He's known for the, he's known for his pile driver and I know that and I don't know how I know that.

76
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,840
It's called the, the tombstone, isn't it?

77
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,280
Tomb, tomb, tomb raider. It's called the tomb raider.

78
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,840
That's right.

79
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,200
It's the name of that, it's the name of that move.

80
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,600
So, so this has been K Fabulous, our podcast within a podcast about wrestling.

81
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,480
We sure hope you enjoyed it, but now I think we should try our hands at some advice.

82
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,000
I have quite a large friend group and we all get along,

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,880
but there's one girl who's part of them who lately has just been so annoying.

84
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,880
We try to be nice and try to be patient, but sometimes she could be too annoying.

85
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,000
Is there any way I can get her to leave us or at least me alone without being rude or

86
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,480
hurting her feelings? That's from annoyed in Kansas city.

87
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,240
What I mean, I understand this is like a huge problem in pretty much every friend group.

88
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,040
You have that one friend that every time he or she comes around, they just ruin your pizza.

89
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,520
Right.

90
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,520
Ruin the special blend of friendship toppings that you've made.

91
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,240
No, it's the freshness. They just, they, they lose the freshness of the pizza.

92
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,440
Mm hmm.

93
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,880
And you want to, uh, these are, these are annoyed goofs.

94
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,160
Okay. Oh, wow.

95
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,280
Wow.

96
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,600
Wow.

97
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,200
My friend is annoyed and like that.

98
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,680
Are you, are you kidding me?

99
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,400
Welcome to the Smothers Brothers comedy hour with Griffin McElroy, Rowan and Martin shit show.

100
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,040
Guys, the annoyed, the annoyed is back.

101
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,160
Is he back?

102
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,040
Better than ever.

103
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,520
Uh, and more relevant than ever.

104
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,600
Apparently you could tell what great momentum he has cause Griffin has to explain the goof to us.

105
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,200
You can tell what a great, great debt he's making in them.

106
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,000
Who hears about the compromising of pizza freshness and doesn't instantly think of the

107
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,480
annoyed. The two are synonymous.

108
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,560
I mean, basically you were right. Um, I, the problem with this,

109
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,960
here's the problem with getting rid of the annoying friend.

110
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,040
You got an annoying friend in your group, happens the best of us.

111
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,880
If you get rid of that annoying friend, someone else becomes the most annoying

112
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,200
friend in your group and friendo that might be you.

113
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,080
Yeah.

114
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,840
You need to take, you need, before you extricate this person,

115
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,880
you need to make sure that you are not going to be the new sort of object of ire, you know?

116
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,680
Is it sort of like the, like a reverse Highlander?

117
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,960
Uh, yes, yes.

118
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,880
There has to be one.

119
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,880
There has to be one. Um, sometimes there's two, but it has to be at least one.

120
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,720
And you need to make sure that you're not sort of next in the line of succession.

121
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,920
Look around you, make sure there's someone more annoying than you, but less annoying than her.

122
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,440
You're golden.

123
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,960
Then you're set to move on.

124
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,400
You guys are turning this into a punishment when in reality it could be a teacher toonity.

125
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,040
Oh, I think you could show this person the error of their ways.

126
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,360
And I think you could do it in a classy way.

127
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,080
Like a night, like a Christmas carol kind of way?

128
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,200
Yeah.

129
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,400
Well, I don't know.

130
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,760
There will be three ghosts.

131
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,400
No, there doesn't.

132
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,520
No.

133
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,320
Would there be ghosts?

134
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,640
No.

135
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,720
The lesson won't be, it won't be spectral in nature.

136
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,880
This sounds like a one ghost problem to me.

137
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

138
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,560
Maybe one and a half.

139
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,280
So what you can do, it'd be like, hey, um, you, just to let you know,

140
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,960
like when you talk during movies, like it, it, it's irksome.

141
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,480
Um, this is a teacher toonity.

142
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,520
I'm helping you.

143
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,880
You got to make sure to say like, I am helping you and make sure that they know that you're

144
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,400
not just like slapping them on the wrist.

145
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,640
That they, you know, though, Griff, I think that that only works if the person already

146
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,800
kind of has an inkling that they might be annoying.

147
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,480
Oh, they know.

148
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:02,960
They know.

149
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,320
How do they not?

150
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,160
Their own parents don't like to hang around them.

151
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,440
You need to, you need to tell this person, listen, you are in real dire straits here.

152
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:13,760
Yeah.

153
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,840
You're in peril of being extricated.

154
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,960
I'm going to reshape you like in the legend of bagger Vance.

155
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,920
I'm going to train you in how to be a better person.

156
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,280
This is me helping you.

157
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,920
You are, you constantly talk down any plans that we may come up with.

158
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,160
And it's just kind of, it kind of brings down the group when you do that.

159
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,080
So if you be more of a yes, man, instead of a no, sir, then, uh, then I'm helping you.

160
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,600
This is a teacher toonity.

161
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,560
Get off my pizza.

162
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,600
And as long as you have a clipboard, that's totally cool.

163
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,400
Everything's great.

164
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,320
You can either start being a yes, man, or a, Hey, where are you guys, man?

165
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,840
That's why isn't anyone answering the phone, man.

166
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,080
Yeah.

167
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,040
You don't want to be that man.

168
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,160
So, uh, I think if you're, it depends on how much energy.

169
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,800
Sometimes you don't have the energy for that, especially as you get older.

170
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,560
Um, you just, you just kind of stop calling people.

171
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,040
Yeah.

172
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,720
That's pretty much it.

173
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,880
Uh, you, you just sort of let them ease on ease on down the road.

174
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,240
Well, that's another, oh, that's another great lesson to take away from this

175
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,080
Justin, if this person is like, if you're in school and have a bunch of classes

176
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,000
with this person and they are, no matter what you do going to be in the same

177
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,600
place as you on many occasions into the future, don't pull the trigger on this.

178
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:25,840
Yep.

179
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,640
Because they're still going to be there awkwardly over in the corner.

180
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,240
Yeah.

181
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,560
Right.

182
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,680
So if you can escape them, don't pull the trigger on this.

183
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
Don't pull the trigger.

184
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,280
You know what?

185
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,720
You should pull the trigger on though.

186
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,640
If are you a maximum fun fan or would you say you're a fanatic?

187
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,080
Do you listen to my brother, my brother, me and judge John Hodgeman and Jade and

188
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,920
Jordan, Jesse go and stop podcasting yourself and international waters and the

189
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,720
new hit throwing shade.

190
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,440
Do you listen to all those?

191
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,520
You think, God, I love this.

192
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:05,120
I'm really enjoying this, but how can I return the generosity, the audio

193
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,240
generosity of a show me, you have that opportunity right now.

194
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,880
It's a, we're in the second half entering the back stretch of the maximum fun drive.

195
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:21,680
You have one week left to get in on this and show your support for your maximum fun family.

196
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,960
I get, can I say family?

197
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,440
Is that?

198
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,360
Yeah, I think family is fair.

199
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,800
I think of every single one of our listeners as a, I don't know, a first cousin.

200
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,840
Yeah.

201
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,880
Here's the, the, let me give you guys the, the, the short, the short version of the pitch.

202
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,680
You go to maximum fun.org forward slash donors.

203
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,320
Slash donate.

204
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,000
There are several donation levels starting at $5 a month, all the way up to $200

205
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,520
per month.

206
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,520
If you want to be one of Jordan's platinum angels, I want to tell you what happens.

207
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:55,040
If you give us, if you can find it in your heart to part with $20 a month, you can say,

208
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,000
Hey, I need, I love these shows.

209
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,200
I love the brothers.

210
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,080
I love Jordan, Jessica, go less than them.

211
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,480
I want to give you $20 a month.

212
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,200
You're going to join.

213
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,960
Why does it why less?

214
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,960
They love them less than us.

215
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,920
They love us more.

216
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,880
That's key.

217
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,320
We're going to come back to that in a second.

218
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,120
Okay.

219
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,560
So you want to give $20 a month.

220
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,640
You're going to join the diamond friendship circle.

221
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:23,680
You'll receive a shiny new stainless steel water bottle in a handy on the go size.

222
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,160
It's going to be screen printed with the cool maximum fun rocket ship logo.

223
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,440
You're also going to get a beautiful max fun friendship bracelet that is going to look

224
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,800
so fresh and will guarantee you the biggest of hugs when you meet us in person, which

225
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,400
you secretly know you will someday.

226
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,320
You don't want to be not wearing the bracelet because we'll know

227
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,280
last year.

228
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,640
It was a last year.

229
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,160
It was the maximum fund membership cards and no kidding.

230
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,240
Anytime we went to an event, we would see people who bust those out and give them just

231
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,640
the dankest headiest hugs that they have ever received.

232
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,520
Marley hugs.

233
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,560
You don't want to miss out on that treatment.

234
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:00,800
Yeah.

235
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,920
You don't want to miss out on that.

236
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,240
And you're also going to get and this I think is the greatest gift of all, but you were

237
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,120
going to get a ton of digital content.

238
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,400
You're going to get a bonus.

239
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,080
My brother, my brother, me episode starring our dad with us.

240
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,680
You're going to get a 15 minute video of us performing in Austin for Austin live show.

241
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:31,040
You're also going to get a rift video that's us watching an old timey educational film

242
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,120
about alcohol and goofing on it.

243
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,040
And that's just from us.

244
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,440
Everybody's got a bunch of bonus episodes and videos like that.

245
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,200
So you're going to get access to a ton of that stuff.

246
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,320
And you get that at every level, every five dollars a month.

247
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,840
You can get all that stuff and it will just mean the world to us.

248
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,760
Now, here's the important thing right now.

249
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,360
My brother, my brother, me is getting I don't want to turn it into a competition, but it

250
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,280
is we're getting beat by Jordan.

251
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,720
Just go, you choose your favorite show when you pledge and more people are choosing them

252
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,120
than us.

253
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,120
We're tied with bullseye and that's on the radio.

254
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,440
So they don't need they don't need you like we need you.

255
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,280
They're getting them radio dollars.

256
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,920
Yeah, they're getting radio money.

257
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,280
We need your real money.

258
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,680
We need you to rise up and say, my favorite show is my brother, my brother and me.

259
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,680
And I love all the shows, but I love them best.

260
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,480
Think of it this way.

261
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,000
It's both your opportunity to contribute to maximum fun as a whole and also your opportunity

262
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,880
to really let everyone know that we're way better than them.

263
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,200
Yeah.

264
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,760
You really got to help us stick it to the man.

265
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,120
And by the man, we mean everybody.

266
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,200
It's not us because we're paranoid.

267
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,880
But anyway, maximum fun dot org slash donate.

268
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,840
Go there right now.

269
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,200
Rise up.

270
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,880
My bim bambinos crushed the J.

271
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,040
J.

272
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:54,320
Go army underneath your hand like so many shoddily construct constructed action figures.

273
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,680
And then after you do that, go on Twitter and tell everyone that you voted for us above

274
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,240
everyone else.

275
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,440
Sorry, fools.

276
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,640
Sorry, haters.

277
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,760
And make sure to use the hashtag max fun drive so they know that in the NBA rules.

278
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,080
Why would they know that from that?

279
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,600
I guess you got to use both the NBA hashtag and the max fun drive.

280
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,800
And there are no there are no characters left for tweeting.

281
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,960
And a picture of yourself flipping the double bird.

282
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,280
This is for Jordan and Jesse.

283
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,200
I got one for each of you in your ear.

284
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,560
So do that.

285
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,240
That seems like pretty extreme.

286
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:37,680
But if they're putting their middle fingers like corn holders, here's the tweet.

287
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,120
You're talking about your donation.

288
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,320
You've got max fun drive and B&B and hashtags in there.

289
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,360
You've got a link to maximum fun dot org slash donate.

290
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,400
And you've got to bet you're at one hundred and ninety characters right now.

291
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,600
You've also got a picture of yourself flipping the double bird.

292
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,280
One for Jordan and one for Jesse.

293
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,160
And a gif of someone with a sour face is going mmm.

294
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,680
No, we don't have room for that tweet.

295
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,240
You link that on twit pic, you're at around 300 characters.

296
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Just send that to us and we'll retweet it because I really want to see at least one

297
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,560
person do that.

298
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,080
Come on, Griffin.

299
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,480
You know what I mean.

300
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,320
Here's a Yahoo answer for us to consider.

301
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,200
It was sent in by Atiana Kuriyama.

302
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,920
Thank you, Atiana.

303
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kyle, who asks, I'm a country boy and I want to tattoo.

304
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,960
I think it's supposed to be tattoo, but when it's only got the one L.

305
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,000
I want Audrey tattoo.

306
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,440
A tattoo is when you get a tattoo because you've plateaued in your life.

307
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:35,680
Sure.

308
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,400
I've tattooed.

309
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,160
It's not a tattoo on your toe.

310
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,720
Travis is going to go for the fucking metagoof.

311
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,520
I want something that says, hey, I'm a country boy and proud of it.

312
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,880
Don't know which words to use though, something short and sweet, a one-liner or even better,

313
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,680
a few words.

314
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,280
Thanks for the help.

315
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:04,000
He spelled four F-E-R to really drive the point home that he is he is rural.

316
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,920
Basically anything that Hank Williams Jr.

317
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:20,800
has ever said, ever escaped his lips, or escaped his mustache more trickily, would be a great

318
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,600
option here.

319
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,880
I suppose anything from the Blue Collar Comedy Tour.

320
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,640
Any of their jokes.

321
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,960
Get her done.

322
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,720
No, I think it's get them done.

323
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,160
Just do it.

324
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,200
Get them done.

325
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,560
Just do it, get them done already.

326
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,280
Maybe like trucking and fucking.

327
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,360
No, no way.

328
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,040
No way.

329
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:57,840
Maybe something patriotic like the dig them frog standing in front of an American flag,

330
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,240
but also on top of a French flag while crushing a French Tweety Bird.

331
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,920
Dip one from a peephole.

332
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:10,640
Dip one like he's doing chaw, but he's doing it in honor of his people.

333
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,960
What says I'm a country?

334
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,520
What is the message you want to get out there?

335
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,360
I'm a country boy and I'm proud of it.

336
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:28,560
Maybe that, I mean, that seems very sort of to the structurally from a grammar perspective.

337
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,600
Yeah, done like in a nice like calligraphy kind of style.

338
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:32,880
Yeah.

339
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,560
What about just in calligraphy?

340
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,960
Just the word agriculture on your body.

341
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,400
Would that be good?

342
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,200
I feel like that says a lot about like I my farmer.

343
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,800
My parents were farmers or ranchers, but they were involved with the production of

344
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,360
well produce that you get and eat at your grocery store.

345
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,200
Maybe it's like a picture of a farm, but they're growing pickup trucks.

346
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,640
Is that an image we can capture in tattoo?

347
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,000
And an American eagle is harvesting them.

348
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,200
I love this.

349
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,440
Is the eagle driving like a caterpillar?

350
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,800
Like a caterpillar, I'm sorry, a caterpillar like truck.

351
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,520
Oh, yes.

352
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,840
Yes, he is doing it by himself.

353
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,840
And there are a bunch of migrants watching from afar and like,

354
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,600
migrants are watching the eagle driving the caterpillar truck,

355
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,160
harvesting smaller ears of trucks.

356
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,720
The eagle has a tattoo that says trucking and fucking.

357
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,400
Right, and the eagle saying something like, sorry, Paco, I've got it under control.

358
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,560
Or something like sort of racist, but it's not like in your face.

359
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,040
You wouldn't be ashamed to take it off with the Olympic pool, you know?

360
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,960
That's 110% racist.

361
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,360
Is it because he said Paco?

362
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,880
Yeah, that was a contributing factor, Travis.

363
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,760
Can you get Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes and he's maybe like peeing on a city skyline?

364
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,240
I was going to say I'm a city skyline.

365
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,840
Why not a city skyline?

366
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,520
Because it's like, fuck the city.

367
00:21:59,520 --> 00:21:59,760
Yeah.

368
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,040
Oh, right, okay.

369
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,040
He doesn't care for urban environments.

370
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,920
You get the American eagle eating a city mouse.

371
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,880
That might be a little hard to convey.

372
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,400
Or a giant American eagle eating a city.

373
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,600
What about a giant American eagle eating an American eagle retail store?

374
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,120
Because it says, oh, hey, I know, I know.

375
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,640
Why are the eagles so big?

376
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,280
Why can't it be just like a tasteful eagle eating a tasteful yet smaller American eagle store?

377
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,800
When you say giant, do you mean like in scale or like on his back?

378
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:39,680
I'm imagining a large ambulatory a la foghorn leghorn,

379
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,840
like walking around like super beefy eagle man hybrid.

380
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,920
Oops, I'm turned on.

381
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,400
Oh, no.

382
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,520
Oh, no.

383
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,280
Not a kill.

384
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,560
Get through what episode?

385
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,320
Do you guys know the tattoo that Tony Danza has?

386
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,040
What is it?

387
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:02,320
It is a picture on his bicep of a man walking and around the man it says keep on trucking.

388
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,520
I recall this from like, I think I saw it 15 years ago and God, I hope that's correct.

389
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,400
But I'm fairly sure that is a tattoo that Tony Danza sports.

390
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,800
He is two words away from trucking and fucking.

391
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,320
With the slightest amount of modification, we could get him on the rural train.

392
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,520
Or I guess the rural pack mule.

393
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,080
What is it?

394
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,120
What's the train out there?

395
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,280
I guess it's just a train.

396
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,640
Who rides a train anymore?

397
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:30,880
Right.

398
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,920
Old timey farmers that don't know shit about planes and things.

399
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,560
They get scared.

400
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,840
They think it's a white dragon.

401
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,360
They don't think that farmers, I'm sorry.

402
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,480
No, this is a good.

403
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,840
This is let's explore this vein because you could just get an Amish person

404
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,720
because the Amish are like the ultimate country boys.

405
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,480
Oh, the oldest school.

406
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,680
Old school.

407
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:54,960
Oh, what?

408
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,440
You're listening to Hank Williams on the radio?

409
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,760
We don't know who that is or what that is.

410
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,920
We don't have zippers.

411
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,440
So maybe we're more street than you think.

412
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,520
When the black swan comes and revolution sleeps across this globe and technology shuts down

413
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,760
around us, the Amish are going to be the only ones that are out there just like living.

414
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,080
That are making it.

415
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,640
It just just real quick.

416
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:20,880
Okay.

417
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,920
What is the black swan?

418
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,680
And why is it the harbinger of the apocalypse?

419
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,000
I thought you meant that movie.

420
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,120
Yeah, I thought that too.

421
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,840
No, when when that movie comes to Amish villages.

422
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,640
Well, I mean, if that was the only movie they'd ever seen, it would kind of jack them up.

423
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:37,760
Sure.

424
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,040
That would be I mean, that would be that would be pretty messed up.

425
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:47,200
But a black swan is a is a disproportionate role.

426
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,480
I'm reading from Wikipedia now is a disproportionate role of high impact, hard to predict and rare

427
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,120
events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance

428
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,000
and technology.

429
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,760
So it's basically like it's the big one when the black swan comes up.

430
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,680
In this scenario, Jesus second coming at the same time as Quetzalcoatl's first coming and

431
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,040
they show up at the same time and they're like, oh, it's awkward.

432
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,320
I can come back in a thousand years.

433
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,600
You wreak havoc and then I'll come back and just sort of be the and they'll both want

434
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,400
to be the hero.

435
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,240
You know, no one wants to everyone.

436
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,440
No one wants to be the opener.

437
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,080
You know, everybody wants to close close out the stadium.

438
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,680
So there.

439
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,720
Oh, my God.

440
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,640
Jesus riding Quetzalcoatl.

441
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,920
Oh, we're all done.

442
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,480
Well, had a good had a good ride.

443
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,520
Humanity.

444
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,680
I never get that tattoo.

445
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,040
Jesus riding Quetzalcoatl would be a good tattoo.

446
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,520
I would.

447
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,320
That really makes people know that your country and proud.

448
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,240
And then under it, under that picture, agriculture.

449
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,960
Hey, guys, what's the non rudest way to walk away from a conversation in the office that

450
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,040
you know you can't contribute to anymore?

451
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,520
Like, say you're talking to someone and then someone else walks in and the conversation

452
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,080
became all about mammals from that point on.

453
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,480
Would you interrupt the dialogue to say I'm leaving now or would you just walk away silently?

454
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,080
It's not like I don't like mammals.

455
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,800
I just don't like talking about them sometimes.

456
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,400
And that's from Mammals and Marmalade, who is a strange obsession they have.

457
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,000
But I think you work at a zoo.

458
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,720
We can help.

459
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,560
Maybe I would I prefer to talk about reptiles today.

460
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,560
No more mammals for me.

461
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,520
I don't have anything to add.

462
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,680
Reptiles are just scaly mammals, basically.

463
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,800
Yeah, pretty much.

464
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,120
I think the non rudest way is the most mysterious way.

465
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,600
And that is to just wordlessly don't make a big deal out of it.

466
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,040
Just turn and walk away, like mid sentence.

467
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,160
But that's like super rude.

468
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:50,800
But first, you got to get really big eyes and gasp a little bit.

469
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,600
Like you saw a ghost?

470
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,400
Yeah, just something where everybody now they're done talking about mammals because they're

471
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,640
going to wonder what that weird shit you just did was.

472
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,120
But you can do that like once ever.

473
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,960
Yeah, it's not like a renewable resource of extricating yourself.

474
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,200
And once once you do it once ever, they're going to come up to you immediately and be

475
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,760
like, hey, hey, man, what's what the fuck?

476
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,040
That was really weird.

477
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,920
That was super weird.

478
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,640
That thing you did.

479
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,200
You look like you saw a black swan.

480
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,960
Can we go more mysterious?

481
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,120
Can you carry with you a pouch of smoke bombs?

482
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,600
That's a throw one down.

483
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,680
What's that in your other hand?

484
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,760
Oh, it's a patch of it's a pouch of caltrops.

485
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,200
You drop those in the smoke.

486
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,240
They'll never find you.

487
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,080
They'll try to, but they'll step on the caltrops and they'll never talk to you again.

488
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,360
You'll probably get fired.

489
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,400
This is not a good this is not not good advice.

490
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,840
Smoke bomb, caltrops.

491
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,880
Where did he go?

492
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
He grappling hooked away because he's Tenshu.

493
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,080
Don't worry about it.

494
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,200
You also need a grappling hook.

495
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,400
You need that.

496
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,160
Basically a lot of ninja gear.

497
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,200
Do you know about katanas?

498
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,360
Maybe just hang around.

499
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,720
Like you don't have to you don't have to.

500
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,920
This is see, okay.

501
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,040
Okay, I'm I'm on this.

502
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,360
Here's the biggest misconception that people have about conversations.

503
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,280
No one enters a conversation to listen to things.

504
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:15,520
Nope.

505
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:21,680
Everybody enters a conversation to to talk about things and force people to listen.

506
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,800
The listening part is the is you paying the piper for all the talking you're going to do later.

507
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:33,920
Mm-hmm, so if you are if you are in a conversation and you don't have anything to add you are like

508
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,880
you're sitting pretty because you can just pile up debt of listening.

509
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,280
Like you can really be a great listener because you're in that very rare position

510
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,480
of not having anything to say and no one wants you to talk.

511
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,320
No one ever wants anyone else to talk.

512
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,840
All anyone ever wants is to talk and have everyone hang on their words.

513
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,040
So you're not holding up your end of the social bargain here.

514
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,480
This is so just stand there.

515
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,760
So you're saying you wait you wait it out like a storm and then you say are we done with mammals?

516
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,520
And they say yeah, you say good because it's time to talk about Doctor Who.

517
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,480
Strap in.

518
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,600
It's strap in.

519
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,120
It's Doctor Who time.

520
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,400
I'll take it a step further and I'll look at it like that.

521
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,520
But then when they leave a window open leave a door open like they mentioned a doctor and

522
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,800
then you jump right in there and you that is Travis.

523
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,120
That is the Travis McElroy method and you pretend like you just invented that as a goof

524
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,600
for this podcast.

525
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,640
No, I'm not at all.

526
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,960
You wedge yourself right in the conversation and say did you mention doctors?

527
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,840
Like no, I didn't.

528
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,640
Like well now that we have let's talk about Doctor Who.

529
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,360
Okay.

530
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,320
Yeah, that's my move.

531
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,920
That's not like a good move though.

532
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,400
We've been trying to get you to stop pulling that move forever.

533
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,720
You say that but I mean I know you're wondering for a while now and I know you're wondering

534
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,680
about this.

535
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,800
This bleeding headband.

536
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:56,960
I was in a horrible accident and I just got back from the doctor and oh hey.

537
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,200
Hey.

538
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,160
I loved it.

539
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,640
I loved it.

540
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,680
Did you hear about the new companion?

541
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,320
It's crazy.

542
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,480
What were you saying?

543
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,200
Oh, you're dead.

544
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,000
Fuck.

545
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:07,760
Sorry.

546
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,280
I forgot I was driving to the hospital.

547
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,800
His next words were gonna be I need you to shoot this needle into my heart.

548
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,160
And you know you and the worst part is not that they died but because you've always wanted

549
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,720
to try that.

550
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,480
You've always wanted to try to jam a needle into somebody's heart full of what do they

551
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:22,880
put in there?

552
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,680
Adrenaline?

553
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,880
Mountain Dew.

554
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,800
Mountain Dew?

555
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,200
Search.

556
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,520
Josta.

557
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,080
Josta.

558
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,040
Ah fuck.

559
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,440
Damn it.

560
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,440
Just sit there and listen.

561
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:33,680
Yeah.

562
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,040
What's the worst that could happen?

563
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,120
What a nice situation to be in and not be expected to contribute anything.

564
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,760
Just sit there and listen.

565
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,120
And if there's enough people in the circle like if we're talking like one on one or

566
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,480
like three people you gotta stand there forever like until it naturally breaks up.

567
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,200
But if you're like in a group of like eight, nine people no one cares if you're there or

568
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,360
not.

569
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,640
If you're in a big circle full of people and they're all talking remember that God gave

570
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,720
you two ears and one mouth for a reason.

571
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:11,120
But he also gave you two legs and two arms which is four so maybe jump in the middle

572
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,640
of the circle and just dance.

573
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,360
Pray dance.

574
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,120
Just dance away.

575
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,160
Just bust a move.

576
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,600
Just bust a move.

577
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,640
Just start dancing because you that is gonna that will be a new topic of conversation.

578
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,600
Especially if you start slowly at first and just like build up to it.

579
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,840
Do you mean like you ease into the move?

580
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,800
What?

581
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
What are you saying about mammals?

582
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,240
Yeah my favorite mammal is a blue whale.

583
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,720
Here we go.

584
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,280
And you gotta make these mouth noises too.

585
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:41,520
Yeah.

586
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,120
That's cute.

587
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,200
Man I sure hope blue whales are mammal.

588
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,000
Oh boy howdy do I ever.

589
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,560
We are gonna get emails about that if incorrect.

590
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,680
Okay and that's also great because then you'll be fired.

591
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,920
Well I don't think you'll be fired.

592
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,600
I think you'll be promoted.

593
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,040
Yeah.

594
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,280
Chief dancer.

595
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,080
Which is the opposite.

596
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,240
I recently turned 23 and my parents pulled the Prius promise on me.

597
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,200
Two days before my birthday they asked what I wanted as a present.

598
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,040
I told them I wanted a high quality camera which is something I was planning to buy for

599
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,520
myself.

600
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,000
On the day of my birthday they told me they were still looking into what camera to get

601
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,560
and didn't have anything for me and it's been a few weeks and I'm not and now I'm not sure

602
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,000
how they're going to get it for me at all.

603
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,080
In which case I would just buy the camera myself.

604
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,640
But I don't want to do that if they've already ordered it online or something.

605
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,320
How do I broach the subject without putting them on the spot?

606
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,960
Or how long should I wait before I can safely assume they won't be getting me the camera?

607
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,120
Now it's from Camera Shine California.

608
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,620
Oof.

609
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,120
I have been in this position almost exactly and it is the worst because basically what

610
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,400
you're saying is hey when are you going to give me that present?

611
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,460
Yeah.

612
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,480
Here's here's the here's one of the big mistakes you made and this is a tricky this is a tricky

613
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,920
thing but if you care about something especially if it's a big purchase you should never let

614
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,400
anyone make it for you like exactly it never especially with that fucking camera there's

615
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:18,560
so many variables so many does it take pictures does it not what yeah high quality video low

616
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:24,880
quality video instant facebook posting nude pics for sexting sexting does it have something

617
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,800
sexed is it sexed enabled there's so many choices you gotta just hand them a pic this

618
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:37,040
isn't like this isn't like kid stuff at christmas where you could get the big toy book get a

619
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,520
red marker and just circle 50 things and say like i can't wait for santa to get here this

620
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:47,120
isn't like that can you get on can you kick start can you kick start a camera are you

621
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,680
asking are you telling this person to ask their dad to kick start for the camera no

622
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,440
you're i mean your dad can kick start in if he wants but you have to kick start the kick

623
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:03,040
starter the program you have to start your dad yeah hey yeah kick start my dad don't

624
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:16,160
you know uh griffin yeah is it time yet yeah sure this yahoo answer was sent in by lisa

625
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:23,360
holofield thank you lisa it's by yahoo answers user buddhist prime who asks is it illegal

626
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:30,160
to take pictures of adults sleeping on college grounds after class when they are tired as

627
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:37,760
long as i am not profiting from it okay wait people may not like it people who are awake

628
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,920
watching me take pictures of others may have a hissy fit about it but there's nothing illegal

629
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,400
about it right and if they get confrontational with me or put their hands on me i can report

630
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,520
them to the police and they can go to jail right because people who do that have serious

631
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,820
issues and need to be identified before they can become a later risk potential ultimately

632
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:00,200
i want to petition the dean for sleep capsules to be installed so that students including

633
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,600
myself can rejuvenate our tired minds and do better in school and i would use the sleeping

634
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:11,200
students pictures as evidence for this whoa several issues hold on hold on oh my god this

635
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,200
rabbit hole goes so deep but first off let's just get this out of the way by students they

636
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:22,120
mean girls and by girls they mean attractive girls and by the dean they mean their penis

637
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:27,800
and by sleep capsules they may actually be talking about sleep castles that may actually

638
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,720
be on the level that that's weird enough to actually be be accurate and just just so i

639
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:39,480
know in what way would you profit from taking pictures of sleeping people what what is like

640
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:45,640
a coffee table book there's a market for all that traffic you can sell pictures of anything

641
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:53,120
look at yesterday i looked for pictures of a bull in a china shop but also all the but

642
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,640
a candy shop instead because it was to illustrate a very important post i was reading my writing

643
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,760
from my live journal and i had to go to a one of the stock photo places and search for

644
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:08,160
like bull in a candy shop and i got a lot of results that i did not enjoy seeing but

645
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:15,020
i but but i had to do it people buy pictures of anything weird anything sleeping people

646
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:20,400
dead people don't kill the people that are sleeping don't kill no don't kill things

647
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,520
that are illegal this thing that you've described maybe maybe killing it definitely killing

648
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:32,800
people definitely 100 um so don't do that part i don't know if you take a if you take

649
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,880
a here's the thing if you take a picture of me and i'm asleep and all you do is show it

650
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,200
to the dean i won't know about it look at griffin look at how pitiful he looks i can't

651
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,840
do anything about it i'm so tired i got a little sunburn yesterday i can barely move

652
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:55,140
i can't chase you down i think that this is probably one of those things that may not

653
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:00,800
be outright illegal but if i catch you doing it i will find a way to make it illegal like

654
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,320
i will claim it in a way that will make it sound really you'll take them to nickelodeon

655
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:10,680
kids court and yeah you'll sue them on like judge judy or something there's no legal

656
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,480
precedent for this but sir i mean it's pretty pretty skeezy i guess if i see a picture

657
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,040
of you taking a picture of an asleep person i will find an adult and they will take they

658
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,640

666
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,920

667
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,560
said oh i'm sleepy i'm gonna lay down on the ground and i just wish there was a capsule

668
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,000
here that i could sleep in and you know what i find funny as you've been describing this

669
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,760
justin if this person were doing it as an art project there'd be nothing weird about

670
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,000
this right it's the sleep capsule thing what the fuck is a sleep capsule i think you're

671
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,360
a tanning bed i picture a tanning he shouldn't be he shouldn't be penalized for having a

672
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,800
functional project creepy as though it may be because i don't know if you guys know this

673
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,200
sleepiness in college it's an epidemic it's taking over the world that's why we have like

674
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,040
five hour energy drinks and sleeping do you know what's in those sleep you know do you

675
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,920
know how much vitamin b is in a five hour energy drink what the percentage is if you're

676
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,960
doing enough to get me going 8333 percent that's a little bit too much b just a touch

677
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,440
too much b in those can i ask you guys a serious question about five hour energy drink that

678
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,880
i've had forever yeah are you sterile because of all the five hour energy drinks you drink

679
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,200
no i know why i'm sterile on the commercial it's what's your reason it's because i make

680
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:25,120
god mad um on the commercial for five hour energy it says if you're not sure how it'll

681
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:31,720
affect you to drink half at first does that give you 50 energy for five hours or two and

682
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:37,500
a half hours of 100 energy it's not see you think that it stacks like that but i had a

683
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:46,200
friend who uh wanted to uh stay up for an entire day so uh he he drank five of them

684
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,240
like in a row just like bam bam bam bam bam and then he uh jumped up and he kicked the

685
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:59,520
sun and he burned it he burned to death and the sun's obviously in the sun's heat he died

686
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,960
that was the weirdest episode of jersey sure if you guys have never seen that one tracking

687
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:10,120
down uh what a twist hey here's my problem with the sleep capsules okay how do you explain

688
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:17,720
to a local homeless that you have a bed but this one is closer to the chick filet on campus

689
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,720
yeah so you're gonna sleep there if that's cool and by the way sir if you could please

690
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:29,960
not sleep in it even though right you're homeless yeah how do you how do you have that conversation

691
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:35,080
with them not that you should talk to them but how if they were to approach you right

692
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:40,200
flailing wildly and shouting about whatever it is they do you know how they would be i'm

693
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,800
not interacting with them myself i live in a i live in a small town but um how i imagine

694
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,440
they are how would you have that conversation with them that you had that this is second

695
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:57,840
bed and they can't they can't get near it it's more like charge a nickel yeah most um

696
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:04,040
you charge a nickel into the bed into the bed i so you're saying that that if i was

697
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:10,720
a homeless person for for the princely sum of five cents a night i could have i could

698
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,120
have a home is that i don't know how the homeless economy works justin a lot of misconceptions

699
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,320
here uh you don't get a whole night's worth of sleep for five cents in the sleep capsule

700
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:26,120
you get 20 you get a 20 minute energon nap and then the sound of sirens uh wakes you

701
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:31,240
up and then you can you can put another nickel in but it's it just adds to your time what

702
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:38,320
do you guys think the perfect nap length is what's 20 minutes see i i usually need 25

703
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:44,240
minutes for that five minutes of get in get in that head space i need to get in the head

704
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,840
space and i'm going to take a nap maybe the sleep capsule has some sort of tech in it

705
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:54,360
that just like maybe like a hammer just like bang just like hits you right in the center

706
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,400
like in both temples at once and you die for just like 20 minutes but then you come back

707
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,720
out of it because there's a needle a needle that comes out and shoots mountain dew into

708
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:08,300
your heart oh and there's an adjacent flatliners booth so you you can pay a nickel and flatliners

709
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:13,580
with somebody as they take a death nap in the an adjacent capsule is that yeah basically

710
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:20,160
the way i understand it right sure yep okay with a homeless man standing guard why do

711
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:27,200
we not pay the homeless to guard our sleep slash flatliners capsules and that way they

712
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,440
wouldn't have they wouldn't get a it'd be a good steady work and we're creating jobs

713
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:38,120
you're welcome obama welcome obama and all we have to do to get this plan to revitalize

826
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,820
you have to do is like as a pilot the they planes basically fly themselves we've heard

827
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:27,080
we've all heard it said the one thing you have to do as a pilot your one sort of responsibility

828
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:34,680
is to not leave the cockpit and start talking about 9-11 that's like the one thing you don't

829
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:40,940
have to do if you could not do that one thing your job is you are like 75 of the way there

830
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:45,680
after that it's just looking good and banging stewardesses but you know though this this

831
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,340
pilot though might have been going out of his way for customer service what do i mean

832
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:56,200
you ask i'll explain please do because right now this is crazy i fly on an airplane what

833
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:02,240
i want every time i have the experience and i know i know but what i want is an experience

834
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:08,680
in which upon landing the plane the entire uh the entire flight just erupts into applause

835
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:14,400
okay okay like we're just so happy to have landed okay like we did it we've done it and

836
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:21,160
nothing says i'm so glad to have landed like a crazy sky scared pilot what you're saying

837
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:27,600
you are giving me the tyler durden tomorrow when you wake up after this flight your cereal

838
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,120
tastes better than it ever has before is that what you're telling me i've gotten halfway

839
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:37,180
there i've flown on a flight at christmas where we sang christmas carols in midair

840
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:42,040
during turbulence that's fucking beautiful are you kidding me yeah but we didn't applaud

841
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:47,440
when we landed i tried and nobody joined in with me hey travis if i want to appreciate

842
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:54,360
the life christy's given me i'll read a mitch album book okay for the duration of the flight

843
00:54:54,360 --> 00:55:00,160
if the pilot could just not leave the cockpit and talk about 9-11 and i'll be back here

844
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:05,880
reading tuesday's with mori sir if i became on the intercom and which is like hello ladies

845
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:11,520
and gentlemen i just want to take a second to talk to you about uh 9-11 is it it it was

846
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,280
if you watch the videos if you watch the videos can you do the voice like travis yeah i'm

847
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,520
talking in my hands uh if you watch the videos on youtube they explain a lot new world order

848
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:26,040
illuminati there were missiles on the plane oh oops if i see the pilot on a flight that

849
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:32,640
i'm on i'm like well that's it i'm dead i'm dead i will look out the window fully expecting

850
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:37,400
us to be fucking flying into the hungry mouth of a volcano because that's where i think

851
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:43,720
we are there's nothing you want to say less than a than the pilot i can oh the pilot's

852
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:49,320
just walking in the bathroom to take a shit i don't care i saw him leave his charge if

853
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:54,640
i'm if i'm at terminal b and i see a pilot at the chile's express i'm going to defecate

854
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:59,780
my pants i don't want to see any pilots ever they have one plate they should be surgically

855
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:03,580
attached to the cockpit that's where they belong don't get out of there it's a one day

856
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:11,280
you can't do do you know who do you know if there was another pilot like on the plane

857
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,680
that went into the cockpit and helped them land it yeah that's gonna give you a false

858
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,560
sense of security right that you just always assume there's another one there's a backup

859
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:24,480
pilot sure if your first if your first one breaks down absolutely dope is that guy though

860
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:30,000
don't worry i got this i've got this you know what in the footage that i saw it definitely

861
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,960
looked like he was wearing a uniform are they like spider-man like they have to keep it

862
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:39,720
on well you know the pilot's life is a horrible horrible life to lead because imagine when

863
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:43,520
justin you and i both work at home so like punching out not a big deal like we can just

864
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:48,680
go in the kitchen and now we're eating a sandwich travis you have to drive home uh when you

865
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:53,160
punch the clock uh pilot he could punch the clock and be like ah fuck what like where

866
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:59,000
i'm in tokyo god damn it i gotta go get on a plane and get home to i just assumed they

867
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,680
were nomadic and just sat down wherever the plane landed you think home is whatever port

868
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:09,120
yeah exactly that's merchants but that's i don't think that's how it i don't think that's

869
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:14,600
i'm almost certain they are they are citizens of no land right they have no allegiance to

870
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:18,600
that's why if you're gonna go to war the first ones you should court are the pilots because

871
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:24,600
they have no allegiance to any swath of land they say they say no no territory but the

872
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:29,960
sky no race but the blue and that's their sort of credo that's their motto that's their

873
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:35,160
house words basically that was the nerdiest that was the single nerdiest paragraph you've

874
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:40,400
ever i didn't come up with it griffin blame the pilots maybe the fact that maybe they

875
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,200
don't have enough stress they obviously don't have anything to worry about maybe you should

876
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,280
pile your complaints on with them things are obviously good luck finding them because they're

877
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,760
always on the move you can't track them down you can't crush them you have to work from

878
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:57,280
the inside and they have diplomatic immunity is that true that's true pilots can do anything

879
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,800
it's not considered a crime pilot cannot be charged for anything there's actually only

880
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:06,520
one there's only really only one like uh i would say like no no if you're a pilot can

881
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:12,960
you guess what it is did you did you guess leaving the cockpit and talking about 9 11

882
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,440
because that is exactly it that's the one thing you can't do that will get you that

883
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:23,680
will get you uh excommunicated from the church of flying that's a really bad thing to do

884
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:28,760
and then you got to start paying taxes again one one thing just one last actionable thing

885
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:34,360
for realsies this is 100 like i don't like flying really either but the one thing that

886
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:40,480
i do that helps me lock down my sky scaredness my sky fear is uh just look at the stewardess

887
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:45,320
and look at how bored she looks or look at the steward that was my thing i think i told

888
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:50,160
you that and i think you took that to heart look at the flight look at the flight attendant

889
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:55,360
and just look at how bored they look and just think like this is even when it gets rough

890
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,320
even when it gets choppy if they are flying into the mouth of a volcano a flight attendant

891
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:04,880
will just you know just keep on keep on reading hunger games not a big deal not a big deal

892
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,240
they'll keep reading their people magazine and they won't even trust the pilot trust

893
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,480
the plane unless that but i bet you that's the worst fear in the world because they think

894
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,840
everything's cool and locked down 100 of the time and that's why they look bored and the

895
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:21,640
pilot snaps and it's like 9 11 i bet you the fear that they feel it's like when superman

896
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:29,400
feels pain for the first time i bet you they just they just shit to death in seconds they

897
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:35,340
yeah it's it's uh it's got to be a spooky one because you've got to tell yourself that

898
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:39,640
nothing ever happens on plane yeah you've got to that's what you got to promise that's

899
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:43,760
what you have to keep telling yourself how about a yahoo answer yeah that sounds good

900
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:50,440
this yahoo was sent in by joanna heinz thank you joanna it's by yahoo answers user stupidass

901
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:59,600
who asks what's his username though uh it's carl weathers fan 2011 okay uh carl weathers

902
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:08,360
fan 2011 asks penis stuck in a cd tray i thought it would be funny but then i got sucked in

903
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:15,080
i am in incredible pain i can't get it put what do i do butter doesn't work this is actually

904
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:19,400
horrifyingly uh close to some of the emails we get from first-time listeners i'll tell

905
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:24,560
you what you don't do press the close button yeah well it sounds like he has already committed

906
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:31,040
that particular foible right so wait he put okay so he put his penis in the cd tray sure

907
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:37,640
and closed it i think it may have it may have been an auto close situation you know if you

908
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,040
leave the cd tray out for too long they don't want you to slip and step on it and then break

909
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:46,920
your computer so then i assume he just immediately killed himself yeah what kind of what kind

910
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:51,120
of first off let me just get this out of the way hit me if this is some kind of viral thing

911
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:55,820
for there's something about mary too there's something else about mary i'm gonna be something

912
01:00:55,820 --> 01:01:02,760
more about mary than we have yet to discover dumb and dumber dumb and dumber um that then

913
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:09,320
i will be very put out secondly who is using cd players who is out there putting you deserve

914
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:13,440
it you know what maybe this is amish they're they're not used to dealing with zippers so

915
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:19,880
they don't have a sort of a perennial fear about their um dong zones well this this could

916
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:26,520
also be a like a cd or dvd drive on like a computer but like even then like who doesn't

01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:41,040
what kind of goof is this yeah what how did this happen i did it to be funny maybe it's

920
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:48,360
okay in what context maybe it's like a lo-fi high-tech bris right was somebody else using

921
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:53,400
the computer you stuck up behind them and put your penis in the disk drive oops got

922
01:01:53,400 --> 01:02:00,960
you oh no don't close it there's a few things i would say there's a few things in the world

923
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:07,700
maybe a small handful that you shouldn't put your penis in uh like crocodiles a crocodile's

for some of us that's not okay actually a pump is okay no because i can really get to

929
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:46,460

930
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:54,520
each of which say butter doesn't work i would say griffin that if you search penis blank

931
01:02:54,520 --> 01:03:00,120
oops like anything in the middle there the number one response is going to be butter

932

me something like this is okay so i have in in the hundred episodes of doing the show

934
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:16,040
what i've learned is to not judge anybody for the stuff that they are into correct agreed

935
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:23,320
so if this dude had put like i wanted to bone my computer yeah so i put my penis in it yeah

936
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:29,640
i'd be like you know what i i i don't i don't necessarily subscribe to that but go for it

937
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,880
there's so many sharp edges though but to do it as a goof there's also better ports

938
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:41,800
that you could choose but to do it what's that travis what what's that travis what port

939
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:47,960
do you have usb 4.0 and this time we shaped it like a vagina for goofs he puts it in it

941
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,760
weird thing that you can hook up to a usb port that is a vagina a usb vagina you're

to deal with your sky fear though this is just let's just let your dick just get well

get your dick stuck in a computer forever like that gives you a really great like point
