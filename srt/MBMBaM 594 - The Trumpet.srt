1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,320
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,060
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,780
Hello and welcome

9
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,700
My brother my brother and me and advice show for the modern era. I am your oldest brother

10
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,620
Justin McElroy, and I am Archduke Travis McElroy Lord of the Manor

11
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,060
What's that that's fancy man, that's fancy man God. Oh, you know what we need

12
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:40,460
I can fancy take flight. We need to hire a Herald for the year to announce for us

13
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,060
Yes, I've advocated for this a long time on this show

14
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,420
Yeah, get yourself a personal Herald and I think that this is the time for it

15
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,080
In old-timey art and stuff when they did show like a Herald or town crier

16
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:01,540
Yeah, I always thought that my man had a horn, but I do believe it was some sort of proto Vuvuzela

17
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,260
Like some you know what? I mean?

18
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,420
Come and whip it over his head and be like check out the Prince

19
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,060
or something or well

20
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,140
No, if the Prince is already there than the town Herald suck shit at his job

21
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,880
You got to let you got to give me fair warning so I can get my kids dressed up and in their finery

22
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,540
And get him outside to greet the Prince and all that stuff

23
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,080
but I'm just saying if he came out in the middle of town was like

24
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:34,420
That good Vuvuzela sound I would stop what I was doing chopping chopping lumber. Yeah

25
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,420
I mean potatoes

26
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,540
Right, and yeah exactly can I say such a fucking good like

27
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,580
17th century agrarian

28
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,540
Like I mean you have the Constitution for it

29
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,220
You got the build you have the sinew the sinew the muscle the musculature

30
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:00,420
If I would be so bold of the iron stomach that can eat basically uncooked meat. It would be so dope

31
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:08,020
I think I'd be really good at collecting barleys to give to the kid to give to the king and the

32
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,680
Satisfaction I would get out of that Mike's family wouldn't have any of the barley dick

33
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,200
But I would know like I bet the Kings eating good today. Yeah, I would love that actually probably not make it through the week

34
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:24,120
Griffin if you're ever if you ever see a portal yeah, and you step through and you look around you don't see any cars

35
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,740
Yeah, you should just start funeral planning them. Yeah

36
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,260
I mean

37
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,660
Come back through the portal if you can come back to the world we can but if not like start your funeral plan

38
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,700
They don't have a modium back then yeah, and like that would be my number one concern

39
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,020
They don't have like white noise machines

40
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,700
They're obviously I would love it if Griffin was the one who got sucked through the portal and hello from the magic tavern

41
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,980
the portal behind the Burger King

42
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,460
Because it would literally just be like an afternoon of him like tripping over a log falling to a sharp rock

43
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,460
And dying

44
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,980
There's a chance that like the denizens of this world would see him and be like look at that pasty skin in his noodly arms

45
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,980
He must be royalty. Yeah

46
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,780
That young that young waifers never worked a day in his life

47
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,340
be smirched by consumption I

48
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,180
Have a 21st century immune system. They have nothing that could take me down. That's the first thing second

49
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,860
Even if I did get sort of

50
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,020
diarrhea so bad that it sort of became my

51
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,540
Sort of defining characteristic if I knew that I would as long as I'm getting that barley to my great king

52
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,740
yeah, and I knew that like he was

53
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:42,780
Stuffed to the gills with this good stuff, and I think I could I think I would be okay with it now

54
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,780
Here's what I will say Griffin if you were able to survive

55
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,780
The everything I could see you being the wise barley farmer

56
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,940
That delivers the barley in such a way that the king is like I'm gonna elevate you like you you not only deliver the body

57
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,340
He wouldn't he'd be like that barley is my fucking life. Yeah, I live for this

58
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,220
But the other I would elevate you but then I'm worried that that would affect the barley supply chain

59
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,340
And so like I want you to know yes that in my heart

60
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,980
I've elevated you but also if you don't deliver this fucking barley on a regular schedule

61
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:21,140
I'll have your literal heads Baren Harkin and left Griffin with the worst barley collecting equipment just to sabotage him

62
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,860
It was but then Griffin was able to do it. He tied two donkeys together, and they got all the barley

63
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,460
I'm just saying when all the other serfs begin their uprising

64
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,520
Yeah, like why does the king keep taking literally a hundred percent of our barley?

65
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,340
Come on Griffin. Let's fucking ride. I would be like

66
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:45,660
Uh, y'all go y'all go on ahead. I will I will definitely catch up on this uprising

67
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,180
Catch me on the next uprising for sure. I just got to place a quick phone call to

68
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,140
My leash this is this is a good point Griffin because it's just occurred to me that like in that way

69
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,140
I actually think you might survive better

70
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:05,540
Yeah, I think if I went back to the portal and the other serfs are like the king keeps taking all of our barley

71
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:11,260
I bet yeah, there's barley any left for us. They would just murder me. I think they'd be like hey

72
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,060
We're real sick of whatever this thing is that you're doing where some words sound like other words

73
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,260
So we're gonna just go ahead and kill you and there's no

74
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:26,140
Forensics or cops or an amazing bifurcation of the timeline is the first person to do a pun

75
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:31,060
Yeah, everyone's like kill him kill the way. Yeah. Yeah, enjoy him

76
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,300
And then there's only the devil could figure out that some words sound like other words

77
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,000
It's fine though

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,360
Cuz if at any point if other denizens of the fiefdom ever did get p.o'd at me

79
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,440
I just pull out my cell phone and be like y'all should not actually

80
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:50,460
Check out my fucking light rectangle idiots now step back. Let me harvest my barley and give it to my dad

81
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,380
I mean the king oops I do that. Oh, that's so oh man. It's embarrassing me

82
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
So this is an advice show

83
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,900
Well, you're gonna take your questions that you asked us and we're gonna turn them alchemy like into wisdom. I

84
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,980
Have a slight fever and I'm but I'm not this isn't a question

85
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:14,820
I know sometimes covered free Justin slips into a question and it's hard to tell like is that Justin is that question?

86
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,420
This is Justin. That's your internal

87
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:24,540
Joke combustion engine. I don't want people to be like everyone's looking for us to slip even for a second

88
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,060
But yeah, I mean they all come in for the crown. Everyone's come for the crowd. They're waiting for us

89
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:35,060
Not me to have Griffin Griffin. I think who's got the crown on now is great

90
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,460
And I will I will definitely send them all of my all my crop this year. I

91
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,800
Work it. Oh, sorry. I'm this of the first question. Give me that first question Justin

92
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:53,340
How can I be more like Captain Jack Sparrow? That's from Maritime, Massachusetts

93
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,340
Waiting for an answer

94
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:03,700
Can I ask why you'd why this is something? Yeah. Well, it's so rare that a question comes along that I'm like, oh

95
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,540
That's not what we're asking at your internal machinations. We've given up on a long time ago

96
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,700
Oh great. Well Griffin and I are asking I think I don't want to put words in your mouth there Griff

97
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,340
But why would you want to be more like Captain Jack Sparrow?

98
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:20,260
well, that's you're not putting words in my mouth you're taking the words from my mouth because those are the words that escape my mouth just

99
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,620
Just Captain Jack Sparrow is a lovable rogue. Okay

100
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,780
well and and one of the greatest pirates that one guy's ever seen and

101
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,580
He's super clever. He gets out of scrapes

102
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,800
He is a real out-of-the-box out-of-the-box problem-solver

103
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,420
And you know, he has his own ship. He makes his own rules. Yeah

104
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,380
He seems more or less like a pretty cool dude to me you guys

105
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,940
Let me just for just for folks who maybe haven't seen these films. I'll

106
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,940
I'll summarize them real quick. Yeah, there's Captain Jack Sparrow. There's his dad Barbosa. Who's also a

107
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,580
Yeah, there's Barbacoa. There's squid face monster captain and then there's like

108
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,100
Stuck up naval general guy sure and they all take turns sort of trading sides

109
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,620
So but at every point throughout the 19 films that was made in this series

110
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:21,700
They just did different match-em-ups like in this one Captain Jack Sparrow and squid face are teaming up against good guy and Barbacoa

111
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
And then they'll switch the next

112
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:30,220
This time it's Captain Jack and and and Barbacoa and the good general against squid man

113
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,460
And I think that's the seventh or eighth one, you know, it's kind of like wrasslin in that way. Yeah

114
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,180
Very much so for me in W. Oh, yeah

115
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,540
Water organization, it's fucked up in that one movie where they all were the good guy

116
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,780
And they just kind of sailed around for a while. Nothing really happened

117
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,380
What if none of us is a bad guy? What if we just want different things?

118
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,180
Okay, what if all of our motivations are different and our life goals just don't like line up

119
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,660
But we can learn to see each other's perspective

120
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,740
yeah, and there was the one that was it was just Captain Jack Sparrow and all the other captains were gone and everybody in the

121
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,140
Movie theater kept yelling like this soft. This means more captains. Oh

122
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,700
Also, Orlando Bloom's becomes a captain and at the end one of us so there's five captains all sort of just switch

123
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,140
I think he becomes undead. Yeah, if I remember correctly, it's a really cool flicks

124
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,280
But he does take time Orlando Bloom does take time to get Kiera Knightley pregnant before

125
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,620
He then goes away for I believe ten years at a time if I'm not

126
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,780
Before he turns into a bone skeleton and he doesn't have any more

127
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,780
calm

128
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,700
Can't talk about Jack Sparrow without relating the anecdote of the freest man I ever met

129
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,420
okay, I was in a murder mystery and

130
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,540
We I used to do these murder mysteries at Raywood Castle all the time beautiful place they don't do anymore

131
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,420
Mr. Denham, they used to run him retired

132
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,300
But at the end of the day or the end of the weekend once the murders have been solved and the corpses

133
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,340
I'm cold pile everybody burnt everybody would stand up and like introduce themselves

134
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,520
Yeah, and there was a guy at one who was just like Jack Sparrow and I'd clocked this dude before

135
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:19,900
Well, we're on land so he didn't have a captain captain captain Jack and he was like

136
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,320
I'd clocked this guy before in this exact same captain Jack because it was like a pretty good captain Jack

137
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:34,600
Yeah, and he said I realized something this weekend. I used to think that when I came here and I got dressed up like this

138
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
I was putting on a costume

139
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
But what I realized is

140
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:46,120
This is me and what I'm wearing out there. That's the costume. Fuck. Yeah, dude. Yes, dude. Fuck

141
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,040
Yes, live it. I'm just saying if they need a new

142
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,800
Cap Jack he's in. Yeah, probably still right from the castle. That's so much like that

143
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,360
How can you be more like him? Yeah, we didn't even attempt it. We just talked about him for a while. Hey, wait

144
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,440
No, no, just if that's how can you look like him? I mean just like how can I be you say be more like?

145
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,080
Jonathan Sparrow

146
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,160
That's his real name. Of course, Jonathan. So fucking dirty

147
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,280
Well yesterday I couldn't I could not do that

148
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,560
That life cuz he's so he's so dirty

149
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:27,040
He's not even just like I haven't taken a shower or bath in a while dirty like he's done things

150
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Yeah to become

151
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
like more dirty

152
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,320
It's a it's a vibe. He is doing of just like can I be the dirtiest rascal?

153
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,800
He's a dirty rascal. I think that that is rule number one be a dirty rascal

154
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,720
I think rule number two if you accomplish something in it like seems more difficult than it really was

155
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,080
Say it was Turtles. That's a good one. That's a good one. Say it was Turtles

156
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,920
Every time every time he was like sea turtles and they're like, oh fuck this dude rules

157
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:07,440
I'll turn to Wikipedia it begins the characterization section with according to screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio

158
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,920
Sparrow is a trickster who uses wit and deceit Arlecchino

159
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:18,960
Are we stirring up the pot is a trickster. He uses wit and deceit to attain his goals referring to in disputes verbally instead of a horse. Oh

160
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:26,600
With a slightly drunken swagger and has slurred speech and flailing hand gestures. Yes. Sparrow is shrewd

161
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,420
calculating and eccentric

162
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,760
So that the slightly drunken swagger I think is attainable right now. Yeah, that's attainable today

163
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,280
You don't even got to be drunk to do that man. Yeah, you just get a little little swag also

164
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,480
He's a he's a very good swordsman. I just want it not the best

165
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
hard though of like all the

166
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,200
Character traits to try to embody like I don't you need that one

167
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,520
Well, not at first but it fucked up that on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride

168
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,000
they did add cap captain Jack to it, but they and he looks like

169
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,200
Pretty pretty photorealistic I would say yeah

170
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:13,960
But the other animatrons in that ride still kind of look like sort of ghoulish commedia dell'arte

171
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,800
Masks of fear. Yeah, but then like you turn a corner and there's

172
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:28,360
Photorealistic captain Jack Sparrow. He's like you have to get me out of here. Yes. Yeah, take me to the Hall of Presidents

173
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,360
Presidents

174
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:37,900
Presidents that would be great. By the way. Hey Disney if you're listening just start incorporating Jack Sparrow into other animatronic things, too

175
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
like the bear jamboree and

176
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,040
Hall of Presidents anywhere there are animatronics just have like sneaky Jack Sparrow

177
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,320
Peeking out from like behind things and like that's out of barrels and shit. Yeah

178
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,040
There's a quote on here, too. I just wanted to pass along it says

179
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:02,080
a gentleman m'lady you will always remember this as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow and that is

180
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,680
That's the quote that source to Jack almost escapes another sticky situation

181
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,240
Wow, yeah

182
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,560
that is something that I have tried in my day-to-day life if I go to the post office and

183
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,120
There's a big line and I'm about to wait in the line and then I'm like, no, I'm not gonna wait in the line

184
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
I'll loudly announce

185
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,760
gentleman m'lady you will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Justin McElroy and they're like

186
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Where are we catching what?

187
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,480
Better luck next time and then you'll swing out on a rope. Never me down

188
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,900
Now here's the wing that rope is attached to nothing

189
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,520
Justin is just always holding a rope and a saver and if he sees a situation

190
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,480
He wants to get out of he swings the saber and just yells huzzah

191
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,680
And then kind of walks out holding the rope up like he's swinging on it, which is not don't get me wrong

192
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,720
It's a cool move. It works every time it plays

193
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,320
Anyway, that was a lot of talk about Pirates of the Caribbean Travis. You're welcome

194
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
It's just once a year. I need it

195
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,040
Listen, I realize I kind of called that in really early this year and I'm gonna be fucking regretting that

196
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,320
Give anything to talk about it. I get it I get it, but I needed it

197
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,540
Can we push the Wizards throne and make a sweet off I brought barley?

198
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,860
Okay, you what I brought barley. Oh

199
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:27,780
Yeah, the wizard you forgot your own fucking thing from like he's allergic Travis. I didn't forget it

200
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:33,580
The Wizards allergic to grains. Oh, this is actually this is nut based barley. Oh

201
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,140
Nut barley, huh? Yeah, I made it from almonds

202
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:44,060
He's not he does paleo Travis. Fuck know that. Yeah. Hey cool. This is meat nuts. I

203
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,060
I

204
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,900
Made almonds out of beef and then I use those

205
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,500
These are these are delicious meat nuts, okay, so this one was sent in by

206
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,860
Celia thank you. Celia

207
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,180
It's a wikiHow article and it's from the wizard

208
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,780
He wrote it and it's how to convince your parents to let you wear a thong. Thank you

209
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:14,700
Well, let's just say let's just say step zero. Keep your grades up. Yeah

210
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,420
Obviously if your grades slip there's no way that this is gonna happen

211
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:24,620
yeah, that's your parents to let you wear a thong may seem like an impossible task with enough preparation and strategy your chance of

212
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,460
convincing them strengthens

213
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:32,240
Convince them with a persuasive argument that will leave them confident in your abilities. Ah, yes

214
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:38,680
They know they're gonna rock that shit. That's like that's terrible. That's like to basically say like do a good job

215
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,520
Yeah, yeah, like convince them to like, okay. Yeah wikiHow. That's why I'm here

216
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,800
Yeah, there's a lot of cognitive dissonance in this wikiHow article and that's like compared to other wikiHow articles

217
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,440
And so that's saying something part one prepare your argument one plan your strategy

218
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,960
Yeah, what do you think I'm doing wikiHow? Yeah

219
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,440
It's a combination of appealing to your parents reasonable side and appealing to their emotional side

220
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,280
You want to hit them from both angles to show your argument is thorough. Tell them how important this is to you

221
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,000
So like is it like a slideshow set to Sarah McLaughlin? Is that what they're talking about?

222
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,080
So I've got the I've got the details, but also a little tug of the heartstrings there. You know what I mean?

223
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,840
I think that's the same the songs of

224
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,380
The angels that was lazy. Okay

225
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,040
When you plan the tracks of the angels

226
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:37,560
Rest up. It's not getting you're not I'm actually listening to you in real time

227
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,560
So I know these are not getting more. There's not more effort going into it

228
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:46,520
Well this time I was getting there because the thongs would be in the cracks of the angels. Okay, okay

229
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,040
When you plan your strategy write down how you'll approach them reasonably

230
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,400
What kind of things do your parents react to on a logical level?

231
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,280
What are their weaknesses? Oh

232
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,720
That's great because then you sit down you're looking at the paper which your dad loves all dads love the paper

233
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,760
Yeah, you say like, oh, did you see this turns out thongs are really good for the economy

234
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:14,180
Mmm, that's great. They were a real Christmas story sort of. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh and then explain in really intricate detail how thongs are

235
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,720
undermining

236
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Cryptocurrency and I bet your dad

237
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
They hate crypto

238
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,680
Okay, yeah, they don't understand it Justin. Do your parents have a strong sense of pride?

239
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,040
Are they quick to avoid fear?

240
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
These are the kinds of things you should be thinking about that's great

241
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:37,680
Because if this thong plan goes south you you will be multiple steps closer to knowing how to destroy your parents

242
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,280
Psychologically, is there a kid in your class that your parents acknowledges the Alpha?

243
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:49,480
Right because like that I might listen my kids coming home every day talk about I don't know Christina Derek

244
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,600
I don't know Jamal somebody right and I'm like, what did they do today? Huh? Yeah, cool

245
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,320
Oh, that's so cool, man. They did what all their parents bought them the new switch, whatever it is, right?

246
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,600
Yeah, it's like oh, yeah, they wear a thong and I'm like what they do

247
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,600
Okay, this next part this next part so tight. Let's just get through it

248
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,960
Okay to know why you want to wear a thong an important part of your strategy is appealing to your parents sense of reason a well

249
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:22,220
Reasoned argument includes persuasive justifications for wearing a thong write down five or six logical reasons why you would want to wear a thong Wow

250
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,580
Yeah, let me thongs thongs don't show panty lines

251
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,380
The main benefit of this is that it avoids attention to your butt surely your parents can get on board with that

252
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,700
They don't want people looking at their baby's bottom

253
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,300
No way thongs last longer since there's less fabric to wait they reshape better than regular ponies

254
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,940
Is that true if you change shape at all?

255
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:47,300
It is less likely that you will have to buy new ponies saving money and then step three thongs keep you cooler and hot temperatures

256
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,780
They are lightweight allowing for better air flow by avoiding sweat in your ponies

257
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,620
You will also avoid possible skin rashes or blemishes

258
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,700
That mean that's all three reasons. I did say five or six

259
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:04,620
But also, there's no fucking way thongs last longer. There's no way doesn't make sense

260
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:09,480
They're a hair and friction friction pressure, but just like it's flimsy, too

261
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,100
There's less fabric. There's less room for stitching

262
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,180
problems I

263
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:20,220
Mean that is the thing. Let me tell you I I did I dabbled in speech and debate in high school

264
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,140
You got to have some counter points ready like what what are your parents gonna bring up?

265
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:31,780
Wedgie promise is definitely one of them. Yeah, and this is where you need a counterpoint right where you're just like, yeah

266
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,780
I wear a tight belt. Oh

267
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,300
Interesting, no one's getting in there

268
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,460
Wells well

269
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,860
Samantha if you promise to just wear a tight belt

270
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,220
Every time you're wearing these things and then every time you come downstairs in a tight belt your prints would be like, oh how responsible

271
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,740
No good choices step three step three show them you are responsible prove to your parents

272
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,340
You are a responsible person who makes responsible choices doing this will give your argument more credibility

273
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,340
on a sack of flour for a while

274
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,900
Carried around you come on, baby. Yeah

275
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,940
Wow, she's doing a great job keeping those under pants on that

276
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,900
Flower if you have chores or homework do them on time without being asked

277
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:16,060
So you're great your grades up for sure your grades up save your money instead of spending it on frivolous things

278
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:21,380
And do not stay out late or come home drunk. Well guys, I went a whole month without coming home drunk

279
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,380
So I think yes, you're ready

280
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,380
You're ready now for those special underwear

281
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,460
Be prepared to pay for your thong. Yeah, like getting the alternative is like not

282
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,380
Not going to work. Look I'm not like you asked me to now. I need a hundred dollars

283
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,340
I do not know the best thongs. I don't want to sully myself

284
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,420
Practice your argument in the mirror. Yeah

285
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:49,380
Yeah, that's that that's something that would be cool to have somebody walk in on my butt

286
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,900
It gets so sweaty mom

287
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,780
What are you doing there? No, they get out

288
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,580
Approach your parents about the conversation. Yeah

289
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,820
Ask when they seem to be in a good way approach them

290
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,180
He doesn't want to start screaming through the walls when they're doing

291
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:12,260
Hey hypothetically if I were to ask you about thongs just hypothetically

292
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:17,660
Okay, so part two convincing your parents one bring your notes with you. Awesome

293
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,100
Fucking awesome. You can hide them in your pocket or another discreet place in your pocket is great because you can be like

294
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,100
I need to wear a thong because uh

295
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,620
My butt gets sweaty or doesn't get so hold on one sec

296
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,980
It says here my butt does get sweaty

297
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,700
broach the subject

298
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,740
calmly

299
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,600
Try to control the conversation as much as possible the more you're interrupted the easier it will be for you to lose your place and forget

300
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:48,660
What to say, that's it. They just want to flummox you. Yeah, that's that that misdirection is like number one parenting secret

301
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,860
That's why right off the bat you have to flummox them call them by their first names. Yeah

302
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,060
Do you uh?

303
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,460
Daddy, I really want this new good. You can't say daddy. You gotta say like Jonathan

304
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,700
Jonathan well, this is what I'm imagining my children coming to me and asking for the new jitsu toy

305
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,660
And I interrupt and say like but what is a gu jitsu?

306
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:12,820
And then they're like all up in there in there then their mind labyrinth and they just can't escape it

307
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,200
Go through your list of logical reasons the sweat. Did I mention the sweat thing and the panty lines they got to go

308
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,300
They got to go

309
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,900
Everyone's gonna look at my butt if I don't wear a thong is that what you want fucking weirdo nasty

310
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,020
You're nasty for that nasty dad and a nasty mom

311
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:35,840
Appeal to their emotions this one. I feel like you've given us a lot of ammunition for the logical stuff

312
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,100
Yeah, I don't know what that what we're pulling on heartstring wise

313
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,660
Remind them that you're growing up old enough to make decisions about how to adorn your own body

314
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,620
Yeah, I mean that's pretty foolproof mom dad. I'm 32. Let me wear a thong

315
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,160
Invite questions well

316
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,980
Jonathan Alicia

317
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,140
Thus concludes my presentation. Thank you for your time today. I really appreciate your attention

318
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,540
There will be coffee and some snacks on your way out. Oh

319
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,140
Let's take some questions right? Oh wait. Oh, I'm getting the light

320
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:15,340
I'm sorry. That concludes my time stay tuned for the next TED talk about

321
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,020
Macrobiology or whatever?

322
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,640
Give them some time to talk it over or think about it. No, you can't have a thong. Well, hold up

323
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:28,300
Circle back tomorrow. Thank you. Remember what I said Alicia think what does Alicia think Alicia?

324
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:34,020
You guys do not seem on the same page about you know, Jonathan. You never take time to ask Alicia what she thinks

325
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,740
Oh, I'm so sorry. You have to put this this

326
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,760
We'll go get some wine Alicia, we don't need Jonathan for this

327
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,820
Start part three reacting to their response be prepared for any response. Okay?

328
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,420
Prepare yourself for the possibility. They will say no or drive the discussion out

329
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:55,380
it's a good idea to come up with possible solutions to those scenarios, even if they do not happen you press the button and

330
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:02,220
Jail cell bars drop over every exit from the kitchen. Yeah anywhere. I have these jail bars

331
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,100
Installed until we're done here until I'm done with you

332
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,500
react calmly

333
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,940
If they respond with an immediate, no, don't storm off in a huff or raise your voice. Let me wear a thong. No

334
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,420
Okay

335
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:20,780
Cool, if you feel yourself getting upset breathe check to see if your body is tensing up and relax your body

336
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:26,060
If none of that works and everyone's still glaring at each other tell a joke. Humor is a great way to defuse a tense situation

337
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
That's awesome

338
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:35,200
Play this play Cisco's thong song at maximum volume on every smart device in the house Alexa

339
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,420
This this one seems like actually a very good strategy ask them why they say no

340
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:47,100
Like I want to wear thongs everything in your life, huh? Yeah speak on that speak on that, please

341
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,620
Do you think that this is something is this because your parents had no to you for something Jonathan?

342
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,820
Jonathan, are you just projecting forth your?

343
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:04,300
Your fear of not being responsible enough for a thong. I understand that I understand that you've forgotten what it's like to want things Jonathan

344
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:12,100
songs Jonathan and that's that's partially my fault since I since I was was born and I understand that that's a sacrifice parents have

345
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,100
To make but don't you don't have to force that on me. Did I mention the sweat?

346
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,020
sweaty, but

347
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,300
Why do you want my butt to sweat dad? Damn?

348
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,060
I thought we were cool

349
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:28,660
If your parents won't budge off of them a compromise, maybe you can suggest revisiting the topic after you show more responsibility

350
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,900
That's probably gonna do it. It's because I didn't mop enough

351
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:38,600
All right, mom dad compromise. I'll wear the thong over regular underpants. Yeah

352
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,840
Finally step five drop the subject if all else fails accept your fate and walk away

353
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:47,700
Do not continue to beg or harass your parents doing that will only diminish any chance of convincing them later and it will put them

354
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,540
In a bad mood walking away from the argument with grace allows you to keep your parents respect, huh?

355
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,980
Seems like you're very lost your parents respect cuz I don't respect enough to let you wear the thong you crave. Yeah. Yeah

356
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,060
I

357
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,420
Think also I'll add a step six on this wiki article

358
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:07,580
I don't think you're allowed to just I don't think these are up for community edits, but you could also just do it

359
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:13,660
Yeah, and what are they going to do? You know what I mean? You'll have to wash them yourself to not get

360
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,460
if you really want to cloak the situation, but like

361
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,060
They're not gonna be like hmm Samantha can't help but notice

362
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:26,420
There's not as many panty lines this morning because that's a fucking wild thing to say over the over the in the breakfast nook

363
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,500
I think that I think that these are foolproof ideas

364
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,480
I will also say if if your parents say no instead of just walking away and accepting your fate

365
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,180
Let me offer this say like, okay. I hear you. Let's revisit this in q3

366
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:47,780
Let's circle back in q3. I think that that's gonna like knock them off their groove a little bit

367
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:52,260
Yeah, so that when you bring up in q3, they're like, I think they're a business person

368
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,620
Sometimes my kids drop something and that would be the exact moment to attack

369
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,780
Like if they just like dropped it like all right

370
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,760
I would be so sort of like I would need to sit down on the floor for a little bit

371
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,440
Yeah, and that's the time where you like if you change your mind. Just let me know. Yeah

372
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,880
Show me the exact date on this calendar where I'm gonna be a lot of ways

373
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,500
The thing is q2 q2 is the summertime. And so my butt is gonna be

374
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:21,340
Just just covered with rashes and irritation because of my stupid big underwear

375
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,960
Yeah, to be fair Griffin that depends on your family's fiscal year starts, right? That's a fair point

376
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:31,420
I mean if anything just a week after you do this conversation if it fails you sit down in the breakfast nook and you go

377
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,220
Ah, oh

378
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,600
Sorry guys

379
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,700
Covered in rashes chalk a block rashes down there. Wow, it's irritated. Oh

380
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,600
man

381
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,240
The kids in school. They keep yelling at me every time I yell every time I sit down at the classroom desk or lunch table

382
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:55,000
Yeah, and they're like, is it your visible panty lines that are giving you rashes sweaty, but are you wearing a teenage diaper?

383
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,480
hurts

384
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
teenage diaper

385
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Barber

386
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,780
Let's take a break and go over the my zone we guys think about that. Yeah

387
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,780
Oh

388
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,380
Hey, can I tell you guys something absolutely wild y'all I tweeted

389
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,220
Lou wherever you are. We need a mombo number six now more than ever and

390
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:42,140
And Linda Carter aka Wonder Woman retweeted it quote

391
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,980
Tweeted it and said sounds like a fun job for the Justice League

392
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,100
What what the fuck?

393
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,780
How would you say? Why would you say this when we're going into the money zone?

394
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:58,100
We can talk about when we come back now. I mean, I think we're in it now. I think you've started it

395
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,440
Yeah

396
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,640
We can't do the ads now because we have to talk about why Linda Carter thinks a good job for the Justice League would be defined

397
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,260
Lou Bega make him dream of a number. I mean a big thing is why this ended up on on

398
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:13,840
Linda Carter's plate in the first place. Linda Carter does not follow me on Twitter. No, yeah

399
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,940
but there's obviously some degree of

400
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,900
separation there where like somebody retweeted it and then Linda Carter saw that and

401
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:29,460
Was like, I don't know who this fucking Travis nobody is but he's got some dope thoughts about Lou Bega

402
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,320
But what about instead of Lou Bega? It's Aquaman

403
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:39,720
What if they said like the D string Justice League to go find Lou Bega that actually would be a fun idea

404
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:47,120
Wonder Twins is right about go find Lou Bega. Yeah wonder twins and so the other bad ones that nobody likes red tornado, baby

405
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:55,880
I think that the amount of you're you're not thinking I think logically about this because there's still so there is

406
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:01,640
Uncalculable power that exists in the the the

407
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,600
Dead Sea Mambo scrolls the Mambo apocrypha of one through four

408
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,360
I think that if we got our hands on that that quadrilogy

409
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:18,700
It would be enough to tide us over for the next few centuries. You have to do Mambo number six Clark

410
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:25,680
I told you I I can't return to that life. I I don't know that I'm there. I'm able to wield the power responsibly

411
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,480
There's no more woman names. I use them all in five

412
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,880
Dumped in too much trumpet. Don't you understand?

413
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,840
It was too much

414
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,280
He would there be a break in mama never six would be like even more trumpet and it would just be eight

415
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:48,200
This cordon trumpets just all blue and would shatter. Yeah, I knew it on

416
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:56,400
The Mambo number five maxi single. There are four tracks. I'm betting it was a casino, right? It would have to be. Yeah

417
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,920
Mama number five radio edit mama number five extended mix

418
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,840
Mambo Havana Club mix. Yeah Mambo

419
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:13,680
The trumpet and that one is six minutes long. Oh god. I don't know if it's just like hey, here's something you could sample

420
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,640
It's the trumpet

421
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:21,820
Mm-hmm, but it's just him saying the trumpet in a bunch of different ways for six minutes. No horn is present on the track

00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,980
Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon

466

00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:50,900
You got really moved at the end of that trip. Yeah, I'm still getting over being sick, but it just gave me a lot of emotion

474
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,300
Yes, that's so beautiful, man. I love that

475
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,140
I'm the only one that's not sick right now and y'all are making fun of my

476
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:04,940
Medieval immune system. So I mean I'm sick and I was still doing like freeway exercises. So oh

477
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,700
I do those every day anyway. Oh, yeah. Yeah. What do you what do you bench in? What are you doing?

You know, what are you doing? I mostly just lift them up off the ground as for as long as I can

481
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:29,620
Hold on to him right now. Oh, really? I'm building a lot of passive muscle. Oh

482
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,280
Yeah background muscle is what they call it

483
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,060
It's been so long

484
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,940
Really? I really didn't think Justin would do this because he was sick and like but I

485
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Think that kind of shows a little bit

486
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:01,700
Squad I want a much squad

487
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,920

Hi, welcome on squad. Well, thank you. It's good to be here within a push. Shut up. Oh

Podcasts in a podcast which profiles the latest and greatest in brand eating

490
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,100
rather than set up today's thing with

491
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,780
You know

492
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,460
spiel I

493
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:32,540
Wanted to play the commercial for it first great and then talk about it. Is that okay?

494
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,580
Now I warn you

495
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:41,460
This is two minutes and 20 seconds long. Oh, man. Oh, yeah, but listen

496
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:48,500
You're gonna be in such a fucking tizzy when you hear what this is this ad from the year of our Lord 2020

497
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,660
see

498
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,600
2022 yeah, see you're gonna trip you ready

499
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,960
Are you ready? Yes

500
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:05,640
One day the guy on the buffalo wing was riding around in a forest smell the smell

501
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,080
He's thinking where's that smell coming from feels like maybe over there

502
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,400
So we mosey don't over pull back on the range

503
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:26,720
That's how you stop a buffalo wing and he hopped on off and he looked in the bush and he saw the wall go to glow of a buffalo garlic blaze meal from Zaxby's

504
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,960
I'm gonna take this with me to go. It's great. Wouldn't it be good with some range?

505
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,960
Go!

506
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,960
Oh, thanks Eagle

507
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,240
Oh, no, you don't ask too many questions

508
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:47,080
But it's a guy on the buffalo wing

509
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,080
Guy on the buffalo wing

510
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:56,240
One day the guy on the buffalo wing saw a fox in the weeds. He's thinking that fox seems shady

511
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,280
No, he's probably harmless enough. I'll just let him go. See you little fella

512
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:06,320
And then he found a hedgehog jammed down in a log and pulled him out and they became best friends

513
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:14,320
They went back to the buffalo wing to snack down on Zaxby's, but the food was gone. The stinking fox stole our meals

514
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:21,320
Oh, but you know what? I got an idea says the hedgehog. I got something stashed in an old stump

515
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:28,320
Oh, that's a buffalo garlic blaze meal. That's what I was just eating. Oh, it's tantalizing. Let's sit down and eat it

516
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,320
Mmm, that's pretty good

517
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,320
Guy on the buffalo wing

518
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,320
Well, if it isn't the chicken wing thief

519
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:41,320
Sorry, man. I'm a fox. It's kind of my thing. Truce? Come here, man. We're cool

520
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:46,320
Oh, it's a guy on the buffalo wing

521
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,320
Hey, uh, guy? I don't remember it happening like that

522
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,320
Yeah, I don't either

523
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,320
Every time he eats Zaxby's that's all he wants to talk about

524
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,320
Yeah, I saw the original and it was definitely a buffalo you were riding not a buffalo wing

525
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
Guy on the buffalo wing

526
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,320
And then it's the original old guy from guy on the buffalo

527
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,320
I can't believe

528
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,320
Can you believe

529
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
That guy on the buffalo wing

530
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,320
That bones are their money

531
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,320
There's there's been

532
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,320
Justin I don't

533
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,320
I don't I don't think

534
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
I've been dealing with this now you got to deal with it

535
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,320
Well, I'm mostly dealing with the fact that it now it's on our show now. It's on our show

536
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,320
So now it's on other problems. There's no fucking way

537
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,320
Uh-huh

538
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:40,320
That I would say more than 30% of our audience understands the reference

539
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,320
That's okay

540
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,320
Wait, there's a reference?

541
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,320
You're probably

542
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,320
Travis?

543
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,320
Travis, are you fucking with me?

544
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,320
I am not fucking with you at all. I have no idea what this was

545
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,320
Okay, stop the show

546
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,320
Okay

547
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,320
This is what I'm saying, Justin

548
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,320
It's it's this is okay Griffin. You're actually your math was right. I got a 30%

549
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,320
I guess 66.6 repeating

550
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,320
But that's not a good hit rate. I think okay. So okay back in 2011

551
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,320
There was a series of YouTube videos called guy on a buffalo that took

552
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,320
Clips from an old show from the 70s. I think called Buffalo Jones

553
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,320
Of just a guy riding around on a buffalo and

554
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,320
Mainly just fighting off animals that try to get at him

555
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:25,320
Okay, but now they've said but now Zaxby's has taken that 11 year old meme

556
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:30,320
And well, you know, I don't know Justin got fucking berries and cream started again

557
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,320
So I guess anything's possible

558
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,320
I guess anything is definitely possible

559
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,320
Damn Zaxby's that's a deep fucking cut

560
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:43,320
It's like a 30% of our audience and approximately 0.03

561
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,320
Repeating percent of the TV watching audience

562
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,320
Yeah

563
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:53,320
So Zaxby's launched an ad campaign to introduce its Buffalo Garlic Blaze signature sauce

564
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:58,320
The new campaign features the quirky guy on a buffalo wing national spot

565
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:05,320
Which premiered during Monday's college football playoff and will run during the big game

566
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:11,320
On February 13th. Oh, they're still doing that. Yeah, they're still going for it

567
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,320
The pandemic numbers are so bad. Are you sure they're not going to cancel it?

568
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,320
They're definitely going to cancel it

569
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,320
They're going to zoom. They're going to zoom it

570
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,320
Now I'm tackling you. Hey, I tackled that guy

571
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:28,320
Oh my god, can I just say like a bunch of like iPads on robotic like bases fucking watch the shit out of that

572
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,320
Sounds better than football, no concussions

573
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,320
Yeah

574
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,320
It's just a bunch of like tricked out robots getting wild

575
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,320
You do have to be careful dumping the Gatorade because you're going to ruin a lot of technology that way

576
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,320
Yeah, tens of thousands of dollars. All these segues are ruined

577
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:47,320
It's just, it's just, it's just, it's not, it's just wild y'all

578
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:56,320
It would be like if fucking, I don't know, Cheerios were like all your Cheerios are belong to us

579
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:03,320
The new guy on a buffalo wing commercial follows a lone cowboy riding a Zaxby's style buffalo wing

580
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:09,320
Who discovers a boneless wings meal from Zaxby's that features the new Buffalo Garlic Blaze sauce

581
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,320
The spot is narrated to a folk song

582
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,320
Pretty sure that's not how that works dramatically

583
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,320
Composed by the band Jomo and the Possum Posse

584
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:24,320
Featuring quirky characters such as the Bobcat, the Squirrel, the Fox, and the Hedgehog

585
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,320
Why are you describing it like this?

586
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,320
I mean, that's what it is, Trav. I don't know what you want

587
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:37,320
I know, but it's not like, it's just saying the parts of it without like explaining it at all

588
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,320
Yeah

589
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,320
It's like, yeah, this is what happens in it. Okay, but like why?

590
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,320
Why is that what happens in it?

591
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:50,320
He says with Dooley Tombras, the president of Zaxby's creative agency of record, Tombras

592
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:55,320
Says, guy on a buffalo wing is impossible to look away from

593
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,320
The kind of campaign that will make diners wonder what they're missing

594
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,320
And have to try it for themselves

595
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,320
Do you guys think that the mindset of, but you're talking about it

596
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:10,320
Has gone too fucking far in this year of Our Lord of 2022

597
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,320
Where people are like, yeah, but you're talking about like, yeah, but

598
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,320
Ask me in 10 minutes what the food was

599
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,320
Yeah

600
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,320
I couldn't tell you, but I'll talk about this wild video forever

601
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,320
The last time that worked is when they fucking murdered Mr. Peanut

602
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:29,320
And I was like, I can't look away from that ad because my good friend Mr. Peanut has passed away

603
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,320
And I thought about it

604
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,320
No, but even then made me not want to eat peanuts because I felt like I was eating his corpse

605
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:39,320
Or I'd much rather feel like I was eating alive Mr. Peanut over and over again and killing him myself

606
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:46,320
I would say, Travis, once you see this man riding a buffalo wing

607
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,320
You will not soon forget what this is about

608
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,320
There's several shots where he is eating a plate of boneless garlic wings

609
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,320
Buffalo garlic blaze boneless wings

610
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:02,320
On a plate that is on top of his steed

611
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,320
Yeah, fucked up

612
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,320
Which is itself a buffalo, a giant buffalo wing

613
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,320
But is it a boneless wing he's riding?

614
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,320
That is up for interpretation

615
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,320
I don't believe so

616
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,320
It looks like it does have a bone in it

617
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,320
Okay

618
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,320
It's just, there's so many things

619
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,320
One, the big buffalo wing does look like I would fuck that up in a major way

620
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,320
Yeah, but then you wouldn't have anything to ride on

621
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,320
But I wouldn't want to sit astride a buffalo wing in the first place

622
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:31,320
Because some of my top five places that I don't want to get buffalo sauce on

623
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,320
My Goojer is way up there

624
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:37,320
Especially if you've been riding that saddle all day and you're getting a little chafed

625
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,320
Because your parents wouldn't let you buy a thong

626
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,320
And then you're sitting there and it's just seeping through your slacks

627
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,320
Forget about it, my man

628
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,320
Forget about it, dude

629
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,320
I don't want a spicy Goojer in the middle of the forest

630
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,320
Where am I going to go? What am I going to do about it?

631
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,320
Don't get me started on ants

632
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:05,320
If this kicks off a trend of doing parodies of ancient, like ancient, ancient memes

633
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,320
I would actually be super into that

634
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,320
I would actually like that quite a bit

635
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,320
You can have any meal you want at Combo.com

636
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,320
Oh, that's good

637
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:20,320
They could be like, burger, burger, burger, burger, mushroom, mushroom

638
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,320
Yeah, that was me, Star Wars kid

639
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:30,320
My male pattern baldness has made me into more of a Star Wars man

640
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,320
Oh, man

641
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,320
Oh, boy

642
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,320
Boy, howdy

643
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,320
All right

644
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,320
All right, so that's much one

645
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,320
Give me the next question, Justin

646
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,320
You got it, bud

647
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,320
I work at a hospital

648
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,320
Thank you for your service

649
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,320
And on the patient food trays, they have milk cartons with little jokes

650
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,320
Awesome

651
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,320
One of the jokes

652
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,320
I read one of the jokes to my coworker smiling excitedly

653
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,320
Only for him to nod and politely stare at me

654
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,320
The joke

655
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,320
What happens when a cow doesn't shave?

656
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,320
She grows a mustache

657
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,320
I feel like I'm in a tomb right now

658
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,320
Brothers, was there a problem with my delivery?

659
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,320
Yes

660
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,320
Couldn't matter

661
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,320
Unanswerable

662
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,320
Can I show my face again at work after this?

663
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,320
And most importantly, how do I up my milk-based joke game?

664
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,320
That's from Cowardly Comic in Greenville

665
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:27,320
I figured with this one, we're three professional top-tier comedians

666
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:32,320
And I figured that we could maybe do, I don't know, some punch-ups, some coaching here

667
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:43,320
Justin, I do like, whether intentional or not, how absolutely flat and soulless you deliver that joke

668
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,320
So that we have just solid flat ground to build off of

669
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,320
Yeah, that was about as worse as anybody could deliver that joke

670
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,320
If the joke is good, it doesn't need the help

671
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,320
It is a good joke

672
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,320
This is a good joke

673
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,320
Okay, you deliver it in a way that makes me laugh

674
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,320
Hey Justin

675
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,320
Yeah

676
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,320
Justin

677
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,320
Yeah

678
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,320
Justin

679
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,320
Yeah

680
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:09,320
What happens when a cow doesn't shave?

681
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,320
What?

682
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,320
She grows a moustache

683
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,320
See, that wasn't funny still, and it wasted more of my time

684
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,320
Well fuck

685
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,320
I would hit it like this

686
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,320
Hey Juice, why doesn't a cow shave?

687
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,320
I don't know, why?

688
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,320
He has a moustache

689
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,320
It sucked still, but it was like

690
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:36,320
Yeah, but you're thinking about this as people who have been free to make jokes and have fun for the last 45 minutes

691
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:41,320
You're on break at a hospital where the weight of responsibility can feel crushing

692
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:47,320
And now here's a brief moment of respite where you're able to goof without feeling like a monster

693
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:52,320
And you deliver this like, banger moustache joke

694
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,320
The joke sucks shit from the ground up

695
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:01,320
There's no good delivery of it that's going to make this person who's dying bust up and forget about it

696
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,320
You know what I mean?

697
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,320
So you may as well like, I don't want to rob them of the precious life seconds they've got

698
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,320
Hey, why doesn't a cow shave?

699
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,320
He has a moustache

700
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,320
That's two and a half seconds and then they're able to go do more stuff

701
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:17,320
I've only seized their attention for like, a really, really minimal amount of time

702
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:24,320
Is there a punch up you can do to it, Griffin, that like, take this joke and make it work?

703
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,320
Sure, let me try

704
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,320
Hey, what happens if a cow doesn't shave?

705
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,320
What?

706
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,320
What?

707
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,320
It gets a fucking moustache, baby!

708
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,320
That's pretty good

709
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,320
Oh, you know what I like? I like the jokes where it seems like a rip

710
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,320
So you can start off reading the paper, everybody loads the paper

711
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,320
And you go like, oh, did you see this? Did you hear about this?

712
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,320
You hear about one of these things?

713
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,320
You hear about one of these?

714
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,320
You hear about this now?

715
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:52,320
You hear about this? It looks like this cow, ooh, their razor broke

716
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,320
She wasn't able to shave

717
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,320
Oh yeah, what happened?

718
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,320
Oh, she grew a moustache

719
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,320
That's dope. Here, let me try this

720
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,320
They got bought into it at that point

721
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,320
The cow didn't shave, guess what?

722
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,320
What?

723
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,320
It got a moustache

724
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,320
Huh. That's a thinker

725
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:14,320
Yeah, that one is good. That's a good way of doing it, actually

726
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:18,320
Do you know a cow's favorite disgraced Prime Minister of Italy?

727
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,320
Oh no, who?

728
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,320
Mussolini

729
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,320
That's good. I like calling Mussolini a disgraced

730
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,320
I think that's kind of underselling it, but sure, yeah, yeah, yeah

731
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,320
Oh, he's so embarrassed

732
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,320
Well, he's not graced

733
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,320
That's for damn sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

734
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,320
He's not holding his head up high for a lot of reasons

735
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,320
Yeah, I like that. That's pretty good

736
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,320
Okay, oh, here's a tough one. Now it's a riddle. You ready?

737
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,320
Okay

738
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:53,320
Which of the Mario Brothers is a cow's favorite?

739
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,320
What?

740
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:58,320
Which of the Mario Brothers is a cow's favorite?

741
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,320
Who's that?

742
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,320
The Mario Brothers? Oh, it's two plumber bros?

743
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,320
Obviously, I know who the Mario Brothers is because I'm an original gamer

744
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,320
They're friends with Toad? You know Toad's friends?

745
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,320
I don't know anything

746
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,320
Toad!

747
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,320
Yeah, I don't know who that is

748
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,320
You know fucking Toad, dude? Look at my tattoo! This isn't me either

749
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,320
This is the person telling the joke

750
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,320
Yeah, of course, of course

751
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,320
I love the person you've invented

752
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,320
It's Toad's friends

753
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:25,320
Who doesn't know who Mario or Luigi is, but fucking is just wild about the little pervert Toad

754
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:32,320
Look at my face! I have a Toad tattoo in the corner of my eye like a teardrop, only it's Toad

755
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,320
I got one for everybody I've killed

756
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,320
Okay

757
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,320
I got six of them

758
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,320
What's the punchline?

759
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:44,320
Oh, you can say either Moo-ee-gee or Moo-rio

760
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,320
They both work

761
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,320
That sucks

762
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,320
You somehow wrote a worse joke

763
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,320
What's the cow's favorite former president of the European Central Bank?

764
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,320
There's a lot of politics here, Justin

765
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,320
Moo-rio Draghi

766
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,320
Now hold on

767
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,320
Well, you did just kind of use Moo-rio again

768
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,320
Yeah, but mine was like you didn't see

769
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:08,320
Travis, okay, I don't want to be like, whatever Travis, but you can't have the punchline part in the setup

770
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:12,320
Okay, where does a cow go to learn about art and history?

771
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,320
The museum

772
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,320
Exactly

773
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,320
That sucks

774
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,320
Do it different

775
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:28,320
I just want to remind the two of you on this call that we can't just deliver purposefully shitty jokes for 15 minutes and then say, put it in the can, that one's done

776
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:36,320
Hey guys, what if we did opposite of jokes today for this show? This is a special episode where we do opposite of jokes

777
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:40,320
What's a cow's favorite cereal?

778
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,320
Moose-lee?

779
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,320
No, it's fucking grass, it's a cow, you idiot

780
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,320
See, that's got some ADC energy that I really like

781
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,320
Yeah, I was trying to do like edgy, I was doing edgy comedy

782
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,320
Yes

783
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,320
We don't do that enough here

784
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,320
Yes

785
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,320
Yeah

786
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:09,320
2022 Fancy Takes Flight, 20 Rendezvous, we're having a rendezvous with like some edgy, challenging, push the envelope, doesn't have to be funny kind of comedy

787
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,320
Yeah, edgy, where if it's not funny to you it's because there's something wrong with you, not me

788
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,320
I made a solid joke

789
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,320
What about what happens when a cow doesn't shave for too long?

790
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,320
What?

791
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,320
Their bush goes fucking crazy

792
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,320
Oh, I like that

793
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:33,320
That's a good joke, that joke is funny

794
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:38,320
Yeah, that's a great joke because now you're imagining like, where does the bush go?

795
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,320
This is true

796
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,320
Like where is the bush at?

797
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,320
Because I think it's all boob down there, I'm not sure

798
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:46,320
It's mostly boob down there, so where's the bush?

799
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,320
Oh, that's funny, you'd be like, where's the beef? But it's like, where's the bush?

800
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,320
I have one

801
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:55,320
And that's like a joke on top of the first, that's a joke topping

802
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,320
I got a joke here and it really makes a statement

803
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,320
Yeah, sure

804
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,320
Does it kick ass?

805
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,320
Yeah

806
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,320
What happens when a cow doesn't shave?

807
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,320
What?

808
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:12,320
Society applies their concept of what beauty is to that cow and judges it for growing a moustache

809
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,320
That ain't it, chief

810
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,320
Well so, but then it has something to say, but I also still got moustache in there

811
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,320
Yeah, sure

812
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,320
Okay

813
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,320
This has been an hour, right?

814
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,320
I don't know, man

815
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,320
Write better jokes

816
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,320
What happened when the cow didn't shave?

817
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,320
What?

818
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,320
Who fucking gives a shit?

819
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,320
Oh, I like that

820
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,320
It's a cow, don't you have better things to worry about?

821
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,320
Cows don't fucking shave

822
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,320
Cows don't even shave, dumbass

823
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,320
It's a good one, man

824
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,320
Oh, edgy, see, you got it in there

825
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,320
Yeah

826
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:47,320
Um, we gotta do something else

827
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,320
We have to do anything else right now

828
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,320
Okay, I got you, don't worry about it

829
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:55,320
Is it a fucking shitty cow joke that we can be ironic on?

830
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,320
Um, no

831
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,320
Okay

832
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,320
But is that a problem?

833
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,320
Wait, but is it a problem if it's not?

834
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,320
Does it need to be that, or?

835
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,320
One, two, three, four, five

836
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,320
Moobaga

837
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,320
Come on, let's ride to the builder's yard around the corner

838
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:16,320
The gang's all here and it's time for us to do what we wanna

839
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,320
There's a house with a roof that leaks

840
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,320
It's an urgent job and it could take us weeks

841
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,320
There's Dizzy, Lofty, and Rowdy too

842
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,320
Wendy always knows just what to do

843
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,320
There's no job too big or small

844
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,320
With scoop and muck, we can do it all

845
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,320
Metal, brick, or wood, it's all good

846
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,320
And we can always send in the tractor

847
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,320
A little bit of timber and a saw

848
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,320
A little bit of fixing, that's for sure

849
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,320
A little bit of digging up the road

850
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,320
A little bit of moving

851
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,320
What are we listening to?

852
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,320
You have to stop

853
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,320
I did

854
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,320
No, but here's the problem, Justin

855
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,320
When you play things through your computer

856
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,320
If we talk at Echoes, so you

857
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,320
I know, I love that

858
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,320
You are holding us hostage

859
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,320
That is like a power play

860
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,320
Yeah

861
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,320
So you just gotta hear Bob the Builder's take on

862
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,320
Lou Vegas Mambo No. 5

863
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,320
Can I, I had, this is a great idea

864
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,320
And I'm assuming the show's over by now

865
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,320
Was that just like a palette cleanser you were playing to get us

866
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:16,320
That was like, I found, I found Mambo the Trumpet

867
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,320
And it was just like six minutes of trumpet

868
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,320
Like, that's not a joke

869
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:23,320
And then related to that was Bob the Builder's take on Mambo No. 5

870
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,320
I thought, maybe this is something

871
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,320
So then I played that

872
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,320
But you just played it

873
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,320
Yeah, I don't have anything to say about it

874
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,320
Its existence is funnier than jokes

875
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,320
Okay

876
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,320
I was just thinking about how it would be cool to make a song called

877
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,320
Mambo No. 2340

878
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:43,320
And the year is, the year is 32,000

879
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,320
Like Warhammer, kinda

880
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,320
Yeah, sure

881
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,320
And it's like, it's all, it's so far in the future

882
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,320
And we've continued to have new Mambos

883
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:53,320
And it's like, this is the 2037th Mambo

884
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,320
Yeah

885
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,320
That we're writing in the year 32,000

886
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,320
That would be awesome

887
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,320
And it's like filled with jokes about how

888
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:03,320
The year 32,000 nutrient slurry that everybody eats doesn't taste very good

889
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,320
Oh, yeah, yeah

890
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,320
And it's like listing the names

891
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,320
And it's like, a little bit of Beep Bop in my life

892
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,320
Yeah

893
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,320
A little bit of Foo Fob in my

894
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,320
And it's just like, even then people are listening to it going

895
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,320
Those aren't names

896
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,320
It's like, yeah, I know

897
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,320
But I used all, I've used all of them

898
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,320
There's no more names

899
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:24,320
And then somebody's like, hey guys, I found this weird old holovid on YouTube

900
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,320
And I just have some questions for you

901
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,320
One, what is a buffalo?

902
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,320
Two, what is a wing?

903
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,320
Three, what is a guy?

904
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,320
Also, where can I get this fucking meal?

905
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,320
Cause it's working

906
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,320
Can we get a pill?

907
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,320
Get the replicator to make a pill of the guy with the buffalo

908
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,320
Also guys, what happens when a cow doesn't shave?

909
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,320
What?

910
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,320
It grows a moustache

911
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,320
Stop the fucking show, Justin

912
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,320
Say the shit that you say at the end of every episode

913
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,320
Thanks for listening to our show

914
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,320
We'll feel better next week

915
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,320
And maybe we'll do better

916
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,320
No, we did fine

917
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,320
I don't like people thinking they waste it

918
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,320
Cause most people are listening to 1.25 anyway

919
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:05,320
They're just blowing through to see what, like how we're going to be realigning the culture

920
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,320
You know what I mean?

921
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,320
It's less about the humor and more about just like keeping their finger on the pulse

922
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:12,320
Well, but if they listen that fast, they're going to miss all the little like Easter eggs

923
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:17,320
And like winks at like stuff we have planned for the future and where the story's going

924
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:22,320
You actually would miss the sheer amount of time we just let hang in the air

925
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,320
After the first reading of that moustache joke

926
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,320
That is true

927
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,320
Go back and listen to that at like 0.75

928
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,320
I was spiraling a little bit

929
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,320
Thanks so much

930
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,320
Thanks to you for listening

931
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,320
Griffin, do your bit

932
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,320
Thanks to Montane for the use of our theme song

933
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,320
My life is better with you

934
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,320
Thanks Montane

935
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,320
I'm a show stopper and a show stopper

936
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,320
Literally

937
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,320
Make sure you go check out McRoyMerch.com

938
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,320
We got the pin of the month

939
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,320
Everybody has a knife

940
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,320
Which benefits the center for reproductive rights

941
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,320
We have guppies want me

942
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,320
Blink shards fear me sticker over there

943
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:57,320
I have been doing some streaming on Twitch

944
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,320
Playing, get this guys, a little game called Fortnite

945
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,320
And it rules

946
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,320
You can check that out at twitch.tv slash the Travis McRoy

947
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,320
Also Griffin has been doing a regular stream on Wednesdays

948
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,320
On the McRoy Family YouTube

949
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,320
In which I believe I'm describing this correctly

950
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,320
He plays video games as Guy Fieri

951
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,320
Nope, that's not it

952
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,320
Not even close

953
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,320
I'm pretty sure that's it

954
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,320
It's cool that you are supporting my art though

955
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,320
I really like it Griffin

956
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,320
Thank you

957
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,320
The kids like it too

958
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,320
Oh that's awesome

959
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,320
Yeah man, so cool

960
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,320
That's going to do it for us this week

961
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,320
Griffin, do you have a final yahoo to go out on?

962
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,320
Yeah, thank you everyone

963
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:42,320
I have a final yahoo that was sent in by Chimneyman

964
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,320
Chimneyman?

965
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,320
I'm so afraid of the Chimneyman

966
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,320
Please don't bring him into this

967
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,320

So, thank you sir

970
01:01:54,320 --> 01:02:01,320

01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,320
Crispifer

972
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,320
Crispifer?

973
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,320
Crispifer asks

974
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,320
Interesting

975
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:11,320

976
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,320
Crispifer asks

977
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,320
Crispifer you say

978
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,320
He asks

979
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:21,320
Crispifer asks

980
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:25,320

01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,320

983
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,320
You know what I mean?

984
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,320
Yeah

985
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,320

You have our full support Griffin

987
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,320
Do you remember some of the stuff you said already?

988
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,320
Because I could try to catch you back up

989
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:41,320
Like some stuff I said in this segment before?

990
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,320
You said yahoo at

991
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,320
Well, I guess I could do that

992
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,320
Okay, so I said Crispifer

993
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,320
And I said it was sent in by Chimneyman

994
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,320
Oh, not again

995
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,320
Oh no!

996
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,320
That's three!

997
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,320
Oh no!

998
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,320
Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle

999
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,320
Rah!

1000
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:59,320
Shit guys, I don't have time to do that final yahoo

01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,320

01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,320

This is my brother, my brother

1005
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,320
I can't move my fist part

1006
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,320
It's pretty small though

1007
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,320
Can't even ask where the lips

1008
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,320
My bones, my bones, my bones

1009
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:17,320

01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:20,320
