1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here come the McElroys, we've got jokes and bits.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We're gonna give advice and do funny skits, laughter it is in store.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Come inside and see, it's time to start.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's My Brother, My Brother and Me.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Omi, I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm Woof Woof Travis McElroy, a dog?

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Still doing it, this is Griffin, still doing it.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, I tried to make it go up at the end because I had a question I wanted to ask,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
because something's really been kind of, you know, just stuck in my old craw.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's just an age-old question I've been trying to figure out.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
A riddle even?

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
No, not quite a riddle, but it's more like when you wear a shirt, right?

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You go out into the world wearing a shirt.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Right, right, right, right.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Which side of the shirt is the side that's getting dirtier?

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The outside that's out facing the world or the inside a rubbing up against your body?

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, this is challenging.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is tough.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
There's parts of my body that are fucking filthy.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Right.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And there is, and we take great strides to mitigate that.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Right.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But the armpits, are we limiting this to just the shirt or are we talking pants too?

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You can't ask that of pants because you know the answer of pants,

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and it's which side's the googer on and it's in.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, yes, because the extension of this question, right, is if you wear two shirts, right?

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And I do.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If you have an undershirt and an overshirt.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Very prominent nipples Justin's got.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He's got to get two shirts in there to just pin those bad boys in.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If you get home, right?

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Right.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Which shirt is the dirty shirt?

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The dirty shirt, yeah.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Can you wear the undershirt again?

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Can you turn the shirt inside out and you're good?

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Where are we at with this?

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, okay, where are you spending your days?

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Are you spending it in a clean office?

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Are you spending a stinky fungus forest?

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's say I am walking around, okay, I'm walking around Columbus, Ohio on a 72-degree day.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, perfect.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Columbus really comes to life in the springtime.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah, but it's not so hot.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The finches.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh, baby.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, and the finches are flitting down the old Ohio.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The Columbus finches.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Oh, when they were turned from Capistrano to Columbus.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh, that's good, clean air.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's good, clean American air right there.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's good, clean air, but a recognizable city.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Now, I could have gone with Cincinnati, but I already live here, and I don't want to speak hypothetically.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
There's too much baggage.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
There's a lot of emotion tied to that city.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And during a game day, you walk outside.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, forget about it.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That shirt's instantly dirty.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, it's 72 degrees.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Perfect.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
72.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Sorry.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Justin and I are just spending time in our memories thinking about all of our great Columbus springs.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I understand.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Can I emerge from the doors of the Center on Science and Industry, or COSI?

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Of course.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And I'm headed to Cozy, the sandwich place.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh.

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Right.

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Right.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And he's feeling cozy in this great, comfortable air.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
72 degree weather.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This question's a bad question.

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Why?

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Well, I can answer it with a single word, and that word is jackets.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay.

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Hmm.

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So, you wear a shirt and a jacket outside in a beautiful 72 degree.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Maybe it's like a light jacket.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And you come back in, and end of the day, you put on your night clothes, and you take off your shirt.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Working in your night clothes.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
My long night shirt.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah.

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Right.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And your cap with your single candle.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Of course.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And you retire the shirt that has been rubbed against your huge prominent nipples and your stinky arm, like your arm goochers.

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And that goes in the hamper.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But the next day, new shirt, same jacket.

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, but just because we've always done that, Griffin, doesn't mean it's right.

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Listen, this is all good stuff, but Griffin started talking about nightcaps.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And I was thinking, you know the cap, and they got the fuzzy ball at the end all the time.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We love that.

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What's that about?

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So you can find the end of it easier.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Are you suggesting that I would be casually stroking up the top of the hat, and I would get to a place where I wasn't sure if I was touching air or hat?

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, it's dark. You only have the one candle.

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So you're like, how high is this hat going?

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And then you worry that maybe you've moved on to a certain, like now you've reached the chandelier, right?

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You missed the end completely, and you just keep going.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You need a sort of anchor when you're working in the dark in old Victorian times where you just have the one candle.

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You need something to sort of establish a depth perception, like target, and that's what the ball is for.

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And it can also be a fun game for when you get bored or you're very, very sick with an old Victorian disease laying in bed.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You sort of swat at it like a kitty cat does.

116
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh yeah, or when you're snoring and you're going honk, me, me, me, me, me.

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Your breath is like blowing that little ball up and it's bopping you back in the nose, you know what I mean? It's fun.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's so funny and cute.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So which side of the nightcap is getting dirtier?

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The ball side.

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
My body makes more filth than the room or area I'm in.

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I can pretty much guarantee that. It's terrible.

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:21,000
My body consumes things and turns it into, I guess, more bones and meat and flesh that makes me up.

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And then everything that doesn't make the cut just gets impressed into my clothing.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's a real horror show.

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Isn't it wild to think that we spend our lives eating food so our bones can get thicker and thicker until one day we die and it's just skin on bone?

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What are you talking about? This is a comedy show.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You said you had something fun and light for the opener. I'm so disappointed in you.

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I am officially revoking your ability to initiate the program.

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hey Justin, I just killed about six and a half minutes.

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
No, but that's not about this. I've been away from art for so long.

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's been a while.

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's been a while since I've made any art.

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Your friend Art Garfunkel?

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
No, see that's exactly what I'm talking about.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's what Justin's hinting at.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No more fucking duds.

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This show is no longer about art.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You've been away from art and it sounded like it.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Hey guys, it sounded like a name and that name is Art Garfunkel.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That you are right now pointing at the basketball underneath the hoop and it's like,

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
well, I thought I threw it high enough to get it in the hole, but I just threw it into the slushy stand.

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's what happened with that one.

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You're right, you're right.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We know.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Fart Garfunkel.

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Thank you, there it is.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
No Justin, no Justin, Justin, no Justin, Justin.

150
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
He got there.

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm going to revoke Travis's privileges from now.

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay, we haven't been able to make art for two weeks.

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Justin, you haven't been able to make fart.

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Because of the weather and stuff and because of that, Borat 2 beat Hamilton for the Golden Globe

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and we let that happen on our watch because we didn't make any art for two weeks

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and America forgot, you know what I mean?

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
America forgot.

158
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Has anyone checked on Lin?

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I talked to Lin last night after Borat beat him so soundly and I promised him on my mother's grave

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
that if Borat beat him for the Golden Globe, it would be discussed in the introduction of this program.

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So now I have cashed that in.

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
There it is.

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Thanks for checking in, Borat.

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Borat, is there anyone you'd like to thank?

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He wants to thank his reggae horn that he travels with at all times.

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That was a real bump set just dookie on the ground.

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That was a nice setup and a failure to deliver.

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We love Borat.

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We do love Borat here.

170
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm saying, here's what I'm saying.

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Everybody wins the Golden Globes because everybody had a great time.

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And the stars came out to play.

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Did you guys actually – you guys probably didn't watch, did you?

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No.

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Sydney likes award shows so we checked in.

176
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It was all wild.

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It was a tough watch.

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It was a tough watch, but Trav, this is going to sound like I'm making it up,

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,000
but in the interstitial before and after commercials, they would point –

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
the celebs that were about to be up for awards were all logged into Zoom, right?

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Sure.

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And they would point – basically point their screens at one another

183
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and encourage them to make fun small talk.

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So I got to watch Bob Odenkirk trying to lure Al Pacino out of his trance

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and lure him into some light conversation as the announcer was like,

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
what's up? We've got another award.

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And it was all, I mean, really –

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It was really, really difficult.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Jason Bateman was there with his kids and I was like,

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
he shouldn't be exposed to this environment.

191
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
None of them should be.

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Were any of them playing Fortnite while receiving their awards

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and telling people to smash that like and subscribe button?

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Jason Sudeikis was essentially doing that.

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah, it was basically mid-kill streak, I think.

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Nice.

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Anyway, can we –

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I just want to say in a serious note, it's been like a while

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
since we've been able to record one because of Earth.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And I just want to say it's a genuine pleasure

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and I'm thrilled to be here with you.

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And I won't let Travis post up anymore.

203
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Fucking dookie.

204
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
All gold.

205
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
All right.

206
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
550.

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, a special one.

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We've got a lot planned.

209
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm a big fan of Formula 1

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and a lot of the teams are doing raffles

211
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
during the preseason period this spring.

212
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The prizes are mostly things like merch

213
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and invites to a virtual car launch event.

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And some are offering virtual meet and greets with the drivers.

215
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The issue is why I love a signed team hat.

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The idea of winning a video call with a Formula 1 driver

217
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
fills me with terror.

218
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm trying to mentally prepare just in case

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
but I'm drawing a blank.

220
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What are some cool things to say when you're talking

221
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
to a race car driver over Zoom?

222
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's from Inane in the pit lane.

223
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I tell you what.

224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Call Inane.

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Got pit lane.

226
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Do you think that the best sort of telecommuting,

227
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
telework solution for a Formula 1 driver is Zoom?

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Do you think they feel very comfortable?

229
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh, I see.

230
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
They're like, oh, this is the sound of my good, fast car goes.

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Zoom, Zoom.

232
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Zoom, I love it.

233
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm very comfortable.

234
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Hey, I can tell you're uncomfortable talking to me,

235
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
at Champson, talking to me over Zoom.

236
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But let me tell you, I feel very comfortable

237
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
because the name of this application is the sound

238
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
of my car go.

239
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Zoom, Zoom.

240
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Thank you.

241
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I think we can all agree the first question is, of course,

242
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
how fast have you gone, right?

243
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah, what's the fastest you get?

244
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Because I think that they'd be excited to, one,

245
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
have a nice softball.

246
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But if they're not excited to talk about how fast they've gone,

247
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
why are they in Formula 1?

248
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Can you get the fake back of a car, like, rear windshield

249
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
driving background that they used to use for, like,

250
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Toontz's The Driving Cat as your rear zoom?

251
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Can you make that happen just to make the race car driver

252
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
feel comfortable?

253
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, and then have them be, like, your driver.

254
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So, like, you're sitting in the back seat and just turning

255
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
into a conversation where you're like, hey, could you slow

256
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
down a little bit?

257
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You're going very, very fast.

258
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, you just took that turn pretty quick.

259
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And I asked you to go to Whole Foods.

260
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No, I said take a right.

261
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
No, only left here.

262
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Actually, I think Formula 1 courses, they zigzag all over.

263
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
They don't do just a big circle.

264
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Really?

265
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's too exciting for me.

266
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I think so, yeah.

267
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I think that the how fast you go question doesn't really

268
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
have legs or wheels in this case.

269
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
If you want, try bouncing that off me.

270
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll be Chet Chamsom, beloved Formula 1 racer.

271
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So how fast have you gone?

272
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Ha ha ha!

273
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
200.

274
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
1 miles per hour?

275
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yep.

276
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Well, we do kilometers, don't we?

277
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Pretty European Formula 1.

278
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Ooh.

279
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What's that translate to in miles?

280
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No one knows.

281
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh, okay.

282
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, sorry, my dog just came in the room.

283
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Hey, buddy, what's up?

284
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let me see those precious toe beans.

285
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
These are his toe beans.

286
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Oh, honey.

287
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
His name is Chet Chamsom the dog.

288
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I named him after you.

289
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I hate that.

290
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Hey, can I say that actually felt a lot more,

291
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I was going to try to illustrate like that's a bad topic

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
of conversation because it doesn't really go anywhere

293
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
from there, but Travis, you are a fucking born

294
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
conversationalist.

295
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Thank you very much.

296
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Even when I was trying to fucking stump you,

297
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
you made me feel so comfortable and involved.

298
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
How did you feel when the dog came in?

299
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I loved that.

300
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's not real, but I couldn't, yeah, I could envision

301
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
the precious toppers, toe beans.

302
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Actually, if I can admit this, when Travis says

303
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
his dog came in, I thought that his dog came in.

304
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Thank you.

305
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He was like so deeply inhabiting the role.

306
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Well, I've actually been training my dogs to come over

307
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
when I'm on Zoom calls because it makes everybody

308
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
so happy.

309
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I give them little pieces of bacon and they come over

310
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and everyone's like, oh, doggo.

311
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And they get really excited.

312
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I didn't even have dogs before the pandemic.

313
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I bought them specifically for Zoom calls to make

314
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
people happy.

315
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And you know what?

316
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
When the pandemic's gone, I'm going to sell them.

317
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Sell these dogs.

318
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah, and you get a little bit of sweat equity there.

319
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The dogs have gotten bigger.

320
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah, they got bigger and I trained them.

321
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Right?

322
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah.

323
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I think that if you get on a call with this stranger

324
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and you say, hey, thanks for taking the time to talk

325
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
to me today, but I really just want a hat.

326
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Can you send me a hat and we don't have to talk?

327
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And the stranger goes, absolutely.

328
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And then you can hang up the phone.

329
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I will say this, I can think of almost no Zooms I've

330
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
been on in the last year where if someone said,

331
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Justin, you can hang up right now if you promise to

332
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
send me some kind of hat.

333
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Absolutely.

334
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Done.

335
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm already closing the screen.

336
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Hey, Chet Jamson, in all your 50 years of racing,

337
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
what was the best fan interaction you ever had?

338
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh, man, let me tell you.

339
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
One time this guy let me get off a Zoom call super quick.

340
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It was amazing.

341
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I named my son after him and I didn't know his name,

342
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
though, so I just called him Hang Up Guy.

343
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This is my son, Hang Up Guy Chamsun.

344
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Happiest I've ever been.

345
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Better than any race I've ever won was that time.

346
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It was the fastest Zoom call I've ever been on.

347
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And you know me, I love speed.

348
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I crave it.

349
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I was in the middle of watching the season finale,

350
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Ozark.

351
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I was like, hell yeah, get right back into Ozark.

352
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
See how Jason and the kids are going to get out of this one.

353
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Zoom Zoom, that's the sound a car makes.

354
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I went ahead and knocked over a Lids

355
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
so I could have more get out of call free tickets.

356
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And now I'm in prison and it was worth it.

357
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It was worth it to get off that Zoom call,

358
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
no questions asked.

359
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And I've knocked over the Lids

360
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and they fucking caught me while I was driving away.

361
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Can you believe that?

362
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The irony.

363
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The irony.

364
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Chet Jamson.

365
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Do you all want a Yahoo?

366
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah, I'd love that.

367
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
This one is sent in by Casey.

368
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Thanks, Casey.

369
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's a Yahoo Answers user, Bush, who asks,

370
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
my grandkids want to start a detective agency.

371
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yes, nice.

372
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Should I start staging crimes for them to solve?

373
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm worried about them actually solving it

374
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and figuring out it was me.

375
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Well, yeah.

376
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I mean, the latter worry is a strange worry

377
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
unless the crimes you were attempting to do

378
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
was like manslaughter.

379
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
No, but here's the thing.

380
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Even if it's like, oh, you know,

381
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Bugsy stole the fucking class pet or whatever.

382
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
If you figure out that's your grandpa,

383
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I mean, after two of those,

384
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
even if it's just pretty money,

385
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
it's always grandpa.

386
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You're like, fucking grandpa.

387
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Like, are you okay, dude?

388
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Like, you stole the class pet

389
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and then you stole that little kid's prize marble shooter

390
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
or whatever.

391
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Like, what are you doing, grandpa?

392
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Well, Trav, did you ever watch The Sherlock Show

393
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
with Ben and Bic?

394
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Elementary?

395
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah, right?

396
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
No, the other one.

397
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That one had-

398
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Oh, the one where Sherlock Holmes woke up

399
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and it was like modern day San Francisco.

400
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
No, that's still elementary.

401
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
This one had been a kid.

402
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah.

403
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The Hobbit.

404
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The Hobbit.

405
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And it was just Sherlock.

406
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It was just right down the middle of Sherlock.

407
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
There wasn't like a special thing about it.

408
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It was just straight over the plate Sherlock.

409
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Do you remember that one?

410
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah.

411
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Well, in that one-

412
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
A little bit.

413
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
In every case, they'd be like,

414
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
oh, the mummy did come back from the dead

415
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and is killing all the people at the museum

416
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
or the people at the circus have been also killing people.

417
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But at the end of each one, it turns out it was Moriarty.

418
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And then at the end of the first season, Moriarty dies.

419
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Whoa.

420
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And you say, whoa, hold on a minute.

421
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Now who's going to do the crimes?

422
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And sure enough, the next season,

423
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
there's a big crime that happens

424
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
where one of the guys, his wife does it.

425
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And you're like, whoa, what?

426
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But then you're like, you find out later,

427
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
it was still Moriarty.

428
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Do you see where I'm going with this?

429
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Is the grandpa Moriarty in this?

430
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Well, yeah, that's what I'm saying

431
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
is that you steal the lunch money

432
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and they find out, oh, it was grandpa.

433
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And grandpa said, I did that as a test for you.

434
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And then the next thing is the class pet goes missing

435
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and everybody thinks it's Bugsy,

436
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
but it turns out it's the grandpa.

437
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And they say, well, now we know

438
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
that grandpa's doing all the crimes.

439
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So grandpa fakes his own murder.

440
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Okay.

441
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But it turns out it was a plot by grandpa,

442
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
but at that point, grandpa is no longer with us.

443
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And then another crime happens and the kids go,

444
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
well, it can't possibly be grandpa.

445
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
He's dead as hell.

446
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But somehow it's still grandpa.

447
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Do you know what I mean?

448
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah.

449
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The only way to get the kids off your case is to be dead.

450
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Well, yes, I mean, obviously Griffin, that's 101.

451
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Can I just say that my favorite part about this question

452
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
is if you read between the lines a little bit,

453
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
that grandpa is worried that the kids will solve it,

454
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
but not sure they will.

455
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So the grandpa does think one of two things.

456
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
One, that these kids are wicked stupid.

457
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Or two, that grandpa might secretly turn out

458
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
to be a master criminal and create an unsolvable mystery.

459
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Right, yeah.

460
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah.

461
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You know, we were talking about Sherlock.

462
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
There's something wild about that is Elementary.

463
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Remember that show?

464
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
We were talking about Elementary.

465
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah.

466
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yeah, I like it.

467
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Well, Justin, you were talking about Elementary, but go on.

468
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah, but I want to talk more about Elementary.

469
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Never watched a single episode of it.

470
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Ran for seven years.

471
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah.

472
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Ended in 2019, which explains why I haven't heard a lot about it lately.

473
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah.

474
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But this is the thing I wanted to say.

475
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
There's 154 episodes of this show.

476
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Okay, syndication right there, baby.

477
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah, Johnny Lee Miller is, of course,

478
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
is now the actor who's played Sherlock Holmes the most times

479
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
because there's so many episodes of it, okay?

480
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Right.

481
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
There's 154 episodes of the show.

482
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
There's got to be one that centers on pro gamers, right?

483
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Okay.

484
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
There's got to be one episode where Sherlock's like,

485
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
this is the gamers.

486
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
The gamers evolved.

487
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Okay.

488
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's got to be his mouse cord that did the motors.

489
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Right.

490
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
There's got to be one Elementary episode that's centered on pro gamers.

491
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Right.

492
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So there's a bit where Lucy Liu has a Google Cardboard headset strapped to her face,

493
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and she looks up at Sherlock,

494
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
but she's obviously still seeing the game world in her headset,

495
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
and she says, so if you die in the game, and he says,

496
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
then yes, you die in real life, love.

497
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Hey, real quick.

498
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Trav, can you help us build this incredible episode of Elementary?

499
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
No, I understand.

500
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I just want to read a paragraph here from The Return of Sherlock Holmes,

501
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
a 1987 television movie.

502
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Okay.

503
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Following those instructions, Jane Watson finds a hidden basement

504
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
containing a primitive cryogenic capsule with a man lying inside,

505
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
whom she thaws.

506
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The man inside the capsule turns out to be her ancestor's friend and partner,

507
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
the legendary Sherlock Holmes himself.

508
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Cool.

509
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Cool, man.

510
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That sounds pretty good.

511
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Hey, I have an exciting new segment.

512
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Okay.

513
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Oh?

514
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And I sneak previewed this to Travis,

515
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
but I am so excited to get started here.

516
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I was cruising the web recently.

517
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Like you do.

518
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And I was so excited to find out that there is a company

519
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
that makes these decks of cards that you can use for podcasting,

520
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and it's to help you do a good podcast.

521
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Thank you, finally.

522
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I know, and I was like, finally it's time to step up our game.

523
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You know, we're pros.

524
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
We wrote the book on podcasting.

525
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It could always be better.

526
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You know what I mean?

527
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That's what we should have called our book.

528
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It could always be better.

529
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Each of you is going to get a card, and I'm going to let you choose.

530
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I have five different decks of these fuckers here,

531
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
but we're going to talk about you're each going to get to pick one.

532
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Travis, would you like a card from the interview deck,

533
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
the would you rather deck, or the what the heck deck?

534
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Oh, would you rather.

535
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Don't you dare take what the heck.

536
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I have called dibsies.

537
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Okay, Travis, I'm going to select a card at random from the would you rather deck.

538
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Finally, this podcast is going places.

539
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
This is good, man.

540
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
We don't even have to think with our fucking forebrains anymore.

541
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
We can just slip slide into that.

542
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's all instinct now, right?

543
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's just instinct.

544
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
All right, Travis, would you rather –

545
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
God, I hope it's dirty.

546
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Would you rather have to grow, hunt, and kill your own food,

547
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
or eat only Taco Bell for a year?

548
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
This is terrible.

549
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
That is fucking terrible.

550
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I mean –

551
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
No, really think about it, Travis.

552
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You are an impulsive person.

553
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I need you to really go through it.

554
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Grow, hunt, and kill?

555
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yeah, I mean, you could hunt a chicken and then eat it while it's still alive.

556
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That seems a little brutal.

557
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Or eat Taco Bell for a year.

558
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
What wildly different options.

559
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah, that's kind of what makes it fun, you putz.

560
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Well, no, Justin.

561
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Typically, in a would you rather, they don't pair up a really, really rough option with an incredible windfall,

562
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
with an incredible blessing.

563
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah, I've never eaten Taco Bell for two successive meals.

564
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yeah, but if I eat Taco Bell every day for a year, you know what?

565
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

566
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Every month.

567
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Every meal.

568
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Yeah.

569
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Sorry.

570
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Every meal.

571
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Sure, sure, sure.

572
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But what I'm saying is, you know what I am now, Justin?

573
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Fucking internet famous.

574
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I've made a documentary that's called Live Moss.

575
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Live Moss, you are dying.

576
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Live Moss, E-minus.

577
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And it's like, okay, now, who knows?

578
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Now maybe I'm rich.

579
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I've got an endorsement deal from Taco Bell.

580
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Or the other option, do a lot of fucking work.

581
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Yeah, there's a lot on the Taco Bell menu.

582
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And we make a lot of jokes, but Taco Bell is delicious.

583
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You could rotate through the menu in a way that you could sustain your body and keep it alive.

584
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Especially now that Papa Fritz is back.

585
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yeah.

586
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
All right, Griffin, so did you want something from the-

587
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I want something from-

588
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
What the heck?

589
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
What the heck?

590
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Just say what the fuck.

591
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
No, you don't get it, man.

592
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Okay.

593
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah, you don't get it, man.

594
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It's a what the heck deck.

595
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It sounds better.

596
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
What the tech deck?

597
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Griffin, what slogan or jingle got stuck in your head forever?

598
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Oh, man.

599
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Forever.

600
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
There's a lawyer in town.

601
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And I am not familiar with the type of work that he and his firm does.

602
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But I do know that he spent several hundred thousand dollars commissioning a song for his little firm.

603
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And the song, if I may sing a few bars, it goes,

604
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:43,000
FUNK and Associates! FUNK and Associates! FUNK and Associates! Call FUNK and Associates!

605
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So it's FUNK and Associates.

606
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's pretty good.

607
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And it's good.

608
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And what I love about it is Dr. FUNK, or whatever his name is, the lawyer-

609
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Probably FUNK Esquire.

610
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Dr. FUNK Esquire, the lawyer, had a really easy bridge to cross there to have a funky song.

611
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But he didn't go that way with it.

612
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
He went in a much more earnest FUNK and Associates.

613
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It could have gone, we want the FUNK and Associates.

614
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Or it could have just been like, call me.

615
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Like literally, it didn't have to be this song that goes as hard.

616
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I lose track of time when I'm hearing it because I'm having such a good time.

617
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I could swear it's like a five minute long commercial.

618
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
That's great, Griffin.

619
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Justin, do you want to do one for yourself?

620
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'll ask myself something from the interview deck.

621
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Since it's the other one I have opened here.

622
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
That would be a fun podcast, by the way, if anyone wants to steal this.

623
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Would you just interview yourself every week?

624
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yeah.

625
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Let's see how this one goes.

626
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I picked a card at random.

627
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm not even going to look at it.

628
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm going to read it blind.

629
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It just says, how big is it?

630
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
How big is it, that ding dong, though?

631
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
How much would someone have to pay for your little toe?

632
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I don't want to answer that.

633
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
No, tell me.

634
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You have to.

635
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Because then you'll start getting fucking Venmo requests.

636
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Yeah, exactly.

637
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I don't need that.

638
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
What's something I would never guess about you, Justin?

639
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Justin, nobody knows me better than you.

640
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I think that that would be a pretty tough one to answer because you know me better than I know myself.

641
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Right.

642
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
What is something that people are obsessed with but you just don't get the point of?

643
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Oh, nice.

644
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Hot takes.

645
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Do something about like Sports Bowl.

646
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Or like Game of Thrones.

647
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Is that still wildly popular?

648
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
That could be good.

649
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Do you have any opinions on Lost you want to share, Justin?

650
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
If you were stranded on a desert island and you could choose one person to keep you company, who would it be?

651
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Just draw from the what the heck deck, man.

652
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Yeah, you're right.

653
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I'm clowning on myself.

654
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I need to just get into the what the heck deck.

655
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Here we go.

656
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What the heck?

657
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
This one is...

658
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I haven't gotten it out yet, but I bet this one's going to be something else.

659
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
If you could bring one famous person back from the dead, who would you pick?

660
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
What?

661
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yeah, what the heck, man?

662
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
What the heck?

663
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Princess Diana maybe?

664
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Travis, you're not...

665
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Sorry.

666
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Sorry, I know it's not my question.

667
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Sorry.

668
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You already had yours.

669
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
This is my question.

670
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I did not realize what you just did.

671
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
If Justin says anyone other than Princess Diana, he's going to seem like a real jagoff.

672
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Okay, well, if Justin could think of somebody who died before their time, was super beloved...

673
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yeah, he's going to say anyone but anybody else and people will be like,

674
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
man, I guess Justin really doesn't like Princess Diana.

675
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Good job, Trav.

676
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I don't know, Trav.

677
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I guess I was thinking of Martin Luther King.

678
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Oh, okay.

679
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Maybe that's a little bit better than yours, Travis.

680
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It is the classic, would you rather bring back Princess Diana or Martin Luther King.

681
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Or eat Taco Bell.

682
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Or eat Taco Bell every meal for a year.

683
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Or if you could eat Taco Bell with Princess Diana.

684
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Mm-hmm.

685
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Or go hunting with Martin Luther King.

686
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'd bring back Abraham Lincoln so I could beat him at Xbox.

687
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
That would be so good.

688
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
He thinks he's so tall.

689
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
People think he's so cool, but when he's freaking out over airplanes, I'm going to steal his wallet.

690
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Can I just say, to jump back to the Taco Bell conundrum,

691
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I didn't think about the implications of eating Taco Bell for breakfast and the effect of that.

692
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Do they have breakfast food at Taco Bell?

693
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Yeah, you want me to list the entire menu for you?

694
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm just saying if they don't and I have to eat tacos for breakfast,

695
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
it's going to severely impact my ability to get things done.

696
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You know what's awesome is I am looking at the Taco Bell menu website,

697
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and they do have categories like combos, tacos, burritos, nachos, quesadillas, etc.

698
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That's sort of the major food groups.

699
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
But then they also have a little section below that that says,

700
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
can't decide?

701
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Perhaps you're craving something.

702
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And then there's three options, and it says meaty, cheesy, spicy.

703
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So it's like, damn, I don't know what form I want the food to take,

704
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
but I do know what I want it to do to my mouth and taste receptors.

705
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Can I ask you something?

706
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
If Taco Bell introduced a surprise me option, would you take it?

707
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Every day.

708
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Yeah, me too.

709
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I think so.

710
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I think most drive-thru places, if I just saw an option that said surprise me,

711
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I think I'd just take that one.

712
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
If there's an option that says fill a bag of it, Derek,

713
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
and that's only when Derek's working.

714
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
He's got a special promotion called fill a bag of it, Derek.

715
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
For $20 worth, Derek.

716
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
You got your D bucks?

717
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Come on over.

718
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
This is how many things you can get.

719
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Fill it to the top, Derek.

720
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I was going to cloud on these pod decks,

721
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
but this is the name of the people that make them, pod decks.

722
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Talk about conversation, fruitful.

723
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And I treasure it.

724
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Sure, we got there.

725
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Because now I'm just thinking about Derek throwing a bunch of fucking fire sauce

726
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
into a bag, loose.

727
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Yeah, but if it's $20 worth of fire sauce, that's a good deal.

728
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
That's a great deal.

729
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You can resell that for sure.

730
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I hate when they ask me if I want sauce there,

731
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
and there's no chef to consult.

732
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
What's the pairing?

733
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yeah, exactly.

734
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What would you suggest?

735
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
What do I want to drink?

736
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I don't know.

737
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Does Dr. Pepper go with the chalupa?

738
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
We're going to take a quick break,

739
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
and the ad guys are going to come in and do their ads real quick,

740
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and us fun boys will be back right after this.

741
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Hey guys, is it time for me yet?

742
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Not yet.

743
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Okay.

744
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Now it's time for you.

745
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Hold on.

746
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I got to do a bunch of cocaine first.

747
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Okay.

748
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Sorry, who is this character?

749
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Ad man.

750
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Justin, stand back.

751
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Let him do it.

752
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Oh God, he inhaled it through his mouth.

753
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
That's not normally how one does the cocaine.

754
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
No one ever taught me they don't teach this stuff in school, you know.

755
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
They don't.

756
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Squarespace.

757
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Squarespace lets you make a beautiful website

758
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
that showcases your work, sell products, and services of all kinds

759
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and promotes your physical or online business and more.

760
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I don't actually know that Squarespace would love.

761
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
No, I don't think so.

762
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I was just thinking the same thing, Griffin.

763
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Okay, this is normal Griffin.

764
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Uncocained Griffin.

765
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I've not done any drugs.

766
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
This is high on life, walking with Jesus.

767
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
High on life, walking with Jesus.

768
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I mean, I smoked a bunch of pot last night,

769
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
and I drank coffee this morning,

770
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and I took my sort of brain regulators.

771
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Jesus would be okay with all of those.

772
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Jesus is cool with all that stuff.

773
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And so would Squarespace,

774
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
because they have beautiful customizable templates created by world-class designers.

775
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
They got everything optimized for mobile right out of the box

776
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
and analytics that help you grow in real time

777
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
with free and secure hosting and nothing to patch or upgrade.

778
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Hey folks, here's a call to action.

779
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial

780
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and when you're ready to launch,

781
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
use the offer code mybrother to save 10% off your first purchase

782
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
of a website or domain.

783
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Now, here's the Griffin McElroy call to action.

784
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Squarespace has allowed us to get away with so much.

785
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
True.

786
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
If you need to make a website,

787
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
at this point, for the principle of the thing,

788
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
go to squarespace.com slash mybrother.

789
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Even if you don't think, if you've ever thought to yourself,

790
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I wonder what having a website's like.

791
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Go to squarespace.com slash mybrother and use the free trial

792
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and when you're ready to launch,

793
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
use the offer code mybrother to save 10% off your first purchase

794
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
of a website or domain.

795
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Force your boys who have gotten away with murder.

796
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
You may be thinking to yourself,

797
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
my idea for a website is too rowdy for Squarespace.

798
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Apparently not.

799
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And they will not endorse it.

800
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I can guarantee you, from life experience, this is not the case.

801
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I don't know if Squarespace has a front page like Twitch

802
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
or Reddit or something, but if they do,

803
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm thinking the rowdier the better to get up to that front page.

804
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I think so.

805
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I think Squarespace is the cool parent who's like,

806
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
my kids are going to fuck up.

807
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I would rather they do it at the house.

808
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Yep.

809
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Yeah.

810
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
We are safe in this.

811
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Squarespace is going to get us through this bad trip

812
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
and they're going to still pay us at the end of the day.

813
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And that's radical and powerful for us.

814
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So squarespace.com slash mybrother for a free trial.

815
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
When you're ready to launch, use the offer code mybrother

816
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain.

817
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Holy shit.

818
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Hey, you know what?

819
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Dolan out accolades.

820
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Same to you, stamps.com.

821
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Yeah.

822
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It says here in the introduction or thought starter,

823
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
if you guys want to talk about butts or whatever, go for it.

824
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
We're cool.

825
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
We know we can't stop you at this point.

826
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
We lost the email that lets us cancel these ads.

827
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Right.

828
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
There's a two factor sort of code that we have to punch in,

829
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
but we reset our phone and we can't stop the machine at this point.

830
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
But taking trips to the post office isn't how you want to spend your time.

831
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Stamps.com allows you to-

832
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
How do you want to spend your time, Griffin?

833
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Reading this incredible ad copy.

834
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Because they allow you to mail and ship anytime, anywhere,

835
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
right from your computer.

836
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You can send letters, ship packages, and pay a lot less

837
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
with discounted rates from USPS, UPS, and more.

838
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I was trying to set it up that we could say something ribbled or blue there.

839
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Well, I do still want to promote the business.

840
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Because if you're a small office that's sending out invoices

841
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
or an online seller shipping out orders,

842
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
or even a giant warehouse sending thousands of packages a day,

843
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
stamps.com can't handle it all with ease.

844
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You get 40-

845
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I'm photocopying my butt and mailing that to people.

846
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
There it is. They love that, Trav.

847
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
They love it?

848
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Well, you can get discounts up to 40% off post office rates

849
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
and up to 62% off UPS shipping rates.

850
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Oh, man, 40% off my butt is a great deal.

851
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Yeah, it's like a cheek and a fifth.

852
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So stop wasting time going to the post office and go to stamps.com instead.

853
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
There's no risk.

854
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
With our promo code MYBROTHER, you get a special offer

855
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
that includes a four-week trial plus free postage and a digital scale,

856
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
and there's no long-term commitments or contracts.

857
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Just go to stamps.com, click on the microphone at the top of the homepage,

858
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
type in MYBROTHER, that's stamps.com, promo code MYBROTHER, stamps.com.

859
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Never go to the post office again.

860
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Maximum Fun is a network by and for cool, popular people.

861
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But did you know it also has an offering designed to appeal to nerds?

862
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
A show for nerds?

863
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
On Maximum Fun? The devil, you say.

864
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
It's true! It's called The Greatest Generation.

865
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And they review episodes of a television program for nerds called Star Trek.

866
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
They've reviewed TNG, DS9, and are now reviewing Voyager.

867
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Hey, Star Trek. My daughter enjoys that program.

868
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Well, if she enjoys that and she enjoys humor of the flatulent variety,

869
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
might I recommend she subscribe to The Greatest Generation?

870
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Hey, are you calling my kid a nerd?

871
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Why, I ought to...

872
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Well, gotta go!

873

Become a friend to DeSoto by subscribing to The Greatest Generation on MaximumFun.org today!

874
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Okay, all right.

875
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah.

876
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I want a munch.

877
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Squad! Squad!

878
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I want too much.

879
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Squad?

880
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
We've already talked about Taco Bell so much.

881
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It almost counts. We're not gonna talk about Taco Bell, we're gonna talk about Duncan.

882
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Okay.

883
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Real quick note about Taco Bell, though.

884
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
They are testing a crispy chicken sandwich taco,

885
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
which is gonna be a taco with crispy chicken in it.

886
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
There's only one thing that I wanted to point out here.

887
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
It's got premium all-white meat, crispy chicken, marinated in jalapeno buttermilk,

888
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
then seasoned with bold Mexican spices, and roll in the crunchy tortilla chicken.

889
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Sounds very good.

890
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
God, I'm extremely hungry.

891
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I'm just not realizing I would eat 50 of these.

892
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yep.

893
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I just wanted to read this paragraph.

894
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Taco Bell is offering both a regular and spicy sidekick.

895
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Each sandwich is served in a puffy bread.

896
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Hey, thank you, Taco Bell.

897
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Thank you.

898
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,000
This is a huge moment where Taco Bell has finally let go of any illusions

899
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
that they are serving anything that in any way approximates Mexican cuisine.

900
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
They are saying, here's what this is in.

901
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's puffy bread.

902
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
We don't have anything to add to it, okay?

903
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It's just puffy bread.

904
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Can I tell you what I love here?

905
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
This is like if...

906
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Don't get hung up on this, because it seems like a good lunch spot.

907
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I know, I know, I know.

908
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
But we talk about the chicken wars a lot.

909
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And this is like if, like, in World War II, like some other...

910
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Like if, let's see, what's a country I can pull out of my head?

911
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I'm gonna sit here.

912
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
If like, if like Brazil.

913
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Oh, no, Brazil I think was in it.

914
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Who's someone?

915
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Yeah, Travis, go on.

916
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Antarctica.

917
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Yes.

918
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
If someone in Antarctica at a science research facility said,

919
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
you know what, now Antarctica is in the World War II as well,

920
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
and we're a major player.

921
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Which side?

922
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
We don't know yet.

923
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
If somebody wants to court us.

924
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
We are still figuring it out.

925
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm sorry, fellas, I'm sorry.

926
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm looking at a picture of one of these fucking bad boys

927
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
and I would do some...

928
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Yeah, I would house it.

929
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I would do terrible things to get one of these in my mouth right now.

930
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Terrible things.

931
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I need to learn which countries are all involved in World War II.

932
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You very much do.

933
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I can tell you some that definitely were.

934
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Don't get me wrong.

935
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Yeah, the big boys.

936
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It's just that I don't know that I...

937
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Some that definitely were, some that definitely were,

938
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and then there's like a whole kind of mushy gray area

939
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
where maybe they got into it, maybe they didn't.

940
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Yeah, right?

941
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And I don't want to take a sling at those, right?

942
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Because then that's what I'm gonna hear back like,

943
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
oh, no, they did terrible things.

944
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
There's probably some that were on the bad guys side

945
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
that aren't exactly crone about it, right?

946
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Yeah, right?

947
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Maybe you could ask them to their face and be like,

948
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
ah, no, no, no, no.

949
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Hey, was that you?

950
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I don't know.

951
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I'd have to check up on that.

952
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
The same thing's happening in the chicken wars, by the way.

953
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
We're gonna find out 20 years from now.

954
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yes, thank you.

955
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
We understood.

956
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
We know exactly where you were going with that.

957
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Okay.

958
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Burger King, by the way, get in the chicken wars.

959
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I knew it.

960
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
They got a new sandwich they've been working on since 2019.

961
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's got chicken on it.

962
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Probably gone bad by now.

963
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Dunkin' has added avocado toast to the menu, folks.

964
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Huh.

965
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
All right.

966
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah.

967
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Kevin Sorbo thinks about that.

968
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So I get Kevin Sorbo on the phone

969
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
to ask him about the Dunkin' avocado toast.

970
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
What is it?

971
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Dunkin' avocado toast.

972
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
You know what it is.

973
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's a popular pick for breakfast or brunch,

974
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
and now it's available for everyone to enjoy quickly

975
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and conveniently as part of any busy day.

976
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Dunkin's avocado toast features creamy avocado spread

977
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
made with four simple ingredients.

978
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Avocado, balsamic salt,

979
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
black pepper, and lemon juice.

980
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
This smooth combination is, man,

981
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
they really do have eight paragraphs here

982
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
about what avocado toast be.

983
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
This smooth combination is spread out edge to edge

984
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
on Dunkin's authentic toasted sourdough bread.

985
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
This is my favorite part.

986
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Dunkin's authentic toasted sourdough bread

987
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
made from a recipe created especially by Dunkin'.

988
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Okay.

989
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Wait, what?

990
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Hold on.

991
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I thought you were gonna say anything else

992
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
because that is the least surprising thing you can say.

993
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And let me also just throw this out

994
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
to someone who's been making a lot of sourdough bread

995
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
over the last year.

996
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
There's only like four ingredients in there, Dunkin'.

997
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
That's not wildly impressive.

998
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
But it's a recipe created especially by Dunkin'

999
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
using a true sourdough starter for a tangy twist

1000
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
that elevates the avocado toast.

1001
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Okay.

1002
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
You put some old flour water in it.

1003
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
We get it.

1004
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah, that's not necessary.

1005
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
For this one, we have salt.

1006
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Yeah.

1007
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yes.

1008
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Then for an extra dash of flavor,

1009
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
the avocado is topped with everything bagel seasoning,

1010
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
which includes sesame seeds, poppy seeds, onion, and garlic.

1011
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Everything, right?

1012
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Yeah, it's everything bagel seasoning.

1013
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Dunkin's avocado toast is available for $2.99

1014
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
and is served in a special portable box.

1015
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Oh, sorry.

1016
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
It replaces our previous option of a non-portable box

1017
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
made from dark matter.

1018
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
You have to sit here and eat it.

1019
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
We're going to watch you.

1020
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
We're going to watch you.

1021
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It's chained to the table like a 3DS at E3.

1022
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Just sit there and eat it.

1023
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
The shape of the box is non-euclidean.

1024
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Your hand will pass right through the bread.

1025
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
You might not even know it's the box when you see it.

1026
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Dunkin's, this is from Jill Nelson, the veep

1027
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
over at Marketing and Culinary,

1028
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
or Mark Cul, as I call it, at Dunkin.

1029
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Jill says, Dunkin's new avocado toast

1030
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
is the definition of quality.

1031
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Oh.

1032
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Delivered at the speed of Dunkin.

1033
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
We've taken a popular brunch staple

1034
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
and made it accessible for anyone

1035
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
looking for something easy and delicious on the go.

1036
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So this avocado toast is for people

1037
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
that have been hearing a lot about avocado toast

1038
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
and just thinking like, how can I get me some of that?

1039
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Because I cannot piece it together on my own.

1040
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I do like, hey, avocado toast now for everyone.

1041
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Yeah.

1042
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Now you don't have to be some snooty hipster.

1043
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Now even your racist uncle can eat avocado toast.

1044
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Do you think that this marks the end of avocado toast?

1045
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And here's what I mean.

1046
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Not that I think Dunkin's going to ruin it,

1047
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
but now that it's for everyone,

1048
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I, a snooty hipster, am less interested in it.

1049
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Right, now that it's not fun anymore to blame the collapse

1050
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
of the housing market and diamond exchange and-

1051
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Stocks?

1052
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Travel and stocks on this mushed up vegetable?

1053
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Yeah.

1054
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Then it's not, who cares anymore?

1055
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Also, do you think that when avocados came along,

1056
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
the person who had named eggplant before it was like,

1057
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
ah, fuck.

1058
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Fuck me.

1059
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I should have waited.

1060
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I should have waited.

1061
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
That would have been a fucking great name for this thing.

1062
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
This is way better.

1063
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
This is way more like an egg.

1064
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Fuck.

1065
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I'm going to call this, I'm changing this one.

1066
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Guys, these are called sick pumpkins now

1067
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
and eggplant says avocados.

1068
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Here's a question.

1069
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I live on the edge of a forest

1070
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
and there have been cougar sightings in the area recently.

1071
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Cool.

1072
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Ask them out on a date.

1073
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Oh, like the animal.

1074
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Yeah, that's why we, that's the stuff with the intros again.

1075
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Oh, okay.

1076
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Remember, we got to think about-

1077
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Got it, got it, got it.

1078
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I was thinking of cougar as a sexy older lady.

1079
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1080
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Yeah, no, for sure.

1081
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And your response to that was they live in the forest

1082
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
and you should go ask them out on a dinner date.

1083
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Well, why else would you call them cougars

1084
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
if they don't live in the forest?

1085
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Umpire.

1086
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I thought the ball would be lower, which is why I swang lower

1087
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
and I just missed it entirely.

1088
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
That was the situation there.

1089
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Oh, so this is football.

1090
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I clearly was misdirected by the goalie.

1091
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Yeah, the pitcher tricked me

1092
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
because he did his body in a different way

1093
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
than I thought I would hit it pretty hard, actually.

1094
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
So I'm going to, you know what?

1095
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Let me take the double and we'll just call it-

1096
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Don't worry, I can't run.

1097
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I'm not making it the third.

1098
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Yeah.

1099
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
So there's cougars in the forest.

1100
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
You've completely, you've ruined me.

1101
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I want to make sure there are no cougars nearby

1102
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
before I let my dog out in the backyard.

1103
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I have been told the best way to scare them off

1104
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
is to speak loudly as they will not approach humans

1105
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
if they know we're nearby.

1106
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
My question is, what exactly should I say

1107
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
that will deter cougars,

1108
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
but won't make my neighbors think I've lost my mind

1109
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
when I say it loudly alone in my backyard?

1110
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
That's from Matt in Vancouver.

1111
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
He, him.

1112
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Okay, Matt.

1113
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Any cougars out here?

1114
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Okay, cougars, get out.

1115
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I can't think of anything else.

1116
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
This is, this question is going to be a no from me

1117
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
on a couple-

1118
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Just holistically?

1119
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Just holistically for a couple reasons.

1120
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
One, there is nothing you can shout out of your windows

1121
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
that your neighbors will hear and say, oh, it's okay.

1122
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
There's no, you can shout,

1123
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I'm yelling to scare cougars away.

1124
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And then your neighbors will hear like, oh, that's-

1125
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
What if it's just like,

1126
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
soup's on, Hezekiah, come in from the fields.

1127
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But then they're going to know that one, no fields.

1128
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Two, no Hezekiah.

1129
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah.

1130
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
That's a good point though.

1131
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And on the flip side,

1132
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
what if one of the cougars' name's Hezekiah

1133
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
and they hear that and they say,

1134
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
hmm, a good dog treat for me.

1135
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Thug soup, can't wait.

1136
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
What if he just yelled out the window,

1137
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
does anyone want to talk about the latest episode

1138
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
of WandaVision?

1139
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And then people are going to be like,

1140
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
oh, this is nice in the virtual age.

1141
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Someone still wants to talk face to face.

1142
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
But then what if a cougar's watching WandaVision?

1143
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
What if then they are?

1144
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
It's gotta be an important neighborhood announcement.

1145
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Something like, hey, I'm going to be so eliminated tomorrow

1146
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
if anybody wants to get some,

1147
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I'll have it outside my house.

1148
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Get your quarters ready.

1149
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
You might have to follow through on that though.

1150
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Oh, that's a problem.

1151
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Does it have to be talking

1152
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
or will singing also scare the cougars?

1153
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I would think singing would be even more scary.

1154
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Yeah, I would think so too.

1155
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And maybe this is why barbershop quartets are a thing.

1156
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
No, okay.

1157
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
There's no way a barbershop quartet

1158
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
is going to scare away a cougar.

1159
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I mean, I was thinking maybe like metal or like,

1160
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
but if it's a soothing thing,

1161
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
that cougar's going to be like, well, now hold on.

1162
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Well, no, I'm sorry, Travis.

1163
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It's going to be a shitty barbershop quartet.

1164
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Oh, okay.

1165
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It's going to be daily auditions for a barbershop quartet.

1166
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
It's going to sound like complete shit.

1167
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Oh, like it's going to be like four tenors.

1168
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
You know what I mean?

1169
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
It's going to be like four tenors

1170
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
who are all coming like, moon over Parma.

1171
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And everyone's like, no, I'm going to do that one.

1172
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And it's so discordant.

1173
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Yeah.

1174
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Sorry, I had two reasons.

1175
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
This was the first one.

1176
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And the second one is that there will be no deterring

1177
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
these cougars from eating whatever they damn well feel like.

1178
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
We live close to nature and we have coyotes.

1179
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And that's not a joke.

1180
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
You hear them every night howling,

1181
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
apparently over jubilation,

1182
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
over some poor animal that they have turned into a meal.

1183
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And you hear that enough times and you think,

1184
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I hope these guys don't know how to pick locks.

1185
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Because if that's, there is nothing but a couple skinny locks

1186
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
keeping me from turning into coyote power.

1187
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
This is fair because if a cougar moved into my neighborhood

1188
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
and then left on my porch like a bag of Wendy's, right?

1189
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I wouldn't be like, I don't think this Wendy's is for me.

1190
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And so you moved to the cougar's neighborhood

1191
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
and you left a bag of dog on their front porch.

1192
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Your dog is named Wendy, which is confusing.

1193
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
The cougar is going to assume that dog was brought there

1194
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
as some kind of peace offering from you

1195
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
who moved into their neighborhood.

1196
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
If you want to help protect your dog, Wendy,

1197
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
there is only one thing really that would be useful to yell.

1198
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And it's, hey Wendy, you better get jacked

1199
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
or you're going to get eaten by cougars.

1200
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Wendy, you need to get swole.

1201
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Do some exercises.

1202
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I can't help you.

1203
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Here's your magic knife that's poison to cougars, Wendy.

1204
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Take outside in your teeth.

1205
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Oh yeah, just yell, Wendy, please don't kill another cougar.

1206
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Be careful with it, Wendy, it's double poison to dogs.

1207
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Which is a design flaw, admittedly.

1208
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I'm sorry about the knife.

1209
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
God, cougars are so big.

1210
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
We forget about cougars, don't we?

1211
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I feel like we've almost never talked,

1212
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
at least it's been a few hundred episodes

1213
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
since we talked about how big cougars are.

1214
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
You see lions on TV or whatever and you're like,

1215
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
God, I'm so glad I never have to fuck around

1216
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
with one of those bad boys.

1217
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
But cougars are in our backyard.

1218
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
We're always within screaming distance of a cougar.

1219
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Unless you live in the big city.

1220
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It's a mountain lion, right?

1221
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And it's like somebody named it a mountain lion

1222
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
and someone said, that's too scary.

1223
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I'm going to call it a cougar.

1224
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And it's like, okay, but it's still a lion.

1225
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
That's a lion.

1226
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And it's like, no, no, no, it's not a lion.

1227
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
It's a cougar.

1228
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Hey, can I do another question?

1229
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Yeah, I love that.

1230
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Here's a quick Yahoo that was sent in by Amy.

1231
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Thanks, Amy.

1232
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user

1233
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
who I'm going to name Bianca asks,

1234
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
why did it take so long to invent vape pens?

1235
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Come on, I could imagine them being invented

1236
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
at least in the late eighties.

1237
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Huh.

1238
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
There's some Monday morning vape inventing going on here.

1239
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
No, but I like this idea because there are many things

1240
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
that I can imagine being invented way earlier than they were.

1241
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Right.

1242
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
You know?

1243
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Yeah.

1244
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Like cars?

1245
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Why did it take us so long to figure those out?

1246
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I can imagine those being invented in like 1500.

1247
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Yeah, we have wheels and boxes.

1248
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
So can't believe it took us that long

1249
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
to sort of squish those two concepts together.

1250
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Now, okay, okay, wait, wait.

1251
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
To Bianca's point, the eighties,

1252
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
what do we know about the eighties?

1253
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
They were wild.

1254
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I love them.

1255
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I love the eighties.

1256
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Vaporwave was the thing.

1257
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
It's right there.

1258
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I don't necessarily know that the vaporwave aesthetic

1259
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
really peaked in the eighties or even existed in the eighties.

1260
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Okay.

1261
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I know what you're saying.

1262
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
If they could have figured out a way to vape cocaine,

1263
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I think it probably would have happened in the eighties.

1264
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
They probably would have gotten that done.

1265
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I think we were clearly smoking

1266
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
and there was lots of digital technology at that time.

1267
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Yeah.

1268
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Cell phones, pagers.

1269
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Car phones.

1270
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Car phones.

1271
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And I can't believe somebody wasn't like smoking

1272
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
while using their car phone and thinking like,

1273
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
what if the car phone was the smoking?

1274
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
You know what I mean?

1275
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Which is basically what a vape is.

1276
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Imagine if we could have watched Zach Morris vape

1277
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
in Saved by the Bell.

1278
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
If they had invented it in the eighties,

1279
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
we would have had it by the nineties.

1280
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
There would have been Ninja Turtle episodes

1281
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
about how bad or cool it was.

1282
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I'm not sure.

1283
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Yeah.

1284
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
These new truth ads where they show the children

1285
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
and they're battling big dragons made out of scrap metal

1286
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
and it's like, this is vaping.

1287
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Hey guys, could you have made it look a little less radical?

1288
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Yeah.

1289
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Like there's some part, there's got to be some kids out there

1290
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
who are like, I would love to go on an adventure

1291
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
fighting a big metal dragon.

1292
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Hi, I've got a new pitch for a new truth ad.

1293
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
It's going to be some Fortnite characters vaping.

1294
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
But who's that?

1295
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
It's a cool youth pastor who shows up

1296
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
and tells them that vaping is bad

1297
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
and then they all eat some apples together.

1298
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Yeah.

1299
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
They go and play laser tag with Spider-Man

1300
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
and it's like, is this more vaping or not good?

1301
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And it's like, but be careful because vaping makes you lose.

1302
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Okay.

1303
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
But it still seems like we had a lot of fun along the way.

1304
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And now they're vaping corn dogs.

1305
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Wait, what?

1306
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Do you know the truth?

1307
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
The real vaping was the laser tag

1308
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
we played along the way with Spider-Man.

1309
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Remember kids, only cool kids vape.

1310
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
But then they do maybe later regret it.

1311
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
All right, Spider-Man out.

1312
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Hey.

1313
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
But maybe they don't.

1314
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I don't know.

1315
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
The science is an M, goodbye.

1316
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
And red wine's good for your heart.

1317
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Or maybe it's not.

1318
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Bye.

1319
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Wait, hey, the Spider-Man message is getting a little muddy

1320
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
with the red wine stuff.

1321
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Did we cut that?

1322
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
No, that was in Spider-Man's contract.

1323
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
He feels very passionately about the red wine thing.

1324
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
When we went on a great adventure to battle the space monster,

1325
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Thanos, that's a lot like vaping.

1326
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Now we won, but maybe you won't.

1327
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
But you're going to have a lot of stories to tell, won't you?

1328
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Science is out, folks.

1329
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Listen, I got to go.

1330
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Don't call me again.

1331
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'm really busy.

1332
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Is it better than smoking?

1333
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Who the fuck knows?

1334
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Is it better than smoking?

1335
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Probably.

1336
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Is it better than breathing?

1337
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Absolutely.

1338
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
You know, when my friend the Hulk wants to chill out, he vapes.

1339
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
There it is, Hulk vape.

1340
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I vape.

1341
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
We all vape.

1342
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
But we are metahumans.

1343
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Would it affect you the same way?

1344
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I don't know.

1345
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
The science isn't in yet.

1346
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Reed is working on it.

1347
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Yes, Dr. Reed Richards is working on the effects of vaping.

1348
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Are there more important things he could be working on?

1349
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
We don't know.

1350
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
We don't actually know, because it could be so bad.

1351
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,000
But also, what a lot of people won't tell you and your mom won't tell you is it could be good.

1352
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
The science isn't in yet.

1353
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
This is my new character, Rip.

1354
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And he vaped a radioactive vape.

1355
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
And now he has super vape powers.

1356
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And we don't know if this is incur- is he a villain?

1357
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Is he a good guy?

1358
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
We don't know yet.

1359
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:30,000
All I know is that when I got bit by that big magic spider, it made all the vape damage to my lungs instantly go away in a second.

1360
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
So there's a way out.

1361
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
There's a way out of this.

1362
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Don't let the doctors tell you there's no cure.

1363
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
There is.

1364
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
There is.

1365
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Big magic tarantula.

1366
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Hey folks, thank you so much for listening to our program.

1367
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
We very much appreciate you.

1368
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And we love you and we're so happy that you have us here with you.

1369
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
We have a lot of stuff going on.

1370
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
We had to postpone the Adventure Zone live show.

1371
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:01,000
That will be an interactive installment in our Honey Heist series.

1372
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
That so far has only been one episode, but it's going to be fun.

1373
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
We're doing choose your own adventure stuff.

1374
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
We got Eirika Ishii that's going to be on it with us.

1375
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
And we had to postpone that.

1376
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Now it's March 5th, this Friday at 9 p.m. eastern time.

1377
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And you can still get tickets for 10 bucks at live.themacroy.family.

1378
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Or if you already purchased tickets, obviously those are still good.

1379
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
And if you can't make the show and need a refund for whatever reason,

1380
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
that's at bit.ly slash Taz Refunds.

1381
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It will be available video on demand.

1382
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Of course you'll miss out on the interactive part, but it'll still be there.

1383
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Speaking of interactive, just real quick.

1384
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Want to mention I started a Twitch channel.

1385
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I'm trying to do it.

1386
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Oh my gosh.

1387
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Trying to do it regularly.

1388
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Twitch.tv slash the Travis Macroy.

1389
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Well, I'll have to tune into that.

1390
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
See if you got what it takes.

1391
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I think I do.

1392
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I know a lot about Twitch.

1393
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I've been playing some fun games.

1394
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
We got a new pin of the month.

1395
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
It's sausage to me, which is a fun German phrase.

1396
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
And we talked about it on Shwanners.

1397
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
And that benefits Feeding Texas, which is the largest hunger relief organization in Texas.

1398
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Currently their network is supporting warming shelters for the unhoused,

1399
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
as well as those without power and water,

1400
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
in addition to replacing perished food and feeding Texans in need.

1401
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
So go check that out.

1402
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
We got an empty bullpen designed by Samuel Reardon.

1403
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And a 20 big dog run pin designed by Mel Westphal.

1404
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000

1418

Thank you, Amy.

1420
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user PandoraX, who asks,

1421
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Alcohol, can he go on a pizza?

1422
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,000
My name is Justin McElroy.

I'm Travis McElroy.

1424
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1425
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
This has been My Brother, My Brother.

1426
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
May you kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1427
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Okay, that was the show.

1428
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Hope you had some fun.

1429
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Talked for an hour and now our job is done.

1430
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Go back into the world, face the day ahead.

1431
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Please don't tell our grandparents all the cuss words we said.
