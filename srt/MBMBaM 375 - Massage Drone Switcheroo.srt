1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,680
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,920
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother,

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,120
Travis McElroy. Thank you all for joining us. I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30

8
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,200
media luminary, Griffin McElroy. Griffin, you brought us here to-

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,520
I want to thank you all for joining me here. I want to thank the press. I want to thank my-

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,840
We never use the press room here at My Brother, My Brother and Me HQ.

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,080
We've had one for years. This is our first proper press conference. I'm so glad that my family is

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,240
supporting me through this difficult time as I make these trying announcements to you.

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,880
And I ask for your patience, I ask for God. I ask for God's bliss and-

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,800
You ask for God? Just like give him to you? This is a press conference and I don't think

15
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,880
there's so much of a back and forth at the press conference until we get to the proper Q&A segment.

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,000
I was gonna say I'm pretty sure that's what a press conference is, but go on.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,240
Well, okay. It's not so much a conversation. It's me talking about- I need God's help on this one

18
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,400
and my family. I love them and they love me and support me through this announcement that I have

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:55,200
to make these trying times is that I have decided today I think I'm just probably not going to end

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,360
up taking- have taken a shower. I think- I think by the clock will roll over and it's going to be

21
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,600
October 9th and on October 8th when I look back in my diary and I have the usual section in the diary

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,240
it says shower time. That won't exist. There won't be an entry for that and it's a difficult

23
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,520
decision that I've made and it's 7- it's 7 30 central time right now while we're recording this

24
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,480
and I could- I could ostensibly take one after the recording but then a night shower just doesn't

25
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,760
make any sense in my life right now. And have there been times today where I could have taken

26
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,120
a shower instead of playing Star of the Valley? The answer to that is of course yes, but it's just-

27
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,360
Are you ready to open it up to questions please?

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,560
I want to thank my family and God one more time because I think that's important because I'll

29
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,120
need both their help to get through this one I think and I- I- it's just- I've just- I- it's-

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,840
and it's not like I've been sitting around all day. I've been out in the hot sun. There's been

31
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,600
a little bit of sweat. I did go to the farmers market. I did go to an open house. There is a-

32
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,840
there's this- there's a- an aroma but I- it's just today's a stink boy day. No showers today for me

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,800
and thanks to God and family. Travis you- I believe you had a question. We'll open up the Q&A now.

34
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,000
I do have a question. Well first I want to say thank you so much for having us.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,600
Well thank you and God.

36
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:15,680
And God and family and I also want to say it- it feels weird to go first episode to

37
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,200
375 episodes and still talking about your showering habits.

38
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,040
Or lack thereof. I hate to interrupt.

39
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,520
Yes thank you.

40
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,840
So here's my question. Do you normally shower every day?

41
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:35,120
That's an excellent question Travis. Yes I do. I honor my body with the wet room is what I call

42
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,160
it sometimes. The small- or the small wet room and I'll get in there and lather up with my soaps and

43
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,960
my oils and I do try to get clean every single day Travis because-

44
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,600
Every day.

45
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,680
Yeah I think it's- it's just a nice little bookend to either the morning or the afternoon as the case

46
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,680
may be. Probably not the evening because it is evening time and I will not be taking a shower

47
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,720
after the recording but yeah I do- I do typically try to keep my- my situation squeaky as- as- as

48
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,640
the case may be. Thank you very much for your question and God. Anybody else?

49
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,560
Excuse me Griffin.

50
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,840
Yeah Justin McElroy please.

51
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Are you reaching this decision just now or did you have a moment where you were like I should

52
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,040
get in the shower and didn't? Did you cross a barrier at some point from which there was no

53
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,360
return?

54
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,160
So there was a moment yes Rachel took the baby and they did go to Target to shop for various sundries

55
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,440
and I did- I did stay home and I had the thought in my mind this would be a good opportunity for

56
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:39,280
me to go get in the small wet room uninterrupted by baby cries or any- any sort of other situation

57
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,080
that may need and so I made the decision in that moment that I was instead going to- I had a crop-

58
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,920
a big crop of cranberries come in on Stardew Valley and so I did decide that I'm just going

59
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,880
to sort of plop right down on the couch and I- I had the thought in my mind this is a lie

60
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,840
but I had the thought in my mind is I'll- I'll harvest these cranberries go sell them maybe pop

61
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,440
in the mine for a second give some gifts to my you know my beloveds and then I'll go get in the

62
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,280
shower but then I saw the- the Honda drive back into the part- into the driveway and I knew like

63
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,400
that that was never going to be a part of the plan and so I do want to apologize to my family

64
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,080
and the lord for that one because I knew-

65
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,320
I'm getting some reports that when your wife did return in the Honda the- upon entering the house

66
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,400
she said the stink is still here you swore it was- excuse me this is my question sorry I'm

67
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,400
reading this quote verbatim this quote is from God this quote God handed me this quote from your

68
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,240
bride and it says the stink the stink is still here you swore you would not be the stink man upon

69
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:53,680
my return and yet here the stink lies surrounding you like a tapestry lies and stink both drape you

70
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,160
like a uh it says here a dirty rug yeah I'm not sure that must be a little bit of um

71
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,760
illustrative sort of language and it hurt but it did hurt it hurt it hurt but I knew that the hurt

72
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,760
was my own and that I caused it and I forced it to happen I- I knew the moment she did walk in

73
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,400
and um her and the child the baby both looked at the gym shorts I had been wearing all day and sort

74
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,440
of looked upon them with disgust and I knew in that moment that uh mistakes had been made mistakes

75
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,120
have been made we can't go out there and perform 100 every single time sometimes Stardew Valley

76
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,960
just came out and I'm want to get my cranberries going um so another question sorry one question

77
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,600
over here over here let's get the let's get the follow-up from Justin and then we'll hop on over

78
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,080
to Travis and Justin are you uh at this point are you able to play Stardew Valley without a guide

79
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,000
because that kind of put me off when I was playing it the first time I mean I always felt like I was

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,640
yeah I know all the crop rotations and everything thank you I know the profit ladders and uh the

81
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,840
statistics and uh thank you very much I and it is because of that dedication to my craft that

82
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,440
kept me from the wet room Travis go ahead with your question please uh thank you very much

83
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,920
Travis McElroy Godtimes um just a quick question are you worried that this breaking of your small

84
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:19,680
wet room pattern will lead to further not using the small wet room in the future well and I'm so

85
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,120
glad that you've asked this Travis because I'm looking at my calendar tomorrow is Columbus Day

86
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,880
which is traditionally stink boy holiday where all the stink boys gather and celebrate not having

87
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,040
taken a shower that day now the thought of going two days in a row I would I think I would need to

88
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,280
consult a physician at that point because who knows what sort of bacterium have climbed up

89
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:44,880
into me just because I have stayed out of the wet room that they hate so bad but um I don't I don't

90
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,880
love the way I feel right now I will be completely honest I don't love the way I feel um but follow

91
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,160
up follow up sorry follow up question to that point sir then why not take a fucking shower

92
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:04,800
oh sorry I've been doing this press conference so long that my tongue got real dry um it's the it's

93
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,960
the it's it's the principle of the thing and I don't ask you to

94
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,200
understand or respect my decisions but I do expect you to respect them okay family and God uh uh

95
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,480
unrelated uh this weekend I was at Disney World and I saw an old man walking around

96
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,880
without shoes or socks and I just wanted you guys okay so I need you to I need why

97
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,760

98
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,320
I thank you all the thank God thank family it's Justin McElroy uh I was at Epcot uh I think I was

99
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:49,200
near Norway and I saw an old man walking around um and he didn't have shoes on or socks and he

100
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,560
didn't seem shameful uh and he had a t-shirt on I think it was a big dog t-shirt and khaki shorts

101
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,600
and he had no socks or shoes at Disney World that's not what Walt wanted and that's not what

102
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,400
Mickey wants and I'm pretty sure about that um Walt envisioned his uh experimental prototype

103
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,000
City of Tomorrow I don't think or Epcot I don't think that he envisioned old men walking around

104
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,800
without shoes or socks now uh sorry Justin Justin quick question here from Griffin McElroy from

105
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,720
Disney yeah Griffin go ahead from Disney Adventures um it was did you follow this gentleman just to

106
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,800
make sure that he was removed from the park by a big burly security guard who was dressed up

107
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:39,600
like Pete from the Goofiverse yeah Pete came in and had a like comical handcuffs that were still

108
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,960
very much real and he was escorted into uh uh Spaceship Earth where I assume he will be kept

109
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,400
until his death um may I may I press conference status real quick you don't have a question

110
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,760
about the Disney or I don't okay well so you guys go ahead and I repeat he was an old man without

111
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,360
socks or shoes I can't believe you don't have anything for that I'm saying it no it's just

112
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:12,160
very well okay uh run it back okay Travis McElroy uh Goofy Goofy um no paper just Goofy um are you

113
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,640
sure that he was gets the news and he takes it back to Goofy and he tells it to Goofy one-on-one

114
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:24,080
and he has to talk real slow is it possible that this old shoeless man was some sort of new

115
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,440
character or cast member that you weren't aware of are you up to date on all of your Disney movies

120
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,160

121
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:04,480
and his family so his didn't count um I I have to apologize uh to everyone it is with shame

122
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:12,160
that I announce I took two showers today and I'm worried that cosmically I took Griffin's away from

123
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,160
him it's entirely possible it would explain my it would explain my I Griffin McElroy shower boy

124
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,720
time uh express I was I was at a hotel this morning and they didn't have hot water but I

125
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,800
needed to wash my hair so I'm just gonna set my head under it was horrible so when I got home

126
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,600
to my real home where there was hot water I took a second shower and even as I did it I thought

127
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,160
wow I'm enjoying this in a way that only Griffin McElroy normally enjoys his showers

128
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:45,200
and I can I be honest I luxuriated in it I did shampoo conditioner and body wash the trifecta

129
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,520
that you only do when you know you've got time uh and it was great it was amazing

130
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,320
Griffin McElroy shower boy express I just am curious about how you plan on repaying this

131
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,120
to me are we going to set up some sort of schedule where perhaps

132
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,560
I get to take two showers one day and you don't get to take any or what's what's the sort of way

133
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,280
to make this right with thank you so much for asking I would much rather do kind of an installment

134
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,640
plan where each of my showers for like two weeks is one minute shorter um and each of yours is one

135
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,320
minute longer maybe you don't get to use soap in one right exactly thank you um rather than just

136
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:26,800
skipping the whole thank you and god thanks god here's uh so this is an advice show uh uh and

137
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,480
here's the first question recently my husband and I bought our first house together congratulations

138
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,840
soon after we bought our house we met our next door neighbor whose name we will say is Rory

139
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,200
because that's hard to say can I all right I'll just go with that you can say Dennis if you want

140
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:50,160
I also just want to say I always love when people um include these fake names as though like saying

141
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,760
his actual name Jerry would totally give him away well I mean fandoms are capable of literally

142
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:03,920
anything and you know I love our listeners but anything's possible um uh as as they got uh that

143
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,600
shrimp heaven now kid had got elected mayor of his city it's true in any way capable of doing that

144
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,560
as we settled into our home I began doing yard work and used a big orange bucket thank you for

145
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,840
the aesthetic details they really helped to paint a picture a big orange bucket that I found in the

146
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,200
home to take pulled weeds to throw in the brush in the backyard after using this bucket a few times

147
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:32,080
I noticed that it has Rory or Dennis written across it I didn't make the connection at first

148
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,200
so I continued to use it until I finally click what you didn't make the connection that's not

149
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,920
a very difficult connection that's a good easy connection I feel like it's not fucking zodiac

150
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:50,320
killer it said Rory on it or Dennis did the former home homeowners steal this bucket am I stealing

151
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:58,160
this bucket do I return it to the owner do I hide it behind his shed do I buy my own orange bucket

152
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,640
and write my name across it and pretend this nightmare never happened help that's from the

153
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,280
real bucket thief it sounds like your conscience has already spoken just based on the title that

154
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:13,040
you've chosen for yourself there that you know this is bucket crime and you are continuing to

155
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,880
be party to it you're not the maybe the the perpetrator but you are an accomplice certainly

156
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,320
you are profiting from the bucket this is actually a really good question because you legally bought

157
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,520
everything in the house if they left it there that's your property you own it

158
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,320
I've always wanted a loaning scenario would happen because it would take I would need to

159
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,320
I would need a bucket pretty bad before I would break into my neighbor's look at him over there

160
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,160
using that beautiful orange bucket again one of these days when he's not looking it'll be

161
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,040
he could throw anything in there and carry it from place to place as a little effort I bet

162
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,240
he could even put liquids in there no way yeah yeah I asked him I said Dennis where did you get

163
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:07,360
that nice bucket and he told me to fuck off can you believe that Valerie he told me to fuck off

164
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,680
so I'm putting together a team I need someone who can do flips someone who can lift things

165
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,600
a guy who has pencils Valerie you're gonna seduce him and I don't listen I know I've had you seduce

166
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,560
a lot of neighbors for a lot of buckets but this one's different this is the last one last job

167
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:31,840
after this one we can retire um this is I I don't know my neighbors super well and I feel genuinely

168
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:37,200
guilty about that because I feel I on paper I like the idea of knowing all my neighbors and

169
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:45,360
getting together for backyard barbecues and bocce ball and what have you um and this seems like a

170
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,720
good opportunity to like go talk to your neighbor you know what I mean like I would never just like

171
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,280
go ring the doorbell and invite them to dinner although I'm sure they would be into that um

172
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:02,400
because of my considerable anxiety but if I had an like a reason to go talk to them I think I

173
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,680
would I think you should I think you should jump at it I think everybody could do better to like

174
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,280
know their neighbors a little bit better and this seems like a chance to do that and have a reason

175
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,640
for it I bought a house recently and we have a big uh like bay window in the living room and

176
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,960
there's this older gentleman who lives in the house across the street and he likes to spend his

177
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,840
time on nice days just sitting on a chair on his lawn and so I like to stand in front of my bay

178
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:32,160
window and look at him and saying old man look at my life and I uh laugh really hard every time I

179
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,200
do it but you don't go talk to him and see if no no no no no no no you are you are I should

180
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,680
advise you Travis you're in a window right now where you please don't be like me in every house

181
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,600
I've ever owned please learn your neighbor's names now and write them down somewhere because

182
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,520
you won't need them frequently enough to remember them and you are definitely going to get to a

183
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,880
window where it would be weird to ask them their name yeah like you are you're hurtling towards

184
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,880
that window from the day you buy the house are you ready that comes over my across the street

185
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,800
neighbor that comes over to use my phone sometimes uh-huh I I she told me her name once the first

186
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,720
time she borrowed the phone and I didn't know it's going to be a repeated thing so I didn't

187
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:19,360
remember it and now look at me we actually play with fire one step deeper where Teresa and I

188
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,280
within the walls of our own home refer to anyone who lives around us as neighbor Reno so I thought

189
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,440
I was like did you see what neighbor Reno was doing over there oh what was neighbor Reno doing

190
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,480
and one of these days I will talk to that person and I will call them neighbor Reno to their face

191
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,360
because I'm a monster who can't control themselves neighbor Reno's fun yeah that sounds like you're

192
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,920
on some Flanders shit I don't even I don't even have I have there's a old every day I drive to

193
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,080
daycare drop my son off not every day like four days a week and when I drive back it always times

194
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,680
out that I drive by an old man who lives near me he's always chomping an unlit cigar he's walking

195
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,960
his dog passing the same street every time we are kindred spirits we are always in the same place

196
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,040
don't know nothing about him except he likes to walk his dog on that street and chewing on that

197
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:09,520
cigar I'm gonna call him Jack from now on because he looks like a jack I so having just bought a

198
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,200
house this is our first permanent residence like house we've ever bought and it's amazing how your

199
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,600
psychology changes I took my dog out into the backyard to use the restroom her not me and

200
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:29,840
I will often use the small wet room and then put pajama pants back on and so like I was wearing

201
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,080
some Muppets pajama pants that Mary Small got me they're great and I made eye contact with

202
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,440
my neighbor who was like fully dressed because it was 2 30 in the afternoon and he was dressed like

203
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:48,640
you know a person an adult and I realized like oh I can't just move now I own this place I'm

204
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,680
trapped here forever and to you I'll always be that 12 year old adult who lives next door yeah

205
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:59,600
oh no and that that dookie is gonna stay there and you own that house and you gotta do something

206
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,480
about it if it's a rental or a lease you can leave and then in a year or so won't be your problem

207
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,840
didn't think about that I bet are you talking about dog dookie I cleaned it up so yeah I got

208
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,240
one for you sent him by uh zooey or zoe porter thank you it's from yahoo answers user what

209
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:27,520
I'll go do a rado oh this is br answers.yahoo.com okay it's it's yeah all right it's something

210
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,680
uh thank thank you sorry something's gone wrong ask this question I'm gonna call him

211
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:39,760
Raquel asks do you think that Mr Bean is sexy

212
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,840
hmm I read this and at first I thought maybe it's one of those dang trolls maybe we got a real

213
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,120
ogre in the mix a real shrek situation on our hands but then I pondered it and I don't know

214
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,760
where to land on the last thing I want to do is objectify Mr Bean or actor Rowan Atkinson

215
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,520
who plays Mr Bean but it's it's it's a it's an interesting sort of subject to tackle because

216
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,600
is Mr is Mr Bean sexy is I guess the core sort of question I'm struggling with he's successful

217
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:19,360
and success can be sexy right probably one of the best known British characters of all time

218
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:26,080
um funny a lot of people think that humor can be sexy or sexual makes you really horny when you

219
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:33,040
laugh at it and prudence and a good problem solver and I think there's a lot of qualities about Mr

220
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,960
Bean that is sexy and makes you horny if you really want to drill down it were there ever any

221
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,320
racier Mr Bean bit I'm not listen I'm not trying to get blue I'm not saying like a sexy I'm glad

222
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,000
you asked that Travis because there was the one in the swimming pool where he gets really scared

223
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,800
up on the diving board and crawls down for him but he's wearing a very tight fitting sort of

224
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,760
pair of trunks or bathing suit where you can see I guess a little bit of his butt and probably

225
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:04,800
if you look really hard on the 4k blu-rays a little bit of penile shape do you think he calls

226
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,280
him Mr Bean yeah yeah was there because I think there could have been a lot of humor I just see a

227
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:15,840
lot of uh like situations ripe for humor like Mr. Bean Mr. Bean shaves his balls right that's

228
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,920
funny no no no no no no sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry thank you Dustin yeah you did say Mr. Bean

229
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:30,960
so we are going to have to take a quick break my flexible friend I have to I have to shave my

230
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:38,320
balls Mr. Wayne if you'll excuse me that's not what Bane even sounded like that was Sean Connery

231
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,880
kind of a maybe oh that's the only way I can do Bane is that you kind of Bane Connery his take on

232
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:50,560
Bane um I want to just hop into the comments here and just pick some of those apart uh Ramos Jr. 107

233
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:57,360
says in his own way lol and I like that yeah to anybody he is confident I think in the way that

234
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,000
he does his stuff and confidence is well here's let me tell you what's messed up about this

235
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,920
question Griffin that I've just realized psychologically the only reason someone asked

236
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:12,080
this question is a they believe he is sexy and are looking for confirmation or they believe

237
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:18,320
he is sexy and are looking for confirmation or b someone has told them that Mr. Bean is sexy and

238
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:25,360
they disagree but in either case a human being has stated or felt that he is sexy answering the

239
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,800
question this isn't a question you think like I don't and no one I know does but maybe the internet

240
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:36,080
thinks otherwise you only ask this if you want confirmation I don't think and beauty's in the

241
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,200
eye of the holder especially when you're looking at being I want to dive down into this one from

242
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,480
he ie Rowan Atkinson is dressed as Blackadder Elizabethan version in that leather doublet and

243
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:55,040
that beard and then they say not af like apostrophe alf like maybe uh you're saying it with a bit of

244
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,320
an affectation but I'm glad that apostrophe is there or else this person would have said not alf

245
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,480
it's not he didn't play out he isn't not out just to be clear now you're not talking about alfar

246
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,880
it now I guess and what we need to dive into next and we still have the Mr. Bean question

247
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,640
on the table but if alf is sexy or not well this is how you build like a logical threat and if we

248
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,280
can establish that alf is sexy I think that will prove that Mr. Bean is sexy I know it's hard to

249
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,560
yes exactly thank you a equals bc equals alf

250
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,560
is Mr. Bean Justin you've been sort of quiet on the subject I'll tell you what alf is really good

251
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:41,760
at hmm nope oh god it's I was gonna make a joke about eating cats and I think you can see where

252
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:49,680
I was going but I'm not gonna say Travis you can park the car outside but everyone knows you drove

253
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:58,880
there I'm sorry sorry sorry Fred no that's the best metaphor I've ever heard for that kind of

254
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,280
thank you Justin rules rules are rules um here's another question moving on before he wants to

255
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:12,320
weigh in on the comedy I'll just say it I think yeah he's pretty sexy okay I think yes strong

256
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:20,800
silent type etc etc uh in the last city I lived there is what I and many others believe to be an

257
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:28,480
authentic bona fide Jimmy Buffett's margaritaville after visiting I never got the hype okay until I

258
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,680
saw a photo from an actual margaritaville thanks Justin and realized that ours isn't the real thing

259
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:42,080
instead it's just this fancy seaside bar and grill that has stolen the good name for their own uses

260
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,600
everyone I've talked to believes that this place is the real deal straight from the j man himself

261
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:55,120
what do I do how do I expose this establishment for their blatant fraud and that's from confused

262
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:03,120
in paradise okay so hmm the the fact that there were eight tees in Jimmy Buffett's margaritaville

263
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,520
should have been the first tip off um because that's not the real Jimmy Buffett uh it was Jimmy

264
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:16,720
Buffett's daiquiri town here's the thing don't you think if you looked at him playing said this

265
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,160
is a Jimmy Buffett's margaritaville right and they responded well you know that's hard it's hard to

266
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:31,280
say what is the Jimmy Buffett's margaritaville really what I that's a weird listen I don't think

267
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:37,840
James is particularly litigious but I think that he does try to keep the margaritaville thing pretty

268
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,120
close to the vest what with the chain of restaurants and the rum yeah it's like he's walking around

269
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,200
to everyone drinking a margarita and he's like no it smacks it out of hand that's mine you gotta

270
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:54,880
pay me five dollars but I do think in this one case you're probably right if you call it Jimmy

271
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,120
Buffett's right you just can't that's James's James wrote that for himself and he shared it

272
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,120
with us but not in this way you're this is I'll tell you what though I do have to call it a

273
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:14,880
question your determination here because like you didn't this is probably the the I assume

274
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,960
the biggest platform in which you will share this information and you withheld a lot of crucial

275
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,720
details that we could use to completely put them on fucking blast yeah right they would be they

276
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,680
would be currently being annihilated right now I would yelp them into non-existence please don't

277
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,320
please don't do that option please don't do that but like no don't do that at all listen we aren't

278
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,560
lawyers we aren't experts and I also don't want the burden of costing a number of people their jobs

279
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,560
on my conscience so like but you don't have to close it just call it something else you call it

280
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,960
something else Jimmy Buffett's would you care for a margarita sir I think Trav I'm not I'm

281
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,240
not I'm again no legal expert I think calling your restaurant Jimmy Buffett's fucking anything

282
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,960
yes oh I see what the problem can I hit you with a possible name Tony Keith's I love this pub and

283
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,920
restaurant he's not using that anymore is he what's that he's not using that anymore he might

284
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,320
even just give it to you well that's it now who is Tony Keith though is the real question

285
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:31,760
McDonald's what about a McBottles hi welcome to Burger King it's welcome to Burger King it's the

286
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:39,440
new good restaurant still frame flame broiled you're gonna love these these good burgers you can

287
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,600
have it whichever way have it whichever way you'd like it to be today our king isn't creepy

288
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:56,160
McBonald's I'm enjoying it I'm enjoying it ba ba ba ba do hmm okay Cindy's Cindy's

289
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:04,080
our our hamburger patties are octagons it's weird right it's weird we say welcome to the octagon

290
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:12,640
when you come in this is this is this is welcome to RC's opening up opening up a restaurant is the

291
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:20,240
most like risky thing you can do in the business world right like what's this like nine out of

292
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,080
every 10 like flop in the first year or so like well you have to think that your only goal when

293
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,080
you open a restaurant is you have to think in your head like you know how up till now people

294
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:38,160
have not known where to get food well now yeah let me step in why why run the risk of in addition

295
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:45,760
to like the pressures of the free food market um open yourself up to a cease and desist from

296
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,240
the historically chill island man jimmy buffett it doesn't it doesn't it does not make sense to me

297
00:28:52,240 --> 00:29:05,360
unless unless this place was open first jimmy was a big fan oh shit my great great grandfather

298
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:16,400
james t buffett loved margaritas and villages and he combined those loves into jimmy buffett's

299
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:24,400
margarita and this no talent hack comes in and says hello my name is dennis lahoya and i'm going

300
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:30,560
to take it all now there's also a possibility that it's a fair use parody and we should always

301
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:39,360
keep that in mind too um that's a that's an option i think just keep just if jimmy's ever in town

302
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:46,240
just slide him a card just walk up to him this won't be a problem just walk up to him

303
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,280
slide him a note and just with an address or if you can meet him in a parking garage

304
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,840
that would actually be great too if you can arrange that is it is it not maybe it's totally

305
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:02,080
legal to open up a bar based on any song title and then it's because it's public it's public

306
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:08,960
domain is what that is and i took i took one sort of law class in college and it was mostly

307
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:16,480
like fair use law but i think if you call a bar like you ought to know or um you ought to know

308
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,960
be the worst name for a restaurant ever because it kind of implies like you ought to know what's

309
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,960
in here you ought to know what our food is i think if you open up a restaurant restaurant

310
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,600
and you call it despacito featuring daddy yankee then you're totally in the clear

311
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,080
but you have to put daddy yankee in quotes because it is a person's actual name

312
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,840
well now that is a restaurant i would go to despacito featuring daddy yankee and you have to

313
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,600
say it like that because of the quotes not a lot of people know this but if you ever look at

314
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,400
copyright documents it actually just says like we would really appreciate it if you didn't

315
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:54,320
but there's like no legal ramifications totally copyright it's just kind of like hey it would be

316
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:01,120
really cool if you didn't you know make a movie called mad max like we'd really appreciate it if

317
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,800
you like wouldn't we're gonna it's trademarked so please don't please but if you do there's

318
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:13,440
nothing we can do about it uh let's take a break right now and uh travel over to the money zone

319
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,920
to earn our money money we're gonna get money we're gonna talk about stuff and get money from

320
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:35,360
it great because that's our crafts our first sponsor is me undies and we told you all about

321
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,880
their underwear and it's extremely good underwear and everybody should have it but if underwear is

322
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,400
not your thing uh we are excited to announce that me undies socks are finally here me undies socks

323
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,880
are spun from premium materials they're dedicated to making the most comfortable pair of underwear

324
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,800
and now socks you will ever own i got a couple pairs of these socks and they are they fit real

325
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:04,880
nice they feel real nice they got a nice grip on them and um they are they have a sort of covert

326
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,520
hemline a lot of people will look and be like are you wearing socks you're like no they're just

327
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,880
barely there me undies so comfortable so fashionable so stylish have you guys ever

328
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,920
thought about the fact that socks are like the donut holes of underpants whoa that's deep because

329
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,320
you put your foot through the leg hole to put them on right and the sock stays on your foot and the

330
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,120
rest goes up around your thing so like if you sewed the sock to the leg hole you'd close it up

331
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,120
well that would not be very comfortable no but that's this is what i'm saying is

332
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,320
is the donut hole of underpants i've thought about it for the past 12 seconds and decided

333
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,560
what you just said was garbo nonsense you know what here's the thing though griffin you're gonna

334
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:49,600
be lying awake in your own mouth won't and yes i will the dat part will be true yes okay and then

335
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,680
it's gonna hit you if like oh that makes total sense because if the sock was sewn to the bottom

336
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,920
of the underpants i'd try to pull the underpants on but i couldn't get past my feet but if i pulled

337
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,840
hard enough but if it pulled hard enough the underpants would come with it sock would stay

338
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,280
on my foot boom sock underpants separated might be garbo nonsense i'll think about it though i

339
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,800
promise i'll put the effort in right now me and these has an exclusive offer just for our listeners

405
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,480
conference about it this always has helped us in the past oh oh gosh this has become a defense

406
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,800
mechanism justin i want to deflect

407
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:05,680
what a burger

408
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,000
can't make you laugh what a burger

409
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,880
up until now everyone has known what a burger as the place at the dallas airport where i saw

410
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:29,920
cardinals what a burger thing but there's a new thing in town what a burger is launching

411
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:38,880
the tree is a burger with creamy chili sauce this press this press release i like because a lot of

412
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,960
times in these press releases people are trying too hard and i feel like in this one they didn't

413
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:51,360
try very much at all and maybe they were just sort of writing it word by word not really knowing what

414
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:58,240
the next word would be chorizo a type of ground sausage that derives its bold taste profile and

415
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,920
deep red color from a fresh blend of spices is already a staple in many places and gaining in

416
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,640
popularity so already what a burger is on the defensive um they're saying chorizo is actually

417
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:18,240
good so calm down we're late to this category uh but trust us lots of other people do it i also

418
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,440
really like the first half of that sentence sounds straight off wikipedia like yeah here's

419
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,440
right but then the second half of the sentence kind of peters out like a kid who like copied

420
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,840
and pasted and like well i can't just leave that i have to add something to it and also i really

421
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:38,720
liked the book and also characters were good the dog represented uh industrial revolution

422
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:47,120
the sizzling chorizo gives the burger a bold taste while a blend of fire roasted poblano

423
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:53,920
peppers red peppers and onions give it a fresh bite what a burger combine these two ingredients

424
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,360
with the new creamy chili sauce two slices of monterey jack cheese and two fresh all beef

425
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:07,040
patties for a unique burger with the perfect balance of spice so those two paragraphs are

426
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:13,120
already in it right and then they go into rich's office and they're like rich help me i wrote two

427
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:17,360
paragraphs and i don't fucking know what else to say we can't just send out two paragraphs and

428
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:25,040
rich is like no problem i've got it quote mexican style chorizo makes this burger unique with this

429
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:31,440
deep red color we're still very hung up on the deep red color of chorizo that's very important

430
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:39,280
with its deep red color fresh blend of spices and bold flavorful profile says rich the whataburger

431
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:46,880
vice president of marketing and innovation the flavors on this burger blend nicely for a balance

432
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:55,200
for a balanced but savory taste we think our customers will really enjoy it now i want to take

433
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:02,560
two things i need to break off here he clarifies that it's savory okay you're not cinnabon there's

434
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,080
not a question in my mind of what the flavor profile is going to be on this burger you do not

435
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:13,920
need to clarify for me that it is a savory taste and then he says we think our customers will

436
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,960
really enjoy which i really appreciate the humility because he could have very easily said no

437
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,920
but no he said think listen we took our breast guess and here's what we know there's a bold red

438
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:34,160
color on this lots of other people are doing it spices and it's a fresh blend and a bite and

439
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:40,080
there's spices and a deep red color and we fucking we're out of ideas over here at whataburger so if

440
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:45,040
you listen other people are doing it just trust us about this if you have anything if you have any

442
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:58,400

443
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:06,480
blend and spices like the mix of flavors is great the blend of spices is great the morass of

444

447
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:27,680
you will the chorizo burger is only available for a limited time and then in a parenthetical it says

448
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,240
no exact dates to share so they're really just taking whenever whenever the chorizo runs out

449
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,560
yeah whenever you guys stop liking it you can tell us we'll take it away we're so sorry we

450
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,120
bought 50 pounds of chorizo from somebody that promises people like it we're just gonna see what

451
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:48,240
happens i wait our sister's kid has invested in chorizo he's promised us you'll really like it

452
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:55,360
i these motherfuckers have i kid you not a bullet pointed list that i will spare you but a bullet

453
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:02,240
pointed list of everything that is on the burger and it covers exactly they they did it in prose

454
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:08,080
and then they wanted to break it down into like the real nitty gritty of exactly what's on this

455
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:14,240
motherfucker and that is available for a limited time they're also doing a spiced up chorizo

456
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:23,360
sausage what a burger late night and breakfast with the uh uh and then there's a taquito i just

457
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:30,240
slice of american cheese in it which does seem strange not how the taquito was intended but okay

458
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,320
i just like i would eat one of these i think it sounds good i'm a fan of chorizo but i will say

459
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:41,440
this blend of lots of meat and spicy sauce and spicy cheese like they may as well get like

460
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,840
fucking oscar de lohoya to come in and duct tape this to a boxing glove and just punch it directly

461
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:54,960
into my stomach because it will be that will essentially be the result of this event just get

462
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,360
like chuck laddell to come in and duct tape it to his foot and just kick it right into like my

463
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:05,120
fucking ribs because that'll basically be about where i'm at i'm sorry they have a list there's

464
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:13,520
four things in the taquito there's a soft flour tortilla scrambled eggs chorizo there's a colon

465

00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,920
beautiful and none of us can bring ourselves to taste it but here's what we know about it just

468
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,920

474
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:20,640
hmm you go to the spa maybe you're getting a rub or uh oils applied to you or uh some sort of

475
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:27,680
exfoliating treatment or maybe you're in a mud situation for a while that's all standard operating

476
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:34,720
procedure this person wants to take their spa over the top and beat the shit out of their

477
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,680
competitors and travis has i've stalled for long enough go trap i've got it thank you every other

480
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:05,680
spa is fucking hardcore you got people yelling at you like you massage rocks yeah they like you

481
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:12,560
have to like slide down i don't know like sandpaper takes fully at your skin it's a really

482
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:19,200
it is not a relaxing experience at all when you said this spa rocks i wish you had stopped because

483
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,640
that painted such a beautiful picture in my mind of travis mcelroy's rock and roll spa

484
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,960
which is a great name for a business so much better than tony keese i love this public restaurant

485
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:35,360
um that i think we could have a lot of fun with it like maybe we just have like a lot of you know

486
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:42,080
heavy shredding taking place in the background while people assail you with sandpaper and

487
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,000
rolling pins but in a way that still feels good at the end of the day but you're you're also

488
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,920
listening to pantera here's what we're gonna call it we're gonna call it dick's last spa and resort

489
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:59,520
and it's gonna be that's very good by the way take a moment to let it sink in because it's like

490
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:06,320
really good and that's all that i had for that great great because dick's last spa and resort

491
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:12,400
do you understand now yeah i have another one i have another idea here this is my idea um take

492
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,840
a lap take a lap justin anyone who's ever been to a spa knows that there's always a moment where

493
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:23,920
they like leave you alone in a room or like set something down in front of you and you have a

494
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,960
moment where like what what am i supposed to do but you're afraid to ask but then after that comes

495
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:36,800
a nice relaxing experience but what if the whole spa was just built to confuse you into relaxation

496
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:43,040
okay okay and so like you walk into a room they hand you a plunger and say i'll be back when

497
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,920
you're ready and leave and the room is completely empty right and you're just left to figure and

498
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:55,200
they never come back you walk in there's a table there and the room is dark and they say i okay so

499
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,280
uh any trouble areas oh your neck and shoulders okay you work at a desk you seem tense all right

500
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,920
um so go ahead and lay down we'll get started uh go ahead and undress to my level of comfort

501
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,600
good luck goodbye they take you into a walk-in closet and say dress more to your level of

502
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,080
comfort and then leave and you're like is that two more jackets where where am i at with this

503
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,600
if we really are looking to improve the spa process i wish they would just say

504
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,920
get take off your all of the clothes and get on the table because the get it out

505
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:27,360
dress to dress to your level of comfort is is a very kind way of saying like

506
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:36,480
oh you're gonna do naked okay i got i got i got a massage when i was like 22 and they said that

507
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,320
and left the room and i was like i honestly had not even thought about that part of the equation

508
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,880
and huge anxiety and so i just thought like does that mean underwear it probably means

509
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:53,520
underwear it didn't mean underwear i guessed wrong i made an incorrect guess i think we have found

510
00:50:53,520 --> 00:51:00,400
an easy way to to improve your spa is just directly clarify you should be like multiple

511
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:06,640
posted signage exactly how much you should undress this is the correct one card of each spa

512
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:13,040
like if you move into this room and you haven't redressed from the last room bad bad job robe

513
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:20,400
you're fine that's fine this is robe comfort here wait outside your competitors and as people leave

514
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:27,280
offer them a massage and if they let you then just start loudly and now it's like hey this

515
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,560
guy just left this spa and he's letting me massage he must not have done a very good job

516
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:38,880
because i i wouldn't want that so you stand outside el haji to try to relax some more and if you can

517
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,600
then then they must have been relaxed must have been very good like must not have been a very good

518
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:48,480
massage i got a massage about a month ago i was feeling extremely stressed out i thought i'm gonna

519
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:54,000
treat myself i went in i literally slept through the whole fucking thing like is that level of

520
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,280
pressure good yeah it's good gone out done out for an hour i slept through the whole thing and

521
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,960
so like i think that a good sort of new process would just be if they see you i'd snore so i they

522
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:10,320
definitely knew maybe a little pinch a little courtesy pinch right right in the you know the

523
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:14,480
armpit fat just get in there and just say like hey sorry you were snoring and i don't want you

524
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,600
to miss a thing because you paid a lot of money for this and it's supposed to be nice i have a

525
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:26,640
tendency um if anyone ever asked me like a question about how much pressure i could take i am a monster

526
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:32,240
and will say 10 when that's not true and so like i got this massage at the moment was like one to

527
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:38,400
10 and i was like 10 and it was it hurts so bad it hurts so much but if you say something it'll

528
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,120
drop i couldn't say three i couldn't say it and it was always like just as i was about to say like

529
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:48,480
no you know what no uncle uncle you win like she wouldn't move to another spot and so it's just like

530
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:56,240
by the end of that like half hour or whatever 60 minutes it was i was just i was in i my whole body

531
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:02,000
was a night i walked out of there like a fucking pretzel because i was so i was so stressed out

532
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:09,440
from my massage because i was um too terrible a person to say like oh you know actually let's go

533
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:16,560
to like the six like which i say now to you yeah and it's like the most normal thing speaking of

534
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:23,760
anxiety uh i got a couples massage with my wife one time uh years ago before we had children and

535
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:32,720
when we arrived for a massage there was a male masseuse and a woman masseuse and we were asked

536
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:41,200
in the moment to sort of pick who we want to do a quick draft and the fucking calculations that i

537
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,960
had to go through the kobayashi maru of that oh it's it's impossible there's nothing there's no

538
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:53,040
option for me there i like i'll rub myself and you both rub her i think is where i ended up to be

539
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:58,480
clear where you're saying that because like you don't want to come off as a homophobic but you

540
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,320
also homophobic but i also don't want to come off as like oh hello yeah absolutely and i don't want

541
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:10,160
to come off as like there's just no right answer i guess is what i'm saying there's no way this

542
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,600
ahead of time to look at a person and say i would like to pay you to touch me it's one thing if i

543
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,680
walk into a room and they're the only brother person there massage therapy is a legit very good

544
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,880
very helpful thing it's a very good contribution to society it's it's i i understand what you're

545
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,520
saying in what i'm saying is it's a challenge if i walk into a room and there's one other person

546
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:36,640
there i know where we stand but if i walk into room and pick someone from a lineup that person

547
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:41,200
knows i picked them over somebody else and that feels weird to me and also the other person is

548
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,880
like so not me all right cool i'm super good at this what we're touching on is it's a very intimate

549
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:53,920
thing i think in the massages is it i think because it's it's another person uh rubbing you

550
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:59,120
all all over and it shouldn't be sexualized and i'm not saying i'm not introducing sexuality into

551
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:04,560
it whatsoever i think it's a very intimate thing and this decision should not be in my hands it

552
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:09,120
should just be the situation that i find myself in yeah i'm perfectly happy either way perfect

553
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:13,280
i have to make the choice perfect spa over the top better than competitors you don't make that call

554
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,960
you show up the massage is one thousand dollars and but you don't get to pick and they tell you

555
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,480
just get nude and they pinch you if you fall asleep and then also they say go ahead and get

556
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:28,560
dressed naked and lie down and it'll be totally great and you lie down and you feel hands on your

557
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:33,600
back perfect amount of pressure every time and you're like whoa and you sort of get the inkling

558
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:38,320
that this was not the person that walked me into the room and then you feel sort of somebody get

559
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:45,440
leaning down close to you and then you hear let me sail let me sail let the orinoco flow and it

560
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,720
is inya they just have inya to do it and you get the live performance right there it's not coming

561
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:57,200
through it's not coming through any sort of loudspeaker situation it's really her and it's

562
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:02,480
only time and it's right there and it's that's why it's a thousand dollars okay here's all right

563
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:09,440
here's in the same thing pinch the dress signs but the massage is is a hundred thousand dollars

564
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:15,440
oh god and when you walk in this the first thing you do is they take a snip of your hair

565
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,920
and that's three months before and then when you walk in you lay down on the table and you feel

566
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:28,880
hands they're strong but familiar and you look up it's you they've cloned you and

567
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:37,520
and give it into a a sort of massage drone the year is 2178 yeah and they they've cloned you

568
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:42,880
and you start to say like i'm tenso and they're like i know i know i was tense there too three

569
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:48,640
months ago i remember now that is going i'm gonna go ahead and say this is a great premise for a

570
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:54,000
sci-fi novel but at the end of that session you do have to murder them with your own hands because

571
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,040
there can't be two of you walking around or it's gonna be a there's gonna be a lot of pivots is

572
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:05,840
what i was gonna say is there's gonna be oh well no i am justin and i i am justin and i paid one

573
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:12,400
hundred thousand dollars for the massage i'm going to go listen to the most beautiful classical music

574
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:18,400
composition okay so you're the drone then right okay all right i'm not going to go listen to

575
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:25,120
the most beautiful chopin piece i will go listen to jimmy buffett is his name and i love him and

576
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:32,080
all of his songs jimmy buffett island music i love jamie buffett you're so you're the drone

577
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:38,240
then and where's justin's body ah shoot we got another one so you know what you're just gonna

578
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:44,400
drive yourself home yes i have eaten the keys and i am prepared to operate a motor i'm prepared to

579
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,840
interface with the takoma all right so you're the drone then oh all right and you murdered them

580
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:55,520
somebody called somebody calling the fucking rub runner because we got ourselves another one nice

581
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:03,440
um i think the most relaxing thing you could do in a massage is like the person comes in and like

582
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,520
they ask you how much and you're like it's perfectly rude it's fine it's fine then during

583
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,680
the massage you lean down and you say it's a hundred thousand dollars and you feel them tense

584
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:16,800
up and the 30 seconds later you say but i'm gonna give you a discount it's gonna be 20 bucks that

585
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:22,480
would be the most relaxing moment of my life to suddenly find out relaxing yeah right like i can't

586
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:28,880
afford that i can't afford that i'm walking on sunshine it's not just that you say it's a hundred

587
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,840
thousand dollars and you instantly see where all the knots are when their body tenses up that's

588
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:40,000
where you carry good and it's in you telling you so like that's that's it's a it's not the

589
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,080
worst way to find out that you are now completely financially destitute uh folks that is gonna do

590
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,600
it for us this week thank you so i hope we didn't stigmatize massage in any way i can't stress

591
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:59,120
enough i love it and i'm not i i wasn't trying to say it's weird and sexual i'm saying is wonderful

592
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:06,160
i just don't like i never liked being the captain of a of a team in in sports either to like say

593
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:11,360
like you but not you but you i don't like it's an it's an into it's an intimate thing i think when

594
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:17,040
you struggle with anxiety and just like talking to somebody then it's this introduces a few

595
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:23,680
sort of things that are a little bit challenging to to get get to deal with but it's good uh it's

596
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,240
good if you uh have any fun stories in your massage therapist or we got anything wrong or
