1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,480
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,520
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Uh, let me check my documents here. I'm your

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,640
middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. Sup, it's Griffin. What's up, Griffin? We've got another

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,480
film watch, uh, one of our great series where we pick a popcorn flick coming out that week and

9
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,640
pretend as though we're very excited for it and that we've seen it or will see it, and this week

10
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:20,160
our, uh, the funny one we got is They Shall Not Grow Old. You guys ready for some fucking gags?

11
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:27,040
They Shall Not Grow Old watch. Peter Jackson has taken a bunch of dope ass footage from World War

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:36,000
One and given it that, put Jar Jar in it, cleaned it up, put Jar Jar in it, colorized it, smoothed

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,080
it out, sexied it up, crunchitized it. Now Justin photoshopped away all the old man wrinkles,

14
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,120
put a bunch of Instagram filters on it. It's just a bunch of sexy ass Chris Helmsworths walking

15
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,840
around. Now Justin, I of course know everything about this film. I studied it up before I watched

16
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,960
it, but for those at home that may be wondering, is this like, is there like a storyline?

17
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,080
It's like, it's a, it's an homage to British troops in the First World War with a bunch of

18
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:11,200
footage that he has like remastered, uh, with, uh, overlaid with a narrative of those who partook

19
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,240
in the war from interviews made in the 60s and 70s. What is, what's uncomfortable is they can't,

20
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,640
it's like Super Bowl, they can't actually say World War One, so they call it the Big Fight

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,280
throughout the whole movie. The first big fight! Yeah, the huge skirmish. I think that this,

22
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,280
if you have, okay, if you've seen this footage, it is amazing what, uh, Pete has done. He's taken

23
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,160
this like really old grainy footage and made it feel so real, uh, which, uh, is, is extremely

24
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,880
impressive. The reviews are in on this one, and it is, I just, it's an amazing achievement that

25
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Peter Jackson has done, and the critics are all uniformly lining up to hail this outstanding,

26
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,760
amazing achievement, but you know there's still one who's like, I don't know, I don't know.

27
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,440
Where's the superheroes? I've seen some other movies and I've

28
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:12,320
never before seen World War One footage digitally remastered for modern audiences.

29
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:19,040
This one left me feeling a little cold. So I guess the thing that's on everybody's tongues is

30
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:28,000
what's, what else can Peter put his magic touch on and remaster? What, uh, maybe just wars or

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,880
maybe there's other stuff? It seems like war he's got pretty much figured out at this point,

32
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:39,360
so maybe it's cheaper for him to do wars. I, I have some footage of me making a sandwich a

33
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,200
couple years ago, but I, I didn't make it interesting. I forgot to make it interesting,

34
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,360
if I'm being honest. The sandwich or the footage?

35
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,280
I mean both, honestly. I would like Peter Jackson to remaster my sandwich.

36
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,600
I'd like to see him take a pass at the War of the Roses, but not the actual one,

37
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:03,280
the Kathleen Turner film. Oh, yeah. Punch it up. Punch up that Kathleen Turner Michael Douglas

38
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,320
classic. Punch it. This guy could do anything, right? Pete can take a whole war and make it

39
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,320
feel like one movie. He could take 50,000 orcs and make them feel like one army. What I would

40
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,360
like him to do is dip into the series Supernatural, which has just crested 300 episodes, and I would

41
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:32,480
love him to just bring it on in. What I want Pete to do, now that he's finished his World War I

42
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,800
film documentary, I want him to just take all 300 episodes of the Supernatural and just fucking

43
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,080
bring it in so I can get caught up on this series, see what all the fuss is about.

44
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,480
Every other issue of Entertainment Weekly has it on the cover. I just want to get in on the hubbub,

45
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,480
the fandom, the tumbling of this show, and I can't because there's 300 episodes and I will be dead

46
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,040
by the time that I watch all those back-to-backs. I just need Pete to bring it in. To bring it on.

47
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,040
J-Man, I'm going to do some quick math here, and let's assume that with commercial breaks,

48
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,640
there's 45 minutes of actual Supernatural in each episode, and you're saying 300,

49
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:19,840
so that's 13,500 minutes. Wouldn't it be amazing if Michael, if, if, if, who's Michael? If Peter

50
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,240
Jackson could- Who's Michael, though?

51
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,080
I don't know. Where did Michael come from?

52
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,800
I was thinking of Michael Jackson. If Peter Jackson-

53
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,360
That's 225 hours of Supernatural. Right.

54
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,880
So much. So much show.

55
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,920
Or- In one hour.

56
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,920
Nine and a third days of Supernatural. In one hour, he would have to squeeze

57
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:46,640
225 minutes into each minute of an hour long episode to get you caught up.

58
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,320
Math is fun. I think that- Thank you, Griffin. I agree.

59
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:57,040
I think that, can you even imagine, he did the whole war, I guess, in one flick,

60
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:04,880
but The Hobbit, a 300 page long book, did take three flicks. That's kind of a fart in the face

61
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,760
to people who did World War I, huh? I think so.

62
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,120
Well, or something.

63
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,880
If they could come back and watch one of the three Hobbit movies where it's like,

64
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,480
here's a 30 minute section on the kind of grass that hobbits eat or whatever,

65
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,200
and they're like, wow, that's cool. My whole thing got blown up, but I guess that one got-

66
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,120
Cut for time, Pete. I cut my whole place getting blown up for time, I guess.

67
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,680
I think that there is- And I think this one is just coming out for one day at a limited

68
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,440
release situation. An event release, if you will.

69
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,280
What a hot watch we're doing.

70
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:49,360
Yeah, this is a hot watch. February 1, I think, is the time that you can see this one out.

71
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,000
Cool, man.

72
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,440
Yeah, man, cool. Go see this flick. Let us know. Well, I mean,

73
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,960
let Rotten Tomatoes know what you think, and we'll definitely see it that way.

74
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,520
We are an advice program, right? So we take questions from you, our beloved audience.

75
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:14,320
You can send those to mbambam at maximumfun.org, and send us your questions. Let us know how we

76
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,800
can help. If you need real, actual advice, not pretend advice, or you just want to tell us a

77
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,760
story or anything like that. If you need actual advice, let us help you. That's our core competency,

78
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,520
really, when all is said and done.

79
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,840
And that's going to do it for us this week.

80
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,600
That's it for our episode. A lot of just sort of talking in this one.

81
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,920
Yeah, but we want to say thank you to-

82
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,680
Hey, wait, let me get a hand on the talking ball.

83
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,560
We never say thank you to the address.

84
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,800
No, listen, I want to talk. I want to talk. I just got a Google calendar notification pop

85
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,680
up that Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out tomorrow. I can't believe it's actually here, folks,

86
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,960
and I heard in this one, Mickey Mouse actually kills Sephiroth.

87
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Why didn't we do a watch on that? Why did we pick the hard one about the war that we

88
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,920
don't know much about and have to really kind of watch what we say?

89
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,600
We could have talked about, it's because you're so very excited for it, huh?

90
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,520
I just can't wait to watch Mickey Mouse fight.

91
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,800
Do you think when they're getting ready to make a new Kingdom Hearts game,

92
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,200
they just do a deep dive on Disney fan fiction and steal a bunch of ideas?

93
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,320
They've stolen a lot of my Wreck-It Ralph fan fiction.

94
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,400
I have one where his fists go to the sides of buildings, and they're so big and sweaty,

95
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:34,080
he can't do anything with them, and they drag him around, and Elsa and Moana and

96
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:44,000
Flint Ryder from Tangled have to come help him carry his fists, and his pants get caught.

97
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,320
His super overalls get caught on a rock, and they tear off.

98
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,640
And so they're dragging him by his huge fists, and that is in Kingdom Hearts 3.

99
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,160
I saw it on a trailer, so I'm not going to say it on that.

100
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,760
Yeah, Kingdom Hearts 3 does have Wreck-It Ralph with his huge fists,

101
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,200
and he teams up with Master Chief for an Ultima summon.

102
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,360
And his pants rip off, I guess?

103
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,400
His pants rip off, and his-

104
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,920
But it's not a dress. Listen, it's not a sexual thing.

105
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,600
It's just a funny thing that happens.

106
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,240
And his Jim Jams all pixelated, and Master Chief's like,

107
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,640
what's, oh, I guess they're censoring your Jim Jam.

108
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,760
Oh, I'm so sorry.

109
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,720
And Wreck-It Ralph's just like, no, that's what it looks like on a video game.

110
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,480
And Master Chief then just says a quiet prayer.

111
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,240
He's very religious in this one.

112
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,000
There's a lot of praying to Christ.

113
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,360
Yeah, there's a whole Christ narrative in this one.

114
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,640
Yeah, one of the movies that they make a world out of is The Bible.

115
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,360
It's great.

116
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,960
Yeah, the Disney movie The Bible.

117
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,560
And sort of fully gets saved. Let's do some questions.

118
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,560
Finally, Mickey converts.

119
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,560
Master Chief takes off his helmet.

120
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,880
He says, finally, I can reveal my identity as Jack Sparrow.

121
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,240
The whole time it's been Jack Sparrow underneath the helmet.

122
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,080
And then he becomes a Christian, too.

123
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,760
This would have been a way better intro.

124
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,680
It's a shame we didn't do this one.

125
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
Jesus Christ.

126
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,440
Then Tron comes out.

127
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,360
He's doing all these crazy stunts.

128
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,840
And when the camera pulls back, he's spelled out with his light cycle.

129
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,200
John 3.16.

130
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,760
Yeah.

131
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,520
Tron loves Jesus, too.

132
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,600
Cyber Jesus, of course.

133
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,480
But all right, all right.

134
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,360
Here comes the question.

135
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,520
At the end of Kingdom Hearts, they all get saved.

136
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
Okay, okay.

137
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,920
No, pull it back in.

138
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,200
Pull it back in.

139
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,320
Oh, we were almost there.

140
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,560
We were so close to doing our podcast that we do it every week.

141
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,160
Here comes the podcast you've been waiting for.

142
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,200
Then I pictured Lightning McQueen getting baptized.

143
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,160
We can't, we can't.

144
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,680
It's just a car, but it's a car wash.

145
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,200
We can't, we can't, we can't.

146
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,320
Go, read the first question.

147
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,800
Go, come on.

148
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,080
No, we can't do this.

149
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,520
I can't do it.

150
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,080
No.

151
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,440
We can't do this.

152
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,080
The chicken from Moana says Jesus.

153
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,880
All right, so we're done.

154
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,920
We're done, that's it.

155
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,320
That's it.

156
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,960
He swallows a Bible whole and he gets choked on it.

157
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,760
All right, here comes the first question.

158
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,880
He does go to heaven.

159
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,680
Hey, hey.

160
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,880
Voiced by Alan Tudyk.

161
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,640
For the last year or so, I've been working in the mall as a retail assistant.

162
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,440
Throughout, I don't like the feeling of doing one of these questions.

163
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,480
I don't like reading questions written by-

164
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,840
Come on, nephew, you feel froggy?

165
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,400
Do it, baby.

166
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,360
You started.

167
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,520
It's just reading a question written by a sensible human being is weird to me.

168
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,760
For the last year or so, I've been working in a mall as a retail assistant.

169
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,160
Throughout my time working there, I have gotten to know quite a few of the people who also work

170
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,640
in the mall.

171
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,920
A few weeks ago, a girl who works at the Mexican restaurant-

172
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,320
Justin, come on.

173
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,280
You're sitting down here.

174
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,240
I'm fine.

175
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,160
And the mall came to introduce herself.

176
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,880
She told me her name, and then I should, quote, drop by sometime.

177
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,160
And she will give me some- give me half-priced burritos.

178
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,600
I have now happily done so on several occasions.

179
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,800
I just thought that this is a friendly thing to do, but my co-workers met her before,

180
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,320
and they have never been offered any discount.

181
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Some of my co-workers now think she's into me.

182
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,640
This wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that I have been happily part of her

183
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,840
relationship for the past four years, and we've recently gotten engaged.

184
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,640
So my question is, is it okay for me to keep this burrito agreement and not tell this girl

185
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,720
I'm engaged as long as she doesn't ask?

186
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,080
That's from Question Quesadilla.

187
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,600
This is a heavy one to start out with.

188
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,840
What a tonal shift from Sora getting saved by Jesus Christ to this tempted by the burrito

189
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,600
of another sort of situation.

190
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,960
I feel like swing on by for half-priced burritos is a weird game.

191
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,680
Is some weird game, maybe?

192
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,080
And I don't know.

193
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:07,680
I think if you have something as powerful as half-priced burritos to offer, I feel like

194
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,000
that's a big ol' power move, because it almost ensures, like, I'm gonna see this person again.

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,400
Well, it also shows I can provide for you.

196
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,240
Yes, burritos.

197
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,120
Which is important.

198
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,600
My love language is half of the money that I would have to spend on burritos just being

199
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,720
saved in my back pocket.

200
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,880
This is a tricky one, because there's so many ways it can play out.

201
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,320
Number one, they're not actually into you, they're just being friendly.

202
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,680
And also, what store do you work at?

203
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,160
That's it.

204
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,720
Maybe they're trying to get half-price iPhone.

205
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,080
Ooh, they're trying to get a reciprocal deal.

206
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,320
That's entirely possible.

207
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,720
See, but the element of this question that is kind of a, like, breaks the whole thing

208
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,320
wide open is that none of the question askers' co-workers have been offered the same deal.

209
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,680
You know what I mean?

210
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,280
You know what I mean? So, like, this is unique to them.

211
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,800
But maybe it's just all your other co-workers are drips, and you're awesome, and the person's

212
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,600
like, I want to hang out with this person more and become friends, and it's, here's

213
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,640
what you need to do.

214
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:08,960
Okay.

215
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,440
Bring your fiancé with you.

216
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,040
This is not good.

217
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,000
That's not good.

218
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,320
What?

219
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,400
I think-

220
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,600
The only other option, like, if you feel bad, is to say, like, hey, I appreciate the half-price

221
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,120
burritos, but you should know I'm in a relationship.

222
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,360
No.

223
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,440
And that's, like, the worst thing I can do.

224
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,200
No, but here's the problem.

225
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,520
There's a very different version of this question that we could get that's like, hey, I've been

226
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:40,320
trying to hit on this guy with some low-price Mexican cuisine, and he just brought in his

227
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,040
fiancé.

228
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,640
Do I have to keep giving him these great burritos?

229
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,920
Damn, you're right.

230
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,800
I'm also assuming the gender of the question asker, which I shouldn't do because we have

231
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,040
no idea, but whoever it is, I feel like that's not-

232
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,760
Here's the thing.

233
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,920
If you're getting half-price burritos, folks, the half of the price has to come from somewhere,

234
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,320
and maybe it's coming from this employee.

235
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,480
Maybe it's coming from Mr. Bell.

236
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,800
I don't know, but it's coming from somewhere.

237
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,760
Mr. Kedoba.

238
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,920
Somewhere along the chain, a piper is not getting paid, and I think that you could do

239
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,840
that a couple times and feel okay about it.

240
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,360
It's not a permanent solution, though.

241
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,800
I don't think you could do that permanently.

242
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,840
I don't feel great about that.

243
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,800
I feel like somebody, eventually the game's going to get got, and if you're just in it

244
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:29,200
for the free burritos and not the camaraderie or the companionship, I feel like maybe it's

245
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,920
time to let this particular hookup slide on by, unless you can reciprocate with a hookup.

246
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,440
You start bringing them burritos.

247
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,600
You start bringing them a half of a burrito, Travis, from a different, better place.

248
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,880
And then you glue it to the burrito they gave you, and you hand it back and say,

249
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,840
good as new. I got this out of Kedoba, and I know you're probably not legally allowed

250
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,280
to go into Kedoba, so here's a Kedoba burrito.

251
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,640
I like how you say that.

252
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,440
What, Kedoba?

253
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,320
How would you say it?

254
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,120
I don't know.

255
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,240
I've just never said it out loud because I've been afraid of doing it wrong.

256
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,560
Well, I live with no fear.

257
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,600
I do not have any limits.

258
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,640
It's 2019.

259
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,840
I'm becoming the monster.

260
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,440
Let the big dog eat.

261
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,080
If Travis actually says Kedoba out loud, he loses his powers.

262
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,880
I can't.

263
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,480
I can't say Kedoba out.

264
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,440
Oh, no!

265
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,520
My tricks have finally paid off.

266
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,400
How about a Yahoo?

267
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,080
I want to pivot.

268
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,640
Okay.

269
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:22,960
Yeah.

270
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,440
The power is in your hands.

271
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,160
Here's a Yahoo.

272
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,920
This one was sent in by Emily Shock.

273
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,400
Thanks, Emily.

274
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,000
It's a Yahoo Answers user.

275
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,240
FN2187, which I believe is the Star Wars guy.

276
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,320
Wait, when did the first Star Wars movie come out?

277
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,280
I mean, the, I guess, seventh one come out.

278
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,160
That was when?

279
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,200
That was fairly recent.

280
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,160
That was while I was living in Austin.

281
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,880
I think it was like 2014, 2015, something like that.

282
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,320
FN2187, which is the name of the Star Wars guy,

283
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,520
has been a member since May 7th, 2007.

284
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,520
So they just happened to, I'm guessing the Star Wars

285
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,640
stole their shit from this Yahoo Answers user?

286
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,240
Or they changed their username.

287
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,360
No.

288
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,800
So they ask, my dreams be having 10 to 30 second commercials.

289
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,000
Is this normal?

290
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,720
Yes.

291
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,440
No lie.

292
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,120
I can't make things like this up.

293
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,480
You could.

294
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,800
I normally don't remember my dreams,

295
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,120
but when this happens, it helps me remember them.

296
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,920
Y'all ever have sort of like, you're enjoying a dream.

297
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:33,920
You're, you know, flying a jumbo jet with Richard Dreyfuss

298
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,600
and suddenly he turns into a piranha plant from Mario

299
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,680
and then all of a sudden you're fully erect

300
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,680
and you're like, what is this gonna?

301
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,240
And then it's just like, you know, you get to,

302
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,600
you watch the Gillette commercial,

303
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,280
the one everybody's talking about.

304
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,680
All the advertising my dreams is native advertising.

305
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,840
Like it happens in the, like I would be flying

306
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,120
with Richard Dreyfuss so that Mario would show up

307
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,400
and then he would pull out a Gillette razor

308
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
and start shaving his mustache

309
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,560
and talking about how smooth the shave it is

310
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,040
and how it's making him a better person

311
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,560
and not a jerk all the time.

312
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,280
Yeah, sure.

313
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,880
Sure, we do co-branded campaigns.

314
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,680
So it is original content and then at the end,

315
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,880
it just is like sponsored by Chevrolet.

316
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,480
Oh, that's nice.

317
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,400
And it's not about the product, right?

318
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,320
Like the car might be in it for like a second,

319
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,640
but really it's more about like I'm driving like a car

320
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
and I'm naked and my teeth fall out

321
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,000
and then the car explodes and then I'm a lizard

322
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,120
and then I can fly and then at the end,

323
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,200
it's like sponsored by Chevrolet.

324
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,480
Yeah.

325
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,120
Don't you guys think, isn't the weirdest part of a dream

326
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,600
always where like you get to the end of the story

327
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,200
in the dream, but you're not awake yet.

328
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,080
So then everybody in the dream just kind of stands around

329
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,920
kind of like hands in pockets.

330
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,000
And it goes on for like a long time

331
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,320
until they look at you and say, wake up,

332
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,760
please, we're really bored.

333
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,640
And then you wake up, but you're still in the dream

334
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,760
brought to you by Chevrolet.

335
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,360
Yeah, the problem is when you take one of the commercial pills

336
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,960
that implants it in your mind

337
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,120
so that you can see it when you dream.

338
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,560
That Morpheus gives you.

339
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,200
Morpheus gives you.

340
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,520
It's hard to flush those out sometimes.

341
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,680
So you get them, I'm still getting commercials

342
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,040
for the Fire Fest.

343
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,560
I'm still getting those in there.

344
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,120
So I'll be having a dream where me and Robert Lozier

345
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,680
are having a huge fist fight on the moon

346
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,160
and then all of a sudden Ja Rule pops up

347
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,960
and I'm like awake enough to say like,

348
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,560
Ja, you got to get out of there, bud.

349
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,160
You got to get out of there, bud.

350
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,560
Bud, it's not going to happen for you this time.

351
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,280
You need to go.

352
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,560
But every time it still goes and he still does it.

353
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,560
Ah, shoot.

354
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,480
You know, here's the thing that's really fucking me up

355
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:04,080
is I bought ads in my own dream.

356
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,760
And this is early days.

357
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,680
Early days of my brother, my brother and me

358
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,600
just to try to get some buzz going.

359
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,200
And so now I'm right now having a hard time

360
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,320
telling if this is a dream that I'm dreaming

361
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,480
with an ad for my own podcast in it

362
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,240
or if I'm actually sitting here recording.

363
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,600
Don't try to fucking freak my bean, dude,

364
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
because it's early and it'll work.

365
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,880
And I can't have that kind of schism.

366
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,800
I'm not trying to freak your bean.

367
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,640
I'm living in my own bean freak

368
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,000
and you're just here for the ride.

369
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,880
You know what I mean?

370
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,040
Wow, I have this occasional part time job

371
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,520
as kind of a secret shopper

372
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,400
where I go to restaurants, gas stations and the like,

373
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,480
OK, I'm going to stop real quick.

374
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,200
If you say my job is, quote, kind of a secret shopper,

375
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,280
I assume you are a thief or a murderer.

376
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,720
The most suspicious, suspicious intro possible.

377
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,360
OK, I have the occasional part time job

378
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,280
as kind of a secret shopper

379
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,520
where I go to restaurants, gas stations and the like

380
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,920
and attempt to buy alcohol or cigarettes

381
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,280
and test the cashier server checks for ID.

382
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,520
I cannot get over Justin.

383
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,600
You have made me realize how much secret shopper

384
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,680
sounds like a euphemism for a shoplifter.

385
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,440
Yes, like I shop in secret.

386
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,320
Occasional part time secret shopper

387
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,840
sounds like you're a shoplifter 100%.

388
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,240
I'm 23 but I look 17.

389
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,040
So most of the time the employee passes this weird test.

390
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,640
I'm not given a script or anything,

391
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,920
but the goal is to appear to be

392
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,720
somewhat normal shopper slash diner.

393
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,880
Recently, I've been tasked with attempting to buy vapes.

394
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,080
I don't vape or have friends who vape,

395
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,480
so I don't really have to ask a cashier for a vape

396
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,400
without sounding completely unbelievable.

397
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,480
Brothers, how does one try to buy a vape

398
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,240
without sounding like a cop?

399
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,560
That's from vexed about vapes in Chicago.

400
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,880
One vape, please.

401
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,560
Yeah, vape me.

402
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,440
Vape me up.

403
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,880
I'm just now remembering,

404
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,400
I just had a very vivid memory of being in high school

405
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,240
and another friend trying to recruit me

406
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,080
into one of these programs.

407
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,360
Like to be an undercover narc, right?

408
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,560
Where they send teenagers in to buy cigarettes

409
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,360
and if they let them, then the place gets in trouble.

410
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,280
It's only now occurring to me that this thing

411
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,800
where it's a real adult pretending to be underage

412
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,840
makes a lot more sense from sort of a legal perspective

413
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,360
than sending 16-year-old narcs in to buy smokes.

414
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,720
But also, to that point, J-Man,

415
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,480
selling cigarettes or vapes to a 23-year-old

416
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,160
is in no way illegal.

417
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,720
Now, I get that you're supposed to check IDs

418
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,160
if they look under 35, which is bonkers,

419
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,560
but that idea of like, whoa, you're in trouble

420
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,160
because that could have been a teen.

421
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,280
It's like, yeah, but it wasn't.

422
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,920
Yeah, but like, my thing was entrapment.

423
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,280
So I could see where that would be a problem.

424
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,440
And you did slink around in those leather pants

425
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,240
to buy those cigarettes.

426
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,400
I had a stippled-on beard that I thought was convincing.

427
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,800
But I had to deal with this while working at GameStop

428
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,920
because pretty close to the end of my tenure

429
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,280
with that great company, they instituted policy

430
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,840
where you did have to like ID people

431
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,840
if they were trying to buy a mature-rated game

432
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,520
because, you know, an 18-year-old

433
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,080
who comes in to buy Call of Duty 9

434
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,880
for sure is gonna have their ID on them.

435
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,680
They are for sure, they do know how to drive a car

436
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,720
and they're very good at it.

437
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,640
And every time that someone would come up

438
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,400
and buy a mature-rated game,

439
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,120
I would assume they were a secret shopper,

440
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,440
which never worked because I never actually got one.

441
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,200
But if I had, boy, would they have been flummoxed.

442
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,560
I would be like, oh, wanna buy this mature blood game, huh?

443
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,320
Gotcha.

444
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,000
Okay, so it depends.

445
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,800
Part of this is like if you're going into a vape shop proper

446
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:11,040
or you're going into Speedway to just buy a vape

447
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,880
because those, they don't give a shit.

448
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,360
You could wander in there and say like,

449
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,320
I need, I don't know, a vape.

450
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,560
And they're not gonna have the sort of expertise

451
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,280
to guide you to the proper vaping experience.

452
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,080
If you're at a vape shop proper,

453
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,160
I think that that becomes a lot harder.

454
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,760
I think that because you're not gonna know,

455
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,160
you know, the terms and all the slang.

456
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,240
So as I understand it from my years in the game,

457
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,880
you go in, you say, I need to, okay, here's the thing.

458
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,720
I got it, I got you, I got a solution.

459
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,520
Okay, here's the solution.

460
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,320
You don't go in equipment focus or slang focus

461
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,640
or juice focus, you go in outcome focus.

462
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,240
You go in and say, I wanna crank so much cotton

463
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,080
that my mom has to leave the room.

464
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,680
Yeah, and then reverse engineer.

465
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,720
Yes, exactly.

466
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,680
Here's my end goal is I wanna crank

467
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,280
some serious fucking dragon's breath, my man.

468
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,360
And I don't know how to achieve that.

469
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,640
And I want it to also have nicotine for sure,

470
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,800
you know, the illegal stuff.

471
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,640
So that's my outcome, that's my solution.

472
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,360
I need you to get focused on the steps we take

473
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,680
to get there vis-a-vis equipment and technology

474
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,920
and implants, whatever it takes.

475
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,240
Yeah, cause it's like building a lightsaber, right?

476
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,200
You're gonna go through every step with them

477
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,120
and that's how you're gonna master it, right?

478
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,080
And I guarantee someone working at a vape shop

479
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,280
and that's like their job is gonna be super excited

480
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,160
to have some kind of like goal that they're chasing

481
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,920
and not just like give me some great vape.

482
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,840
I imagine there's gonna be a lot of like

483
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,120
steepling of the fingers and let me just,

484
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,560
do you like cinnamon?

485
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,320
We've gotten some new carbides from Vienna, right?

486
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,280
And then they like roll out like kind of a jeweler's mat.

487
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,240
You know?

488
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,720
I'm sorry, I'm just so obsessed with this idea

489
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,440
of your vape rig having to be like your lightsaber

490
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,040
that you put together and choosing the Kyber crystal

491
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,480
that goes inside of it.

492
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,880
And you have to make, I feel like everybody

493
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,800
should have to make their own vape rig.

494
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,480
I don't think you should be able to buy them.

495
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,280
I think it should, this is my vape rig.

496
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,520
There are many like them, but this one is mine.

497
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,440
It's how you learn the responsibility.

498
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,240
You know what I mean?

499
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,800
Like yes, I shape this with my will.

500
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,040
I was thinking about vapes that look like other things

501
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,320
because I'm sure someone has made

502
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,840
like a huge lightsaber vape.

503
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,880
The ones I've seen on the street

504
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,400
all look like lightsabers anyway.

505
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
So I typed in sonic screwdriver

506
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,800
and I'm very upset with Google

507
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,640
and what Google thinks of me

508
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,680
because the auto complete from sonic screwdriver

509
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,600
is sonic screwdriver vape.

510
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,160
And so like Google has my fucking number

511
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,600
in a major way.

512
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,880
Oh no.

513
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,320
You could have poking out of your shirt pocket

514
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,440
a ticket for an R-rated movie.

515
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,960
And so you can walk in and be like,

516
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,920
I would like to buy a vape.

517
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,440
And they're like, wait a minute, how?

518
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,800
And then they'll look in your pocket

519
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,920
and what's that say?

520
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,960
Fatal attraction.

521
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,880
Well.

522
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
Well you must be 40 years old.

523
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,960
If you have a fatal attraction ticket,

524
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,080
you're good to go.

525
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,120
Or maybe just walk in with like holding a baby.

526
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,440
And then you're like, I would like to buy a vape.

527
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,240
And they're like, well,

528
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,720
they have a baby with them.

529
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,520
Hurry it up.

530
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,400
Me and this baby have to go see fatal attraction.

531
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,040
And then I've got to pay my taxes.

532
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,880
My taxes I have as an adult.

533
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,040
Car insurance.

534
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,680
Am I right?

535
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,400
I think you can't bring a baby into a vape shop.

536
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,960
I'm not.

537
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,440
I'm going to revoke that advice.

538
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,480
I don't think you can.

539
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,200
No, no, no.

540
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,560
The baby's 26.

541
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,880
Can you guys not vape just for like a little bit?

542
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,600
Just like clear it out in here.

543
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,320
Can everyone stop?

544
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,840
The baby's a cop too.

545
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,320
Yeah.

546
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,360
And it is a baby,

547
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,160
but it's trained for this shit.

548
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,600
It only exhales.

549
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,680
This baby's getting too old for this shit.

550
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,400
Because he's four and he's pretending to be a vape baby.

551
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,920
A vape bait baby.

552
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,040
I'd bring him to vape shops to see if they let me have a baby in here.

553
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,720
You've been busted.

554
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,560
This is my vape baby vape-ster.

555
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,200
I'd bring vape-ster into vape shops

556
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,800
and see if they make me take the vape, my vape, vape baby out.

557
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
My vape, vape, vape, vape, vape baby.

558
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,400
And it's legal to have a baby in a vape shop.

559
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,160
So the vape shop doesn't throw you out with the baby.

560
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,360
Then they're busted.

561
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,200
That's a double illegal crime.

562
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,640
Well, let's not throw the vape fog out with the baby water.

563
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,680
Should we go to the money zone?

564
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,120
We're already there.

565
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,840
Look around you.

566
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,200
I built it when you weren't looking.

567
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,080
Now I'm breaking over the entrance.

568
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,680
So you're trapped here forever.

569
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,520
Oh no, I've been, I've been cask of a mamba, a monologue.

570
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,280
No, you got it right, Ferris.

571
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,440
It's cask of a mamba number five a lotto.

572
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,440
Correct.

573
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,760
Hey, I want to tell you all about me undies because Valentine's Day.

574
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,320
Hard pass.

575
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:28,560
What?

576
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,360
Hard pass.

577
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,400
Why?

578
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,320
I don't want to know about your undies.

579
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,760
Oh, I see.

580
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,120
Oh, this is a silly episode.

581
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,080
Yeah, we're having fun not getting the things done that we got to get done in this one contractually.

582
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:48,640
But me undies is great for Valentine's Day because they're, first of all, quality underwear.

583
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,560
They're made out of micromodal fabric, which is three times softer than cotton.

584
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,240
And you can choose from four different cuts of underwear.

585
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,480
There's the prime cut.

586
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,000
There's the flank.

587
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,240
You can get a porterhouse underwear, all of which are available from-

588
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,760
Mine's a T-bone.

589
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,280
Yeah, from Classic Colors.

590
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,800
Ew, Travis!

591
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
Travis!

592
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,920
That was a finger.

593
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,240
It was a stinker.

594
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,120
Yikes.

595
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,720
And it's got adventurous prints.

596
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,080
I recently Marie Kondo'd my whole wardrobe.

597
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,120
And so now I am happy to say that pretty much all the underwear I own is me undies, and that's great.

598
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:37,120
And for Christmas, Rachel got me a me undies onesie that when I was in town in Huntington

599
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,560
for the holidays, you could not get me out of.

600
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,280
It's true.

601
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,480
Yeah, so Valentine's Day, it's a great gift.

602
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,640
And they have lounge pants as well.

603
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,960
So me undies has a great offer for our listeners.

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,520

00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,120
That's meundies.com slash my brother.

607
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,080
All one word.

608
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,240
I would like to tell you about Stitch Fix.

609
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,880
Do it, Howard.

610
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,840
I don't know who was at-

611
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,360
I don't know who was at PodCon.

612
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,800
And I don't know who's seen pictures of PodCon.

613
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
Oh, shit.

614
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,840
But I got this sweater.

615
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,960
Well, one, okay, everything in the getting ready room for all the podcasters.

616
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,840
Everybody.

617
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,400
Everybody.

618
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,720
I think Hank and I were wearing the same pants at one point.

619
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,520
I fucking ran into Hank at the airport wearing the sweater that I saw him wear.

620
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,600
I packed the sweater that I saw him wearing during the opening ceremony.

621
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,800
And I had it.

622
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,200
It was my only clean shirt left on the day I was traveling home.

623
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,240
And it's like, oh, it's fine.

624
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,960
I won't see Hank.

625
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,960
Saw him in the fucking airport line.

626
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,400
But basically, anyone who has tried Stitch Fix is like into it.

627
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:42,960
Yes.

628
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,040
I got this sweater that I wore at PodCon that had like a blue bow on it.

629
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,160
And like nonstop-

630
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,360
That was a Stitch Fix?

631
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,160
Yeah.

632
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,360
Damn, that's a good sweater.

633
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,720
I know, nonstop.

634
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,040
People are like, great sweater, great sweater, great sweater.

635
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,640
And that's the thing is if you're looking to up your game, Stitch Fix is the way to do it

636
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,480
because they don't just send you stuff.

637
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,440
Like they talk to you.

638
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,320
They ask you questions.

639
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,200
They say, what do you like?

640
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,920
Do you like this?

641
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,000
And they also ask you, and this is my favorite thing, price ranges that you're comfortable

642
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,200
spending on clothes.

643
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,320
Because I know like I don't want a $200 t-shirt.

644
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,840
Like me and Macklemore both agree that's ridiculous.

645
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,120
And so you would say like, I don't want to pay more than blank for a t-shirt.

646
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,120
So they tailor not only the style, but the prices to you as well.

647
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,240
And you work with a personal stylist who will handpick those items for you.

648
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,040
And then if you don't like something, you send it back and you don't have to pay for it.

649
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,720
And that also helps them shape your profile so that the next time it's even more accurate.

650
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,000
How do I get this box?

651
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,960
How do I get this wonderful box?

652
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,320

Hello, this is Amy Mann.

658
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,400
And I'm Ted Leo.

659
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,120
And we have a podcast called The Art of Process.

660
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,840
We're talking about how the creative process is in itself an art form in our opinion.

661
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,360
There are underlying forms and structures that serve as a scaffolding for any creative endeavor.

662
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,960
We've been lucky enough over the past year to talk to some of our friends and acquaintances

663
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,400
from across the creative spectrum to find out how they actually work.

664
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,440
We weirdly don't know as many musicians as you would expect.

665
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,760
New episodes will be coming every other Monday.

666
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,440

So please listen and subscribe at maximumfun.org or wherever you get your podcast.

668
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,600
Do y'all want a Yahoo?

669
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,040
I would love that, Griffin.

670
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,080
It's sent in by Sid Ross, this Yahoo Answers user.

671
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,580
Shh.

672
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:48,400
Who asks, can a locksmith break into every door?

673
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,320
This one I wanted to talk about because-

674
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,460
Okay.

675
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,560
I would hope.

676
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,840
A locksmith can just kind of get in there.

677
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,200
A locksmith motto could be we just get in there.

678
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,320
When you can't get in there and you need to and it's yours,

679
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,000
the locksmith will be there for you.

680
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,480
That seems wild to me that there's a career, a profession in there.

681
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,720
There's probably a career out there called lock maker.

682
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,640
And then there's an evil sort of in-

683
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,320
I'm not saying all locksmiths are evil,

684
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,840
but I'm saying if they could be,

685
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,680
you know how they don't trust the X-Men because of their mutant powers

686
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,680
and they could do infinite evil with it?

687
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,280
I'm just saying I don't know why we're sort of allowing locksmiths

688
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,960
to be so footloose and fancy free with their stuff.

689
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,920
I don't know.

690
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,120
I'm sitting here trying to think of another profession

691
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,520
that is so closely related to like burglaring.

692
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,240
You know, like there is not another-

693
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,640
It's not like, oh yeah, I'm a wall scaler.

694
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,560
If you need me to scale,

695
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,760
I'm a professional guy who cuts holes in skylights.

696
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,720
If you've ever locked your keys in your home

697
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,200
and then had to call a locksmith to come help you out,

698
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,920
I think that it is a universal human experience

699
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,640
to watch someone break into your door in 20 seconds and go, huh.

700
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,200
Yeah, okay, huh.

701
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,160
Locksmiths, if you can at least pretend like it's a challenge

702
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:22,800
and sit there and be like,

703
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,040
well, this is the toughest lock I've ever seen.

704
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,880
Something like that just to make me feel like,

705
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,120
oh, this is going to take me at least an hour and a half

706
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,840
giving you plenty of time to call the police if you needed to,

707
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,800
but you don't.

708
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,920
Pulling this lock requires an extremely loud drill.

709
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,760
A rare tool that only I own and will melt down after I'm done over.

710
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,120
Here, I'm going to leave this with you.

711
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,640
Only I know how to unlock this door.

712
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,280
Now kill me.

713
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,560
That'll be $150.

714
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,520
Good, now kill me.

715
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,360
Kill me, that's the only way you're safe.

716
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,440
That'll be $150 for another 50.

717
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,000
You can clip out my tongue with these hedge trimmers.

718
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,160
Now drive this ice pick up my nose.

719
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,520
Nope, a little to the left.

720
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,640
Got it, there he goes.

721
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,080
Now that you think about it,

722
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,160
it's like paying somebody to point a knife at you.

723
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,560
I'm not saying that there shouldn't be locksmiths.

724
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,880
I'm not saying that all locksmiths are using their powers.

725
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,080
Probably most aren't.

726
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,240
That's probably a pretty good way to lose.

727
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,920
Most locksmiths are not.

728
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,680
Yes, but I mean,

729
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:32,720
I mean, there needs to be a checks and balances system.

730
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,320
Do you think they show up for monthly meetings of a locksmith union or something and they're like,

731
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,680
what, where's Debbie?

732
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,360
It was like, oh, she went rogue.

733
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:41,600
Yeah.

734
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,600
Oh no, yeah, she went to the dark side.

735
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,440
Debbie's a rogue nation now.

736
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,680
Yeah, well, we're going to have to hunt her and bring her in

737
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,560
so that she doesn't give other locksmiths a bad name.

738
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,600
But she's in a house behind 11 locked doors.

739
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,560
Oh no.

740
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,040
Are you guys tough enough for this challenge?

741
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,120
Yeah, just saying.

742
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,240
So anyway, let's keep an eye out.

743
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,240
Become the monster, but still be, you know, just keep an eye on locksmiths.

744
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,080
Do you think that every locksmith owns in their possession

745
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,640
a small locked box that they cannot open?

746
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,280
And if they do, they die?

747
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,720
The paradox lock.

748
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,800
Because they want to open it because it's a challenge, right?

749
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,600
Like they love doing, they love picking locks.

750
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,920
And it's like, hey, here's a lock that's unique to you.

751
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,240
No one else has ever picked this lock before.

752
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,880
Yeah.

753
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,840
But if you open it, you die.

754
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,480
Well, there's a pandemonium cube and locksmiths read it

755
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,720
as always blowing up about the pandemonium cube

756
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,120
because somebody's like, Debbie shows up and Debbie's like,

757
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,560
I think I got it, I think I got it.

758
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,760
And then she tries to pick it.

759
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,240
And then she, of course, gets turned into a skeleton

760
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,920
because she didn't, she forgot to turn that one sort of bust of the devil.

761
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,560
There's also the million fasted crystal of Akumara that a lot of people,

762
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,040
of course, you need a lot of souls to unlock that.

763
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,640
And that one's tricky.

764
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,720
Some people will tell you they're connected

765
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,160
and you need one to unlock the other.

766
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,680
I don't know.

767
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,280
I mean, we can talk about it in the forums all day.

768
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,920
You know what I mean?

769
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,600
But when it comes down to it,

770
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,160
I guess I'm just afraid of the power of the locksmith that opens it.

771
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,800
Yes, yes.

772
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,760
And what they might become.

773
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,320
Especially because they will definitely need to be in possession

774
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,000
of Igalatia's screaming blade.

775
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,360
And I feel like that is what really trips me out.

776
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,440
And the 100 wishes you get from the pandemonium cube

777
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,160
just seems excessive because you're going to change everything.

778
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,640
It seems like that amount of wishes is designed

779
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,680
to make you lose track of how many you have left.

780
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,760
Because it's not as though there's a counter on there.

781
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,200
Well, there might be.

782
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,720
Nobody's been inside the pandemonium.

783
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,000
There might be a little like LL.

784
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,040
Well, that's not necessarily true, Griffin,

785
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,320
because I have heard voices from inside the pandemonium cube

786
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,440
whispering to me the lock combination.

787
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,600
And I don't know if I trust it.

788
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,080
That's a trick.

789
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
They want to turn you into bones, Trav.

790
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,240
That's a trick.

791
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,360
That's an old trick.

792
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,120
You know fucking better than that.

793
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,280
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

794
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:17,600
What?

795
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,880
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

796
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,960
This is what the voice sounds like.

797
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,080
I want a munch.

798
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,200
Squad.

799
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,120
I want too much.

800
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,160
Squad?

801
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,720
D, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d.

802
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,280
It's a little sad this year for Valentine's Day

803
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,040
that because of the Necco company going out of business,

804
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,760
we're not going to have the conversation hearts just like-

805
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,080
What?

806
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,040
Right?

807
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,680
Yeah.

808
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,200
I didn't know that happened.

809
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,000
Yeah, bud.

810
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,400
Necco's out of business and there's no candy hearts.

811
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,480
It seems wild that someone hasn't like swooped in and just like-

812
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,600
Oh, swooped in and inherited that incredibly successful

813
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,080
business plan of making yucky chalk candy

814
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,600
that got them closed down?

815
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,640
They have been bought.

816
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,560
The Necco company has been bought by the people who make-

817
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,400
Chalk.

818
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,600
No, the dumb, dumb people.

819
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,560
But they didn't have time to make the new ones this year.

820
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,760
So there is a gap, right?

821
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,320
Anywhere there's a gap in culture,

822
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,240
you can count on one company that's always 1k away from disaster.

823
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,360
It's Krispy Kreme and they're introducing a line

824
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,840
of Valentine's conversation heart donuts.

825
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,340
Ooh.

826
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,000
And they are basically just doing the thing

827
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,200
that they're not sure if anyone could sue them,

828
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,160
is what I would guess.

829
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,360
Currently, they're not sure who would sue them.

830
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,280
So they're just going to go ahead and do it.

831
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
And it's just donuts that look like those,

832
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,840
except they're very big and they have phrases like,

833
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,240
I heart you or pick me or all the feels.

834
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,760
Oh, yowza!

835
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,680
Hachi-machi, folks. Hey, folks, this is for maybe you.

836
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,880
Real quick sidebar.

837
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,920
Emotions are the thing that make life worth living

838
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,120
and separate us from sort of the animals and refrigerators

839
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,040
and all the other things that aren't people.

840
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,160
Can we not reduce the entire human experience

841
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,920
to the word feels?

842
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,320
Can we just be sad or happy or horny for donuts

843
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,520
or whatever it may be?

844
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,720
Anyway, so these are giant conversational hearts

845
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,440
that say things and they also say DM me on them.

846
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,640
So fuck it, I guess.

847
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,640
Fuck it, anything goes.

848
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,960
Why do they want you to play Dungeons and Dragons with them?

849
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,480
They got Hachi-machi.

850
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,760
They got four classic Krispy Kreme fillings.

851
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
That classic is spelled with the C.

852
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,280
Do not fret.

853
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,800
Cake batter, strawberries and cream,

854
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,840
raspberry filled and chocolate cream.

855
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,400
Mystery.

856
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:00,960
Mystery.

857
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
Cream. Power.

858
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,480
Loose flour.

859
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,040
Spare change.

860
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,960
Finding the right word can be like, I don't know, hard.

861
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,080
And there's a four dot ellipses here.

862
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,200
So I'm trying to punch my monitor and I'm just hurting my hand.

863
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,320
I can't shatter the screen.

864
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,760
But eating a donut is easy.

865
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,800
Well, so we printed the right words on the donuts

866
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,440
for you so you can't mess this up.

867
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,880
Save, again, Dave Skinna, chief marketing officer

868
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,040
for Krispy Kreme Donuts in, I would say,

869
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,920
a rare display of how these companies do, in fact,

870
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,720
feel about their core customer base.

871
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,680
Hey, dumb, dumb.

872
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,720
You know how you can't express how you feel good?

873
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,640
We wrote DM me on a fucking donut

874
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,880
so you can shove it your gob and cry.

875
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,480
Anyway, eat these.

876
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,520
No one's going to sue us.

877
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,320
We're invincible this year.

878
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,960
You can get one of these for free

879
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,080
if you're a Krispy Kreme rewards member.

880
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,160
You can get a free conversation heart donut of choice

881
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,200
with any purchase on Wednesday, February 6th.

882
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,320
If you're not already a rewards member, don't miss out.

883
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:48,800
Sign up at H-T-T-P-S colon slash slash W-W-W dot K-R-I-S-P-Y-K-R-E-M-E dot C-O-M slash A-C-C-O-U-N-T slash C-R-E-A-T-E dash A-C-C-O-U-N-T.

884
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,440
I look forward to someone remixing that.

885
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,920
That is the address to sign up for it.

886
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,520
Yeah, yeah, they couldn't get a bit.ly link going.

887
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,280
Couldn't get a bit.ly going.

888
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:08,560
And don't forget to show how you hashtag say it with donuts this Valentine's season

889
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:14,160
by tagging Krispy Kreme with a photo of your favorite Valentine's Day donut phrase.

890
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,000
And then it doesn't say this,

891
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,280
but I would say you wanna definitely append the hashtag.

892
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,760
Hashtag say it with donuts.

893
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,360
You know what I like to say with donuts?

894
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:25,680
What?

895
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,400
Woman you DUMP piece of s**t

896
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,000
I can't believe we shared that video, you made me so angry.

897
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,520
I hate your guts.

898
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,940
The only thing I say with donuts is,

899
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,020
it's Saturday morning and I've given up.

900
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,280
Those are the two things that I've.

901
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,120
This is my day.

902
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,440
This is my day, I guess.

903
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,000
I guess I'm putting me on this trajectory of the day.

904
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,840
Another question?

905
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,660
Yeah, I'd love that.

906
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,040
Thank you, Griffin.

907
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,640
Thanks for reminding me of what we're here for.

908
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,920
I hate getting haircuts for a lot of reasons,

909
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,600
but the main one is, I have no idea

910
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,280
what level of enthusiasm I have for them.

911
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,880
I have no idea what level of enthusiasm

912
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,320
I should be displaying while I get my haircut.

913
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,800
I'm pretty awkward, so usually I don't talk

914
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,600
with the hairdresser, meaning that I sit there in silence

915
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,880
looking at my reflection and it seems to me

916
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,880
to have my resting, non-smiling expression.

917
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,720
It seems mean.

918
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,080
It seems mean, thank you,

919
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,320
to have my resting, non-smiling expression.

920
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,260
I always feel like the hairdresser thinks I'm judging them,

921
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,920
but then it feels even weirder

922
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,320
to be smiling the whole time.

923
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,360
Am I supposed to smirk?

924
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,500
Should I close my eyes and pretend to be asleep?

925
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,720
Please help.

926
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,400
That's from anxious in the hair seat.

927
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,960
You're deep in your own feels.

928
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,160
Deep in there, huh?

929
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,960
You're deep in the pocket.

930
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,760
You need to pull up, my friend, pull up.

931
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,000
We're all just in this thing together.

932
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,740
You know, we're all just here together

933
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,960
trying to work it out.

934
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,920
I'm willing to bet money that the hairdresser

935
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,640
is not looking in your face.

936
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,080
They are autopiloting, haircutting,

937
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,480
a thing that they've done 20 times a day

938
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,620
for the last X number of years,

939
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:15,080
and they're like singing a song in their head

940
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,000
or they're thinking about their grocery list or whatever.

941
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,240
I think you're probably okay

942
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,800
to make whatever face you're making,

943
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,040
but let me offer this.

944
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,160
Come in with just a powerful scowl and stay scowling,

945
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,120
but close your eyes while they're cutting your hair

946
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,440
and then open your eyes

947
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,440
and let your face break into a smile

948
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,440
and then reach up and touch your own face.

949
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,460
You can't imagine the feeling.

950
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,760
What is this?

951
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,280
And then hug them and begin to weep

952
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,360
and then tip them 25%.

953
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,200
Yeah.

954
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,280
That's all, I mean, that's all excellent.

955
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,240
Thank you, Travis.

956
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:54,120
I wanna dwell on the I'm awkward so I don't talk.

957
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,600
I think that part of that is just practice, my friends.

958
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,320
It's, you know, awkward just means I don't know what to say,

959
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,060
so maybe start thinking of some things

960
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,760
that might be good to say to somebody

961
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,720
while they're cutting their hair.

962
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,240
You know what I like to do?

963
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,760
I like, I have different people

964
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,880
cut my hair every single time.

965
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,200
I used to go to my guy Sunny up at Master Cuts.

966
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,880
Can't always get Sunny reliably,

967
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,280
so now I'm a vagabond.

968
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,880
I go where the wind takes me.

969
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,160
Last time I had my hair cut,

970
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,160
it was in the basement of this hotel in Cincinnati

971
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,880
when I was gonna go to BB's birthday party.

972
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,960
I got my hair cut at eight in the morning

973
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,320
down in some basement of a hotel.

974
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,080
I'm, it's random for me,

975
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,480
but you know what I like to ask somebody?

976
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,840
How did you get started cutting hair?

977
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,680
I'm curious.

978
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,520
How long you been doing it?

979
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,200
How long you been doing it?

980
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,400
Do you like doing it?

981
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,680
And you know what?

982
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,800
That's just letting somebody tell you their life story.

983
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,720
You're gonna learn a lot about the industry, the business.

984
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,680
You're gonna learn about them.

985
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:53,280
I think asking, asking questions, folks,

986
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,720
it is very rare that you're gonna go wrong.

987
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,240
Everybody, read your, you know, your Dale Carnegie.

988
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,480
People wanna talk about themselves.

989
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,520
And if you are uncomfortable talking,

990
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,360
then you're never gonna go wrong

991
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,040
just asking the person about their life.

992
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,040
You're gonna learn something.

993
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,160
You're gonna connect a little bit.

994
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,480
It goes down smooth every time.

995
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,280
Let the fear make you the monster.

996
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,360
The last time I had my hair cut

997
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,480
was by a guy on Route 60 who had a little stand

998
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,240
with a sign outside that said, cash only, $12.

999
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,120
Justin, what are you, what's your game?

1000
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:27,960
Are you okay?

1001
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,240
I went and sat down and he spent,

1002
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,880
I asked a couple of questions about this person.

1003
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,760
And then he spent 30 minutes telling me the story,

1004
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,760
the grand tale of how his wife always wants to buy things

1005
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,480
that are too large for rooms and then pick paint

1006
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,720
that's too dark for the rooms

1007
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,320
to make them seem even smaller.

1008
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,240
And he is so tripped out about this

1009
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,800
that he spent half an hour walking me on a journey

1010
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,760
through his home, which I can now picture in perfect clarity.

1011
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,280
And all the things in each room that are too large

1012
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,400
for the individual rooms.

1013
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,800
And he actually told me that when he,

1014
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,820
he hated the last color of paint so much

1015
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,760
that he asked the person that painted it

1016
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,320
to leave him his number

1017
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,960
because if his wife broke up with him,

1018
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,680
he was going to call them to have them come back

1019
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,480
and paint it a different color because he hated it so much.

1020
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,800
It was a fucking great 30 minutes

1021
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,600
and I got a great haircut out of it.

1022
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,680
Okay, but please walk me through.

1023
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,480
You were driving past and you saw a sign

1024
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,640
that said cash only $12.

1025
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,480
And you were like, screech and pulled in.

1026
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,280
Yeah, I mean, pretty much.

1027
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,080
I was at Google maps.

1028
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:46,320
I stopped at the stop sign and I typed barber into it.

1029
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,600
And I went to the closest place that was around,

1030
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,440
that was there.

1031
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,000
Your game is so wild.

1032
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,760
Does that make you feel alive?

1033
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,000
Is that the point?

1034
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,720
I have two hairstyles, cut and not.

1035
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,640
So it is a binary thing that is taking me

1036
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,240
from longer to shorter.

1037
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,080
That is it.

1038
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,920
That is my style.

1039
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,780
My go-to barber here in Austin made the mistake

1040
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,800
of one of our first sort of sessions together.

1041
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,240
Mentioning Pokemon.

1042
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,400
She talked about wrestling.

1043
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,040
Yeah, she mentioned a wrestling thing

1044
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,200
she'd gone to around town.

1045
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,720
It was one of two things, Justin.

1046
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,560
I thought that was the third.

1047
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,440
Well, Pokemon is basically animal wrestling.

1048
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,840
So I'm not gonna say.

1049
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,240
Yeah, I mean, especially with like a May Champ

1050
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,760
who's got that style or an Incineroar,

1051
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,600
like that one's full.

1052
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,680
And that's 15 seconds.

1053
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,080
Sorry, Griff.

1054
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:35,920
There it goes.

1055
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,760
Save it for next week.

1056
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,240
One last Yahoo to close out?

1057
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,080
Wait, no, no, no.

1058
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,120
Do tell me about the wrestling.

1059
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,800
It's just, you're only allowed to talk about.

1060
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,720
She talked about wrestling.

1061
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,720
Now every time I go see her, I'm like,

1062
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,860
see any good wrestling lately?

1063
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,920
But it was really just the one time.

1064
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,680
It's like how like when you're young

1065
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,680
and you mention in front of your grandparents

1066
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,160
that you are into dinosaurs

1067
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,440
because Jurassic Park just came out.

1068
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,880
And then for the next 25 years,

1069
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,160
you're getting dinosaur books, dinosaur bones,

1070
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,080
actual ones they stole from a museum.

1071
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,280
I hate, Griffin, I feel really bad

1072
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,760
because that was the way that my brain

1073
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,200
completed that anecdote.

1074
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,920
And you told it with perfect efficiency.

1075
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,360
You only told the first 10 seconds

1076
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,520
because that's all you needed.

1077
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,000
The rest of it shook out exactly the way.

1078
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,260
I'm so sorry.

1079
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,000
I wanna thank everybody for.

1080
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,760
You're welcome.

1081
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,120
Oh, come on now, Trav.

1082
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,440
Come on, bud.

1083
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,160
Razzed ya!

1084
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,840
Another famous Travis Razz.

1085
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,960
I wanna thank everybody for listening to our show.

1086
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,200
If you want more stuff that we make,

1087
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,520
go to McElroy, M-C-E-L-R-O-Y dot family,

1088
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,640
and you can find all the shows we make,

1089
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:48,280
all the zany videos, books,

1090
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,080
and most importantly for this particular vignette

1091
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,560
is tours.

1092
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,840
You can go on there and buy tickets

1093
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,760
to our next round of shows

1094
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,760
that are gonna be Thursday, February 7th,

1095
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,000
Birmingham, Alabama,

1096
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,520
and Sunday, February 10th,

1097
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,040
in New Orleans at the Orpheum.

1098
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,960
We're gonna be doing my bim bam at both of those.

1099
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,100
And both of those shows,

1100
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,800
the websites don't even say this yet,

1101
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,480
both of the shows are going to feature

1102
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,200
both Sawbones and Schmaners.

1103
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,960
Yeah, it's a whole lot of shows.

1104
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,880
It's a lot of show,

1105
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,920
and if you go to McElroy dot family

1106
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,760
and click on tours,

1107
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,040
then you can get tickets to those.

1108
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,160
Also, I believe there's a new Monster Factory

1109
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,060
out this week, and y'all.

1110
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,560
It's a good one.

1111
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,760
Oh no, then we gotta do the other part of that

1112
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,160
that I have not done yet, but I will.

1113
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,740
Also, on February 9th in New Orleans,

1114
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,080
we're doing the Adventure Zone,

1115
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,920
so you can get tickets for that as well.

1116
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,880
We haven't sold a lot of tickets for those,

1117
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,200
and we're probably gonna take a fucking bath on this one.

1118
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,180
Folks, come on out.

1119
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,500
We're just so excited to come visit.

1120
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,300
We're just super excited to come,

1121
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,300
but we also don't want this to be the only time we ever do

1122
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,800
because we're bankrupt,

1123
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,760
because nobody came to our show.

1124
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,220
So please come to this show.

1125
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,180
We knew that we didn't have a ton of listeners down there,

1126
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,180
but we wanted them.

1127
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,560
Why are we nagging ourselves?

1128
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,240
This show's gonna kick ass.

1129
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,040
We're gonna sell all this shit until the last day.

1130
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,040
If you fucking miss it,

1131
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,900
you're gonna be kicking your own butt.

1132
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,480
When you put us in a corner,

1133
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,800
when we don't fill a room,

1134
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,200
and we're desperate and hungry,

1135
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,920
that's when we put on the fucking best shows.

1136
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,760
Ask anybody.

1137
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,580
Ask Detroit.

1138
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,240
Ask any city in this great country.

1139
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,840
Don't ask Detroit.

1140
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,680
Don't ask Detroit.

1141
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,520
Specific, ask anywhere else.

1142
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,840
McElroy.Family, just get the fucking tickets, please.

1143
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,620
Please, I have children.

1144
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,540
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1145
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:41,380
for the use of our theme song.

1146
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,480
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1147
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,000
Fantastic, fantastic album.

1148
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,720
Thank you to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

And there's a bunch of new shows.

because we haven't mentioned it in a while,

1161
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,320
and you can pre-order that at TheAdventureZoneComic.com.

1162
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,080
Yeah, should I tie it all up with a nice little ribbon?

1163
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,360
Yes.

1164
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,760
This final Yahoo that was sent in by Seth Carlson,

1165
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,880
the delivery man, thank you.

1166
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,160
It's Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

I'm gonna call them Joe.

1168
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:27,920
Asks,

1169
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,920
The sun?

1170
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,280
Is that sucker big or what?

1171
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,280
Ha ha ha ha.

1172
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,360
My name is Justin McElroy.

1173
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,000
I'm Travis McElroy.

1174
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,680
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1175
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,880
My brother, my brother, and me,

1176
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,160
kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1177
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:53,080
Hey, girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna?

1178
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,160
MaximumFun.org.

1179
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,200
Comedy and culture.

1180
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,240
Artist-owned.

1181
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,880
Listener-supported.

1182
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,440
Is there a dog in a car at a bar on the street?

1183
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,280
Yay!

1184
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,800
I'm Alay Grigoryngo, a small dog owner.

1185
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,760
My dog, Pistachio, howls when she's excited.

1186
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,680
And I'm Ridday Culvert, a big dog owner.

1187
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,920
My dog, Tugboat, tips over when he's sleepy.

1188
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,240
And we co-host a podcast called Can I Pet Your Dog

1189
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,280

We bring you all things dog.

Yes, dog news, dog tech, dogs we met this week.

1192
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,520
We also have pretty famous guests on Butt Legs.

1193
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,240
We're not gonna let them talk about their projects.

1194
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,080
No.

1195
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,920
Just wanna hear about those dogs.

1196
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,520
We don't wanna hear about your stuff, only your dogs.

1197
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,480
So join us every Tuesday on MaxFun.
