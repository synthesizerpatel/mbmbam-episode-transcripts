1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:51,680
Guess who's back? Back again. JC's back. Tell a friend.

6
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,400
That's right, folks. Our main man JC stone rolled away. What's up? What's up now?

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,880
Said it couldn't be done. Sorry, haters. I thought you were talking about the second

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,560
coming of JC ChazÃ©, whose career has hit a major updraft lately.

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,960
I say updraft. That updraft is the perfect word. He's gliding on his success, I think.

10
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,200
He's on a hang glider of success. So this is our special Easter edition. The

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,040
stone of ignorance has been rolled away. There in its place is us. My name is Justin McElroy.

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,680
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy.

13
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,680
We are still alive, but we're sleeping in there.

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,240
Can I say something? I don't want to offend anyone, so I can't stress enough how much this

15
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,920
next statement has no religious connotations whatsoever. But of all the holidays that you

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,040
really look forward to as a kid, Easter is the only one that doesn't translate to adulthood.

17
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,880
You think? There's no baskets when you're an adult.

18
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,280
Okay, so when you're a kid, you celebrate Christmas, then you're an adult, and of course,

19
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,040
Christmas rules. And then you get Halloween, and then you get to be an adult, and you get to

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,000
drink and dress up. Yeah, Halloween gets better, I would say.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,840
Halloween does get better. And like St. Patrick's Day just gets way

22
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,640
more awesome when you get older. Why do you even have St. Patrick's Day

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,320
if you're a kid? What are you doing? Putting food on your milk? Fuck you.

24
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,840
But then Easter, what's the adult equivalent of an Easter basket?

25
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,480
Well, most people see when they reach adulthood, they're so scared of dying, is the thing. So this

26
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,640
day is super wicked, because it means you get to live forever, I guess.

27
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,840
What about jello eggs? Ain't nothing wrong with that.

28
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,000
What about donut eggs, man? You guys get those here?

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,480
Cake eggs. Fake eggs?

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,880
Cake, cake, cake. Fake eggs are baller, because it's like-

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,840
I like rake eggs, which they're eggs, and they're so big you have to eat them with a rake.

32
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,240
These are delicious. This is My Brother, My Brother Meets An Advice Show for the modern era.

33
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,760
Did we cover our names yet? I think we already did that.

34
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,360
Thank you again to everyone who came out to see us perform live in Chicago.

35
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,960
On my birthday. On his birthday.

36
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,560
Our next live show is in the works. No details yet, but we're-

37
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,360
You can always come see my one-man show at the Chuggle Hut, Fake in the Funk.

38
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,000
Fake in the Funk, starring Travis Macklemore.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,080
We can say where our live show will not be.

40
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,920
Okay.

41
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,880
Like, West Coast? Sorry, guys.

42
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,800
Sorry, guys. Eventually, we'll get there.

43
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,280
We know that there's a-

44
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,240
Until we set up a Brother franchise out in the West Coast.

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:38,720
Yeah. We're like rallies. We're sure there's a ton of people who- Actually, I'm sure, because

46
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,720
I see that info on our statistics page, that we have a lot of listeners in California.

47
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,040
It's a beautiful state.

48
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,000
We will get out there. Griffin and I will be out there in June.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,640
We just can't get Travis out there. Well, okay.

50
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,640
We will get out there eventually. That's my promise to the West Coast.

51
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,520
This nation is so goddamn gigantic. Too big for its own good.

52
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,040
Yeah. Too big to fail.

53
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,120
If we could just get rid of the breadbasket, we might be able to get over westward.

54
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,080
But can't do it now because of the breadbasket.

55
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,800
Yeah. Sorry, basket.

56
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,080
So, let's get into the questions.

57
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,880
We did need to talk about something else, though.

58
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,440
Oh, my God.

59
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,520
Griffin, what happened?

60
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,440
About my fucking psychic abilities?

61
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,560
Yeah. About your ability to prognosticate into the future.

62
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,800
I need to stop making jokes because, apparently, my jokes are future truths,

63
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,200
and I don't want to cause the end of the world with a future truth.

64
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,440
Right.

65
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,920
Right. People sent me this link a lot this past week.

66
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,720
This is from ESPN, which is like my favorite website.

67
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,480
Here's the headline. You ready?

68
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,520
Philly Bot to Crank Out First Pitch.

69
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes, that's right.

70
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,480
The University of Pennsylvania has crafted a one-armed,

71
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,960
three-wheeled robot that threw out the opening pitch before Wednesday's game

72
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,800
between the Phillies and the Brewers at Philly Diamond.

73
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,760
That's what they call it.

74
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,640
A robot.

75
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,640
A motherfucking robot.

76
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,360
They spent so much time thinking about if they could.

77
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,200
They didn't stop to think about if they should.

78
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,320
Or if they could.

79
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,560
Did it not work?

80
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,120
No, I guess they did.

81
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,760
They thought about that pretty hard because they did it.

82
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,840
The ball appeared to be traveling no more than 30 or 40 miles an hour.

83
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,200
Do you know what this sounds like to me?

84
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,240
This sounds like a beard.

85
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,920
It sounds to me like they're trying to throw off a

86
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,600
everyone's scent.

87
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,920
Like, oh, look, we made a little wacky robot.

88
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,360
We put a pinwheel on him.

89
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,560
Isn't he harmless?

90
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,320
Meanwhile, in their fucking bullpen, they got Roy Halladay.

91
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,080
They got Cliff Lee, who are human-shaped robots who can pitch a ball

92
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,680
fast enough to just throw it through a car.

93
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,520
The robot's trying to throw this off.

94
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,720
It's the old rope-a-dope.

95
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,320
The robo-dope.

96
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,200
The robo-dope.

97
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,600
And he's saying, you actually heard him.

98
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,280
They said he doesn't have speech circuits, but he actually said after he threw it,

99
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,040
oh, that's as hard as I can.

100
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,720
He said that.

101
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,400
I'm just a robot.

102
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,760
I'm just a robot.

103
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,960
There was a press conference afterwards and a reporter stood up.

104
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,280
He's like, I heard Cole Hamels has bionic legs and arms and they shot him.

105
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,720
They killed him on the spot.

106
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,200
The robot threw, yeah, 30, 40 doesn't sound that bad until it's a robot that's eight feet away

107
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,480
and it wants to eat your brain.

108
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,880
So let's get right to the questions.

109
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,280
How do I get my roommate to stop chewing with his fucking mouth open?

110
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,080
Whenever he eats something, I can hear his disgusting mouth noises from across the room.

111
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,280
I've told him multiple times it makes you want to vomit, but he still does it.

112
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,040
What a fucking cow.

113
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,080
Furious as fuck.

114
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,480
I hope he was typing this like as his roommate watched.

115
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,600
Is he alright looking over his shoulder?

116
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,120
You could do what Justin used to do whenever I chewed with my mouth open and just stand

117
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,120
across the room going, nah, nah, nah, nah.

118
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,080
Did it work?

119
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,880
Yeah, it worked.

120
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,440
Yeah, it worked.

121
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,640
Guys, I don't want to, this may not be the best time to get into this.

122
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,240
Why?

123
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,440
You both have bad mouth chewing policies and practices.

124
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,960
You both chew poorly.

125
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Well, I don't take dainty bites.

126
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,880
Travis takes, Travis is like in a race.

127
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,840
Travis is trying to figure out how few bites he can use to consume because Travis is all

128
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,720
about energy conservation and chewing burns those precious calories that he's gaining

129
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,240
from eating his pizza bagels.

130
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,200
My friend in Trevor in college said I eat like I look like someone's about to take

131
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,160
my food away from me.

132
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,160
You do.

133
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,960
It's some sort of post-apocalyptic future and you've just found this can of gravy.

134
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,040
God forbid anyone tries to move my bowl.

135
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,560
I will take your hand off.

136
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,600
Yeah, he's brutal.

137
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:50,320
Well, it's hard because it sounds like a pretty good little ploy you used on there

138
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,000
telling him that makes you want to throw up.

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,800
Yeah, I think you've tried the direct approach.

140
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,440
Maybe maybe start stealing all the food in the house so he didn't have any food and

141
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,480
then he has to eat somewhere else.

142
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,440
What about that?

143
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,400
I'm going to say you give him the sliced alone treatment and you go right over the

144
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:06,900
top.

145
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,120
You smack and you jaw as loudly as you possibly can.

146
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,120
Every single thing that you eat, like if you could work moans into it like

147
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,680
like you're getting some sort of like pseudo sexual satisfaction from that taco.

148
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
I've eaten some pretty good tacos before, actually.

149
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,200
This might just be wishful thinking and like really optimistic, but I think that the problem

150
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,080
is is that people can't hear their own mouth sounds like.

151
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,600
Yeah, they can.

152
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:39,840
Sure.

153
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,200
I think that people can listen to themselves chew and they're like, that's not so bad.

154
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,000
I think when you eat a good meal, you get all your senses into it.

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,520
You want to touch it, you want to taste it, you want to smell it, you want to see it and

156
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,800
you want to hear it.

157
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,400
And you really want to add to that satisfaction by like letting yourself know that you're

158
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,840
doing a good job eating.

159
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,640
And that's the thing you're eating is making your mouth feel good.

160
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,880
That's why I'm saying moan it up.

161
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,280
Like, by the way, if if I ever if I ever say, hey, what's up with all the eating noises

162
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,640
and you go to tell me that it's considered high praise in some countries, you better

163
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,560
fucking have a plane ticket in your pocket.

164
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,400
That's that's because otherwise you'll make them move away.

165
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,720
They better be flying to a place where it's acceptable, like they better be in practice,

166
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,800
like in training, trying to get ready to eat like a like a caveman or just tell him to

167
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,280
he's only allowed to eat in secret spaces like he has to go into his room.

168
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,000
He can't eat in shared spaces anymore.

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,320
Who is this a thing referring to your bedroom as your secret space?

170
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,680
Is this a thing that didn't catch on here?

171
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,840
I guess, you know, I said that out loud and I go to your secret space, Daryl.

172
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,960
Well, you should just be happy that he does make chewing sounds.

173
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,320
Because what if he didn't have a mouth?

174
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,160
Then you'd feel bad.

175
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,200
What if you were deaf?

176
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,120
What if you were deaf and you couldn't hear any sounds?

177
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,360
Celebrate.

178
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,880
Maybe count your blessings.

179
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,680
Griffin.

180
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,240
What?

181
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,280
You know what I need.

182
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,720
I do.

183
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,800
Um, how about this?

184
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,680
This one was sent in by Galia Ali.

185
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,360
Thanks, sir ma'am.

186
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Big Jeff.

187
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,600
Big Jeff.

188
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,000
Big Jeff asks wrestling themed wedding.

189
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,520
I want to get married in a wrestling ring.

190
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,960
I've got plenty of money to spend.

191
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
My dad won the lottery in 2008.

192
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,320
My girlfriend doesn't even like wrestling, but I do.

193
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
And I want to get married in a wrestling ring.

194
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,480
And then I want Brock Lesnar to come in and beat the shit out everybody.

195
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,760
You know, like he does.

196
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,320
And I want him to F5 my obese aunt.

197
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,840
I don't want a man to attack my new wife, so I want Kelly Kelly to come out and F you

198
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,560
my girlfriend, which would be hot because my girlfriend is a little bigger than Kelly Kelly.

199
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,080
Yeah, I bet, judging from this question, I bet she's a little bigger, I think.

200
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,960
I've only told my girlfriend I want to get married in a wrestling ring,

201
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,000
and she hates it.

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
Frowny face emoticon.

203
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,440
So you say, hey, do you want to get married wrestling?

204
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,800
No, I don't.

205
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,240
OK, well, what about this?

206
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,080
What if I consult the internet?

207
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,600
Let me pay you a picture.

208
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,480
I'm going to move forward as though you said yes.

209
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,600
I've got a loose outline.

210
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,480
It involves Kelly Kelly.

211
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,880
You know your mom's sister?

212
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,080
She's a little overweight.

213
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,000
We're going to get Brock Lesnar to F5 her.

214
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,080
We're going to get Brock Lesnar to furiously try to reload your aunt.

215
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,520
You know what's great?

216
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,880
Because I don't know who any of these people are, he might as well be saying, like, completely

217
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,720
made up mythological names.

218
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,040
To me, it's just completely insane.

219
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,680
If Kelly Kelly is a real person who's become famous for professional wrestling, I'm going

220
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,720
to go hang myself.

221
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,400
What happened to Griffin Kelly Kelly?

222
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:02,960
Kelly Kelly.

223
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,400
He saw Kelly Kelly and hung himself.

224
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,840
Man, this is a...

225
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,680
This is a... did you go to did you go to Big Jeff's wedding?

226
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,600
Yeah, it was pretty good until the Brock Lesnar came out and beat the shit out of everybody.

227
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,800
Who was that?

228
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,760
Is that a real person?

229
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,560
Yeah, I think so.

230
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,680
I think it apparently is.

231
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,200
It was like 50 to one and he whooped everyone's ass.

232
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,320
You know, like he does.

233
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,120
Like he does.

234
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,680
Like he does.

235
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,880
That's Brock Lesnar for you.

236
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,280
They put the cake at the top of a ladder.

237
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,480
They had a ladder match.

238
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,840
A ladder match for the cake.

239
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,040
Yeah, of course.

240
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,880
Although that obese aunt, that fat mom's sister, she got right in there.

241
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,960
After she got reloaded.

242
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,600
In case anyone is wondering, I imagine that it's like when you see a stand up comic in

243
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,760
like everyday life and you're like, be funny.

244
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,560
I bet going into a wrestler and be like, punch me.

245
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,720
He's like, oh, man, I'm off the clock.

246
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,880
I don't I don't want to punch just.

247
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,480
Yeah, but presumably if if this Lesnar person is making an appearance at your show, individual,

248
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,720
he's been compensated richly for the the act of beating.

249
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,200
He's about to deliver to everyone like he does.

250
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,960
Is that what wrestling fans are really like?

251
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,560
Are they really like?

252
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,120
OK, if I if I was a big wrestling fan and I met the rock and the rock beat the shit out of me,

253
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,480
I don't think I'd be a wrestling fan.

254
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,400
I think I'd be a litigant.

255
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,640
Actually, I think I would maybe find like another hobby.

256
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:32,240
Yeah, I don't I don't think that that would continue to be one of my real passions wrestling.

257
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,160
It really caught fire after.

258
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,760
Jake Snig Roberts kicked me in the crotch and threw me down a well.

259
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,480
How was Big Joe sweating?

260
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,480
It was OK instead of handing out rice to throw, they handed out folding chairs.

261
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,720
Booker T killed both of them with a folding chair, so probably not the best wedding.

262
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,920
So they're dead now.

263
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,840
Yeah, I got my Cuisinart back.

264
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,040
And I got to shake hands with Jimmy Superfly Snooka.

265
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,440
It's pretty good, I guess.

266
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,800
Pretty good wedding overall.

267
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,000
It was a pretty good wedding.

268
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,560
Ray Mysterio officiated.

269
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,240
Oh, I swear that was Hacksaw Jim Duggan.

270
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,960
Damn it, I was trying to come up with the Hacksaw Jim Duggan joke.

271
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,480
You should have been like me and not come up with one to say his name

272
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,560
in some sort of context.

273
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,280
Undertaker.

274
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,080
What are we doing?

275
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,320
Yeah, do you want my Paul Bearer impersonation?

276
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,200
Say yes.

277
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,400
I do.

278
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:34,960
You know what?

279
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,320
I'm just assuming he's Christian.

280
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
These could be Jewish services, too.

281
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,760
They could smash a commemorative plastic cup at the end.

282
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,800
They could hoist Big Jeff up on a chair and then pull it out from under him and hit him with it.

283
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,680
I'll take it back.

284
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,280
This sounds like a pretty good wedding.

285
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,840
I think Jeff's wife is being kind of a bitch.

286
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,600
This sounds awesome.

287
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,120
Oh man, it would make the processionals way cooler.

288
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,280
Oh my god.

289
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,480
Yeah.

290
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,440
Instead of here comes the bride.

291
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,400
You walk in your own fucking theme music and jump over the ropes?

292
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,760
Yeah, it was so romantic.

293
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,600
She walked down the aisle to Crazy Train.

294
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,560
There were fireworks and shit.

295
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,280
That's pretty cool.

296
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,720
I think that this-

297
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:24,240
Big Jeff, I usually don't try to get into these things.

298
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,600
I don't get into these sorts of conflicts, but I think your wife is wrong on this one.

299
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,880
I think you're right.

300
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,120
Although it would suck if he showed up and they tried to pull the Montreal screw job on him

301
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,480
and he had to marry somebody else.

302
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,440
That's deep.

303
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,240
That's a deep cut.

304
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
There's one wrestling fan out there who just laughed.

305
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,840
Trust me.

306
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,840
He is in stitches.

307
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,320
Hey, I'm getting married later this year.

308
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,640
Wow.

309
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,360
I just found out that not one, but possibly two of my groomsmen

310
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,040
may not be able to make it to my wedding.

311
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,320
They're both in the Navy, so their schedule is dictated by our commander in chief.

312
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,040
What do I do?

313
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,320
Should I find a couple of second stringers, take their place?

314
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,840
Or should I make two of my other groomsmen walk down with two stinky,

315
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,440
possibly cootie infested girls?

316
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,320
Rich from Seattle.

317
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,920
Ooh, whatever you do.

318
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,840
You don't tell the replacement that they're second stringers.

319
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,040
Yeah.

320
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,680
Yeah, that's not a good framing for it.

321
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,160
Although they probably know that they're not as good as two dudes who are in the Navy.

322
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,160
Yeah, that's true.

323
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
Navy men, naval officers.

324
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,400
I hate to hear this.

325
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,800
That's a tough one because you want it to be those people.

326
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,160
I mean, I'm sure they'd understand.

327
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,040
Yeah.

328
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,400
You gotta have a sit down with that commander in chief.

329
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,680
Yeah, what up Obama?

330
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,200
You gotta go talk to Barry and you gotta figure it out.

331
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Say, listen, let's bend these schedules.

332
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,880
Hey, quick, let's jaw for a second.

333
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,800
Hey, hey, give me some of these jelly beans.

334
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,320
Barry, I know you're busy.

335
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,640
Barry, so help me work this out for a sec.

336
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,520
What is he asking here?

337
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:10,320
I think what he's really asking is, is it acceptable to have backups?

338
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,720
Is it acceptable to have, what's the theater term?

339
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,960
Understudies.

340
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,240
Yeah, can you have that for a wedding?

341
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,840
I don't understand though, he says, should he find second stringers to take to places

342
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,080
or should I make two of my other groomsmen walk down with two stinky,

343
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,440
possibly cootie invested girls?

344
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,640
I'm not sure I understand.

345
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,160
When I think he's asking, do you have someone double up

346
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,440
and like one bridesmaid with two bridesmaids on the other side?

347
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:39,680
Okay.

348
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,480
Nice.

349
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:40,800
Whoa.

350
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,680
Yeah.

351
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,560
That's a pretty tip.

352
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,160
When you do that, you're no longer a groomsman.

353
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,680
You're a coxsman.

354
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,600
The problem is, it's like, who's this ladies man?

355
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,800
If you don't get second stringers, if you don't get understudies,

356
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,120
your side is gonna be out of balance from your bride side.

357
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah, that's true.

358
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,240
And your bride is not gonna like that.

359
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,800
Yeah.

360
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,200
Whoa.

361
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,040
Hey, speaking witch dog, why are you asking us?

362
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,960
You are not making this decision, sir.

363
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,680
Yeah.

364
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,560
Sorry, friend.

365
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,880
You can have all the opinions you want about this.

366
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,080
This is not up to you.

367
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,320
You know what you could do?

368
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,880
What?

369
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,760
Wrestling wedding.

370
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,240
And then it wouldn't matter if it was unbalanced,

371
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,640
because you could have a fucking royal rumple.

372
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,400
And you would think, oh, you would think like the two friends in the Navy,

373
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,400
they're out of town, but then they totally come in with their work and tag in

374
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,040
and then like fucking kick a dude in the face.

375
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,720
I thought they retired from weddings.

376
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,640
This is amazing.

377
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,640
Oh my god, it's Drew Carey.

378
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,920
Drew Carey's in the mix now.

379
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,040
See, that's appropriate, because he was in the Navy, right?

380
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,560
And he was in the royal rumble.

381
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,800
My grooms would look a lot older than I remember them.

382
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,200
They don't look like they're in very good shape.

383
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,200
But their face paint looks amazing.

384
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,320
Did you see Kelly Kelly?

385
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,400
She looks so beautiful.

386
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,600
Assuming it's a she, she looks beautiful.

387
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,400
Assuming Kelly Kelly is a woman.

388
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
She's one of the, she's part of the glow, right?

389
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,680
The gorgeous ladies of wrestling.

390
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,640
Is that still an entity?

391
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,480
Is that, I haven't kept up.

392
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,200
That is the most offensive name I've ever heard.

393
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,120
Is that really a title for a group?

394
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,880
I don't think it's extant, but yes.

395
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,040
They used to show gorgeous ladies of wrestling.

396
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,360
Saturday mornings, I think.

397
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,720
I think you gotta go with two second stringers.

398
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,760
Holograms.

399
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,480
Holograms.

400
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,720
If you tell me that the Navy doesn't have that kind of technology,

401
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,240
you're gonna fuck right off,

402
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,880
because they all live in boats under the sea.

403
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,040
What is the odds on cardboard cutouts?

404
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,960
What is the situation with that?

405
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,320
That the lady could like just kind of carry down.

406
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,520
What about animatronics?

407
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,640
Oh shit.

408
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,320
I love animatronics.

409
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,960
You call the fungineers at Disney, they'll set you right up.

410
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,320
The sorry?

411
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,280
The fungineers?

412
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,840
The fungineers?

413
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,960
Yeah, they make fungineers.

414
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,160
The imaginauts.

415
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,200
The imaginauts.

416
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,880
Imaginistas.

417
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,600
Guys, listen, we don't need to give him-

418
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,280
Call the creationoids.

419
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,920
We don't need to give him a bunch of

420
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,200
phony baloney bullshit answers like cardboard cutouts and robots.

421
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,800
Let's talk about holograms.

422
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,960
Let's talk about real tech.

423
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,600
Will.i.am taught me this technology exists.

424
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,920
I have seen Wolf Blitzer made of light.

425
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,920
As opposed to the regular Wolf Blitzer that's made of pure darkness.

426
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,680
He's the most hateful man in America.

427
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,000
That's statistics.

428
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,760
Rich, I think you gotta get backups.

429
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,240
Just get two other guys you know sort of well,

430
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,720
and if your roommates or your good groomsmen should happen to make it,

431
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,480
you just gotta give those guys the old heave-ho.

432
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,720
Mm-hmm, and bonus if they kind of look like your two original choices,

433
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,320
and you only shoot them in wide shots.

434
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,240
It's good to- but they do have to do their stunts.

435
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,920
Last year, I met an incredible girl who I've since developed feelings for.

436
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,080
Unfortunately, she was in a relationship at the time.

437
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,960
Recently, however, they've gone through a messy and drawn-out breakup.

438
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,480
So now she's single, but seems to have a fair bit of baggage to deal with.

439
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,440
I know she's interested in me, and I think I can make her happy.

440
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,640
The problem is that I've been with girls who just come out of relationships before,

441
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,480
and it's always turned out pretty badly.

442
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,560
Am I better off giving her space now and risk missing my chance,

443
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,760
or making a move in the hope that this time will be different?

444
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,560
Tim.

445
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,080
Girls fresh out of relationships.

446
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,000
The- you know that I've heard that refer to the rebound they call it sometimes.

447
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,800
The rebound.

448
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,320
Well, yes, but like, I started dating Teresa pretty fresh out of a relationship.

449
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,040
Granted, that one wasn't messy or drawn out or anything.

450
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,680
I think that that's the component of this, that it's not that she's fresh out of a relationship,

451
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,280
but that it didn't end well.

452
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
That's where it gets a little bit dicey.

453
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,400
I think that anytime- I think you gotta put your heart out there.

454
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,640
I don't think you can worry too much about the situations that lead people into,

455
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,920
where, you know, where they ended up. When I started dating my wife,

456
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:17,840
she was out of a four or five year relationship, fresh out, matter of fact.

457
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,360
She was just waiting for her knight in shining armor, her special warrior,

458
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,280
as I refer to myself unironically, to sweep her off her feet.

459
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,680
I've totally flipped. I'm with you, Justin.

460
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,120
What's the worst that's gonna happen?

461
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Like, so either you don't take a shot,

462
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,720
or you take a shot and it doesn't work out. The end result is still the same.

463
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,760
But what if you take that shot and it totally works out?

464
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,280
Yeah, take that shot. There's other girls, trust me.

465
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,880
Just take that shot and-

466
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,920
Here's another point.

467
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,440
What if you die before the end of this podcast?

468
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,320
What if you should- here's what you should do.

469
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,440
In fact, bad news, you will die at the end of this podcast.

470
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,560
We'll try to stretch it out as much as we can.

471
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:06,560
You have one podcast left to live. If you only had one podcast left, I would just spend it with us, I hope.

472
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,560
Tim, just call her right now.

473
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,560
Live like you were dying at the end of this podcast.

474
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,560
Pick it up, call her, fuck it, right?

475
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,560
I mean, if it doesn't work out, oh well, you learned a valuable lesson.

476
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,560
It sounds like you may have already actually learned that lesson before with other girls.

477
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,560
But you obviously haven't learned it hard enough.

478
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,560
You'll still be alone and you'll still be facing imminent death.

479
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,560
Yep.

480
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,560
Just constantly.

481
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,560
What's up now?

482
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,560
What is up?

483
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,560
Welcome to our comedy podcast.

484
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,560
Welcome to our comedy podcast that we have together.

485
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,560
It's called Death is Creepin'.

486
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,560
Death be creepin', you best be callin'.

487
00:23:52,560 --> 00:24:02,560
That's our new segment where you make peace with your impending doom and you just go ahead and call her already.

488
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
This Yahoo was sent in by Louie Dog.

489
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,560
Thanks Louie Dog.

490
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user Leprechaun Tori.

491
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,560
Leprechaun Tori asks,

492
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:20,560
My best friend and I are starting up a babysitting company where we live and we need a name. Any help?

493
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,560
Right. She's 14 and I'm going to be 14 in May.

494
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:30,560
We are both CPR certified and we both most definitely want to be babysitters.

495
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,560
Our names are Aja, her, and Victoria, me, but I like to be called Tori.

496
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Thank you to all who help and tribute.

497
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,560
We had a name, but we decided we didn't like it.

498
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,560
It was Monsters and Fairy Tales, but it didn't stick with us.

499
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:52,560
Baby Smothers Incorporated.

500
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,560
Nope, nope, nope. That's really bad.

501
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,560
That's pretty bad.

502
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
Marginally better than Monsters and Fairy Tales.

503
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Honey, look in the phone book for something relating to babysitters.

504
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,560
We got Monsters and Fairy Tales.

505
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,560
I don't know what kind of service or product they provide though.

506
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,560
What about the Snuggle Core? Is that good?

507
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Like C-O-R-P-S?

508
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,560
Yeah, C-O-R-P-S.

509
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,560
What about the Snuggle Army?

510
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
That is also my favorite.

511
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,560
That's my favorite genre by the way right now.

512
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Snuggle Core. Have you heard it?

513
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
It's really good.

514
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,560
That's what Hinder is, right?

515
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
I've never heard Hinder.

516
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
Hinder is Snuggle Core.

517
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Let me just, let me drop some.

518
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
What about Enron?

519
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,560
They're not using it anymore, right?

520
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
The Enron of babysitting.

521
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,560
I have a few Yahoo responses.

522
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Oh, good.

523
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,560
John says, Prestige Worldwide.

524
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
Wait, what?

525
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
Prestige?

526
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,560
Yeah, like Prestige, only you spell it wrong because you're 14.

527
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,560
It's kind of like how Kidz Bop has like a Z and the Z is also backwards.

528
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
Sure, okay.

529
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Hey officer, Kidz Bop would be a pretty good name.

530
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Adriana says, Super Sitters.

531
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,560
Care for critters.

532
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Care for kids.

533
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Nancy is misleading.

534
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,560
Aja and Tori, the two that complete the story.

535
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,560
Wait, what?

536
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,560
Aja and Tori, more for the glory.

537
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,560
What?

538
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
What?

539
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,560
Are they barbarians?

540
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,560
What is their career?

541
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
More for the glory?

542
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,560
This was some glorious babysitting today, Tori.

543
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,560
The day is ours.

544
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,560
T'was.

545
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:43,560
We shall bathe this day in Valhalla.

546
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,560
Youngsters helping the young ones.

547
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,560
That's good because you want to really reinforce your leaving your children with children, other children.

548
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,560
Irresponsible children watching children.

549
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,560
Babies helping babies.

550
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
Barely out of puberty, ink.

551
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,560
The circle of baby help.

552
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,560
You can call it who's babysitting who.

553
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
Who let the babies out?

554
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
We would never.

555
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
What about that?

556
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,560
That's pretty good, right?

557
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Runts and Rugrats.

558
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,560
See, there you have trademark issues with both the candy and the television.

559
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
You gotta get some z's in there.

560
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,560
You gotta get some z's.

561
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
Runts.

562
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,560
Runts.

563
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
And Rugrats.

564
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:32,560
What about rug with two g's to make it hard?

565
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,560
This is the most street babysitting outfit I think ever.

566
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
Pretty much.

567
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,560
If you want street babysitting that's just really raw and really what's happening today,

568
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,560
get rug with two g's and Rugrats.

569
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:54,560
It's hard to get on this baby's level unless you are as street as it is.

570
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
We're talking like fresh out of the womb.

571
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,560
There are babies who are so street.

572
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
So street wise.

573
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,560
Since your baby was fresh out of the womb, it's been so street.

574
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:08,560
Where do you find care that matches that level of real core authenticity?

575
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
I find it with Rugrats.

576
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
It's got two g's and a z.

577
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,560
And the z is backwards in the phone book.

578
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
I didn't know they could do.

579
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,560
They're gonna have to pay a premium for that.

580
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,560
But I think it's gonna be worth it.

581
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:24,560
I want you guys to know that I zoned out because I started picturing street babies and they

582
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
made me really happy.

583
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,560
Yeah, I mean I think it's a pretty positive mental image.

584
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,560
But if only we could write some jokes about it too.

585
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,560
You can't get lost along the path here.

586
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
No, no, no.

587
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,560
Listen, Travis is on to some next level shit because we don't really need to tell jokes

588
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,560
anymore.

589
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:45,560
We can just paint images in our listeners minds and they can come up with the jokes

590
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
themselves.

591
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
I am so tired right now.

592
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,560
Imagine babies with gold teeth.

593
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,560
Everybody, get this picture in your mind that Travis is painting.

594
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
Really think about it.

595
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,560
Gold teeth.

596
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,560
Bandana.

597
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,560
Maybe a tattoo that says, uh, rug's life.

598
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
Good.

599
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,560
Rug life.

600
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
Okay.

601
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,560
Love it.

602
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,560
That's it.

603
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,560
What is that baby listening to?

604
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,560
Baby Tupac.

605
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,560
It's reincarnated Tupac.

606
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,560
No, trick question.

607
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
No, trick question.

608
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560
Tupac's still alive.

609
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,560
So it's not reincarnated Tupac.

610
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,560
Except it's T-W-O-Pac.

611
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
Because he's terrible.

612
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,560
Terrible Tupac.

613
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,560
He's listening to, uh, oh fuck.

614
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
What was it?

615
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Lamb chop.

616
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
Biggie.

617
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
Good, man.

618
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,560
Fuck.

619
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
Lamb chop, but also Biggie.

620
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
Lamb chop and Biggie.

621
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
Oh, fuck.

622
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
You are zinging this one.

623
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
Listen.

624
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Listen, guys.

625
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
Listen.

626
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
Listen.

627
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
Wait.

628
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
Hold on.

629
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Muppet babies.

630
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Don't go.

631
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
Only Biggie's in the mix.

632
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,560
Muppet babies, but, but, but gangsters.

633
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Teletubbies and, and also Busta.

634
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
Fuck.

635
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
No.

636
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,560
See, obviously these jokes aren't working.

637
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,560
Just do them yourself.

638
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
Just wait.

639
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,560
Just wait.

640
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
Listen.

641
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,560
We could get you to there, but we want you to start making up jokes on your own.

642
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,560
The magic was in you the whole time.

643
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,560
Just imagine.

644
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,560
Thug babies.

645
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,560
Uh, okay.

646
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,560
And you're there.

647
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,560
Listen, we, we've, we've stalled for long enough.

648
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Uh, I think, personally, I think we've, we waited, uh, for this, for this journey we're

649
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
about to take right now.

650
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Just a bunch of friends headed to the money zone.

651
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,560
So this year, Curtis Worley wants us to wish his friend, his dear friend, Robbville.

652
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
I'm sorry.

653
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
I tried.

654
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,560
Rob Mumblebup.

655
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
Rob Mumblebup.

656
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
Rob Mulvey.

657
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
Mulvey Hill.

658
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
Yeah, that's it.

659
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
That's good.

660
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
Rob Mulvey Hill.

661
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
I like Mumblebup better.

662
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
All right.

663
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Rob Mumblebup.

664
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
A very happy 27th birthday.

665
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,560
Rob is a huge fan of Mubim Bam.

666
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
We are a, a little late on this one.

667
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,560
His birthday, his birthday was April 2nd.

668
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
Oh, okay.

669
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
Only 23 days late.

670
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,560
Hey, when you go, when you go belated, you go Mubim Bam.

671
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:20,560
That's our, that's our new, uh, sales angle that we're using.

672
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Uh, so, so tell me some things about Rob.

673
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,560
Hit me with some Rob, some Robtoids, as we say.

674
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,560
Um, well, his name is very short.

675
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Very, very easy to spell.

676
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Very quick.

677
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,560
If you're on, if you're doing a standardized test, that's only three bubbles.

678
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
It trips off the tongue.

679
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Right off the next one.

680
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Rob Mumblebup, right off the tongue.

681
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,560
You are still doing that wrong, but go right ahead.

682
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Tell me more.

683
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
I'm intrigued.

684
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,560
You know what the, you know what the BUP's favorite team is?

685
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Tell me.

686
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
The Detroit Red Wings.

687
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
Perfect.

688
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,560
They play hockey.

689
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Love it.

690
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,560
Curtis Vorlie has, uh, included this on his enumerated list of Rob features.

691
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Yeah.

692
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
So the bullet points for Rob.

693
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,560
He took us right to the Rob Zone, and he wrote, um, Detroit Red Wings, parentheses, hockey

694
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
team.

695
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Thanks, Curtis.

696
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
Thanks, Curtis.

697
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
Because we're idiot babies.

698
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
For the vote of confidence.

699
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,560
There are some people on this show that appreciate that kind of insight.

700
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,560
Um, what about his favorite metal band, though?

701
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,560
If I, if you had to pick one, let me hear it now.

702
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,560
Um, it actually doesn't say, here's the thing, Curtis.

703
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,560
I don't want to make Curtis paid for this message, um, to, to honor Rob.

704
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,560
So I don't want to make it all about Curtis, but I feel like I have to give him some advice.

705
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Uh, as far as list making goes, cause he wrote some things about Bob.

706
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
Underwroth.

707
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,560
You don't say.

708
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,560
Is he in Underwroth?

709
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,560
Cause that'd be pretty fresh.

710
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,560
Is it a band that he likes?

711
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,560
Is it a band he doesn't like?

712
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,560
He hates Underwroth.

713
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,560
You should see him.

714
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,560
This is my friend Rob.

715
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,560
He is equivocal about Underwroth.

716
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,560
And then Curtis has really brought it home with his last one.

717
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,560
Yeah.

718
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
Beards.

719
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
Okay.

720
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Does he have a beard?

721
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
He has multiple beards.

722
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,560
Hey, this is multi-beard Rob.

723
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,560
He's my dear, dear friend.

724
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,560
I love him very much.

725
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,560
He has a beard for all occasions.

726
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,560
He did a good job with his accent, though.

727
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
He's a drummer.

728
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
See, that's, that we could work with.

729
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
Yeah.

730
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,560
He makes some giggles about that, but beards?

731
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,560
He's got a beard on his chin.

732
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,560
He's got a beard on his beard.

733
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,560
His nose has a beard.

734
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,560
It's called a mustache, but he calls it his nose beard.

735
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,560
That's why I love Mumble Bup.

736
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,560
He's got a way with words.

737
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,560
Mumble Bup, happy birthday.

738
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Uh, sorry about your friend Curtis.

739
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,560
He, he does, his heart's in the right place.

740
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
God bless him.

741
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,560
But his list making abilities are in oblivion.

742
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,560
They're in space.

743
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,560
He doesn't possess them.

744
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,560
They, they're, they might as well not exist.

745
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Our other, uh, uh, special, special message this week

746
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,560
is from PC perspective, back our first, very first

747
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Can't get enough.

748
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Repeat sponsor.

749
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,560
I heard that their industry business numbers

750
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Yeah, just really good industry business.

751
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,560
Their sums, their money calculations, um, supply and demand

752
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:07,560
I hear it all went up 400 percent.

753
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Whoa.

754
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,560
Wow.

755
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
Right through that glass ceiling.

756
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,560
Seems.

757
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
That's what that means.

758
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,560
Smashed right through it.

759
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,560
We gave them, we gave them a tune and we gave them

760
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,560
that sponsorship and everybody's like, oh, glad I get it.

761
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
They got so corny for PCs.

762
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,560
Now, Griffin, what does, what does PC stand for again?

763
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,560
Uh, it stands for prickly cactus.

764
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Prickly cactus.

765
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,560
Think about it.

766
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,560
I'm not quite sure that's right.

767
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,560
PC perspective is a great spot for information, in-depth

768
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,560
reviews of PC components and technology news.

769
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,560
They got a hardware leaderboard at pcperd.com forward slash

770
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,560
H W L B.

771
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,560
Great page for recommendation to see new PC builds

772
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560
without having to dive into tons of detail.

773
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,560
Guess what guys?

774
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,560
Hit me.

775
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,560
I just checked the leaderboard.

776
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,560
How's your rig?

777
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,560
My rig?

778
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,560
It's number three.

779
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,560
Whoa.

780
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,560
Whoa.

781
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,560
Whoa.

782
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,560
That's a big, that's a good rig.

783
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
The only.

784
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,560
I bet it's putting up.

785
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,560
The only people who are above me are Bill Gates

786
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,560
and the Apple Bill Gates.

787
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,560
Apple Bill Gates?

788
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,560
Uh-huh.

789
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,560
Wow.

790
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,560
Cool.

791
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,560
And he's a PC user, huh?

792
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,560
Uh-huh.

793
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,560
That seems odd to me.

794
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,560
It is weird.

795
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
Hey, know thy enemy.

796
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,560
If you want to discuss how odd that is, you should go to

797
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,560
PCPerforms.

798
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,560
They got a podcast, pcperd.com forward slash podcast,

799
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,560
where they tell you about PC stuff.

800
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,560
It doesn't have as many jokes as ours, but unlike ours,

801
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,560
there is some worth listening to.

802
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,560
I hope they will actually better your life in some way.

803
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,560
I hope that they have jingles about us.

804
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Yeah, I hope they've written a jingle or two about our show.

805
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,560
My brother and my brother and me instead of our show.

806
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,560
Nasty, I'm on the track.

807
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
I have to start again.

808
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,560
So go to pcper.com.

809
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,560
So what have you worked up so far?

810
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,560
You know what?

811
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,560
I've been working on it all morning trying to get a jingle

812
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,560
together that can combine the magic of Rob Bumby book

813
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,560
and PC perspective and the services that they both offer.

814
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,560
And I'd like to take everyone back.

815
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:12,560
I'd like to take everyone back on a journey with me to,

816
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,560
I would say, the soundtrack of the year 2001.

817
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
You think 2001?

818
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,560
Yeah.

819
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
I'm trying to think.

820
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,560
That was my freshman year of high school.

821
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
I was really into Apollo 440 back then.

822
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
Okay.

823
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,560
So maybe if you saw Lost in Space, the film,

824
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,560
maybe if you saw Gone in 60 Seconds, the remake,

825
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,560
you'll know this spoof.

826
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:59,560
Can't stop the Rob.

827
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Can't stop the Rob.

828
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,560
Can't stop the Rob.

829
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,560
Can't stop the Rob.

830
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
Can't stop the Rob.

831
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,560
You can't stop the Rob.

832
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,560
Can't stop the Rob.

833
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,560
You can't stop the Rob.

834
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,560
Can't stop the Rob.

835
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,560
You can't stop the Rob.

836
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Can't stop the Rob.

837
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,560
Can't stop the Rob.

838
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
That's all right.

839
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,560
Hold on.

840
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,560
That's the only...

841
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,560
That's a goof and you know how long I worked on that?

842
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,560
All right, so what I can do is...

843
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,560
So if we had to do a pros and cons of that.

844
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,920
Okay, pro

845
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,920
Rob heavily featured Rob

846
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,280
Khan

847
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:44,080
The lack of any concrete details about this Rob person or our secondary sponsor piece

848
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,640
It's like oh other than that though fucking slam X on their oath

849
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840
He likes a Detroit Red Wings

850
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,160
He has a number of beards

851
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,080
He's got a last name. That's impossible to pronounce. He's a king

852
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
of

853
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,360
Computer Town

854
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,840
He's the king

855
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,760
Of Computer Town

856
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,040
He reads PC per

857
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
Dot com

858
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,440
They've got forums

859
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,640
and a podcast

860
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:34,200
Starring Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob

861
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:44,440
There it is he brought home now except for your insistence that Rob is the star of the PC per podcast

862
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,420
That's really great

863
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,140
Have you listened to it?

864
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:48,980
What?

865
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,300
Have you listened to the PC Pro Podcast?

866
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,140
You know what?

867
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,060
I did.

868
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,900
I did.

869
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,260
Rob, I did not catch him.

870
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,580
Let me ask you a second question, a follow up.

871
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,540
Okay.

872
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,520
Have you seen Gone in 60 Seconds?

873
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,360
Yeah.

874
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,180
Pretty good play.

875
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,540
I don't feel like you guys got the song.

876
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,700
Like you guys got the goof or the spoof.

877
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,700
I have a friend who's a girl, I'm a guy,

878
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,360
who steals all my male friends.

879
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,300
I'll meet someone new,

880
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,420
and then as soon as I meet this girl,

881
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,100
they start hanging out with her instead of me,

882
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,060
a fact she constantly reminds me of.

883
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,860
I've got a chance to win back her most recent theft

884
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,760
at a wedding all three of us are attending.

885
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,260
I need some good advice.

886
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,620
What can I do to win back this bromance?

887
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,700
Thomas.

888
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,000
You know, it's funny we should get that question.

889
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,580
Not it, this is not a spoof.

890
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,660
This is not a goof.

891
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,460
Not, I don't know, an hour or two later,

892
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,720
we received this question.

893
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,060
I have a friend who's a guy

894
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,980
that claims I keep stealing his bros

895
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,600
because they end up calling me to hang out instead of him,

896
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,540
but I can't help that one, I'm more fun to hang out with,

897
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,260
and two, I'm a girl.

898
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,440
He's currently trying to claim

899
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,340
our newest Canadian friend for himself.

900
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,820
How can I keep from him boxing me out of this friendship?

901
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,640
An upcoming wedding is the next time

902
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,780
we all hang out in the same place.

903
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,820
Holy shit.

904
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,580
Is that the best time to make my move?

905
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,880
Obviously, I'll be looking hot.

906
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,020
Daniel.

907
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,860
Or Danielle.

908
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,460
I think probably James, yeah.

909
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,300
Danielli.

910
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,860
I think he got on that second pass, but.

911
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,020
This is incredible.

912
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,480
Has this ever happened before?

913
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,540
This is the dueling.

914
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,880
Hey, brothers, I hate Jeff.

915
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,820
Love, Mark.

916
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,080
Hey, brothers, I hate Mark.

917
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,920
Love, Jeff.

918
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,860
Man, this is a toughie.

919
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,660
I feel like Thomas,

920
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,100
there's something in Thomas' question

921
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,180
where he does not realize

922
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,420
the sort of insurmountable millennia-long odds

923
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,860
that he's up against here.

924
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,420
It's the basic heartbeat of the species

925
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,660
that is thwarting you,

926
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,140
not anything about yourself personally.

927
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,480
Guys, I don't wanna keep beating a dead horse here,

928
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,900
but the best solution is Wedding Mania 29.

929
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,380
Again?

930
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,340
Again.

931
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,220
You smash Thomas with a folding chair.

932
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,260
A wrestle wedding.

933
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,660
Three friends enter, two friends leave.

934
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,060
See, that's what we do.

935
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,460
We get another ladder match.

936
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,300
We put your friends on top of the ladder,

937
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,460
and then Thomas and Danielle, or Danielly,

938
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,280
they just go right at it.

939
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,520
I wanna know what kind of cruel intentions

940
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,780
like these two people are living in

941
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,820
that they are constantly competing over new friends.

942
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,620
Hey, did you steal Philip from me?

943
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,260
Well, I mean, like, we went to Denny's last night.

944
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,300
Is that what you mean?

945
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,140
Like, yeah, in that-

946
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:31,980
You son of a bitch.

947
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,660
You son of a bitch.

948
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,500
Last night-

949
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,320
You got another one, Daniel.

950
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,000
Denny's was our special place.

951
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,420
You asshole.

952
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,980
I told you that in confidence.

953
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:45,140
I told you about how good their griddle cakes are.

954
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,180
Just with secret.

955
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,480
I thought it was a secret.

956
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,980
Why can't you just all be friends?

957
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,060
Why can't you all three be friends?

958
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,020
Is it like every guy wants to, is that the thing?

959
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,260
Is this like, like, is there another perspective

960
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,620
from a friend who's like, I was hanging out with this guy

961
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:07,060
and he had a sexy friend, and then I hung out with her

962
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,660
and now she's, they're both getting weird about it.

963
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,140
They just cry all the time.

964
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,760
It sounds like Danielle is saying that Thomas

965
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,100
kind of sucks to hang out with.

966
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:22,000
Thomas, but he is a great facilitator of new friendships.

967
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,540
He's like a realtor of friendships.

968
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,260
Oh, so Thomas brings them in

969
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,320
and then Danielle's the one who closes.

970
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,940
Right, exactly.

971
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,140
That's bullshit, man.

972
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,560
Danielle, you gotta pass some of that,

973
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,340
some of that sweet friendship juice back to Thomas.

974
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,420
Pass it on down.

975
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,260
Pass it down the line.

976
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,100
Share with your buddy.

977
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,820
To be fair, Danielle's not doing anything wrong.

978
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,580
She's just better than Thomas.

979
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,420
Yeah.

980
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,740
Listen, nobody's saying that Thomas,

981
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,900
nobody's saying Danielle isn't better than Thomas.

982
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,380
Like, that much is obvious just from there.

983
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,380
Do you know how many emoticons Thomas used in his email?

984
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,220
Zero, you know what I mean?

985
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,380
I don't know how he's feeling.

986
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,340
He's like, he's like talking to data.

987
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,420
Danielle used one and it was a winky face,

988
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,540
which is my very favorite emoticon.

989
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,380
Oh, really?

990
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,460
Thomas, you know what helps?

991
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,220
Don't refer to your friendships as bromances.

992
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,060
Yeah, that would,

993
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:07,880
that probably scared him off.

994
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,860
I just met this new guy and we're in a bromance.

995
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,380
Why doesn't he wanna hang out anymore?

996
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,500
We got fly dude kisses all the time.

997
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,340
I think he's a real bromosexual, just like myself,

998
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,140
and I really love hanging out with him.

999
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,100
Can we start referring to like,

1000
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:26,580
can we start calling like high fives and fist pounds

1001
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,400
and like chest bumps?

1002
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,620
Can we just refer to those as dude kisses?

1003
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,620
I think so.

1004
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,180
Just gave him a big bro smooch.

1005
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,820
It's not a big thing.

1006
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,020
Gave him a double fist pound.

1007
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,300
It was real European.

1008
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,140
That's how they do it there.

1009
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,780
I'm gonna get dude kisses going.

1010
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,940
I'm gonna get it started.

1011
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,780
I think you should.

1012
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,060
I think that would be cracking.

1013
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,500
Danielle, stop being so fucking greedy.

1014
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,340
Thomas is so lonely.

1015
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,900
Leave Thomas, be more awesome.

1016
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,980
Why don't you go back in the annals of the history,

1017
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,620
find a friend that you don't like anymore

1018
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,220
and give it back to Thomas.

1019
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,100
Oh, so you're saying like hand me down friends.

1020
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,340
Exactly.

1021
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:09,100
Make new friends, keep the old and give some to Thomas.

1022
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,100
Give some back to Thomas.

1023
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,580
Yeah, he'll appreciate it.

1024
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,380
Think of it as a friendship tax

1025
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,700
because Thomas does a lot for you

1026
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,780
vis-a-vis getting you friends.

1027
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,620
Exactly.

1028
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,780
You gotta kick back like 20% back to him

1029
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,820
and then 10% to social security

1030
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,180
so that when you're old and like ready for death,

1031
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,900
you have some friends that are waiting for you.

1032
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,660
Griffin, yahoos, I need them.

1033
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:35,820
Okay, I found these, I found two

1034
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,140
and I'm gonna try and combine them into one super question

1035
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,700
because they're topical.

1036
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,540
Okay.

1037
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,500
All right, here we go.

1038
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,980
Yahoo Answers user prego asks,

1039
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,140
what to do for Easter with no kids?

1040
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,420
My husband and I have no kids.

1041
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,780
Well, we are expecting.

1042
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,420
Congratulations.

1043
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,580
Way to go guys.

1044
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:01,500
Are there any ideas that we can do for Easter?

1045
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,900
I think it's gonna be raining Sunday too.

1046
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,140
Something fun, like a sexy egg hunt or something.

1047
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,060
Excuse me, sorry?

1048
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,660
Like a sexy egg hunt or something.

1049
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,420
It's the world's fastest egg hunt.

1050
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,180
That's one locale.

1051
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,300
Yahoo Answers user corsair asks,

1052
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,580
what are some good ideas for my boyfriend's Easter eggs?

1053
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,260
My boyfriend and I are being silly this year

1054
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,460
and having an egg hunt

1055
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,580
and we're filling each other's eggs with little things.

1056
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,060
I filled about half with candy

1057
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,580
but I need some cute sexy ideas to fill the rest.

1058
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,220
I'd like a few of them to be rather suggestive

1059
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,660
but nothing is coming to mind.

1060
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,180
The trick is that whatever it is,

1061
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:40,460
it has to fit inside of one of those plastic eggs.

1062
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:41,300
Help?

1063
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,580
So, two questions.

1064
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:48,580
I think the first is more sexy egg hunt general topic ideas.

1065
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,540
Where does one hide a sexy egg hunt egg?

1066
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,660
Second being, what do you fill your sexy eggs with?

1067
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,500
You're saying?

1068
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,340
Mustard gas.

1069
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:59,820
That would suit these people,

1070
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,180
that would serve these people right, I think.

1071
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,300
If that's what they discovered.

1072
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,140
You guys are-

1073
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:08,020
I actually, this year I invented something new for Easter

1074
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:12,180
and it's called a solo solitaire egg hunt.

1075
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,980
What you do is you take a couple Ambien

1076
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,980
and then you hide some eggs

1077
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,140
and then you wake up

1078
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,220
and you try and remember where you put them eggs.

1079
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,700
That's pretty good.

1080
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:25,540
The sweet veil of Ambien has been lifted from your eyes.

1081
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,980
You go searching Memento style for your-

1082
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,060
And inside the eggs, more Ambien.

1083
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,300
Everybody wins.

1084
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,380
Have a great night.

1085
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,780
Happy birthday, Jesus.

1086
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,140
Maybe fill it with lube.

1087
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,620
Hey, I found your, ah, fuck.

1088
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,020
Oh no.

1089
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,140
What did you do?

1090
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,300
You're saying loose lube.

1091
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,140
Not like a one-

1092
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:45,980
I'm saying loose lube-

1093
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,980
Not like a one shot, like a-

1094
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,700
I'm saying when they open it,

1095
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,460
I want it to look like the world's worst pinata.

1096
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,660
Just everywhere, just lube spraying.

1097
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:59,460
My God, there's lube everywhere.

1098
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,340
Honey, in one egg, I've hidden lube.

1099
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,620
In one egg, I just emptied out a squeeze it.

1100
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,420
And you, we gots to keep them straight.

1101
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,420
This is so important.

1102
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,620
This is a Jell-O's is in here.

1103
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,820
Enjoy.

1104
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,260
A lot of people are saying that this is distasteful.

1105
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,100
Oh yeah?

1106
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,660
Just because of the whole Jesus thing, right?

1107
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,820
The whole-

1108
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,180
It's a religious holiday.

1109
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:20,020
Yeah.

1110
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:24,220
And like, I get it, I get it, you guys.

1111
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:28,660
It is maybe not the intended way to spend the holiday,

1112
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,500
but-

1113
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,340
I get it.

1114
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,260
I can't, I'm so down with it.

1115
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,980
Like I'm so down with their, their pioneering.

1116
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:36,260
Here's my main problem with it.

1117
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,460
With all this talk of like sexy egg hunts

1118
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,580
and all this stuff,

1119
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:42,940
how did they bypass painting up your scrotum

1120
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,300
to look like an Easter egg?

1121
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,100
Justin, um-

1122
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:50,260
Yeah.

1123
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,940
What's up?

1124
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:56,940
What if you hid the eggs all over your body?

1125
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,020
Like, like one of those,

1126
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,700
you turn yourself into a sushi platter,

1127
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,660
you turn yourself into like a playground

1128
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:02,940
where you've hidden a bunch of eggs.

1129
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,260
A wonderland, perhaps.

1130
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,780
A wonderland of eggs, of hidden, hidden away eggs.

1131
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,180
I mean-

1132
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,700
I just looked in your armpit,

1133
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,860
checked right between your butt cheeks.

1134
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,220
Right?

1135
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,900
Hey, lift up these, lift up these fat boobs.

1136
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,820
Bound to be one behind your knees.

1137
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,620
Your body is an egg hunt.

1138
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:34,500
Looking inside your ear canal.

1139
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,780
Body is an egg hunt.

1140
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,580
Oh Christ.

1141
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,980
Put a condom in that egg, you silly.

1142
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,220
Silly, it's easy.

1143
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,140
Hey, I wanna hear Griffin's last question.

1144
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,540
But first, a few quick housekeeping things.

1145
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,260
Again, thank you to everybody who came out to Chicago.

1146
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,220
It was a great time.

1147
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,780
Sorry we got the episode up late afterwards.

1148
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,420
It was kind of out of our hands.

1149
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,140
But hopefully this one will be on time.

1150
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,100
I was drunk for four days after that show.

1151
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,540
We were drunk for four days afterwards.

1152
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,380
And if you missed it,

1153
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,900
if you go back through the NBNB AM Twitter feed,

1154
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:12,060
we have a link to a video that was shot of the live show.

1155
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:12,900
So check that out. There might even be one

1156
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,580
with better audio with the actual live show audio.

1157
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,260
And if you go back through Travis's Twitter feed,

1158
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:20,140
you can see a picture taken of me after the live show

1159
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,060
that I do not remember.

1160
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,580
Do not recall being snapped.

1161
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,420
I don't remember the shutter.

1162
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,940
When you were having intimate dude kisses.

1163
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,620
Snapping up on me.

1164
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:32,860
If you wanna hear more of our show, it's NBNBAM.com.

1165
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,100
There's all kinds of episodes there.

1166
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,700
There's the methods of asking us questions there.

1167
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,780
We'd love it if you subscribed to us on iTunes,

1168
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:43,060
give us a rating, a review,

1169
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,380
tell your friends to listen to the show.

1170
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:48,980
You don't want them to die without us tonight.

1171
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,460
And you're the only one who can stand between that.

1172
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,180
Those two things happening.

1173
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,700
That thing that we just said.

1174
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,140
My BIM BAM will stop your friends from dying.

1175
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:58,980
That's what that phrase is.

1176
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,980
My BIM BAM will make your friends live forever.

1177
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,940
My BIM BAM at Maximumfun.org.

1178
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,220
We need your questions.

1179
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,500
We were a little light this week.

1180
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,660
If you had one that you thought was pretty good

1181
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:12,180
and we never broached it, send it again.

1182
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,980
We only get to a few questions per show.

1183
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,380
So, you know.

1184
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,260
As long as it's not scatological

1185
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,460
or masturbatorial in nature.

1186
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,060
Yeah, except in the sense that all of our show

1187
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,420
is masturbatorial in nature.

1188
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,180
But I mean, other than that.

1189
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:30,460
We were just talking about Easter egg vaginas.

1190
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,380
Yeah.

1191
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,420
How do you not jerk it to that?

1192
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:38,420
Not, tote bags should be arriving now-ish.

1193
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,280
If you are a donor who got one of those.

1194
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,500
Other goodies should be arriving the next two weeks or so.

1195
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,960
If you're a Maximum Fun donor.

1196
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,380
So keep an eye out.

1197
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,640
My tote bag came and it was full of money.

1198
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,480
Oh yeah?

1199
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,060
Just like chock full of bills.

1200
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:54,900
Shoo.

1201
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,340
I feel bad for anybody who didn't get one of those.

1202
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,180
Yeah, me too.

1203
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:00,100
You're so rich.

1204
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:00,940
Griffin.

1205
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,460
We got any shout outs?

1206
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,820
Oh yeah, shout outs.

1207
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,300
What's going on on the, oh yeah, Twitter.

1208
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:11,300
If you can tweet about our show with the M-B-A-M ribbon.

1209
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,920
S Diesel has had his Twibbin,

1210
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,980
his My Brother, My Brother, Me Twibbin.

1211
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,280
Are we trending yet?

1212
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,700
Are we trending?

1213
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,740
How's the trip?

1214
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,660
Your Muse.

1215
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,420
They're mostly Easter based.

1216
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:26,680
Of herself with scraps.

1217
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,580
Charlene519 got her tote bag.

1218
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,420
She was excited.

1219
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,700
Mr. Whalen just got Jess on the My Brother, My Brother,

1220
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,980
Me train and she had a jolly good laugh,

1221
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,700
whatever that means in foreign language, I understand.

1222
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,360
I've seen a lot of photos of people with their tote bags

1223
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,700
and they were putting cats and dogs in them

1224
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,740
and carrying them around.

1225
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,460
Not sure how I feel about that.

1226
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,740
I like it.

1227
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,900
That dog or cat can't be comfortable though, can it?

1228
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,460
I think it's the most comfortable, my problem.

1229
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,520
Can I get a JPEG of a dog and a cat in the same bag?

1230
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,920
Can somebody JPEG that for me?

1231
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,440
I don't want any old ass dogs or old ass cats either.

1232
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,760
I want young blood, I want that young stuff.

1233
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,260
I would also like a picture of a dog and a cat

1234
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,040
in a hot tub together just chillin'.

1235
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,880
Just chillin'.

1236
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,360
At the bottom it says just chillin'.

1237
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,000
And then I want a JPEG of you

1238
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,480
and you've hidden an Easter egg somewhere on your body.

1239
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,320
Where is it?

1240
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,220
And send it straight to Griffin.

1241
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,060
I need that in my personal phone.

1242
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:20,880
Those could just go straight to Griffin.

1243
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,960
Send it to lonelyeggs at gmail.com.

1244
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,800
Griffin.

1245
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,540
What did you put in your egg?

1246
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,560
I took half an egg and it's on the tip.

1247
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,440
Griffin, please.

1248
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,200
It looks like the juggernaut.

1249
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,480
God, I'm begging you.

1250
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,320
No.

1251
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,360
Yeah, this is our final question.

1252
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,040
It was sent in by Derek Martz.

1253
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,640
Thank you, Derek.

1254
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,580
It's by Yahoo Answers user Twilight Sparkle who asks,

1255
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:50,520
what's wrong about being sexually attracted to Pokemon?

1256
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,880
I'm Justin McElroy.

1257
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,080
I'm Travis McElroy.

1258
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,440
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1259
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,920
It's been my brother, my brother, me.

1260
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,880
Kiss your dads.

1261
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,320
What do you wear on the lips?

1262
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,520
Keep your heart, three stacks.

1263
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,080
Keep your heart, hey.

1264
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,720
Keep your heart, three stacks.

1265
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,080
Keep your heart, man.

1266
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,720
These girls are smart, three stacks.

1267
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,400
These girls are smart.

1268
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:30,400
Play your part.
