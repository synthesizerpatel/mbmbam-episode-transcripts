1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,520
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,480
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. It's an

7
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,360
interesting energy, Justin. Yeah, it's weird. I'm sweet baby brother 30 under 30 media luminary

8
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,960
Griffin McElroy. I don't know if y'all saw the news. I know y'all did on the call, but y'all

9
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,680
who are listening to the episode. Y'all proper. We're gonna be writing a book, a comic book,

10
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,760
five issues of one. I prefer funny book. There's different classifications. There's

11
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,680
comics and graphic novels, and my art is funny books. I like to do funny books. I like to do the

12
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,600
funny pages. Silly papers. It's called Journey into Mystery. It's part of the, what is it,

13
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,760
Thor Fight series, something about Thor. Thor Fight 2019. Thor's fighting everyone on this one,

14
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:46,880
and we are, I guess the big headline here is we're writing a funny book. It'll be out in April,

15
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:55,120
but we are also officially co-workers with Wolverine. Yep. I'm three cubicles down from

16
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,400
Logan. So I'm in a completely different department from Logan, and my interactions with him are all

17
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,320
in the kitchen, and they are pretty bad because of all the pranks he does to me. I'm kind of his

18
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,880
Dwight. He did my stuff in Jell-O, and he stabbed my dad three times. He stabbed my dad once,

19
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,680
but it counted as three because he has three knives, but how is he being near him? Is he

20
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:25,200
listening to loud music? Yeah, and here's the thing. The motherfucker hums along with the music.

21
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,560
Just under the level of loud enough that you would feel comfortable saying something to Gladys,

22
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,000
the office manager. You're saying Gladys is like, it's not that loud, but it's loud enough

23
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:47,360
that I can't not hear it. Yeah. Hi, guys. It's me, the manager, Justin. Hi, Justin. Hi,

24
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:55,520
Justin. I couldn't help but overhear you all talking about Logan, and I'm not sure that you're

25
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,760
really producing the healthiest work environment with these kinds of comments. Well, Justin,

26
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:09,680
just real quick, I left a note on your desk for HR about the dad-stabbing incident, so I feel like

27
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,200
it's weird that you're coming to me first. I don't want to step on Griffin's toes, but I feel like

28
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,440
the humming thing is as bad as the dad-stabbing thing. Well, multiply mine by three, because again,

29
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,920
three knives in this guy's hand. Yeah, but he hums every day, Griffin. Sure, sure, sure. Okay. Well,

30
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,280
that's a fair point. Listen, guys, why don't you take a seat and we'll get this all sorted out.

31
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,160
Oh, boy. Oh, see, I wasn't looking at our conversation. That was the chair scooting back.

32
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:42,320
That's me sitting down in it. Berkey, could you get? Berkey! Can you get Logan down here?

33
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,720
Oh, goodness. Berkey, get Logan down here and ask him to- I don't want to confront him,

34
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,720
he's a super hero. I'm afraid he's going to get mad. Okay, here he comes. He's going to stay

35
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,920
completely silent though, Trav, so don't worry about it. He won't yell at me. Oh, he's wearing

36
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:08,000
flip flops again. Oh, man. Logan, if you could just sit right there. You remember Travis and Griffin?

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:21,280
Hey, Logan. Hey, Logan. Logan. I'm sorry, can he put the knives in his hand when we're doing this?

38
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,920
I feel like it's a little threatening. I don't know how you- I know you snicked him out,

39
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,840
I don't know what sound it makes when they go back in. Oh, see, when you weren't looking,

40
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,200
he had just one of them out, like the middle finger. And Justin, that's what we're talking

41
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,560
about. That's the kind of shit we're talking about. Logan, guys. Slip your knife back up

42
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,120
into your hand and let's talk about this like adults. Logan, put them away. Thank you. Logan.

43
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,160
I said put them away, Logan.

44
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,840
See, I can't deal with this. How am I supposed to do Marvel's accounting work and write a comic

45
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,640
book while Logan's doing this? Logan, this is uncomfortable. This is- let me back up.

46
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:15,360
You've given a lot of great work to this company. We love the blue and orange and yellow suit.

47
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,920
We were wild about the orange and brown one. And then one day you just refused to wear costumes at

48
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:30,160
all. Yeah, you just kind of went tank top and jeans, which- I'm sorry, I didn't jump in. I was a fan.

49
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:39,360
Thank you. We were all trying to let that slide, Logan, but at this point, we-

50
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,920
Hey guys, do we have to be careful about what we say about a lot of things now?

51
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,160
This is just now occurring to me as I'm trying to inhabit this great character.

52
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,040
No, comedy is all about just being, you know, offensive and being an offensive

53
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,000
rude boy. And so like, I think we can say whatever we want. Devil may care.

54
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,440
Yeah, I think Justin, Frankenstein teen, become the monster.

55
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:03,680
Yeah.

56
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
Deadpool sucks. There.

57
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,800
Oh no, we can't say that.

58
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,120
Take that, Marvel. I don't think you should say that.

59
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,680
No, I enjoyed those movies actually quite a bit.

60
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,680
I just watched- actually, I just watched the second half of the second one. This is being a

61
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,480
father. I watched the first half of the second one two months ago and thought I should circle

62
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,760
back around the second half of the second one.

63
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,600
Hey, can we get back into the bit?

64
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, yeah.

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,600
Yeah, yeah. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

66
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:29,840
Okay.

67
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,080
Okay.

68
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,800
Logan, I just wanted to say that like, you may think you're hot shit with your

69
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,320
knife hands, but I just wanted to say, we are the ones writing this particular comic.

70
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,840
And I don't think you are necessarily in it, but we could put you in it.

71
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,480
And then I could, like, for instance, I could write a scene where Magneto gets up

72
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,800
close to you and farts so bad and you smell it and die like an idiot.

73
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,200
Yeah. You know what? We don't even need to write you into it. We can just have a character say,

74
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,840
like, Logan told me the other day he likes to eat poop that he finds.

75
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,480
And yeah, Spider-Man's like, it's too bad about Wolverine. And then somebody else is like,

76
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,840
what's wrong? And Spider-Man's like, Magneto farted in his face and he smelled it so bad

77
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,800
he died like an idiot.

78
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,320
Mm-hmm. And like, maybe like Kate Bishop is like, I heard that Logan went down a

79
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,760
water slide so fast that his underpants ripped off. And like, he was really embarrassed.

80
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,000
And no one will sell him underpants.

81
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,840
And now no one will sell him underpants.

82
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,440
So he's naked all the time.

83
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Yeah, and he smells like Magneto's fart because it lingers in all of his chest hair.

84
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,120
Yeah, and his sideburns and stuff.

85
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,560
Would you like, hey, would you like that, Wolverine?

86
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,160
You wouldn't like that, would you?

87
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,120
I don't care, dude. I've got no more dads to stab, bud.

88
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,480
You stabbed all the dads. Wait, it's my dad too. Hold on, this is just occurring to me.

89
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,880
Logan.

90
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,760
Yeah.

91
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,520
We could make him have a, like, a tattoo that says Lemon Diet Coke forever.

92
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

93
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:02,960
Hey, on this topic, could I, could I, like, solve the, you know, the big fight that we're writing

94
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:10,000
with, like, me, Griffin, coming in and stopping it, and then, like, I get to be in the movies?

95
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,480
This is my favorite thing that people who, like, write, get their own comic series,

96
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,360
like TV shows or whatever.

97
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,800
They make a character and, like, they establish, like, that character is low-key, not low-key,

98
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,680
low-key the strongest character in, like, the, the comics universe.

99
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,160
Sure.

100
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,640
If you did that, it's like you just introduced Griffin and he's invincible and two times

101
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:37,120
stronger than the Hulk and, like, he, he shoots webs, but better than Spider-Man.

102
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,360
Yeah.

103
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,000
We don't have, we don't have Peter Parker in ours, but, like, this, this sort of example

104
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,840
would work better if we do. What if we, like, had a scene where Spider-Man took off his

105
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,920
mask and it was Peter Parker, and then everybody's, like, gasp, and he's, like,

106
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,440
oh, you ain't seen nothing yet, and he pulls it off and it's me, and it's actually-

107
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,720
Oh, shit.

108
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,760
Been me the entire time since, like, the 20s. I don't know.

109
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,560
Yeah, you know what I like, what would be better is then he tears off his suit and it's

110
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,640
the Hulk's body, but Justin's head and face.

111
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,600
See, I don't need that much. I'm happy if, like, Thor comes back to, like, I don't know,

112
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,360
finish his, his big fight or whatever, and where's he been? Well, he's been with me and

113
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,760
I've been coaching him. I'm Thor's life coach.

114
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,560
I see.

115
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,040
And without me, and he says this numerous times, without Travis, I am nothing.

116
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,520
Well, and then-

117
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,480
So, like, I'm not the most powerful, but, like, the most powerful needs me.

118
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,960
And I'll just, I'll just write in that Thor finds his estranged father, Thor Senior, and

119
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,520
that's me.

120
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Whoa. And then he unstabs our dad.

121
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,160
If we have time, we'll find room to work in the undead stabbing.

122
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

123
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,040
We could have Spider-Man say, you know, a great man once told me, with great power comes

124
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,560
great responsibility. And then someone else says, oh, yeah, you're Uncle Ben. And then

125
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,800
Peter Parker says, no. The only thing my Uncle Ben ever told me is, hey, shut up, wheel is

126
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,640
on. Enjoy this rice. And enjoy the rice. And the Yankees have no hitting this year.

127
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,920
Those are the two things my Uncle Ben ever said to me. No, my best friend Justin McElroy,

128
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,640
a grown adult, said those things to me, and it really inspired me and changed my life.

129
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,720
I'll never forget when Justin was gunned down by those gangsters while saving all of those

130
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,800
orphans and puppies. And his dying breath, he said, with great power comes great responsibility.

131
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,560
And don't do Spider-Man 2.

132
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,280
And then he got one more thing in before he died, and it was Wolverine smell magnate.

133
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,760
And then later, when no one expected it, he came back.

134
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,960
He was the greatest hero of them all, Superman 2.

135
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,760
And Superman squared.

136
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,840
And Superman times Hulk.

137
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,640
Superman plus Hulk.

138
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,560
Justin McElroy this entire time has been Superman on Hulk's shoulders.

139
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,880
Go get him, son.

140
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,480
With an Iron Man suit on.

141
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,400
Sorry about your luck, Hitler.

142
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,880
Oh, yeah, he's from the 40s. I love that vibe.

143
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,080
That's also Super Justin's catchphrase.

144
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,720
He says that all the time, even when not fighting Hitler.

145
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,400
He's just so popular that one time he fought Hitler, he can't stop saying it.

146
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,960
We are, do we send this part to a lawyer, like the first 13 minutes to a lawyer,

147
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,400
just to protect, just to have a lawyer look at it and check our work?

148
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,960
Just kind of make sure it's all clear.

149
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,120
Anyway, it's called Journey into Mystery, comes out April 10th,

150
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,680
and it's going to be like five issues, so.

151
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,760
A bunch of people said you should have waited 10 days and it's like, yeah, those are the decisions we get to make.

152
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,920
The day comes out.

153
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,840
We called up the Marvel president people and we're like, do you guys know about weed?

154
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,760
You guys know weed, right?

155
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,800
Y'all know about weed, right?

156
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,560
Ask Mickey about weed.

157
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,680
Okay, so anyway, this is a podcast.

158
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,960
It's an advice show or something.

159
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,680
We say that it's so much more, it's really more of a family at this point.

160
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,320
Sometimes it's so much less, though.

161
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,840
Some families podcast.

162
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,560
We're getting to the point where it's finally feeling like family, folks.

163
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,560
So, I was cleaning out my closet over the holiday season,

164
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,760
and I found this unwrapped present hiding in a back corner.

165
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,200
It's a Christmas present, still wrapped, from four years ago,

166
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,520
that my now roommate gave to me to give to one of our other friends.

167
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,240
I obviously never did that.

168
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,840
So what do I do?

169
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,080
If I open it and keep it, my roommate will know I never gave it to the person I was supposed to.

170
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,880
Should I just keep it in my closet forever?

171
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,480
That's from poor present transporter in California.

172
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,120
I'm going to assume then that that's a misprint in the beginning

173
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,480
where you say you found an unwrapped present and then say it was still wrapped.

174
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,400
You probably meant you found a wrapped present.

175
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,480
An un-un-un unwrapped.

176
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,440
I will count.

177
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,640
Everything's just an unwrapped present, if you think about it.

178
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,120
Yeah.

179
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
Issue, unwrapped present.

180
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,880
This poem, unwrapped present.

181
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,680
Unwrapped present.

182
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,680
Except for explicitly wrapped presents.

183
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,400
Or not them.

184
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,160
Hey, this is a bad ruse you've got going.

185
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,280
Because there's a huge sort of failure point here in it.

186
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,880
And it's that the roommate will at some point have...

187
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,720
The roommate could ostensibly find out that the person they meant to give the present to

188
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,920
never received it.

189
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,160
And whether that's they go to their house and it's like,

190
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,680
where's the punch bowl, punch bowl, punch bowl,

191
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,960
looking for the punch bowl, where's the punch bowl?

192
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,240
And it's not there.

193
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,560
Or they explicitly just say,

194
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,000
hey, do you ever use that punch bowl I got you?

195
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,120
Then the jig is up.

196
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,440
And then they're going to assume that you stole it, pawned it.

197
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,000
Hey, did you...

198
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,320
I've been meaning to ask you,

199
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,000
did you like that ferret I bought you?

200
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,080
Oh, no.

201
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,480
It's...

202
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,400
You gotta fess up, I feel like.

203
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,120
I know that our position on these matters is usually very like,

204
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,400
zag on them,

205
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,120
2015, lie and steal and be bad.

206
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,480
But listen, it's 2019.

207
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,480
It's time for you to become the monster.

208
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,640
By which I mean confront your fear of how bad this is going to be

209
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,880
when you do own up to not delivering on this Christmas cheer.

210
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,240
Because I'm not going to lie to you.

211
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,680
You fucked up pretty bad.

212
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,720
Yeah, but what if...

213
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,680
Okay, this is different from advice we've ever given.

214
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,000
But what if you just walked up to the other friend,

215
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,680
the one that is supposed to get the present,

216
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,720
and you say,

217
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,200
hey, I fucked up real bad.

218
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,720
My roommate, our friend,

219
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,080
gave me this present and gave it to you,

220
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,360
and I completely forgot about it.

221
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,560
It's been four years.

222
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,960
Yes, I fucked up, but here you go.

223
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,000
And, and, please don't tell them.

224
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,600
And never to.

225
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,960
You can't ever tell anyone.

226
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,920
I don't agree.

227
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,680
If I'm looking at the...

228
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,280
If I'm looking at a chart right now,

229
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,040
people who are angry, none.

230
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,200
Right?

231
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,480
If you give them the gift,

232
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
that person's angry instantly.

233
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,920
There's one person angry.

234
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,440
If they tell your other friends,

235
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,960
if they tell your other friends, that's two people angry.

236
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,120
And you're not feeling so hot yourself.

237
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,360
It seems like everyone is more upset

238
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,280
now that you have given this present away.

239
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,080
Other thing is,

240
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,560
put it in the closet and forget about it.

241
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,080
And then if your friend is like,

242
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,120
oh man, come on, get the present.

243
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,920
You could be like,

244
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,280
oh shit, hold on, let me fix it.

245
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,880
And then they're kind of mad,

246
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,360
but you have plausible deniability.

247
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,120
It seems to me that if you suddenly

248
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,960
just decide to deliver it,

249
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,640
it seems very intentional.

250
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,280
I feel like that would make me much more frustrated

251
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,760
than just letting them like...

252
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,520
We both have stuff.

253
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,560
Go Travis.

254
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,200
Okay.

255
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,960
Put it in your now roommate's closet

256
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,920
when they're not home.

257
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,720
Oh.

258
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,480
Like under a t-shirt or something.

259
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,840
And then your roommate will be like,

260
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,800
hey, what's this?

261
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,480
And you're like, I don't know, what?

262
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,120
So listen, I'm giving you two options.

263
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,560
One, complete honesty.

264
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,320
Two, the deepest lie.

265
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,240
You never gave it to me.

266
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,200
You fucked up.

267
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,920
Put it in the recipient's bed while they're sleeping.

268
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,000
And then you wake up.

269
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,600
What I will say is what's gonna really

270
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,040
take the edge off this.

271
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,480
Don't do it right now,

272
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,640
holy shit, this close to the holidays.

273
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,200
No way.

274
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,960
In May, in fucking August,

275
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,720
when you want a big fun holiday

276
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,960
to just get psyched out of your mind,

277
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,120
but there's not a whole lot there for you.

278
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,520
And then you get a Christmas present?

279
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,800
It doesn't matter how old it is.

280
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,760
It doesn't matter how dusty,

281
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,120
how many cobwebs it's developed on its hide.

282
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,160
That's exciting.

283
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,360
Christmas in August.

284
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,600
And then you give it to him and you say,

285
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,480
this is from me.

286
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,800
Oh, okay.

287
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,520
I don't like that.

288
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,720
You don't know what it is though.

289
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,760
Oh wait, that's like a call.

290
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,560
It might be shitty.

291
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,000
Could be a framed picture

292
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,840
of this person in their roommate.

293
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,720
This is from me.

294
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
A picture of you in my roommate.

295
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,680
How about a Yahoo?

296
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,160
Sure, yeah.

297
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,880
I mean, here's one from Elliot.

298
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,440
Thank you, Elliot.

299
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,960
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

300
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,600
who I'm gonna call

301
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,400
Muscly James.

302
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,400
There's an ad.

303
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,840
There's a man running on a treadmill.

304
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,320
He's huge.

305
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,440
Muscly James asks,

306
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:29,280
what is a polite way to pocket pick?

307
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,040
These days when you hear about thefts,

308
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
there is, it's usually not cute.

309
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,240
I feel like the era of the gentleman thief

310
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,320
or gentle person thief is well over.

311
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,800
Is there anything that we can get going again

312
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,240
by doing a polite pocket pick?

313
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,000
Here's what you do.

314
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,960
You wait at an airport in like, say,

315
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,800
I don't know, Montreal, right?

316
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,600
For a plane that just got there from America.

317
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,400
You pick their pocket and take their American money.

318
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,440
But what's that?

319
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,280
You've slipped some Canadian bills in there.

320
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,240
I see, yes.

321
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,160
So you have picked their pocket,

322
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,720
but also they don't have to hit up the currency exchange.

323
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,560
Now, but maybe the Travis McElroy gentleman thief

324
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,640
exchange rate is gonna be a little bit different.

325
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,320
Well, yes, absolutely.

326
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,880
But I would pay a little bit extra

327
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,240
to be saved having to interact with another human being

328
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,520
while doing an exchange that I have no idea how it works.

329
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,200
That's my nightmare.

330
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,240
There's something that you can leave in there.

331
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,600
There's something you can leave in there

332
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,680
that will not only take the edge off,

333
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,200
you will feel like you have come out

334
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,560
on top of the equation.

335
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,480
And I'm having trouble.

336
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,360
It's not candy.

337
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,800
I feel like candy would be good for a second.

338
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,440
Then you'd be like, well, I can't go to bars

339
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,280
because I don't have my shit anymore.

340
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,960
Mm-hmm, a better wallet?

341
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,760
Now, Juice, does it have money and stuff

342
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,720
and cards in there?

343
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,440
A better life.

344
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,280
A better life.

345
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,080
A new life.

346
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,840
And they can better life.

347
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,200
Okay, are you switching wallets?

348
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,640
Is it the Gentleman Thief's?

349
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,240
Switches your wallet with a different wallet

350
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,000
that contains within its folds a better life,

351
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,760
a way forward for you and Janine and the girls.

352
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,960
A new chance at the life you always swore you'd have.

353
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,560
Credit cards, a driver's license,

354
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,960
an acceptance letter to that prep school

355
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,360
that you tried to get the girls into for so long

356
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,720
and never could quite pull it off.

357
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,680
It's a new start.

358
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,320
Janine, it's what we waited for.

359
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,760
We have to take this chance.

360
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,120
It's a miracle.

361
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,240
It's like the address on the driver's license,

362
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,040
like your new house.

363
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,840
Exactly, it's a new start.

364
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,320
There's pictures of well-trained dogs in your wallet.

365
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,880
Daryl, we can't just-

366
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,760
Daryl's dead.

367
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,400
My name is Victor.

368
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,720
Victor Newchance.

369
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,120
It says right here on my new wallet.

370
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,520
My name is Victor Newchance

371
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,320
and your name is still Janine, I guess.

372
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,480
There's no driver's license for you.

373
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,080
There's no driver's license for you.

374
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,920
Maybe I'm supposed to go by myself,

375
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,240
Janine, but I'm taking you and the girls with me.

376
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,360
Let's be conspicuous.

377
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,480
I hope nobody switches Janine's wallet.

378
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,040
She's got a lot of money.

379
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,200
And nothing going on, really.

380
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,680
No big opportunities on her horizon.

381
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,560
Close doors for Janine.

382
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,520
Big, open butt pockets.

383
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,920
Where the wallet lives.

384
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,080
That could be really good, Justin.

385
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,240
Just a new start.

386
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,440
Or maybe a little puzzle.

387
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,320
Maybe a puzzle.

388
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,840
Sort of a skill testing puzzle.

389
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:00,960
Yeah.

390
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,840
Like one of those where it's like

391
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,360
you try to get the little metal beads into the holes.

392
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,160
That kind of thing.

393
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,800
Any kind of puzzle really, Trav.

394
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,000
Like a word search?

395
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,280
Sure, man.

396
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,360
Any puzzle that you could think of

397
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,440
is probably equally funny, I would guess.

398
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,240
A crossword.

399
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,280
A sudoku.

400
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
Man, you know a lot of puzzles.

401
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,840
I gotta give it up.

402
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,920
You could say if you solve the puzzle,

403
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,200
you're gonna get your wallet back.

404
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,840
I'm watching.

405
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,880
And they stay there

406
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,200
and they spend a couple hours working on the puzzle.

407
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,160
By the time they solve it,

408
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,480
we're sitting on a beach, earning 20%.

409
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,240
But then when they solve it,

410
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,160
we do have to give their wallet back.

411
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,320
Trav, did you not fucking hear what I said?

412
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,680
But you said that if they solve it,

413
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,800
you would give their wallet back.

414
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,640
But I can't, Trav,

415
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,320
because unless they're on the beach,

416
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,160
earning 20% with me.

417
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,400
Well, you would go back to where they are.

418
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,960
But the 20% needs me there at the beach.

419
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,240
But then why tell them,

420
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,640
Griffin, why tell them to solve the puzzle then

421
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,840
if you're not gonna give it back?

422
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,200
Because it seems like a waste of time.

423
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,000
What about a lotto ticket?

424
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,720
Ooh.

425
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,200
Now, if you do that a million times,

426
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,040
somebody is gonna be helped by that.

427
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,320
Somebody's gonna be helped by that.

428
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,480
And then karmically, I think you still come out on top.

429
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,680
But can you imagine if it happened the first time, Griffin?

430
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,400
Oh, beans.

431
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,920
The first wallet you steal,

432
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,440
you put, oh, it won $38 million or whatever.

433
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,680
That is a barrel of beans.

434
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,160
You're not gonna keep pickpocketing after that.

435
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,440
Oh, shoot, I'd be so freaking PO'd.

436
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,800
Your fire's gone out.

437
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,480
You don't wanna pick any pockets.

438
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,400
Do people still pick pockets?

439
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,920
When a criminal wants something from you,

440
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,120
I feel like they usually go through a less savory.

441
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,720
I was convinced growing up

442
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,840
that anywhere where there were more than three people,

443
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,880
you are 95% likely to get pickpocketed.

444
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,680
Interesting.

445
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,760
And so I think maybe what happened is the wallet chain

446
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,000
made the gentleman pickpocket go extinct.

447
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,800
Yeah.

448
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,440
Oh, it's attached to him.

449
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,560
I saw a lot of wallet chains in the late 90s, early aughts,

450
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,720
and I never saw one of them prevent a theft

451
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,800
and damn it, I really wish I had

452
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,640
because that would have been so funny.

453
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,800
I did see them facilitate a lot of skateboard accidents.

454
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,720
Let's say, because I'll tell you this.

455
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,200
If I pull a wallet out of Jinko Jeans,

456
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,920
which were made to be stolen from,

457
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,440
what with their jumbo.

458
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,760
They're like some sort of carnival game.

459
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,600
Yeah.

460
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,720
But a carnival game for kids, you know,

461
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,280
like this is the kids version of Skee-Ball.

462
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,920
I could steal a wallet from one butt popper

463
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,720
from one butt pocket while dunking a tennis ball

464
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,920
full force into the other one.

465
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,040
They would be none the wiser.

466
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,080
But then they would have the wallet chain.

467
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,520
I bet you dollars to donuts.

468
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,400
If it was me and I was at the mall and I got this wallet

469
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,720
and I pulled it and then had the initial snap back

470
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,440
of hitting that chain tension

471
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,080
and then the skater looks back at me,

472
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,520
I bet you I could pull that wallet hard enough

473
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,000
to either rip the pants or break the chain.

474
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,840
I could either rip the pants or break the chain.

475
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,600
And now you're in a real pickle

476
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,480
because one, your pants are torn and messed up

477
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,360
and they're falling down

478
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,680
and everybody's laughing at you, Wolverine.

479
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,760
Or two, I have now a weapon on a chain

480
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,960
that I can use against you.

481
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
I have a wallet flail.

482
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,280
How about another question?

483
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:13,920
Yes.

484
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,640
Would that be okay?

485
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,960
I tend to sneeze rather loudly.

486
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,920
I'm not doing it on purpose or anything.

487
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,880
Uh-huh.

488
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,920
It's just how I've always sneezed.

489
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,520
A few days ago at work, I noticed a coworker of mine

490
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,200
give me a dirty look after I sneeze.

491
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,680
I figured I was just imagining things

492
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,720
until about an hour later

493
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,360
when I noticed her glance over my direction

494
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,240
and then sneeze so loudly, she was nearly screaming.

495
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,760
Should I just shrug it off?

496
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,280
Nearly screaming, huh?

497
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,640
Or does this mean?

498
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,640
That's from Achoo and Appalachia.

499
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,880
Hey, listen, it's me, Justin.

500
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,680
I've got a lot of human foibles and faults.

501
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,240
This is coming from a place of 100% humility.

502
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,080
My heart is open to you.

503
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,560
You should sneeze quieter.

504
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,840
You just should sneeze a little quieter

505
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,680
and I don't think you consciously make the choice

506
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,040
every time you sneeze to sneeze very loudly

507
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,440
but I think you did make it one time when you were seven

508
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,640
and you said, fuck it.

509
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,800
This is fine.

510
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,520
This is fine.

511
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm gonna blow the doors off these motherfuckers.

512
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,200
Here we go.

513
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,320
And then you blew it up

514
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,640
and then years and years and years and years later,

515
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,160
you don't remember this being a conscious choice

516
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,920
but my thing for you would just be

517
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,240
one thing to work on in 2019

518
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,920
would just be to sneeze quieter.

519
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,160
Or at least carry a thick flannel handkerchief

520
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,240
that you might muffle said sneeze.

521
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,800
Is that it?

522
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,360
Did you sleeve it?

523
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,800
Did you cover that?

524
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,000
Oh, you gotta cover that.

525
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,880
Yeah, you gotta vampire.

526
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,200
Because if you sneeze that loudly.

527
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,320
Oh, shit.

528
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,920
Become the monster, folks.

529
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,200
If you gotta sneeze, vampire it.

530
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,000
Yes.

531
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,280
Yeah, you gotta vampire.

532
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,160
It's not bad.

533
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,120
There are people who are like,

534
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,840
why did you pick a bad thing and say people do bad stuff?

535
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,800
We're not.

536
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,000
Sleeve it, sneeze it.

537
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,200
It can mean so many things.

538
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,760
If you take it to mean that you should do bad things

539
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,600
then you are already a bad monster.

540
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,920
Let me say this.

541
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,360
You're looking at that, you're like,

542
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,640
do I need another cookie?

543
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,880
Hey, become the monster.

544
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,440
Become the monster, go for it.

545
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,480
Cookie monster.

546
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,440
Yes, for sure.

547
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,560
Anyway, we're getting so far away from it.

548
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,040
All right, guys.

549
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,240
Probably the angriest I've ever been in my entire life

550
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,040
is being in a room of people working

551
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
and somebody does one of those screams.

552
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,880
There's one of those sneezes where they scream

553
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,120
in the first part, you know what I mean?

554
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,320
Like, ah-choo.

555
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,880
And then they give that look like,

556
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,040
ah, shucks, that's just the way I sneeze.

557
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,120
It's fucking not.

558
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,120
Just sneeze quieter, please, for the rest of us.

559
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,240
Just sneeze quieter.

560
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,160
Your vocal cords are still putting that stank on it.

561
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,960
This is coming from Justin

562
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,080
who used to do a drum roll before he used to sneeze.

563
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,080
Right, I used to do a grill.

564
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,080
We all get our attention in different ways.

565
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,560
He did, he would go like, brr-chish.

566
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,480
That's not a joke.

567
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,920
He would really do it.

568
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,160
He sounded like Yoshi doing a butt stomp on his grill.

569
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,200
It was amazing.

570
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,120
But I'm saying it was just a way to get attention.

571
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,560
We all do these things in school

572
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,680
and then we grow and we move past them.

573
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,160
You have to stop sneezing so loudly.

574
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,320
You're bothering everyone, please.

575
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,080
Think about it.

576
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,680
Just sneeze quieter.

577
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,440
You can do it, I believe in you.

578
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,760
You don't need to get in a sneeze fight with this person.

579
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,360
This is a professional environment.

580
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,800
But can I say something that doesn't bother me?

581
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,800
If this person follows my sage advice

582
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,600
and they start sneezing quieter,

583
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,600
then his coworker, let's call that person Shimmy.

584
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,520
So when Shimmy notices the next time you sneeze

585
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,520
and it's quieter, Shimmy's gonna think that she's cowed you.

586
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,000
Yeah, she's won through,

587
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,560
I would say some very shameful play.

588
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,800
Oh, then might I suggest.

589
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,800
Now wait, now Travis, you started talking very quickly

590
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,600
and sometimes when that happens,

591
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,680
the sounds are funny, but the ideas are bad or challenging.

592
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,280
Uh-huh, well, I think, no fear here.

593
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,600
You won't even let me get through the sentence

594
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,080
when I tell you to think about the ideas.

595
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,720
These just be extremely challenging.

596
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,760
Hold on, wait, hold on.

597
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,600
My mind moves so quickly, Justin.

598
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,000
Let me open a fresca, okay.

599
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,360
Hold on, let me get comfortable

600
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,320
because I've tried to help you twice preemptively.

601
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,800
There will be no post-emptive help

602
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,080
for what you're about to do.

603
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,160
Okay, you're going to start sneezing quieter, but prouder.

604
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,720
So when you feel a sneeze coming on,

605
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,600
stand up, maybe put your foot up on the chair

606
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,080
and spread your arms like you're about to deliver

607
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,680
like an operatic solo.

608
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,280
Like Scott Stapp.

609
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,200
Yeah, sneeze politely, bow, sit back down.

610
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,020
That's good.

611
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,960
You could also just sneeze quieter

612
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,800
and then Shimmy will sneeze louder

613
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,240
and then come over and be like,

614
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,080
looks like my sneeze was louder

615
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,560
and then you gesture all over your desk and you say,

616
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
yes, but mine was wetter.

617
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,920
I hate it.

618
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,360
Mine was so wet.

619
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,080
So you can keep your decibels.

620
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,040
Let's take a brief sojourn at this point in the program

621
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,680
and go peruse the wares over at the Money Zone.

622
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:59,840
Welcome stranger.

623
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
Welcome stranger to the Money Zone.

624
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,640
I'm very excited this week to tell you about Ring.

625
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,480
Ring's mission is to make neighborhoods safer

626
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
with smart video doorbells and cameras

627
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,920
that protect millions of people everywhere.

628
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
What does that mean, you ask?

629
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,080
Well, you connect it to your phone wherever you are.

630
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,920
There's a camera on the Ring doorbell.

631
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,080
It senses motion or people can like, you know,

632
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,680
push the button, pause up on your phone.

633
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,160
You look at it, see who's there, takes videos.

634
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,160
If you're worried about like people stealing your packages

635
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,000
and stuff, which I always am,

636
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,320
then this video doorbell is for you.

637
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,240
Or if you just want to see who's at the door

638
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,080
before you like get up and go open it, you need Ring.

639
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,880
And so as a listener,

640
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,960
you have a special offer on a Ring starter kit

641
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,440
available right now with a Ring doorbell

642
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,080
and motion activated floodlight camera.

643
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,680
The starter kit has everything you need

644
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,400
to start building a Ring of security around your home.

645
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,360
Just go to ring.com slash my brother.

646
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,080
That's ring.com slash my brother.

647
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,160
Did y'all see a video guy made a box

648
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,360
and it shot glitter everywhere

649
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,520
and did fart spray when people stole it?

650
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,480
I mean, yeah, I guess that's fine.

651
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,320
How come I didn't know there was fart spray

652
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,120
until that video?

653
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,520
How did I not know that we have successfully synthesized it?

654
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,560
I don't know.

655
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,920
I guess they're just not on the blogs.

656
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,080
There's no cure for canker sores,

657
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,720
but we still, we made fart spray.

658
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,160
Good work, science.

659
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,760
Hey, here's one for Quip.

660
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,440
I brushed my teeth with it today.

661
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,800
These are toothbrushes that are battery powered.

662
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,040
And used by Griffin, each one.

663
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,720
They shake and shimmy in your mouth.

664
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,200
They do a little cleaning dance.

665
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,040
And you put it in there for two minutes

666
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,600
and it has these sonic vibrations.

667
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,280
And then it just gets those guys pearly white again.

668
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,360
And it's wonderful.

669
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,400
I'd like to travel with it because I have a little thing

670
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,600
and it's like a cover for it,

671
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,880
but then you can turn it upside down

672
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,920
and stick it on your mirror.

673
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,840
And then like it's a little holster for it.

674
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,680
Like it's a cool cowboy gun.

675
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,000
So if you want to get Quip and have a cool toothbrush gun,

676
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,080
I want you to go to getquip.com slash my brother right now.

677
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,120

you get your first refill pack of toothbrush heads for free.

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,400
So get your mouth happy and healthy too.

681
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,200
The toothbrushes start at just 25 bucks

682
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,000
and you get your first refill pack for free

683
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,680
at G-E-T-Q-U-I-P.com slash my brother.

684
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,880
Genre film fans, hear me, I know you're out there.

685
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,360
Do not be ashamed of your love for gore,

686
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
action, sci-fi or fantasy.

687
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,520
It's time to come out of the shadows

688
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,960
because on Switchblade Sisters,

689
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,200
we celebrate our love for genre films.

690
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,800
I'm film critic, April Wolf.

691
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,080
Each week I have a conversation

692
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,440
with a different female filmmaker

693
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,960
about their fave genre film.

694
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,760
And we cover film craft, getting projects off the ground,

695
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,640
working with actors and our general love for genre movies.

696
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,120
I've had so many great guests like Heather Gramp.

697
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,280
In the past, it's like so many films are made by men

698
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,320
that the female point of view is not always respected,

699
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,800
which is why all these stories haven't come out till now.

700
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,880
Jennifer's body director, Karan Kusama.

701
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,120
I think there's a lot more fantasy

702
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,040
and a lot more expectation projected onto a woman director.

703
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,960
Comedian and actor, Kate Berlant.

704
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,280
I mean, it sounds so cheesy to talk about it in yourself.

705
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,080
Like you just keep going, you know, I'm just a vessel.

706
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,880
Like I just do it, you know, I don't think,

707
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,800
but like that is what it is.

708
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,680
And many others.

709
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,840
So check out Switchblade Sisters every Thursday

710
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:50,320
on MaximumFun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.

711
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,280
It's getting more operatic.

712
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,880
That was very like a, like a medieval,

713
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,280
you know, Dark Ages fife-ing.

714
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,240
I enjoyed it.

715
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,560
I have two this week and some we do them as a combo

716
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,640
because they're both less substantial.

717
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,800
Either one would have been a good Munch Squad Junior,

718
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,280
but I'm going to do one.

719
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,440
Is that the conversion rate to Munch Squad Juniors

720
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,720
equals one Munch Squad Senior?

721
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,000
This one kind of bums me out,

722
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,520
but I'm going to go ahead and say it.

723
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,320
Oh no.

724
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,800
Tim Tebow teams with Core Life Eatery for Food Revolution.

725
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,520
Oh no.

726
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,080
Welcome to Tim Tebow's Food Revolution.

727
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,640
The first paragraph of this fast food press release says,

728
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,840
what if you could change your life in just 21 days?

729
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,520
Professional athlete Tim Tebow is teaming up

730
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,960
with Core Life Eatery, an active lifestyle restaurant,

731
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
offering a variety of greens, grains,

732
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,200
and broth-based dishes to do exactly that.

733
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,080
Tebow is taking the Core Life Challenge

734
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,160
and it wants you to join him.

735
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,080
So this is a...

736
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,480
The Core Life Challenge is a 21-day food revolution.

737
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,560
All of these days I'm assuming you will eat

738
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,800
at Core Life Eatery, I have to imagine.

739
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,520
That's a brand built around clean eating,

740
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,960
which doesn't mean anything.

741
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,360
Wait, it's a 21-day challenge

742
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,600
where you have to eat at this same restaurant every day?

743
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,800
Yes, I know.

744
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,080
What a great challenge.

745
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,880
If that's the case, then I unconsciously did

746
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,000
the Wendy's Challenge in college a lot.

747
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,440
So it's promoting overall wellness.

748
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,000
It encourages you to take control of your health.

749
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,040
Although I would argue,

750
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,800
if you're eating at the same restaurant every day,

751
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,280
you're letting Tim Tebow take care of your health.

752
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,000
Tebow takes the wheel.

753
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,520
Me, Tim Tebow.

754
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,480
Are you okay?

755
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:38,960
Are you okay?

756
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,920
I'm worried about you.

757
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,880
I'm stopping you at the door with my football body.

758
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,680
Core Life Eatery and co-founder Todd Mansfield,

759
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,960
who spent decades practicing physical therapy

760
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,280
and functional medicine, which means lying,

761
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,560
is trading nutrition,

762
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,920
design the challenge to provide simple guidelines

763
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,400
to improve health and also presumably tricks

764
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,040
to get people to eat at the same place for 21 days in a row.

765
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,440
During these 21 days, you'll get recharged,

766
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,520
refueled, not refunded though,

767
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,440
and embark on your personal journey,

768
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,840
journey towards living a healthier lifestyle

769
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,240
and living in fucking soylent green,

770
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,680
becoming the healthiest version of yourself.

771
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,960
The challenge begins on Wednesday, January 16th,

772
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,640
and you're gonna get daily emails with helpful tips

773
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,360
and special offers to help you stay motivated

774
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,920
and on track from Tim Tebow, I guess.

775
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,240
Hey, it's Tim.

776
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,040
Are you gonna come into the restaurant today?

777
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,440
We're all missing you.

778
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,840
Didn't see you there yesterday,

779
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,240
and I'm worried you might be dead

780
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,920
because you're not eating healthy.

781
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,680
Here's a quote from Tim Tebow, footballer.

782
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,840
For our best performance, we need the very best food,

783
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,240
says Tim Tebow, who's credited here

784
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,800
as a Core Life Eatery enthusiast.

785
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,040
His parents must be so proud.

786
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,400
Congratulations, Tim.

787
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,680
Core Life Eatery provides the top quality fuel

788
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,640
your body needs to detox, refuel,

789
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,000
and begin 2019 by getting on the path

790
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,520
towards being a healthier you.

791
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,120
Detoxing, of course, can be performed

792
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,120
by anyone with a kidney or liver.

793
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,600
You don't need Tim Tebow to make you chicken.

794
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,400
You don't need to eat Tim Tebow's special chicken

795
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,880
every day to get detoxed.

796
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,520
Anyway, what does it help if Tim Tebow

797
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,360
massages your liver and kidney?

798
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,160
Does that help?

799
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:42,160
Can the three of us get Cleveland Brown's

800
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,440
fullback, Refrigerator Perry, to do a challenge for us?

801
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,920
And it's just like, eat wherever the fuck you want.

802
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,520
And don't eat at Tebow's place.

803
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,800
Don't go to Tebow's place.

804
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,320
Don't go to Tebow's place for three calendar weeks.

805
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,440
It's me, Refrigerator Perry.

806
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
Just go to fucking Taco Bell or whatever.

807
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,520
I want to meet the person who is like,

808
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,680
oh, man, I've got to get my life on track in 2019.

809
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,400
I know.

810
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,120
I'm going to let Tim Tebow make all of my meals.

811
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,960
So here's some more news.

812
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,440
Fuck, don't let Tim Tebow lie to you

813
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,520
and overcharge you for lettuce.

814
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,120
Baskin Robbins adds new brownie inspired flavors

815
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,840
to the menu.

816
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,840
Boy, that is one pretty challenging inspired,

817
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,440
I have to say, brownie inspired flavors to menu.

818
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,600
It's like it has a spirit of a brownie

819
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,840
without any of the actual content.

820
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,240
Baskin Robbins is ringing in 2019

821
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,720
with a brownie lover's dream come true.

822
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,320
Brownies.

823
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,040
Brownies.

824
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,000
Hey, dipshits, we finally figured it out.

825
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,840
We just sell brownies.

826
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,720
Cool, right?

827
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,520
Yeah, I guess.

828
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,120
The January flavor of the month brownie bar mashup

829
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,560
is a delicious combination of traditional chocolate

830
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,080
and blonde brownies.

831
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,280
It delivers on two delicious brownie flavors in one bite.

832
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,200
Ice cream fans may also find themselves

833
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,560
under a sweet spell this month

834
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,760
as Love Potion number 31 returns to Baskin Robbins.

835
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,480
This combination-

836
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,200
New flavor MK Ultra hits the stores.

837
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,080
This combination of white chocolate flavored ice cream,

838
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,800
Agent Orange, and raspberry flavored ice cream

839
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,400
with chocolate flavored chips.

840
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,560
I'm gonna fucking lose my-

841
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,320
Okay, I'm gonna try again, okay?

842
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:34,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

843
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,440
It's a combination of white chocolate flavored ice cream

844
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,200
and raspberry flavored ice cream

845
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,880
and chocolate flavored chips

846
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,120
and raspberry filled chocolate flavor hearts

847
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,320
and raspberry swirl.

848
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,520
And it's sure to work its magic on every guest

849
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,760
as it has already worked its hypnotic linguistic magic on me.

850
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,480
Here's a quote from Carol Austin.

851
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,440
Carol, hey, it's Justin McElroy,

852
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,920
a local reporter for Munch Squad.

853
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,440
It's January, right?

854
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,080
We're all eating at Timo's place to get fit.

855
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,000
How are you justifying continuing to operate this month?

856
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,120
Should you not shudder?

857
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,360
Who would pledge to eat more ice cream

858
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,640
in this month of new beginnings and fresh starts?

859
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,880
Well, Carol, her eyes dart back and forth

860
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,480
across the room nervously

861
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,480
before she hesitantly answers a sweat beating

862
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,360
on her upper lip.

863
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,640
Well, Justin, our mission is to help guests

864
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,920
flavor every moment.

865
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,680
Okay, Carol, let me stop you there.

866
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,360
It doesn't mean anything.

867
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:39,860
Go on.

868
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,840
Our mission is to help guests flavor every moment

869
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,880
and January's offerings are here to do just that.

870
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,760
Whether your resolution is to, a silence fills the room.

871
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,720
People wait expectantly as Carol Austin,

872
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,440
vice president of marketing tries to sell ice cream

873
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,240
in January.

874
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,480
Whether your resolution is to reconnect with old friends

875
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,800
or enjoy more family time,

876
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,120
Baskin Robbins has something to help everyone hit pause

877
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,680
and savor the start of 2019.

878
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
Carol, it's a good try, Carol.

879
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,600
It sounds like good ice cream.

880
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,440
It sounds like confusing ice cream.

881
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,840
Hey, gang, two things real quick.

882
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,000
One, William the Refrigerator Perry played for the Bears,

883
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,720
not the Browns.

884
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,600
I just wanted to say, I just want to apologize to my dad

885
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,080
for getting a football fact wrong on our podcast.

886
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,120
And the other thing is-

887
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,920
Hey, Griffin, hold on.

888
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Sorry, my neck cut out for a second.

889
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,160
Before we get back to the show, I did want to mention,

890
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,400
you know, I think you said William Refrigerator Perry

891
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,600
played for the Browns.

892
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,560
Ah, shoot.

893
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,640
No, you're gonna get dad points.

894
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,120
Yeah.

895
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,640
Hey, sorry, I stepped away for a second

896
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,680
to go get a glass of water.

897
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,720
I did want to say real quick, Griffin, it was the Bears,

898
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,520
not the Browns.

899
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,440
Not the Browns that Refrigerator Perry played for.

900
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,400
Oh, shit.

901
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,560
Guys, sorry, I stepped away to get a screwdriver

902
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,920
for some shelves I'm installing.

903
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,600
Damn it.

904
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,640
Earlier, you mentioned about William Refrigerator Perry.

905
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,680
My dad points.

906
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,240
They're flying through my fingers.

907
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,120
Hey, guys, sorry, I just traveled back forward in time

908
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,600
from the past where I just watched William Refrigerator

909
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,120
Perry play for the Bears.

910
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,240
What are you guys talking about?

911
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:18,960
Ah, shoot.

912
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,800
Hey, guys, I've become unsuck in time,

913
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,000
and I think I just sired William Refrigerator Perry.

914
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,960
Wild.

915
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,440
And he had a birthmark shaped like a bear,

916
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,640
if that means anything.

917
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,680
Second thing.

918
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,560
Everybody, please, Christ, go to CoreLifeEatery.com

919
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,160
and scroll down to the bottom of the page

920
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,480
where you will find a picture of Tim Tebow

921
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,360
whose face is making a face as if you have just told him

922
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,480
that everybody else ate all the CoreLifeEatery

923
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,560
we got delivered, and there's none left for him.

924
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,440
And he's making this incredulous face

925
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,520
that is so incredible.

926
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,760
It's so incredible that this is what they went with.

927
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,960
What?

928
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,080
Wait, what do you mean you ate all the CoreLifeEatery?

929
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,840
What about all my orange drinks?

930
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,560
What about my orange drinks and vegetable bowls?

931
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,080
But I drove all the way here.

932
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,360
I should have called first.

933
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,720
The tagline that they've gone for with this challenge,

934
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,720
by the way, is it says this like fourth times on the website.

935
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,520
It only takes 21 days to change your life.

936
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,520
Hi, that's not inspiring at all.

937
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,120
I've never done anything for 21 days ever,

938
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,120
and my life is a way.

939
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,560
I mean, it is the way that it is.

940
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,760
I don't even go to places I want to go to

941
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,920
three weeks in a row, CoreLifeEatery.

942
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,200
I'm gonna take this challenge

943
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,720
and see what Tim says about the fact

944
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,400
that I'd have to drive 500 miles

945
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,560
to go to a CoreLifeEatery.

946
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,760
Sorry, everybody who doesn't live

947
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,120
in a major metropolitan area,

948
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,120
your life stays the fucking same.

949
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,920
Should I just go outside and chew leaves like a cow?

950
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,360
Like Tim?

951
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,160
Like Tim would do?

952
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,840
Hey, I've got a Yahoo.

953
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,160
I just love the picture.

954
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,120
Ah, Tim.

955
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,840
It's real good.

956
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,320
This one was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

957
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,440
Thank you, Graham.

958
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,320
It's Yahoo Answers user Melanie who asks,

959
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,000
I forgot when my job interview is?

960
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,640
How do I go about asking when my interview was

961
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,120
without appearing irresponsible?

962
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,720
This is so choice.

963
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,680
That's rough.

964
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,160
Oh, no.

965
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,120
That's rough.

966
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,120
I'm trying to think of a wording.

967
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,920
Hi, I'm calling.

968
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,720
Can't lie.

969
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,560
Can't lie, they won't tell you.

970
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,200
Ooh, this is a delectable little confection.

971
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,040
Yeah, it's riddle me this.

972
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,320
Riddle me this.

973
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,840
No, I did it first.

974
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,200
But you didn't say piss.

975
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,240
Oh, it's because it's New Year

976
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,760
and I'm trying not to cuss as much.

977
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
Could you pretend to be a cuss?

978
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,640
Pretend to be a competing job.

979
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,140
Nope.

980
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,800
Now, hold on.

981
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,480
I do want to hear what Travis thinks competing job is.

982
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,640
I'm going to hire Henriette.

983
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,000
So I'll interview her when you were going to.

984
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,360
When was that?

985
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,000
That's nothing.

986
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,000
No, that's quite good.

987
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,720
The name was Melanie.

988
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,280
It's good.

989
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:07,840
It's good.

990
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,080
The idea of poaching a job interview.

991
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,960
What about you call and say,

992
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,280
I can't wait to start work.

993
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,440
Let's move that interview up the sooner the better.

994
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,640
You say when the interview,

995
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,160
I choose the interview time.

996
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,480
What are you doing right now?

997
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,520
And then you knock on the door.

998
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,480
I know my interview was supposed to happen at a later time,

999
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,000
but I'm so horny for it.

1000
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,280
I mean, excited for it.

1001
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,200
Shit, sorry.

1002
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:35,760
Ah, fuck.

1003
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,720
Oh no, sorry.

1004
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,360
That I want to do it right now, please.

1005
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,120
Your interview was two months ago.

1006
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,760
You've been working here for two months.

1007
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,280
Yeah, whatever you're going to do, do it fast.

1008
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,560
Why don't you call the boss, okay?

1009
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:58,000
And you say, hi, this is Shellac from-

1010
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,960
Melanie.

1011
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,520
Oh, you're lying.

1012
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,160
It's a lie name.

1013
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,280
Sorry, it's a lie name.

1014
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:01,840
Yeah, go for it.

1015
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,240
Go, go.

1016
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:02,640
Okay.

1017
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,160
You didn't put on your lie voice.

1018
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:04,960
Yeah, so I thought it was-

1019
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,440
Oh, okay.

1020
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:05,920
Sorry, sorry.

1021
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,080
So you say, hi, this is Shellac

1022
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,000
from human relations.

1023
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,720
And I was going to get an edible arrangements

1024
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,760
for everybody that has a job interview this month.

1025
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,800
And could you just list them off to me with the times

1026
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,840
so I can get them one personalized

1027
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,280
and have it ready for their interview time?

1028
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,880
Now, I want to say, Justin,

1029
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,520
that the department human relations

1030
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,240
does make it sound like Shellac works in the sex department.

1031
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,840
Some sort of sex acts.

1032
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,480
Well, you could just say you work at-

1033
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,160
They're aliens.

1034
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:48,960
Okay.

1035
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,160
You could just say you work at Edible Arrangements

1036
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,760
and say you want to give free deliveries

1037
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,920
to everybody who has a job interview today

1038
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,000
because damn it, Edible Arrangements loves jobs.

1039
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,640
We're just so excited that the economy is thriving maybe.

1040
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,560
And our shit is really just some apples

1041
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,680
we dipped in chocolate.

1042
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,680
So there's very little overhead.

1043
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,320
Ask them, say we would like to offer our facility

1044
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,440
for you to do your job interviews in today.

1045
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,560
You know what?

1046
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,480
We interviewed Melanie for you.

1047
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,280
She's great.

1048
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,760
Hey, it's me.

1049
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,400
It's me from the bakery, Bakery Joe.

1050
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,600
I got a cake here that says happy job interview Melanie.

1051
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,680
So when do you want this dropped off?

1052
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,880
I like that.

1053
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,320
That could work too.

1054
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,040
How about this?

1055
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,240
Check this one out.

1056
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,000
Hello, Richard.

1057
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,320
Yeah.

1058
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,960
This is Dr. Frito-Lay.

1059
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,720
I heard you had an interview with Melanie coming up

1060
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,720
and I say just hire.

1061
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,320
She's the tops.

1062
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,360
Anyway, gotta go, crunch.

1063
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,760
Now that's assuming, I guess,

1064
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,160
that she's interviewing for Frito-Lay.

1065
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:56,800
Yes, right.

1066
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:02,320
You could fit in whatever you wanted to there.

1067
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,200
You could just roll up to like the waiting area

1068
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,200
in front of the office and just start sitting there now

1069
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,880
and just say like punctuality is really important to me.

1070
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,640
So I want to be here right when you need me for the interview.

1071
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,440
And they'll be like, it's in 19 days.

1072
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,720
And you say, well, good thing I brought all this soup.

1073
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:28,640
And then you show them all the soup that you brought.

1074
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,960
Exactly 19 cans.

1075
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,720
19 cans, one a day.

1076
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,160
That's all you need, folks.

1077
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,520
Hi, it's me, Tim Tebow.

1078
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,600
And I'm here to tell you how to flip your shit all around.

1079
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,160
It's your 19 day soup challenge.

1080
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,080
Don't eat more than one can of soup a day.

1081
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,240
Things are loaded with salt.

1082
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,120
Not Tim Tebow's soup.

1083
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,160
His is made out of football sweat.

1084
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,480
So today I went to New York City.

1085
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,040
I almost said Gatorade because you said football sweat.

1086
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,960
Today I went to New York City with my girlfriend

1087
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,120
and we decided to take a short taxi drive

1088
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,360
rather than take the subway.

1089
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,560
However, a taxi rear into the city bus.

1090
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,080
Oh shit, geez.

1091
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,960
The driver has jumped out and screaming at the bus driver.

1092
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,320
Now we're sitting in the back arguing

1093
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,400
whether we have to pay for our ride still

1094
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,040
and whether or not we should flee before the police arrive.

1095
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,880
Brothers, help us.

1096
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,720
And that's from traumatized taxi travelers in New York City.

1097
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,520
I'm assuming-

1098
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,240
There's gotta be a law on this one.

1099
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,840
The typing of the question, I'm assuming was therapeutic for you

1100
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,840
in that once you finish typing it, you're like,

1101
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,440
well, we certainly do have to stay here at the cab, don't we?

1102
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,200
We really don't have a lot of options here.

1103
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,000
Derek Scott, we don't have to spend a lot of time on this one, gang.

1104
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,840
I'm almost a hundred percent certain

1105
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,560
you are not the first people to be in a cab accident.

1106
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,400
There has to be precedent for this one, I think.

1107
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,440
I don't know.

1108
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,920
The good news is if you do run away,

1109
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,920
what's the cab driver gonna do?

1110
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,280
File you in their cab?

1111
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,720
Don't rip off cab drivers.

1112
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,480
We should be explicitly clear

1113
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,320
that you shouldn't rip off cab drivers.

1114
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,280
It's a question of what do they owe you

1115
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,520
they made you be in a crash.

1116
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,240
How long were you in the cab before that?

1117
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,560
Like, were you almost to your destination?

1118
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,320
Then you need to stay and pay.

1119
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,720
If it's like you just sat down in the cab,

1120
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,280
turn a corner, hit a buzz, move it along.

1121
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,920
Did you just maybe ask the taxi driver

1122
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,360
who's having a very bad day.

1123
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,880
Oh yes.

1124
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,720
You should probably ask them.

1125
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,480
You are a witness though.

1126
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,800
You are a witness to the crime.

1127
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,040
I don't think you can flee because you witnessed it.

1128
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,240
It wasn't a crime as much as it was a New York whoopsie.

1129
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,800
Okay, you're a witness to the whoopsie.

1130
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,320
In a New York whoopsie.

1131
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,880
Guys, if I ever make a fourth album,

1132
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,600
witness to the whoopsie is just about the best name

1133
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,480
I can come up with.

1134
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,240
Dang it.

1135
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,440
I was a witness to the whoopsie.

1136
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,280
Yeah, ask the cab driver or Google it.

1137
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,240
What do you do if you're,

1138
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,840
I'll fucking Google it for you here.

1139
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,720
Let me just do it.

1140
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,200
I don't want to get snide, but what do you do?

1141
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,960
Do you do, geez, type much?

1142
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:20,560
If you're in a cab and it gets in a New York whoopsie.

1143
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,120
Griffin, also search how to be on Cash Cab.

1144
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,000
Is it like a submission thing

1145
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,760
or do they just randomly pick people up?

1146
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,920
I mean, there's a whole website here called Justia,

1147
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,440
which may be Justin's website,

1148
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,320
but he mistyped it at the end and put an A in instead of N.

1149
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,240
Yeah.

1150
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,040
And do you have to pay though?

1151
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,080
To be on Cash Cab?

1152
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,280
If you lose Cash Cab,

1153
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,280
do you have to pay when you get to your destination?

1154
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,800
Do they drop you off if you lose

1155
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,400
and you don't get to go to your destination?

1156
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,920
I've never watched Cash Cab.

1157
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,400
Oh, I think my Skype might've cut out.

1158
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,440
Can you guys not hear me?

1159
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,800
Yeah, we can hear you, Trav.

1160
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,600
Here's another question.

1161
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,080
Pay them.

1162
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,240
I just decided to pay the cab.

1163
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,000
Look at the meter, pay with there.

1164
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,720
Pay the cab.

1165
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,360
Yes.

1166
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,200
A while ago, I folded an...

1167
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,360
Oh, but wait, they don't have cash.

1168
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,120
They were planning on using a card.

1169
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,240
Use the fucking card reader.

1170
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,640
It probably didn't explode when we were into this.

1171
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,280
That shouldn't look suspicious.

1172
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,240
A while ago, I folded an origami dragon for my math teacher.

1173
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,880
The teacher asked me if I was good at origami.

1174
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,240
I said, yeah, sort of.

1175
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,160
She then asked, can you fold books to make words?

1176
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,720
I socially napped and wanted to exit the conversation

1177
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,480
as quickly as possible, said yes,

1178
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,520
which was a complete and total lie.

1179
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,800
She gave me an old math book to fold into her last name.

1180
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,920
I have no clue how to fold books.

1181
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,000
How can I do this?

1182
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,560
Maybe, how can I escape this awful task

1183
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,840
I did not mean to accept?

1184
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,440
I haven't looked at the book for a week or two.

1185
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,880
I keep making excuses until I haven't started yet.

1186
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,680
It's from a clever name pun involving books or something.

1187
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,200
Can't even be bothered to make up a name.

1188
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,560
Bad enough that you're agreeing to fold books into words.

1189
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,400
Books already have words in them.

1190
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:18,800
That's right.

1191
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,800
Yeah, so you should just give her back the original book

1192
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,240
and say like, yep, there you go.

1193
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,440
One word filled book, hot and fresh, ready to order.

1194
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,120
I'm looking at...

1195
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,240
Fold books.

1196
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,280
I'm looking at it now.

1197
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,080
It's like if you fold a bunch of pages in a row

1198
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,120
in a way that then makes like a pattern appear,

1199
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,960
so you can like fold one page

1200
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,760
and that's like the very left side of the J.

1201
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,600
And then it needs to be a long book

1202
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,360
if you're spelling out Jonathan Taylor Thomas,

1203
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,960
like a long, long, long, long book.

1204
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,240
It's nice that your teacher said,

1205
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,920
oh, thank you for this present.

1206
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,880
Now let me give you a chore to do.

1207
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,120
Yeah.

1208
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,400
This present's lovely.

1209
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,400
Make me a bigger, better present.

1210
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,040
I mean, I'm looking at Etsy and we're talking about,

1211
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,680
this is a $40 product that you are giving to them for free.

1212
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:17,840
I could do one where I just sort of roll the pages a little bit

1213
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,000
and then tuck it back into the spine

1214
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,880
and just do that with all the pages and you give it back.

1215
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,200
And the teacher's like, this doesn't say anything.

1216
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,320
And you say, yes, it does.

1217
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:32,560
It says, mmm, because it looks like a bunch of Ms.

1218
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,160
Could you just wait until you graduate

1219
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,240
and not worry about it anymore after that?

1220
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,840
That could be good.

1221
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,920
You could also get a Sharpie out

1222
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,160
and write Derek on the side of the book.

1223
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,280
Ooh, or find someone on Etsy

1224
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,120
and buy the book from them already

1225
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,440
or send it to them and say, hey, will you do this for me?

1226
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,240
And now you're the middleman of origami.

1227
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,440
Why'd you lie so bad?

1228
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,960
I'll tell you what's worth trying

1229
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:08,400
is to go to the teacher and say, I couldn't do it.

1230
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,880
And I thought I could, but your name's too hard

1231
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,120
and it's got a lot of bad letters in it

1232
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,120
or from an origami perspective,

1233
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,880
it's got a lot of bad letters in it.

1234
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,000
And I couldn't do it and I tried, but I couldn't do it.

1235
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,680
And I'm sorry, but I couldn't do it.

1236
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,440
I decided instead to focus on my studies.

1237
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:27,940
Right.

1238
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,920
Because I'm a child.

1239
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,760
And then your teacher's like, my name is Joe

1240
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,760
and it's just J-O, so.

1241
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,600
But the O is the hard one.

1242
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,960
The O is a really toughie.

1243
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,560
There's a lot of curves in there.

1244
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,800
Give me angles all day long.

1245
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,840
Hey, why'd you lie so bad though?

1246
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,200
This seems like a weird one.

1247
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,840
I get wanting to get out of the conversation,

1248
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:54,480
but in my experience, no is the much better rip cord

1249
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,920
for pretty much most things.

1250
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,080
If someone tries to improv you and you say no,

1251
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,680
end of improv, you're out of there.

1252
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,160
But if you say yes and, now you have to, you know,

1253
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,080
what are you gonna say next about the grocery store?

1254
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,120
Here, Griffin, let's try it, okay?

1255
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,120
Hey, Griffin, are you any good at origami?

1256
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,200
You tell me.

1257
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,280
Oh, it's pretty good.

1258
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,120
Can you fold books into words?

1259
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:18,660
No.

1260
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,160
You fail.

1261
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,180
I hate you.

1262
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:20,740
You fail.

1263
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,740
You fail this class.

1264
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:23,240
Oh, no.

1265
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,740
You're out of school now and you're off the football team.

1266
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:27,940
Okay.

1267
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:28,500
Quarterback.

1268
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,300
All right, let me try.

1269
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,540
The conversation's still over though, isn't it?

1270
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,660
Trav, let me try.

1271
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,860
Ask me, Trav.

1272
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:34,580
Okay.

1273
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:36,100
Hey, are you any good at origami?

1274
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:36,580
Hell yeah.

1275
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,980
Well, don't curse.

1276
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:39,540
We're in school.

1277
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:40,820
Fuck yeah.

1278
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:41,860
Fuck yeah, dude.

1279
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,340
Hey, hey, I heard that, Jared.

1280
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,140
Get to math.

1281
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:48,660
Is he fucking, is origami Steve good at origami?

1282
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,180
Dumb fucking question.

1283
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:50,820
Think about it.

1284
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,900
Think about it with your fucking brain before you-

1285
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,660
Get out of here, cursing Jerry.

1286
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,740
Cursing Jerry's vaping everywhere.

1287
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,180
Yeah, I'm trying to talk to origami Steve.

1288
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,740
Oh, shit, he's folding up my vape fog in the air.

1289
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,260
Don't curse.

1290
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,060
I'm gonna send you to the principal's office.

1291
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:10,660
Get out of here.

1292
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,260
No, I'm sorry.

1293
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,060
Origami Steve.

1294
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:13,560
Yeah.

1295
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,320
I know you're good at origami.

1296
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:15,800
Mm-hmm.

1297
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,840
Can you fold books into origami?

1298
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,320
He's the fucking best at origami.

1299
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,440
I swear to God.

1300
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,120
Cursing Jerry, I'll call your dad.

1301
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,160
Okay.

1302
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,720
Can you fold books into origami?

1303
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,920
I'll call your dad.

1304
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,160
Get to lunch.

1305
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:35,480
Okay.

1306
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,440
It's Taco Tuesday.

1307
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,680
Fuck yeah, dude.

1308
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,180
Okay.

1309
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,840
Now, can you fold books into words?

1310
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,640
Only Bibles.

1311
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,800
You sit there in silence.

1312
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,120
See what tough Ms. Teacher wants to do then.

1313
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:04,520
See how much she'd love to see her name represented in the art of the falling page

1314
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,560
if she's willing to destroy God's beautiful, perfect word.

1315
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,120
Let's end this episode.

1316
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:10,600
Hell yeah.

1317
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,080
Yeah.

1318
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,280
This has been so much fun.

1319
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,560
Thank you all for hanging out with us.

1320
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,680
We love you very much.

1321
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,080
We had a really fun 2018 with you,

1322
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,360
and we hope that we're going to have a great year together, us and you.

1323
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:31,080
If you are anywhere near New Orleans, the NOLA, I believe.

1324
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:31,720
Mm-hmm.

1325
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,760
As I believe they call it.

1326
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,400
As they call it.

1327
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,440
Or maybe just NOLA.

1328
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,720
I don't actually know.

1329
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,440
If you're anywhere near there or Birmingham, Alabama,

1330
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,040
we're going to be headed your way.

1331
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,680
So please come see us.

1332
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:48,040
If you head to McElroy.family, you can find the tour section there,

1333
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,080
and you can see the places that we are going to be.

1334
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:56,600
And that is going to be Birmingham on February 7th,

1335
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:02,840
and then New Orleans on February 9th with The Adventure Zone on February 10th

1336
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:06,040
with MBM all shows starting at 7 p.m.

1337
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:11,480
And it will be very fun, and we hope that you will come and join us

1338
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,760
because we're really looking forward to it.

1339
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,960
We've never been in that area.

1340
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,280
I've never visited either of those cities.

1341
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,480
So it's going to be a hoot and a half.

1342
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:27,320
Also, even before that, here in January, you can come see Sawbones at Sketchfest,

1343
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,640
the California Academy of Sciences on January 17th.

1344
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:36,360
January 17th, it's a big show with us,

1345
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:40,040
and Roderick's going to be there with Omnibus,

1346
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,280
and you should know this, and John the Colton,

1347
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,680
Paul and Storm, and a lot of other cool folks.

1348
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:50,440
So you go to Sketchfest website, get tickets for that.

1349
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:55,720
Also, last thing, you can get remote attendance or in-person attendance,

1350
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:03,080
I guess, for PodCon that's going to be January 19th through the 20th.

1351
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,520
And there's a lot of different panels you can see and stuff like that.

1352
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,920
And you can get remote attendance if you go to the PodCon website,

1353
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,280
which is podcon.com.

1354
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,200
So go for it.

1355
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,840
And Justin mentioned earlier, our website, macroid.family,

1356
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,520
got a bunch of stuff on there.

1357
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:20,680
If you want to find out more about our shows or get the newest merch,

1358
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,600
we have a new pin for January.

1359
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,880
It is a stylish pin that says UNLESS on it.

1360
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:26,600
It's real slick.

1361
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,480
Yeah, that's all at macroid.family,

1362
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,560
and thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1363
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,800
Maximumfun.org, check out all the great shows there.

1364
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,440
Thanks to John Roderick and The Long Winters

1365
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,120
for the use of our theme song,

1366
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,840
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1367
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,920
It's very, very good, the song is, and the album, and the band,

1368
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,160
and you should go get the whole discography.

1369
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,000
So y'all want the final?

1370
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:49,800
Yes.

1371
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,960
I was sent in by Megan. Thank you, Megan.

1372
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,040
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

1373
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,200
Muscley James is back on my screen. Thank you.

1374
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,680
Ooh, two for Muscley James.

1375
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,440
He's really curious, and he asks,

1376
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:05,720
how many rocks can you fit in your backpack?

1377
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:09,160
My name is Justin McElroy.

1378
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,440
I'm Travis McElroy.

1379
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,320
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1380
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,360
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1381
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:21,960
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

1382
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:47,800
Best comedy at the British Podcast Awards in 2017 and 2018.

1383
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,480
Also, I love it.

1384
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,680
There were no horses in this country until the mid to late 60s.

1385
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,600
Specialist bovine ass vet.

1386
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,120
Both of his eyes are squid's eyes.

1387
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,400
Yogurt buffet.

1388
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:01,080
She was married to a bacon farmer who saved her life.

1389
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,320
