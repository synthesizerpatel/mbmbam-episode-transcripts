1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,040
Hello everybody and welcome to our Brother for Brother mean advice show for the

6
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,680
imaginary. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,280
I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy. Got a story for you guys.

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:05,040
All right. Does it have spooks and scares or is it more like a jokes and laughs one,

9
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,840
like the funny sermons? You know what's funny? It's got both. Is there any hug and

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,920
loving and kissing in it? Yeah, what's it rating MPAA-wise? R. Oh, okay. Some adult content,

11
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,120
but educational adult content. Oh, okay. It's one of those horny,

12
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,720
edutainment movies with spooks and scares. What's the educational nudity? All right.

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,480
This will actually, I'll click for you guys when I tell you it's about my upcoming vasectomy.

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,320
Oh, so does, you can see how it all kind of tracks, right? Oh my. So just to set the stage,

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,800
I did not know. Don't really got to set it more than that. Well, I didn't. This is the first work

16
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,120
here. This is the first sort of vasectomy based conversation that I believe the three of us have

17
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,040
had unless you and Travis are having secret sidebar vasectomy chat. We all share our calendar

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,600
and mine has had an appointment labeled vasectomy appointment. You are fucking kidding. We win.

19
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,440
In the calendar, look in the calendar. Yesterday afternoon, blow it up. Justin, I need to know,

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,000
do you have any like big plans for the day before your vasectomy? I'll just like some final,

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,520
some just bucket list things you want to accomplish. I'll be damned, dude. Yesterday afternoon,

22
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,080
you had a vasectomy appointment, all caps. Oh no, we missed it. I didn't get you a card

23
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,280
or anything. You didn't get me a card or anything. I went to the, I went to get, I got,

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:42,320
gotta get a vasectomy. I'm just crazy about it. I'm crazy about this vasectomy. And it is like,

25
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:48,880
it, if you're a person with a penis, I think that, you know, it's a pretty, it's like reversible,

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,040
unlike, and which is the one negative.

27
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,000
There is a chance you could accidentally reverse it. Like you could pick something up wrong.

28
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:08,800
There's a lot of, there's a lot of birth control that is less, you know, taxing or more taxing or

29
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:16,720
whatever. But I just decided vasectomy is the way to go. So I go in, I waited, I would say for like

30
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:26,960
45 minutes and it was rough because I have no, I mean like I'm not in any way like worried or

31
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:34,400
nervous or unsure about this, but they were showing a video in the lobby on loop of what it's like to

32
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,320
get a vasectomy. So like some person's balls are just being split open in front of me. Every like

33
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,920
15 minutes, this one clip would pop up. Did it have a little narrator who was just like,

34
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,520
and you're still sure? Yeah. It was like, it's no big deal. You go, we go, just go in and clip

35
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:57,680
the vas deferens and, and then we get out in and out. Was it the Jurassic park DNA strand?

36
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,040
Who's like, there's going to be less of me kind of popping around. It's pretty close to that. We

37
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:11,360
got, uh, when I went in, I, uh, there was a, I was so bored. There was like a hearing test kiosk

38
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,640
that I like sat and took a hearing test. So I was waiting for-

39
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,000
Now not during, right? You weren't taking a hearing test during.

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,520
No, but I go back-

41
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,520
How'd the hearing test go? Probably not great.

42
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:27,120
Bad actually. My hearing is just as suspected bad. Um, but I just don't, I feel like I don't

43
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,240
want to go into doctor's offices every week to get something about my broken 30 year old body.

44
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,760
So at this point you've just accepted like, this doesn't work.

45
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,960
It doesn't work. That's life. So I get back there and there's a nurse back there to take my vitals.

46
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,840
And the first thing she says is, so you don't want any more kids?

47
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,720
Wow.

48
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,720
And I was like, um, feels like if you went to buy a car and someone's like,

49
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,440
you sure you want to pay for gas all the time? I think she was just making conversation.

50
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,720
I literally have no idea why she would decided to pitch it this way. And I said, um, yeah,

51
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,160
no, I'm for sure, for sure, for sure, for sure, for sure, for sure, for sure.

52
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,360
You should have said to the nurse that asked you that question. You should have been like,

53
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,560
oh yeah, I totally want more kids. Wait, should I not? Can I not do that?

54
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,720
Wait, I thought this was just sort of an aesthetic choice. You're telling me, wow.

55
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,520
I just want to walk around with my vas deferens hanging out through my scrotum. No big deal.

56
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,360
Now, Justin, were you worried about like a rookie of the year scenario

57
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,200
in which you would have this procedure done?

58
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,760
You would nut super hard every time you did.

59
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,840
It would really amaze Daniel Stern.

60
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,400
Yeah. So she asked me what I did for a living, and that's always a good conversation.

61
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,440
So I tried to muddle my way through that. Oh, by the way, she asked me,

62
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,400
you don't want any more kids? I said, and I didn't even like monitor my tone.

63
00:05:52,400 --> 00:06:00,000
It's just what like belched out of me was, no. She said, why not? I said, got them.

64
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,440
Got kids. Checked off the boxes.

65
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,040
Got them. Got a lot of kids. All good. No more thank you.

66
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,520
I got Boardwalk and Park Place. I'm not going to eat any more Big Macs.

67
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,240
So we, I was, the doctor finally made his way in about an hour after I got there.

68
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:25,600
And he has me, he said, the first thing he says is like, so what do you do for a living?

69
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,720
And I'm just like trying to explain. It's like, oh God.

70
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,680
I was like, this sounds so stupid, but like, I guess like technically

71
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,160
entertainer, I guess, I don't know. It's like, it's where my brothers and I do podcasts.

72
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,760
And then we just like wrote a, we're like, we just wrote a graphic novel that just came out.

73
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,160
And we do like these live, he cuts me off. He's like, do you lift heavy things?

74
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
No, no, I don't. I don't.

75
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,800
You, you've, you're in the career path that you're in so that you explicitly

76
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,720
never have to lift anything heavy.

77
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,360
And that's all he was trying to ascertain. Like dude did not need my fucking LinkedIn.

78
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,480
I thought you were going to say, he was like, wait, are you Taco?

79
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,160
Are you Justin McElroy? Oh my God.

80
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,600
I'm honored to be working on your balls.

81
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,640
What a treat to be working on your balls.

82
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:22,160
And he, he, uh, he said, um, we can, we can give you, uh, some Valium before.

83
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:30,240
And the, another option is, um, you can do the gas that'll knock you out for it.

84
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,680
And it's like 80 bucks more.

85
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,000
So I don't know what 80 bucks is worth, but it's that apparently.

86
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,280
So like $80. And I don't know why he knew the amount like right off the top of his head,

87
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,840
but it's like $80 where I want to knock myself out with gas for this ball procedure.

88
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,200
Um, but then he's like, okay, stand up and take off your pants.

89
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,360
I did. I did. I acquiesced.

90
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,160
And you tore away your tear away pants.

91
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,200
Yeah. And I dropped my pants and, um.

92
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,160
Did he say, this is too big, man. I can't, I wouldn't even know where to find

93
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,600
the vas deferens in this thing.

94
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,080
He just grabbed, he just grabbed, grabbed my vas deferens, both of them.

95
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,480
And he, this is not bullshit.

96
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,880
Without looking, it was amazing.

97
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:21,040
He pinched them and I, and I felt like, oh God, oh boyzy.

98
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,680
And he said, this is, these are his words.

99
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,880
Can you tolerate that?

100
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,000
Wow.

101
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,240
Fuck yeah, I can tolerate it. Look at me.

102
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,240
Some people black out when I do that.

103
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,440
If you can tolerate that.

104
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,640
And he was like, if you tolerate that, we should be good to go.

105
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,440
Some people black out and then, but in the back of my head was thinking,

106
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,920
fuck, if I was one of those people that blacked out, I could save myself $80.

107
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,200
You just pinched my vas deferens.

108
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,440
Also, where's the word of warning?

109
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,360
Like, hey, I'm about to pinch some stuff.

110
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,120
You might black out.

111
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,200
The other word that I didn't get was like, you can pull your pants back up.

112
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,480
Cause we were like a few sort of conversational threads into this discussion

113
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,320
before I was like, can I cover my balls or?

114
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,000
Tell me more about podcasting.

115
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,320
Yeah, is there more we need to address?

116
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,560
So we go, we finished that appointment.

117
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,080
I made my appointment for the thing.

118
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,920
He said, you'll need a driver, which it was a fun, like,

119
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,000
give it a fun sort of heist feel.

120
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,800
The theft of Justin's ability to create.

121
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,920
Call Statham.

122
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,840
I got a guy working on my balls.

123
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,760
You need a no baby driver.

124
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:44,640
So I'm in the sort of checkout area and I'm getting a date for when I could get my vasectomy.

125
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,400
The doctor at first offered me, how about tomorrow?

126
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,040
And that was a part of me was like, fuck yeah, let's go.

127
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,320
And I told him, it was like, unfortunately, actually that won't work for me

128
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,200
cause I'm gonna have to watch both of my kids all day by myself.

129
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,240
But I'll definitely be ready for a vasectomy after that.

130
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,360
So let's go ahead and we scheduled it out as I'm standing in the checkout area

131
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,480
when they're making my appointment.

132
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,880
And the lady's like, so there's a couple of things you just need to be aware of.

133
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,920
When you come, you're gonna need to bring somebody to drive you

134
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,720
and a valium to take and a jockstrap.

135
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,080
And I'm like, you know I don't have a jockstrap.

136
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,200
And she's like, you can get one in the gift shop and bring it with you.

137
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,240
And she said, you're gonna need to wear a jockstrap.

138
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,600
She said, you're gonna have some swelling for about 48 hours.

139
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,440
Sexual activity will be okay after a week.

140
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,840
And you're gonna need to wear the jockstrap for two weeks to alleviate the discomfort.

141
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,360
I was like, so really the sexual activity will be okay in two weeks?

142
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm like, let's go ahead.

143
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,760
And the question of sexual activity will be off the table

144
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,000
as long as the jockstrap is in the equation.

145
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,400
Okay, so we got the jockstrap.

146
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,280
And then the last thing, this is wild, you gotta come back.

147
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:19,280
She's like, you're gonna need 20 evacuations after you have the surgery.

148
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,120
And then we'll test your sperm count again.

149
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:28,160
So it could, and then you'll be sort of like clear for, you know, sex without condoms.

150
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,840
But 20 evacuations, so it could be, you know,

151
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,760
three or four months before we're ready to test that.

152
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,760
In my head, I'm like, yeah, it could be.

153
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,640
I was so happy she snuck in three or four months

154
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,040
because I was ready to be like, oh, so just a few.

155
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,080
Oh, never mind.

156
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,800
It's not just like a six pack of Gatorade or whatever.

157
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,720
So do you have a waiting room or is there something comfortable?

158
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,680
20's a tall order.

159
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,440
Jesus Christ.

160
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,120
But this is the worst part.

161
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,960
She's like, at that point, she gets like really vague,

162
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,600
like upsettingly vague about this sample procedure.

163
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,640
And she was like, so you'll just have the cups

164
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,480
and you'll bring in the cups and we'll test them.

165
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,120
And I was like, okay, like, where are the cups coming from?

166
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,160
Oh, we'll have them here.

167
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,080
And she was like, and then you want to take them to the,

168
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,240
oh, let me actually scratch that out in the form.

169
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,840
See, it says you used to take them here and she scratches it out.

170
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,160
She's like, but actually you're going to take them to the lab

171
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,760
and they're actually at this different address.

172
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,840
And she scratches it out and writes something else in.

173
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,080
Then she's like, and their times are different actually,

174
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,920
scratching it out and right back again.

175
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,400
So at this point, like I'm going to bring a cup of juice to somebody

176
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,200
can we please nail down exactly when and where that is happening?

177
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Like, I don't even know where I get the cups.

178
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,440
Like, will you give me the cups here?

179
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,640
I actually asked her like, I don't know how to say this,

180
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,160
but will I prepare the sample at home

181
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,240
or will I prepare the sample here?

182
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,920
That seems like a small question.

183
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,240
It's the biggest difference humanly possible.

184
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,200
The biggest difference, like she said, and it could be,

185
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,240
it doesn't have to be right away,

186
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,200
but it should be within two hours of procuring the sample.

187
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,320
And I'm like, ma'am, I cannot weigh the social ramification.

188
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Please just tell me exactly how many minutes

189
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,600
and I'll do it perfectly.

190
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,920
I don't want to rush, but I don't want to be late.

191
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,760
I want to know the exact method this is happening.

192
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,280
Here you go, still steaming.

193
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,480
Right.

194
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,560
No, you nasty pervert.

195
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,880
The cups, you're supposed to use different cups.

196
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,360
It's only been 10 minutes.

197
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,720
It's way too soon.

198
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,480
You just cranked off.

199
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,600
You just cranked it.

200
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,040
Did you already have your shoes on

201
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,480
and your keys in your other hand?

202
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,040
What are you doing?

203
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,960
We did a temperature scan on this.

204
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,920
You're a dirty pervert.

205
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,840
It's how close you live.

206
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,320
So we have security cameras, okay?

207
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,600
You can't do that.

208
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,960
We did it like the Predator.

209
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,880
This stuff's magma red hot.

210
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,280
Also, you have no sperm.

211
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,320
Congratulations.

212
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,160
But also, also nice.

213
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,800
The cum puzzle has been solved.

214
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm now like worried about,

215
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,640
there is going to be a period,

216
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,280
when people talk about the back catalog of the show,

217
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,680
there is going to be a jockstrap period

218
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,880
where I did record wearing a jockstrap for a while.

219
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,480
What if that's your best word?

220
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,520
Maybe that's like, yeah,

221
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,120
then I'll have to keep it on all the time.

222
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,320
It'll get like superstitious about it.

223
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,320
I do see in the calendar now,

224
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,560
your actual vasectomy day,

225
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,920
the day vasectomy will happen.

226
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,360
It's, and I know it is

227
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,880
because I'm not going to say what day it is

228
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,400
because I don't want you to get tweets from people

229
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,440
like congratulating you or checking in on how you're doing.

230
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
So just go ahead and start sending those in nonstop

231
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,240
for the next month.

232
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,640
But it does say vasectomy in all caps

233
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,000
with a big exclamation point,

234
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,360
which is one nice,

235
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
because it notes just how excited you are

236
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,160
for this procedure.

237
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,960
But it also lets me know that I am going to see you

238
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,480
during the jockstrap period

239
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,320
because my seeing you will be within two weeks of this date.

240
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,600
So I'm, I can't wait.

241
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,760
Oh yeah, within two weeks of this date,

242
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,440
we will be on tour, won't we?

243
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,800
Yeah, we sure will, bud.

244
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,880
I just need a little bit to process the fact

245
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,560
that I'm going to be walking around Disney World

246
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,440
with my balls in my hands.

247
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,080
Oh, no!

248
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,040
You will be at Disney World in a jockstrap.

249
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,480
It's a small world.

250
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,080
It's going to be, oh, rough, rough time.

251
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,720
All right, well, that's going to be a cool trip.

252
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,480
I'm sure I'll be fine by then.

253
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,280
So anyway, that's like my sort of situation.

254
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,440
That's where I'm at in my walk.

255
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,840
Let's move on to the questions, though.

256
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

257
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,400
About two weeks ago,

258
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,520
a set of keys was found near a set of mailboxes

259
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,480
in my neighborhood.

260
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
Someone hung them on a nearby bulletin board,

261
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,160
but no one has claimed them.

262
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,960
There's a store loyalty card on the key chain,

263
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
and I happen to know there's a vulnerability

264
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,920
in the company's website

265
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,800
that would allow me to access their personal information,

266
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,040
including a phone number and email address.

267
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,880
Is it okay to obtain and use that information

268
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,840
to contact them and help them get their keys back?

269
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,800
PS, I reported the vulnerability to the company months ago,

270
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
but they don't seem interested in fixing it.

271
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,520
That's from Helpful Hacker in Redacted.

272
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,720
Fuck yeah, I'm in.

273
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,120
I'm doing good.

274
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,240
I'm a white hat.

275
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,200
I'm into the Aldi network database.

276
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,080
I found the sarin gas.

277
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,320
Release sarin gas in all Aldis.

278
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,440
Cancel sarin gas, but I could.

279
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,360
Why do they even have this command?

280
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,440
Piggly Wiggly has just forwarded me 15 Bitcoins

281
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,760
to release sarin gas in all the Aldis.

282
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Is that a lot or not many?

283
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,920
I don't even know if 15 Bitcoin,

284
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,760
is that like 15 cents or $15?

285
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,520
How does that, is it?

286
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,440
How many Bitcoins?

287
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,200
I'm gonna say it's probably about quarter million dollars.

288
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,400
You could do a lot of crimes to me

289
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,720
if it meant I get my keys or wallet back.

290
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,440
If I lose my keys or wallet, not my phone.

291
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,480
Losing my phone is annoying

292
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,160
and it's gonna be kind of expensive,

293
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,400
but like I can spend the money

294
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,600
and get like the insurance coverage on the phone

295
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,760
to do the thing and I'll get the phone back.

296
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,840
But my keys, holy shit.

297
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,920
If I lost my keys, that's my month

298
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,840
is just getting reassembling the fellowship

299
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,800
of the key ring of just getting,

300
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,320
like I would have to first remember

301
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,000
all the keys I have on my key ring

302
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,440
and then my wallet, fucking forget about it.

303
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,560
If my wallet disappears,

304
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,920
then I'm just gonna like start over,

305
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,160
change my identity, you know?

306
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,360
Cause it's, there's no point.

307
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,080
There's no point.

308
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,080
I could not tell you the cards that are in there.

309
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,440
So like I would let you,

310
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,600
I wouldn't mind you hacking the Aldi website

311
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,400
to get my info if it meant reuniting me.

312
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,760
Here's what I'm more worried about.

313
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,360
I would also love to have my keys back

314
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,880
though I only have three keys,

315
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,160
but I do have a really great like Tardis key chain on there

316
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,560
that I love and I wouldn't know where to get a replacement.

317
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,000
Yeah, it's like one of those like,

318
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,080
it's shaped like a hotel room, you know,

319
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,920
like diamonds and it's like information

320
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,040
about the Tardis and stuff.

321
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,720
But it's not, it's not three-dimensional.

322
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,680
It's not a three-dimensional.

323
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,880
It's a flat key.

324
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
That's what I thought is that you had a phone box

325
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,760
in your pocket, okay.

326
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,680
No, but what I'd be worried about

327
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,600
is the information that you could access here

328
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,840
of like Travis went to the grocery store

329
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
and like had a week where he really thought

330
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,760
he was gonna get into fancy cheeses

331
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,600
and bought too much cheese one weekend.

332
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,400
Like that's information I don't want you to have about me.

333
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,640
I'm also disappointed in whatever grocery store chain

334
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,400
this is that you reached out to them

335
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,160
and was like, hey, there's a backdoor

336
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,920
and they're like, well, okay, whatever.

337
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,480
It happens.

338
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,440
Oh, I mean, literally nobody gives a shit.

339
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,720
I think go ahead and hack them.

340
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,720
And I don't usually say that.

341
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
I usually think that the hack is not good.

342
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,760
Here's the thing though.

343
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,600
It's been two weeks.

344
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,480
So my point being is like this person's probably

345
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,120
already working on like rebuilding their key chain.

346
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,280
They might even be like done.

347
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,800
And now like two or three weeks later,

348
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,120
you're like, here they are.

349
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,320
Like they've just gotten over the fact

350
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,640
that they've lost and replaced these keys.

351
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,840
Can you imagine?

352
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,720
I was thinking when Griff was talking about

353
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,040
how sort of terrible this would be for his keys and wallet.

354
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,440
Like it would be unfathomably annoying.

355
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,400
Like no argument there.

356
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,480
Can you imagine if this could happen for internet?

357
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,400
Can you imagine how kind of like

358
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
if just one day you woke up and you're like,

359
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,360
I can't do it at all.

360
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,640
I can't.

361
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,440
Like you can't.

362
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,720
Hold on, Justin, just to follow up.

363
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,000
It's all internet.

364
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,320
I can't internet.

365
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,600
And all my internet is gone from me, right?

366
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,680
I can't get to it, but it is gone.

367
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,240
Like it's not gonna, not like some weird hacker is like,

368
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,920
it's gone.

369
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,000
Like your internet is like a physical thing in the world

370
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and you just can't get into it.

371
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,920
So you can't check your sites?

372
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,520
Can't check your sites.

373
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,880
I could do this now, right?

374
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,400
Just log off, go to a cabin.

375
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,360
But what if people start talking shit?

376
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,360
Oh, okay.

377
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,080
What if people are asking questions about your vasectomy

378
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,520
and you can't be there to answer them?

379
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,960
Yes, I won't be there to answer them.

380
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,040
So I can't do that.

381
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,800
It's like, I don't know what the,

382
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,960
I'm having trouble sort of like conceiving this.

383
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,080
I was just thinking about how like,

384
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,760
it would be really nice,

385
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,760
it would be almost kind of nice with a wallet

386
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,000
cause there's like, you get a lot of cruft

387
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,080
and it's like, okay, well I just need like,

388
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,920
all I need is like a license and a card.

389
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,240
And like after that, I'm just, I don't care.

390
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,160
I'll figure out the AAA's phone number.

391
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,960
Like if I need to contact them, whatever, no problem.

392
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,160
I do have a lot of junk in my wallet.

393
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,280
It's just a lot of junk.

394
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,000
And I just kind of wish you could do that with like internet

395
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,080
where like, I just need this email address.

396
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,120
Just empty it out?

397
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,640
What if I just emptied out my internet?

398
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,440
Fuck yes.

399
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:52,880
Okay.

400
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,720
I've got a fucking lick ice cream frequent,

401
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,120
ice cream buyer card that's all the way punched out.

402
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,000
Hell yeah.

403
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I get a free fucking pint of ice cream.

404
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,720
Are you kidding me?

405
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,640
What else is in here?

406
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,680
What's in my wallet?

407
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,480
Let me see.

408
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,240
Anybody, hey, this is a funny, hold on, wait.

409
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,600
This can be like a funny bit.

410
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,440
Anybody got, anybody got a Jimmy cap?

411
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,760
Anybody got a, anybody got a rubber?

412
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,400
Ah, no.

413
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,360
Yeah, I don't either.

414
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,760
All right.

415
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,480
Here's a Yahoo.

416
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

417
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,920
Thank you, Adrian.

418
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,120
It's Yahoo Answers user.

419
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,640
They're anonymous.

420
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,480
I'll call them Cody asks.

421
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,800
Well, people think I'm tough if I talk through clenched teeth

422
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,080
and wear sunglasses.

423
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,480
They might think you have to go to the bathroom really bad.

424
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,920
I don't know, Trav.

425
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,360
I think it could be pretty bad ass.

426
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,280
I think you could sound like a real tough, okay.

427
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,960
Can you show me which way it is to the rallies?

428
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,160
Do you know, see, that sounds, Griffin, like you need to shit.

429
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,000
Or you're angry at rallies.

430
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,640
Let me try.

431
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,320
Where's the closest rallies?

432
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,640
If you sound like a representation of like a physical manifestation of anger,

433
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,760
like the Lewis Black character in Inside Out,

434
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,600
is that tough or are you just kind of fussy?

435
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,960
Is there a way to talk through clenched teeth and not sound angry?

436
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,400
Like if you were like, oh, I love rallies.

437
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
No, that still sounds like you're pretty pissed off.

438
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,480
Okay, let me try again.

439
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,360
Let me try again.

440
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,680
I love rallies.

441
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,040
I don't know how to diagnose that one, Trav.

442
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,920
Okay, okay.

443
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,760
Can it be inspirational?

444
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,760
Like what?

445
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,720
It always seems impossible until it's done, Nelson Mandela.

446
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,400
That kind of sounded a little bit like the Joker and Batman had a raspy voiced baby.

447
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,200
Yeah, but I do appreciate the quote.

448
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,880
I found it uplifting.

449
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,320
Was that somebody speaking to Nelson Mandela or did you include that?

450
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,000
Hey, Nelson Mandela.

451
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,800
It was both.

452
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,840
It was someone quoting Nelson Mandela to Nelson Mandela.

453
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,320
So Nelson Mandelbeck, okay, you got me.

454
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,480
And Nelson Mandela thinking, wow, I'm uplifted and that person's tough.

455
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,080
Yeah, that's a very tough version.

456
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,880
I'll say this.

457
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,480
The sunglasses are going to go a long fucking way to looking tough.

458
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,400
Let me offer a similar but different option.

459
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,280
Sunglasses and your teeth never touch.

460
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,560
So you say like, let's go to the rallies.

461
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,920
Has anybody seen my Bible?

462
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,640
Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, and today is a gift.

463
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,880
That's why they call it the present.

464
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,440
Nelson Mandela.

465
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,960
Actually, Kung Fu Panda.

466
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,160
Okay.

467
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,240
I found a page of 10 life changing Kung Fu Panda insurational quotes.

468
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,720
Ah, cool.

469
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,600
Let's figure out which one is the toughest.

470
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,600
Which one of these KFP quotes can Justin make sound the most hard ass?

471
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,560
Okay.

472
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,800
That was Master Oogway, of course.

473
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,560
Your story may not have such a happy beginning,

474
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,880
but that does not make you who you are.

475
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,280
It is the rest of it.

476
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,200
Who you choose to be.

477
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,480
It's from the Seasayer.

478
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,080
Not exactly pithy.

479
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,440
No, it's a little wordy.

480
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,520
Do you have sunglasses?

481
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,320
Do you have sunglasses?

482
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,440
Yeah.

483
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,520
I know you have your fucking Gunnars,

484
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,120
but those have never made anybody look tough ever in the history of time.

485
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,080
Okay, here we go.

486
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,520
I got my sunglasses on now.

487
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,960
Tap them so I can hear it.

488
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,400
Yeah, tap them against the mic.

489
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:30,960
Okay.

490
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,000
He could be tapping anything.

491
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,840
I believe him. Master Oogway says,

492
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,520
There are no accidents.

493
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,920
Okay, wait.

494
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,360
Shit, no, that was bad.

495
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,000
That was fucking hard ass, dude.

496
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,280
There are some, though.

497
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,760
That one's just-

498
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,120
But there are accidents.

499
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,320
There are accidents.

500
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,480
If I knock over my cup and I'm like,

501
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,920
oh, I'm so sorry, and you're like,

502
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,960
there are no accidents.

503
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,040
There was an answer on this,

504
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,800
and it's from an anonymous user who says,

505
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,520
do you have a jaw issue?

506
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,640
And then follows that up with,

507
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,720
sunglasses are way fucking tough.

508
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,640
Yeah, for sure.

509
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,160
Me and my family like to go out and eat every weekend.

510
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,880
And one of our favorite places to visit

511
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,040
is a local Mexican food restaurant,

512
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,120
but recently we've been avoiding the restaurant

513
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,520
since one of the staff there keeps asking us riddles

514
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,320
while we order.

515
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,600
Oh my God in heaven.

516
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
He won't even ask us if we want to hear them anymore.

517
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,400
He just starts asking us riddles until we've lost our appetite.

518
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,640
There was even an instance where the whole night

519
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,960
he just kept trying to get us to invest in Bitcoin.

520
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,080
And that's not a riddle.

521
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,280
That's different.

522
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,040
Well, is it a riddle, Justin?

523
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,560
How does Bitcoin work?

524
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,280
I love this restaurant since it has amazing burritos,

525
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,440
but this guy repels us from going back.

526
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,160
How should I confront this burrito riddler

527
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,560
so that I can enjoy a nice meal

528
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,240
without being forced to listen to his musings?

529
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,280
That's from Gmail.

530
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,720
I just-

531
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,200
If meat and cheese wrapped up by bring to thee,

532
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,440
you must answer me, visa riddles three.

533
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,960
It's just, are the riddles Mexican food based

534
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,320
or are they just anything goes?

535
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,280
Okay, what do you guys think about this?

536
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,120
I just read these on Reddit about riddles.

537
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,560
Oh, what was it?

538
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,000
So there's like a guy and it's a puddle of the food.

539
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,800
Oh, what was that?

540
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,240
Well, like how does he just have these riddles ready to go?

541
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,600
Is he reading them from a book?

542
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,520
What's he steal?

543
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,840
And why does he want you to invest in Bitcoin?

544
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,440
I just don't see...

545
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,120
It just makes me...

546
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,800
I don't want to do a riddle then, but sometimes I do.

547
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,240
And that's the problem with riddles

548
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,040
is you can never get a nice brain tickler

549
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,440
when you need one.

550
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,640
And I don't really want to do that

551
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,920
when I'm trying to eat Mexican food.

552
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:01,280
Where is this guy when I'm on a long car trip with my wife?

553
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:07,200
Because then we can really use a nice little cerebral diversion

554
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,840
to sort of ponder over.

555
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,320
Especially when it's time to order,

556
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,680
which I think we can all agree,

557
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,560
no matter how confident you are in what meal you want,

558
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,760
as soon as someone asks you,

559
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,240
it becomes like the most high stress,

560
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,920
like, oh, please let me go last.

561
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,280
Like, why would that be the time to ask me some riddles?

562
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,960
I'm barely keeping it together, ordering from you.

563
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,960
I googled taco riddles

564
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,040
because I did want to have one where you could like...

565
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,000
My grand plan was,

566
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,080
what if you twisted it back on him with a taco riddle?

567
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,320
And like that would really knock him for a loop.

568
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:54,560
And I found an online riddle database that's crowdsourced.

569
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,200
So the quality of the riddles,

570
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,800
specifically the one I found,

571
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,800
and then as I continue to peruse the site,

572
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,760
all on this site is questionable.

573
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,360
So I don't have...

574
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,440
I wanted you guys to know

575
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,640
that when I don't have anything to add to this,

576
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,720
it's not for lack of trying.

577
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
I tried a few things.

578
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,560
I looked and I just couldn't bring home the bacon this time.

579
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,760
Well, hold on, Justin.

580
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,720
Let us hear them.

581
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,640
Don't just assume that.

582
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,960
Hit us with those gems.

583
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,120
Okay, well, here's the one riddle on the internet about tacos.

584
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,840
Riddle.

585
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,680
This is from riddles.com,

586
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,920
which is my new fucking homepage.

587
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,280
I have 10 tacos.

588
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,520
My friend eats three of his.

589
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,880
I eat 11.

590
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,800
How many do I have left by tomorrow?

591
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,480
How many do I have left by tomorrow?

592
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,040
Wait, what?

593
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:48,800
Okay.

594
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,160
Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.

595
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,760
I'm gonna read this one more time.

596
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,440
I have 10 tacos.

597
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,200
My friend eats three of his.

598
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,840
I eat 11.

599
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,880
How many do I have left by tomorrow?

600
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,960
You have negative one taco.

601
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,600
No, I've got it.

602
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,720
No, Travis.

603
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,360
The riddles are all about sort of open-minded way of thinking.

604
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,800
And the answer to this one is the doctor was his mom.

605
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,160
Oh, they don't bury alive tacos.

606
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,760
They all fuse into a piece of feces in my toilet.

607
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,160
Yum.

608
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,040
That's the answer.

609
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,600
Holy shit, doctor.

610
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,320
Just saying.

611
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,800
Hey guys, here's another riddle.

612
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,920
What do ghosts eat for breakfast?

613
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,960
Cereal with boo-berries?

614
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,200
No.

615
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:40,880
No.

616
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,680
No, blueberry pancakes.

617
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,720
Invisible eggs.

618
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,920
Dreaded wheat.

619
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,760
Fucking hell, man.

620
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,120
Damn, dude.

621
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,800
Great riddles that get frazzled out through the ages are very challenging.

622
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:04,640
And riddles.com is where people can come and just sort of do whatever.

623
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,200
Just sort of play around and explore the space.

624
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,960
I'm deep in the guts of this website right now.

625
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,760
Here's one.

626
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,440
Oh, I got one for you.

627
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,800
I'm neither liquid nor solid or gas.

628
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,760
I'm used to create famous things, but I do not get any fame.

629
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,920
If you merge solid and liquid, you will find the other part of who I am.

630
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,440
What am I?

631
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,480
What?

632
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,360
I am paint.

633
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,480
Hey, paint's liquid.

634
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,640
Hey, what are you doing?

635
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,520
What are you doing?

636
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,560
You're not.

637
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,840
You're not paint.

638
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,440
What are you doing?

639
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,000
I am not water or soda or beer or wine,

640
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,560
but I am a wet liquid that you drink and I'm not milk.

641
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,280
What am I?

642
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,120
I'm water.

643
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,040
But a different kind of water than what you were thinking of.

644
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,440
That's a good riddle.

645
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,720
Damn, could this be?

646
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,240
Advice is played.

647
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,560
Can we all agree that advice is played?

648
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,080
Riddles are where it's at.

649
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,640
That's where it's at.

650
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,160
Okay, you can carry it everywhere you go and it does not get heavy.

651
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,600
What is it?

652
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,000
I don't know what.

653
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,280
Okay, one, we can spend the next 45 minutes listing things

654
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,040
that fit that clarification.

655
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,040
The answer is your name.

656
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,560
Okay, but like also a light bag, a balloon.

657
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,800
Like there are lots of things, a grain of sand.

658
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,600
Hey, guys, I'm big as an elephant, but lighter than a feather.

659
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,160
What am I?

660
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,840
You know, the wind.

661
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,200
That wind is as big as an elephant.

662
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,680
This is riddles.com.

663
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:55,200
This should be like brain teasers.fart, not like riddles.com,

664
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,240
which should be the web address of like the internet's premiere riddle source.

665
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,320
Here's one for you.

666
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,520
Which of these words is the odd one out?

667
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,320
Apple, care, or strawberry?

668
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,360
Care?

669
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,680
The answer is not care.

670
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,720
The answer is strawberry because apple and care end with an E,

671
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,840
but strawberry doesn't.

672
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
Okay, but like.

673
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,520
Seriously, you just can't do that.

674
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,920
Just can't do that. That's not how any of it works.

675
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,080
You can't.

676
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,720
You simply can't.

677
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,520
Okay, you ready?

678
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,640
I like this one.

679
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,200
The hand sows, the eye harvests.

680
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,440
That's the riddle?

681
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,160
Yep.

682
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,120
The hand sows, the eye harvests.

683
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,360
I ask again, that's the riddle.

684
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:49,860
Yep.

685
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,880
Answer, to read and to write.

686
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,960
Okay, we gotta go to Money Zone.

687
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,840
We could do this all day.

688
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,400
This is the dumbest shit I've ever seen.

689
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,280
This is worse than Yahoo Answers and it's riddles.com.

690
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,200
This should be a fucking honored website.

691
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,080
I want to do one more just to like get us into the Money Zone.

692
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,720
Help me solve this, is the name of this one.

693
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,800
Riddle, I have six legs, three eyes, five tails, 20 ears, and half a head.

694
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,440
Who am I?

695
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,080
Answer, I don't know.

696
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,680
Please help me solve this.

697
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,360
Are you kidding me?

698
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,280
Oh, riddles.com.

699
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:33,780
No.

700
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,440
All right.

701
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,960
Well, the hunt is on.

702
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,880
I've got the beginning of a riddle.

703
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,720
I feel like this is a riddle I've started.

704
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,800
We have a considerable platform here, boys, that we need to use responsibly.

705
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,560
We are now crowdsourcing the hunt.

706
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,160
Give me the numbers again, Juice.

707
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,660
Juice.

708
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,840
I have six legs, three eyes, five tails, 20 ears, and half a head.

709
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,340
Who am I?

710
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,120
Yeah.

711
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,760
So get out there.

712
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,200
Get looking, friends.

713
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,640
Write in your theories.

714
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,360
Work together.

715
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,280
I want to see this on the message boards.

716
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,840
Do your math.

717
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,360
I want to see people helping this person figure this one out.

718
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,560
Oh, my good god.

719
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:25,600
Oh, I had such a great dinner last night, y'all.

720
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:32,320
It was meatballs in like a soy glaze over rice and peppers.

721
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,400
Very delicious.

722
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,280
Very quick to make.

723
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,240
Very satisfying.

724
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,080
And the fancy restaurant I got it at was, what was the name of it?

725
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,720
Oh, that's right.

726
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,840
That's right.

727
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,400
My Kitchen.

728
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:42,900
Whoa.

729
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:49,440
Believe it or not, it's from Blue Apron, where you're going to get delicious, high-quality

730
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,680
ingredients that you will make into absolutely stunning meals that you will not be able to

731
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
believe that you yourself cooked.

732
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,640
If you thought like, hey, I should learn to cook a little bit better or get into some

733
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,840
new recipes or try some new ingredients that maybe you've never messed around with, Blue

734
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,480
Apron is a great way to get started.

735
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,760
They've got chef-designed recipes and exciting partnerships.

736
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,760
Some of the recipes that are going to be coming up in the next few weeks are hidden right

737
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,400
now because they're going to be determined by MasterChef.

738
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,720
That's exciting.

739
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,640
There's even a Bob's Burgers-themed meal coming up soon.

740
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,680
Get out.

741
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,320
Yeah, I'm serious.

742
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,160
So check out this week's menu.

743
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,360
Get your first three meals free at BlueApron.com slash my brother.

744
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,120
That's BlueApron.com slash my brother.

745
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,840
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

746
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,280
Can I tell you about Wink?

747
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,240
Yes.

748
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,280
Wink's real good.

749
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,920
Wink will help you figure out what wine's good and then bring it right to your door.

750
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:57,920
There's a guy, his name is Todd Winkles, and he will come to your house.

751
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,120
He carries the box, and he sets it down really gently, and a lot of these wine delivery companies,

752
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,440
they won't set the box down gently.

753
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,320
At that point, you don't got nice bottles of wine that have been sort of tailored for

754
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,520
your taste buds.

755
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,360
You got a wet doormat, a wet wine stain doormat.

756
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,960
Wink won't do you like that.

757
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,080
They got online ordering.

758
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,120
They got quick shipping.

759
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,280
They got personalized recommendations.

760
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,480
The only way that Wink can make wine discovery, the act of it, easier is if they drank it

761
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,440
for you.

762
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,320
A lot of other wine delivery companies will do this.

763
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
Companies will do that.

764
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
They do do that.

765
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,760
They insist on that.

766
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,240
It's always two for you, one for us.

767
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,320
Thanks for buying us this wine, they say.

768
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,200
And Todd Winkles will really want to, and if you invite him in for a glass, he will

769
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,360
appreciate it, but he loves this red stuff and this white stuff sometimes.

770
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,200
It's pink and bubbly, but he won't do it.

771
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,760
He will resist the temptation.

772
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,280
Anyway, it's Wink, W-I-N-C-E, W-I-N-C-E.

773
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,000
It's wince.

774
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,280
What a riddle.

775
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,160
W-I-N-C, this is my riddle.

776
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:13,800
What is the wrong way to spell a company's name and then not get paid for a commercial.

777
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,000
Wink makes it easy to discover the great wine by-

778
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Discover the great wine.

779
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I don't know what's wrong with me.

780
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It's the greatest wine.

781
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I don't know what's wrong with me.

782
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Why am I incapable of reading it and talking it the same?

783
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,040
It's in all of the greats.

784
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,320
What's happening to me?

785
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,360
Jesus Christ.

786
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,200
They match wines to your taste

787
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,800
and ship them right to your door.

788
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,000
They got no membership fees.

789
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,560
You can skip any month, cancel any time.

790
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,440
Anyway, go to trywink.com slash my brother.

791
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,080
You're gonna get $20 off your first shipment.

792
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:51,080
That's T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com slash my brother for 20 bucks off.

793
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,320
Trywink.com slash my brother.

794
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,400
Oh, thank God.

795
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,360
I got a message from Jamie to Matt.

796
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,200
Happy anniversary.

797
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,760
Since we have one in August and one in December,

798
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,780
I have a higher chance of getting this message

799
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,060
to you on time.

800
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,020
I'm thrilled that my relentless onslaught

801
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,360
of making you listen to McElroy podcasts worked

802
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,280
and that we can enjoy them together now.

803
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,460
Thanks for 13 years of loves, laughs, and vidya games.

804
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,200
I love you and I like your back.

805
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,400
Nice.

806
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,880
Like your, I like your back.

807
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,240
Oh, I thought you said I like you back, but it's your back.

808
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
I said it right.

809
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,160
I can read and talk at the same time.

810
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,960
All right, no need to get like that about it.

811
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,320
Yeah, I enjoy good back.

812
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,120
This is a message for B and it's from your Tom.

813
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,420
Oops, fuck, that's right.

814
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,180
From me to the McElroys to you.

815
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,440
Thanks for showing up to the club fair,

816
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,680
dining to Monster Factory with me,

817
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,840
and all the other more serious and mushy ways

818
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,200
you've changed my life for the better, you electro cutie.

819
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,600
No matter when you hear this,

820
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,640
I know I can't wait to see you.

821
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,380
Ernie and Brian are okay too, I guess.

822
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:07,380
Was the intro to that message Tom realizing

823
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,960
that they have to actually write something?

824
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,320
Yes, I do think that Tom maybe didn't know

825
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,360
that Tom was gonna get through and Tom just decided

826
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,640
that they were gonna make it up kind of on the spot.

827
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,480
I love that.

828
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,280
You did good, Tom, you did good.

829
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,320
You did prefer for this to pop off around March 2nd,

830
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,000
so we are not accommodating you there on that note,

831
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,640
but still, here we are.

832
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,640
Here's a message for Jonathan Kane.

833
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,840
It's from May, Andrew, Artemis, and Matchy who say,

834
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,440
hey Slippery Boy, thank you so much for existing

835
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,920
and we're so glad we met you.

836
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,400
You and the Kane clan are always in our hearts,

837
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,840
especially Papa Kane.

838
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,620
You're the most special garbage boy

839
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,160
and bigger than life itself.

840
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,620
We love you more than the world.

841
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,280
Keep filling our lives with 69 jokes.

842
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,080
Oh wait, 69 jokes?

843
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,240
Or maybe exactly 69.

844
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,780
You've told us 57 jokes and eight jokes,

845
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,920
we're done with you.

846
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,260
Love the Sin Siblings and the other Ding Dongs

847
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,360
in Underwater Piss Utopia.

848
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,320
So there's a lot of stuff in that one

849
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,640
that I didn't quite understand.

850
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,800
Is this underground wrestling?

851
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,240
Because I've been trying to find a foothold in that world.

852
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,800
I think we might be talking about

853
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,660
some real backyard shit, boys.

854
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,320
Hi, I'm Allie Girtz.

855
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,360
And I'm Julia Prescott

856
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,520
and we're Everything's Coming Up Simpsons.

857
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,320
We are a Simpsons podcast on the Maximum Fun Network

858
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,120
and we've got some exciting news.

859
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,520
Ooh, tell me.

860
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,580
We are going to be doing some live podcast shows

861
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,360
in some of our favorite cities.

862
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,000
We're so excited and we wanna let you guys know

863
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,400
out there in the Max Fun universe

864
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,120
that we are coming to you.

865
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,520
Hell yeah. Hell yeah.

866
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,960
On Saturday, September 15th,

867
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,720
we will be at the North Door in Austin, Texas.

868
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,560
Yee-haw.

869
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,040
On Saturday, December 1st,

870
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,240
we will be at the Alamo Drafthouse,

871
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,280
Sloan's Lake in Denver, Colorado.

872
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,920
There's no basement in the Alamo.

873
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,880
We'll find out.

874
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,440
Friday, December 7th,

875
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,400
we are gonna be at the Vera Project in Seattle, Washington.

876
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,120
Oh God, Nirvana.

877
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,960
Yes. Okay.

878
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,080
And Saturday, December 8th,

879
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,440
we will be at Mississippi Studios in Portland, Oregon.

880
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,600
Hey, Matt Groening lives there.

881
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,240
Yes. Or once lived there.

882
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,900
He still lives there in our hearts.

883
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,500
So make sure that you mark your calendars for those dates

884
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,400
and we will be posting the ticketing links

885
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,600
on our Twitter that is at SimpsonsPod

886
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,080
and we will smell you later.

887
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,520
I have a friend who plays live music in bars

888
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,880
and restaurants as a primary source of income.

889
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,000
He has a great steady gig at a hotel restaurant

890
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,540
except for one tiny problem.

891
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,040
Every time he plays.

892
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,360
Why? Why is this true?

893
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,120
Every time he plays a solo show there,

894
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,920
he is contractually obligated to play Stacy's Mom

895
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,960
by Fountains of Wayne.

896
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,160
Not a joke.

897
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,880
He did not read his contract carefully enough

898
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,120
before signing and now legally,

899
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,040
it's required for him to apply for fictional mom

900
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,680
at least once a week.

901
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,280
Brothers, it's been almost a year of this

902
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,960
and my friend now hates this song more than anything.

903
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,000
Is there anything I can do

904
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,900
to help him get out of this situation?

905
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,040
That's for Sick of Stacy's Mom in Southern Maine,

906
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,800
which actually almost kind of sounds like

907
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,840
Fountains of Wayne. Fountains of Wayne.

908
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,680
Very good.

909
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,040
Let me get something out of the way

910
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,280
before we get into this question.

911
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,880
Fountains of Wayne is a good band,

912
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,960
but I can understand how there are very few songs

913
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,760
that I think you would play them every single time

914
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,860
you played a gig that you would still feel great about.

915
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,440
Now, I bet even Fountains of Wayne,

916
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,240
if they had to do this, would be like,

917
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,080
okay, we feel like we're doing this song.

918
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,480
Hey Travis, do you think maybe in 2003,

919
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,960
you think maybe they might have done that

920
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,200
around that period?

921
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,520
Hey buh buh buh buh boys,

922
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,160
I don't know if Fountains of Wayne is actively touring.

923
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,720
I'm gonna bet Fountains of Wayne

924
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,880
don't get to leave the building

925
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,280
if they don't do Stacy's Mom.

926
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,500
I'm sorry. Yes.

927
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,560
Yeah, they're gonna go ahead

928
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,040
and bang that one out for everybody

929
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,480
every single time they perform.

930
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,160
Of course, they're making like big coin off of that.

931
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,920
Like they, I don't know,

932
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,760
maybe they don't have to do Stacy's Mom every time.

933
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,140
I would think they would probably have a hard time

934
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,080
not doing Stacy's Mom.

935
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,160
Before we talk about anything else,

936
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,640
we need to talk about why this was in a contract,

937
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,360
a legal contract that a lawyer probably helped do.

938
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,200
I have two guesses.

939
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,160
Guess one, that the bar is like called Stacy's.

940
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,400
Okay. Or the owner

941
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,720
or like the bartender's name is Stacy

942
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,040
and it's like a fun thing.

943
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,040
Or two, at their audition for this gig,

944
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,040
this musician friend played Stacy's Mom

945
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,200
and they were like, oh my God,

946
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,880
it's the best, I love that song.

947
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,120
Yes, but you gotta do that every time.

948
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,800
And he was like, okay, you got it.

949
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,920
And then didn't know that it was like,

950
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,560
that was actually in the contract

951
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,300
because that is the song that got them the gig.

952
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,020
Or the bar is owned and operated and themed

953
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,320
after Fountains of Wayne.

954
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,640
That's also- Now we're talking about it.

955
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,880
That's also possible.

956
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,520
Maybe a Fountains of Wayne themed bar.

957
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,880
Soda Fountains of Wayne.

958
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,200
Soda Fountains of Wayne.

959
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,620
There's no alcohol served at this bar.

960
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,280
No, it's a strictly Christian staff.

961
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,120
Straight edge Christian Fountains of Wayne themed bar.

962
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,700
Profoundly unpopular.

963
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,480
Oh, I'm there, I'm there.

964
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,440
And it's just one big,

965
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,960
and it's not a soda fountain in the traditional sense.

966
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,720
It's a literal water feature in the middle of the floor,

967
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,800
but it's sort of a caffeine-free Mountain Dew feature

968
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,000
and all of the teens just come around

969
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,680
and they stick their head over the jets

970
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,240
and get just the blast of that fresh mountain flavor

971
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,640
while they do just dance and just enjoy the night

972
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,260
to the music of Fountains of Wayne.

973
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,360
And it's nice because you can drop your kids off there

974
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,000
and you know it's safe.

975
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,040
Like you know there's no alcohol.

976
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,660
I liked Fountains of Wayne before Stacey's mom happened

977
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,140
and I felt very vindicated.

978
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,440
But then they won Best New Artist Grammy,

979
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,120
which is so baffling to me

980
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,840
because they'd been operating for like a full decade

981
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,920
before that actually happened.

982
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,840
But anyway.

983
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,520
Yeah, Stacey's mom's 15 years old.

984
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,360
That's wild.

985
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,180
That's so wild.

986
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,020
The song is.

987
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,680
The mother in the subject of the song is.

988
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,080
Stacey's mom is in the Guinness Book of Records.

989
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,560
Youngest mom with a teenage kid.

990
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,860
Doesn't make sense her daughter's one year older than her.

991
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,280
Is there some stank you can put on the song Stacey's Mom

992
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,960
to like freshen it up?

993
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,160
Stacey's Mom, A Look Back.

994
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,160
And it's like, you know what, I realize now

995
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,760
that maybe it was just a childhood crush.

996
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:45,280
I think Griffin is more thinking we take it to the islands

997
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,400
with a reggae cover.

998
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,840
No, that was actually wasn't.

999
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,680
That was the opposite of what I was thinking.

1000
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,240
Griffin wants to take it on to the islands.

1001
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,280
No, I think that'd be hugely problematic,

1002
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,520
but I would, you know, like a nice bossa nova might be okay.

1003
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,320
Maybe redo it, but in a minor key.

1004
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,160
Oh, that's fun.

1005
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,360
Stacey's Mom.

1006
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,360
Let me look up the chords.

1007
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:09,720
Or maybe write a song about Stacey's dad.

1008
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,040
Have we talked about this before?

1009
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,960
Stacey's dad is back from work.

1010
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:18,200
He's doing his best with his ship collection.

1011
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,800
Grills a real good steak and can fix the lawnmower.

1012
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,020
I know it is a pretty much equal, just normal,

1013
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,440
but I think Stacey's dad is a good guy.

1014
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,080
He's trying his best.

1015
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,960
He doesn't know how to relate to his teenage daughter,

1016
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,960
but he's doing his best.

1017
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,040
My guitar's open tuned, so I can't play this,

1018
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,440
but it's just E-A-B-A.

1019
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,320
But so it'd be E minor, A minor, B minor, A minor.

1020
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,320
And you could probably do a good-

1021
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,160
Why are you open?

1022
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,880
Why did you open tune?

1023
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,080
You know, I like to get Tinder on it.

1024
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,120
Yeah, I think you're just lazy.

1025
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,720
You want it to sound good when you're not hitting.

1026
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,560
Do you got your guitar?

1027
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,380
Do you got your guitar on you?

1028
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,240
Yeah.

1029
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,340
Give me an E minor.

1030
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,180
Okay.

1031
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,360
Stacey's- Stacey's-

1032
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,400
And then A minor.

1033
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:06,680
A minor?

1034
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,860
Is that A minor?

1035
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:08,700
Yeah.

1036
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,700
Stacey's mom has got it going on.

1037
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,540
B minor.

1038
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:20,620
Stacey, can I come over after school?

1039
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,340
Haunting.

1040
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,160
You're in the major.

1041
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,000
You're in the major.

1042
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
We can hang around by the pool.

1043
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,920
Did your mom get back from her business trip?

1044
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,760
You went back to the major.

1045
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,380
Listen, I know you want to play the major

1046
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,880
because it sounds so good, but it's got to be minor.

1047
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,880
Is she there or is she trying to give me the slip?

1048
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,040
Why, Stacey's mom has been dead for over 50 years.

1049
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,440
Oh, now see the pre- the pre-chorus

1050
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,840
is already slightly minor.

1051
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,680
Let's just jump to the-

1052
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,520
Fuck the pre-chorus.

1053
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,340
Get to the chorus.

1054
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,440
Oh boy, that used to be.

1055
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,440
Stacey's mom has got it going on.

1056
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:23,440
She's all I want and I've waited for so long.

1057
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:29,560
Stacey, can't you see you're just a G7 minor girl for me.

1058
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,320
C sharp minor.

1059
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,880
I know it might be wrong,

1060
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,880
but I'm in love with Stacey's mom.

1061
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,400
No, God bless.

1062
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,240
Mom.

1063
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,760
Yeah, so you do that and it's like

1064
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,960
if your parents have you mow the lawn all the time

1065
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,800
and you mow the lawn super bad once,

1066
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,280
you don't have to mow the lawn anymore.

1067
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,320
Justin, I thought you did a great job

1068
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,400
at doing a bad job at that song.

1069
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,400
The problem is that I was bringing the melody into the mix

1070
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,240
because I don't know, I can't transpose that

1071
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,600
in my head on the fly.

1072
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,280
So I was trying to eyeball what that melody

1073
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,120
would look like in a minor key.

1074
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,040
No, I know it's a fun song.

1075
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,880
I don't blame you.

1076
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,960
It's a fun song and what you did to it is a perversion.

1077
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,720
And so that was your body reflexively

1078
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,920
trying to sing the fun song.

1079
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,400
That was like sneezing.

1080
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,000
It was like sneezing, Justin.

1081
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
It was just like sneezing.

1082
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,440
Folks, thanks so much for listening.

1083
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,240
We hope you have enjoyed yourself

1084
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,800
aside from the music part there.

1085
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,920
Sorry about that.

1086
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,920
It was good.

1087
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,400
It was good, you did a good, bad job.

1088
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,960
You know, I did my best.

1089
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,480
We've got some, if you wanna come see us,

1090
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,520

That is also macroshows.com slash tours.

that's on September 1st, but that may also be sold out.

1104
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,400
I'm not exactly clear.

1105
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,520
But no, there's a few seats for that if you wanna come.

1106
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,080
So please come see us at Atlanta.

1107
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,160
That's gonna be fun.

1108
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,000
It's gonna be a really fun one.

1109
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,920
I also think maybe we might,

1110
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,240
I would like, I think I might be doing some stuff

1111
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,560
at DragonCon that same weekend.

1112
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,720
I'll let you know.

1113
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,400
But if you are gonna come to those shows,

1114
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,360

1116
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,120
Make sure to put that in the subject line.

1117
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:53,480
Also, PodCon, the fundraiser IndieGoGo for PodCon 2

1118
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,600
is going on right now.

1119
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,000
Help us fund it so we can have an even better second PodCon,

1120
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,680
one of my favorite conventions I've ever done.

1121
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,040
And Justin and I helped found,

1122
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,040
you can go to bit.ly slash McElroyPodCon 2

1123
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,080

Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1129
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,000
for these for a theme song.

1130
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,200
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1131
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,600
It's a very, very good album.

1132
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:34,240
And we're so fortunate that we get to use that song

1133
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,640
as our theme and have for many years now.

1134
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,680

It was sent in by a Level 9000 Yadru Druid,

1150
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,480
Drew Davenport.

1151
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,320
Thank you, Drew.

1152
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,200
It's Yadru Answers user.

1153
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,120
Matt 85.

1154
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,800
Matt 85 asks,

1155
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,280
have you ever bought a burger from a burger van?

1156
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:36,280
My name is Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy. This has been my brother, my brother and me. Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

1157
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:44,280
Hey, girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna?

1158
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:10,280
Debunking.

1159
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,280
Rebunking.

1160
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:16,280
Regular sized bunking.

1161
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,280
Boaty McBoatface.

1162
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,280
Do any of these words make sense to you?

1163
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,280
Then maybe Trends Like These is the podcast you should be listening to.

1164
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,280
We put out an episode every week on maximumfun.org.

00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,280
Ah? Ah?

1172
00:53:42,280 --> 00:54:05,280
Yeah, that was great.
