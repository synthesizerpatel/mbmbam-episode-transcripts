1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,600
Hello and welcome to my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,760
Batten down the hatches, it's Great Iron Day, and I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy,

7
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,040
your middle-est brother. I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Get your belt,

8
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,280
attach your belt to you and Helen Hunt, and then wrap it around that pipe,

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,760
and you're not going anywhere when the football NATO comes. Football storms are coming,

10
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,400
hailstorm touchdowns, hailstorms the size of footballs. My knee's been aching all day.

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,120
You know what that means? That usually means it's gonna be just a touchdown NATO. Oh shit,

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:25,200
Peyton coming. Guys, are you fucking ready? Are you fucking ready? Have you prepared yourself?

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,280
Have you made yourself ready, you and your home and your families? Are you armed? Well,

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,600
better question, have you prepared your soul? For the football resurrection. Yeah, what's gonna

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,840
happen to you after the football comes? I've got some literature here I'd really like you guys to

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,240
read. Have you prepared your soul for when Peyton Manning comes for you? He could come at any time.

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,680
As he does for all of us. That's what's so scary. I can't go in Papa John's anymore because Peyton

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,240
Manning is in all Papa John's simultaneously. I don't know if you guys know this, but Papa John

19
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:05,120
created a demonic portal that he ensnared Peyton Manning in. He lets him out every football game

20
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,440
day. Otherwise, he is simultaneously in every Papa John's at once. Have you ever seen Multiplicity?

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,520
It's like that. It's a lot like that. Next time you're in Papa John's, do me a favor, look in a

22
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:22,640
mirror, think about Gatorade. Oops, who's there? Peyton Manning's behind you. I think that the end

23
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,480
will basically be Peyton Manning gathering up all the world's bad people in Las Vegas

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:40,720
and Eli Manning gathering all the good people. Now who's he? Sorry, Eli? Yeah. He's his brother.

25
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,840
He's the malformed clone of Peyton Manning. Oh, I see. So to continue the Multiplicity riff,

26
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,240
it would be like if Michael Keaton, if one of his clones was just a torso without a head.

27
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,000
When Peyton Manning was born, William Refrigerator Perry took one of his ribs

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,240
and from that rib, he formed Eli. He put a salty rub on it, he marinated it in some sauce,

29
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:13,120
and then he was ready for the big game. He was. He needed a few dips and he was ready. Football

30
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:21,040
is coming and I don't think you can ever be too ready for football. This may be our last

31
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,040
transmission. We may get swept away by a gridiron fever tonight, which is a literal disease.

32
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,920
Let me actually- It strikes the young, the elderly,

33
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:39,680
the middle-aged people who are in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, just everybody.

34
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,440
Cheese. All the decades.

35
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,280
Cheese heads. It gets cheese heads real hard. It gets parrot heads.

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,360
Parrot heads. You guys got a favorite? Who are you pulling for?

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,760
I'm rooting for Nate Irving. Oh, me too. I was going to say the exact same thing.

38
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:05,520
Nate Irving. In my favorite quote of the week, Nate Irving was asked how he was going to unwind

39
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,880
before the big game and he said, I'm going to sit up in my hotel room and play my Pokemon game.

40
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,040
I love you, Nate Irving. You're the best football player.

41
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,520
According to the Wall Street Journal, he promises he won't spend all his time playing Pokemon. He

42
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,160
might occasionally mix things up by watching HGTV. Did you guys know that I'm a professional

43
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,320
fucking football player and my name is Nate Irving? Did you guys know that about me?

44
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,680
I'm basically the best football player.

45
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,240
I'm super good. I set a career record with 41 tackles this season. I'm super,

46
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,760
super good and I didn't know it. Yeah, that's all you need.

47
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,440
We are on a boat and our destination is self-discovery island.

48
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,920
Well, can you imagine Nate Irving, the Braggers win the Super Bowl and it's like,

49
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,600
Nate Irving, are you excited? He's like, I am excited. I won the Super Bowl

50
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,360
and I also beat the trainer I've been trying to beat for like the last two weeks.

51
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,480
I don't think he has any trouble beating any kind of trainers. I'm just saying,

52
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,480
I think he's probably- Oh wait, so you just assume

53
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,080
because he's an excellent football man that he's also really good at the Pokemon.

54
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,560
That's what he's terrible at Pokemon and it's just, football is not a challenge for him anymore.

55
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,640
He just can't wrap his mind around like the different type sets,

56
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,560
the different elemental strengths and weaknesses. I can't remember what psychic is strong again.

57
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,840
What is psychic strong again? What beats bugs? Ah, damn it.

58
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,240
My girlfriend spends the night at my place more often than not while I tolerate her hair dryer,

59
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,000
hair straightener, and assorted other energy guzzling beauty accoutrement.

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,160
I can't stand when she makes changes to the thermostat in the morning after I've left and

61
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,240
heats the condo up to tropical temperatures while nobody is home to enjoy it. I've tried asking

62
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,880
politely, but my electric bill has gone up more than 300% from December to January.

63
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,440
What is a conservation minded boyfriend to do? And that's from Chile in Chicago.

64
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,000
You could do what my landlord does and put a lock box around the thermostat.

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,440
That should be good for the relationship.

66
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,520
Hey honey, you can't be trusted. Bye, I'll see you at work.

67
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,320
I put- Love you.

68
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,480
Also, I put all your hair dryers and stuff in a separate lock box, and only I know the password.

69
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,400
I'm going to dip back into the Bim Bam Classics folder and dig out this one because I think it's

70
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,280
appropriate. Go to the thermostat and just put a little jelly on it. Ugh. I went to change the

71
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,640
thermostat and my hand got all this jelly everywhere. I hate this.

72
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,160
Right, but- Maybe the problem is what kind of jelly?

73
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,560
Right, and this person- Just before we move on.

74
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,320
This person is leading a conservation based lifestyle, and that's admirable. You can have

75
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,440
the patience and the willingness to sacrifice all of the good things in the world to live like that.

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,760
Good kudos. This person does not want to waste jelly like that. That is jelly that could be

77
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,080
eaten by a person who really needs some jelly to eat, and you're wasting it. You're using it

78
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,560
as a punitive measure, and that does not seem like something a conservationist would be into.

79
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Let me throw this out. Maybe the problem is you can't take something away without presenting

80
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,400
another option, so if you say you can't raise the thermostat, maybe you also give her a barrel that

81
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,360
she can burn some newspaper and scrap wood in. Oh, so like a one in, one out,

82
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,840
fuck the earth sort of policy. Yeah.

83
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,960
Okay. A literal scorched earth policy, because if you do that too much, this rock will be

84
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,800
uninhabitable. Yes, but it's not like it's going to pollute the outside. It's inside his apartment.

85
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,640
As long as he never opens a door or window and releases the toxic fumes he's built up in there.

86
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,880
Yes. How do you get anybody to do anything?

87
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,240
Guilt. Buy an animal that's susceptible to heat. And let it die?

88
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,440
And let it die at once. Build a snowman in your living room.

89
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,480
What? Put a snowman in your living room and make her love it.

90
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,640
Yeah, put a snowman in the living room and tell her that via a magical instrument,

91
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,840
it has become possessed with the spirit of your dead relative, and then when she turns the

92
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,680
thermostat out of her mouth, just start screaming. No, she won't. She won't care about that. Just

93
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,600
make it look like Benedict Cumberbatch. She'll- Is that what- Hold the fucking phone. Is that what,

94
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,600
like, is that what ladies are into right now? That's what ladies are into right now.

95
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,440
That's, I don't know. That's what they're into. His, I mean, I get, like, he's a tremendous actor,

96
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,400
and of course, like, who doesn't love Benedict Cumberbatch? But I never thought about him on,

97
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,440
like, an erotic level. He's got so many ridges. He's got a lot of ridges on that dome.

98
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,000
I think right now, if ladies could just watch Benedict Cumberbatch

99
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,880
and Tom Hiddleston just, like, rub their faces together.

100
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,040
That's all they want. They just want that.

101
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,080
He has a lot of ridges, too. That's a lot. It's like two, like,

102
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,160
ski slalom courses, just, like, rubbing, rubbing, making friction.

103
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
And that's, and that's the new thing.

104
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,760
Ridges.

105
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,800
Ski slaloms.

106
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,880
I gots to get some fucking dome ridges.

107
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,800
But apparently dome ridges are where it's at. I'm as surprised as anybody, honestly.

108
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,920
So I guess those are some pretty good suggestions.

109
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,240
Can't wait. Can you ask her to pay for the extra 200%?

110
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,200
Oh my god. Split the utility bill with her.

111
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,080
Yeah. Or-

112
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,120
Then she can do what she wants.

113
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,440
Just ask her to be more fucking considerate.

114
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,960
Please. Just be considerate of my feelings.

115
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,680
Buy her a giant sweatshirt that she can wrap herself in.

116
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,040
Hold on. Wait a minute. Are you dating a salamander?

117
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,440
Because if you're dating a salamander,

118
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,720
then you need to be conscious of her lifestyle needs.

119
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,600
And maybe you eat the extra-

120
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,720
I mean, guys, I lived in Chicago. Energy ain't cheap.

121
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,640
Energy-

122
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,840
And it gets cold up there.

123
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,480
It gets cold up there. And there's only so much gas.

124
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,120
And if energy raiders come by your street, you have to fight them off.

125
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,920
But if this woman needs heat, or else her salamander skin will turn to dust, and she dies.

126
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,800
It's just how salamanders work.

127
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,560
Here's a Yahoo. I'm just going to stop asking if you guys want it,

128
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,840
because the answer is never no.

129
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,200
That's true.

130
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,640
This one was sent in by Carolyn Flynn, or Caroline Flynn. Thank you, Caroline. Or Carolyn.

131
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,160
It's by Yahoo answer user Megan, who asks, what should I wear to a club?

132
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,020
Hey.

133
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,380
Hey.

134
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,660
Hey.

135
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,480
I'm not going to ask you that.

136
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,480
I'm 19, and I'm going to a club that's for 16 to 20-year-olds.

137
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,520
Kind of a crazy club.

138
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,600
And I'm not sure what to wear.

139
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,960
I don't want to look like a slut, but I want to look a little sexy.

140
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,400
There's a couple things I will not wear.

141
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,200
I absolutely despise skinny jeans, so I refuse to wear those.

142
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,560
And as far as shoes, I don't want to wear heels, because they hurt my knees.

143
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,160
And I can't wear flats, because I have to find ones that fit.

144
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,400
Other than those few things, I'm pretty much open to anything.

145
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm 5'5", 115 pounds. So I'm pretty skinny.

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,720
I have a butt and boobs, but neither are huge.

147
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,680
Did you need to point out that you have a butt and boobs?

148
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,520
I have a butt. My legs do not just connect to my waist.

149
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,760
I'm an amorphous blob who poops through her belly button.

150
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,800
That's my line.

151
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,280
So there's that.

152
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,520
That's why I hate skinny jeans so much. I don't have legs.

153
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,400
I hate skinny jeans.

154
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,840
Oh, and one more thing.

155
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,880
I'm a living blob.

156
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,040
So there's not really anything I can't wear.

157
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,240
I'm getting pretty full of yourself.

158
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,120
So if you guys could maybe put links in with your answers,

159
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,280
so I can get a better idea of what you're thinking, that would be great.

160
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,780
Thanks.

161
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,080
A teen club?

162
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,160
Those exist, dude.

163
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,120
I guess Huntington had...

164
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,920
We had the gym factory, which was a trampoline emporium.

165
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,040
But in the back room...

166
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,760
By day.

167
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,280
Trampoline emporium by day.

168
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,520
By night, a teen hotspot.

169
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,800
Which is where fucking eighth graders learn to bump and grind.

170
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,000
Which, how do you-

171
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,400
Here in Flannaddy, we have a place called Blast.

172
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,560
Oh, no.

173
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,000
It's a teen club.

174
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,760
It's the same principle?

175
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,960
Yeah, except it's a full-on nightclub in Newport on the Levee.

176
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,000
And I think it's open Fridays and Saturdays.

177
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,200
And then they card people to get in, and then they serve Red Bull and Gatorade.

178
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,520
And just a fucking cave.

179
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,640
When they ID them, if they're older than like 20, they don't let them in?

180
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,400
Don't let them in.

181
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,520
But when you look at the place, what's crazy, if I may, for a moment.

182
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,040
What's crazy about it is it looks like someone said,

183
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,960
hey parents, don't worry, it's going to be totally safe.

184
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,080
We're going to keep an eye on it.

185
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,720
Kids, don't worry.

186
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,880
We've really set this up so you guys can fucking do-

187
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,280
No, I remember our teen club, the gym factory,

188
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,560
was the fucking grossest place I've ever been.

189
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,640
Like, I'm 26 now.

190
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,520
I have not been to a place that allowed drinking

191
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,680
that was like 10% as gross as the gym factory was,

192
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,440
because it was just like a bunch of eighth-year-olds,

193
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,680
eighth-year-olds, just a bunch of eighth graders

194
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,560
just fucking gyrating and just like pupating

195
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,120
and emerging from their sexual chrysalis

196
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,960
to become like a bunch of fuck moths

197
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
attracted to some genital flames.

198
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,240
Are you talking about the same gym factory

199
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,720
where there's like rope swings and there were phone pits?

200
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,280
No kidding.

201
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,760
I think I had like my fifth-grade birthday party there.

202
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,240
Three years later, I was like fucking

203
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,720
jizzing inside my jinko jeans.

204
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,120
I'm thinking about it now.

205
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,560
That place is crazy.

206
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,800
That's crazy.

207
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,760
The fact that teen clubs exist is crazy enough,

208
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,840
but also there's like the world's biggest jungle gym

209
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,880
and around the corner is like a fucking-

210
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,600
Dry humping.

211
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,640
Is dry humping the teen red light district.

212
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,680
Anyway, what's this young woman going to wear?

213
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,000
A chastity belt.

214
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,080
I would wear a-

215
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,680
From extremerestraints.com.

216
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,320
I would wear a chain that you can attach to your leg

217
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,560
that keeps you from going to this place.

218
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,720
Yeah, it's treacherous.

219
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,800
How about just some kind of like harness

220
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,760
so that if you get in too deep, you can tug the rope

221
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,280
and your parents can pull you out

222
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,200
so that you don't get trapped there.

223
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,800
You want your parents watching you.

224
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,160
You want your parents to be your spotters in this event.

225
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
Yeah, they're at a safe distance.

226
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,880
I want it tied to the back of the caravan

227
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,440
so you tug the rope and they just floor it

228
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,360
and you go flying out the front door.

229
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,400
Oh, shit's going down.

230
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,600
Get me out of here, moms.

231
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Hey, do you want to ride on yourself?

232
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,760
You want to ride on yourself with this neon highlighter?

233
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,440
It's just stuff to do because we can't drink.

234
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,240
Uh, yeah, hold on.

235
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,200
Let me just pull on this rope three times and bye.

236
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,340
Bye.

237
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,540
Maybe a-

238
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,920
How about a nice blouse?

239
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,800
Maybe a pantsuit.

240
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,920
Pantsuit, yeah.

241
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,600
I like that.

242
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,240
The kids, you know what the kids like nowadays?

243
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,840
They like writing on themselves

244
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,800
just because they can't drink

245
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,920
and they just need something to do.

246
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,560
And they're really into Margaret Thatcher.

247
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,200
Just like her style.

248
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,640
You know what I want to come back?

249
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,680
Shoulder pads.

250
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,480
Oh, yeah.

251
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,160
God, man, if-

252
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,480
I can't believe as ironic as everyone and everything is

253
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,320
all the time forever now

254
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,800
that those haven't really reared their ugly flat heads.

255
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,280
That's got to be hard for like their creator,

256
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,560
Paul shoulder pads.

257
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,320
Yeah, wait, look at these.

258
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,680
Come on, man.

259
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,240
These are bulky.

260
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,360
Hey, guys, look at me.

261
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,720
And then like a guy that's like wearing a suit

262
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,040
that he bought from the set of Hanging with Mr. Cooper is like,

263
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,080
dude, I don't know.

264
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,160
That is a little too much for me.

265
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,880
Shoulder pads?

266
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,680
A little much.

267
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,320
I don't know.

268
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,520
Let me clean off the fake lenses in my glasses.

269
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,360
Let me clean those out real quick.

270
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,080
Sorry.

271
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,760
I want to look like David Byrne,

272
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,760
but you look a little too much like David Byrne.

273
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,400
Does that make sense?

274
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,520
Yeah.

275
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,360
I want like 75% Byrne.

276
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,120
If you go too much over that,

277
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,480
then you just look silly.

278
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,080
You know, I'm going to go on a limb

279
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,320
and I'm going to say the next big thing is blazers

280
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,880
that are nautical themed with shoulder pads.

281
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,800
So like the buttons have the anchors on them.

282
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,280
Yeah, sure.

283
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,160
Maybe there's like a blue and white stripe thing going on,

284
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,560
but it's definitely has a nautical flare

285
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,920
and shoulder pad.

286
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,480
Oh my God.

287
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,640
I'd give up everything to follow that style.

288
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,120
Maybe you got some sardines, some sardines in the pocket.

289
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah.

290
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:06,880
Sailors.

291
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,120
Oh yeah.

292
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,800
It's a full sensory experience.

293
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,600
Sight, smell, sound, you know, you open up the coat

294
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,520
and the speakers play the sound of the ocean.

295
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,560
It's so important.

296
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,840
If you're going to a teen club,

297
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,040
you have to put together a full sensory experience.

298
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,640
You know why?

299
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,880
It's A, it's because it says something about you.

300
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,920
I'm in the boats.

301
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,720
Hey, what's up?

302
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,400
I'm a child of the ocean.

303
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,840
That's sort of my style.

304
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,520
But more importantly than that,

305
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,640
you want to be able to transport yourself to anywhere

306
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,120
but the place you are, which is a teen club.

307
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,840
Can you guys explain the science to me?

308
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,120
Is it just, is it?

309
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,640
It doesn't make any sense to me that a club where you can drink

310
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,280
and get fucked up and like hang out with adults,

311
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,360
all of whom are of consenting ages,

312
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,040
is less gross than a place where you cannot drink

313
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,400
and everyone's in high school.

314
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,480
Because the one thing the teen club lacks is excuses.

315
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,960
Everything that's happening there

316
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,520
is completely generated by hormones.

317
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,080
It's Sodom and Gomorrah is what it is.

318
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,400
Right, exactly.

319
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
It's just a pavilion of carnality.

320
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,040
Don't look back.

321
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,360
And you can't blame any of it on alcohol.

322
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,640
Don't look back at the gym factory.

323
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:14,960
Just go.

324
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,000
Just go.

325
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,880
Oh, your salt.

326
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,080
Now your pill of salt.

327
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,640
You fucked up.

328
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,480
Well, here's the problem, Griffin.

329
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,720
At an adult club with adult people,

330
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,520
they also have adult reasoning and stuff like,

331
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,600
I just can't go up and grind on this person.

332
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,560
I work with them.

333
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,160
No, I think you're right about the hormones.

334
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,800
I think that's it.

335
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,200
That is a fucking cocktail, man.

336
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,760
Eighth grade?

337
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,120
Fucking forget about it.

338
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,200
I'm usually, I guess, like 98% water and 2% meat.

339
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,680
And then back there, I was just like from the waist down.

340
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,880
100% bone.

341
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,440
Just like bone zone all the way.

342
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,120
When I was in eighth grade, I was in a computer class.

343
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,480
And our teacher, he was an overweight man,

344
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,560
angry at the world, seemed to hate pretty much everything.

345
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,040
Now hold on.

346
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,280
This was a computer class teacher?

347
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,760
Now wait.

348
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,280
That doesn't sound right.

349
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,880
He seemed to hate everything.

350
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,400
Every single thing about his life seemed to make him miserable.

351
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,000
And the very first thing he said to us on the first day

352
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,560
of this eighth grade computer class was,

353
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,680
I wouldn't trade places with any of you for love or money.

354
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,720
That's how this guy's game was so whack in his entire life.

355
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,120
His entire life circle was off kilter.

356
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,400
And yet, he would not trade places

357
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,880
with a young, vibrant eighth grader.

358
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,200
Vibrant my balls.

359
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,720
That is, I wasn't, nobody's vibrant when they're in eighth grade.

360
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,920
They're just like exuding weird, like chemicals and shit.

361
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,320
They're just like, they have a sheen of slime.

362
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,720
They're just a bunch of like jizz slugs.

363
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,160
I fucking, oh.

364
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,320
They have a slime of sheen actually too.

365
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,920
Man, we went through some shit

366
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,560
and we came out on the other side so much stronger.

367
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,720
I recently got out of a four-year relationship.

368
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,680
By both of our accounts, we were very happy together.

369
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,720
But my ex was never ready to commit to marriage.

370
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,160
And I got tired of waiting.

371
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,040
I'm 33 and he's 38, BT dubs.

372
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,360
And this is LA, if that makes a difference.

373
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:19,840
Of course.

374
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,400
We love it.

375
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,360
I've started seeing other people.

376
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,640
My question is this.

377
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,240
How can I avoid getting involved with another commitment-phobe?

378
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm definitely not desperate to get married,

379
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,480
but I am ready to find a life partner.

380
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,840
At what point in a new relationship should I bring this up?

381
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,720
After a few dates, a few weeks, months?

382
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,240
I basically want to say,

383
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,480
I only date guys who are interested in marriage.

384
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:42,960
Don't do that.

385
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,720
I don't want to come across as crazy, pathetic, or desperate.

386
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,600
What's your advice?

387
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,240
Thanks a lot.

388
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,560
All right.

389
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,920
Don't like, the labels of crazy, pathetic, or desperate

390
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,920
have nothing to do with it.

391
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,680
It's just like, it's almost like rude in a way.

392
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,480
It's just like a weird thing to float by somebody.

393
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,080
Put it on a completely different,

394
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,000
like put it in a different framework and say,

395
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,640
it's like walking into a job interview and say,

396
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,440
hi, I'm such and such.

397
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,440
I'm here to interview.

398
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,840
And I want you to know, I'll only take this job

399
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,160
if eventually I get to be CEO.

400
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,400
I've got my eye on a management position.

401
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,040
Yeah.

402
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,240
And I won't accept the job if you can't guarantee

403
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,600
that that's going to happen.

404
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,080
It's like, oh, we just met.

405
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,920
Like, I don't know.

406
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,760
I think by its very nature, commitment

407
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,360
in the context of a relationship has to be 100% holistic.

408
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,320
It cannot be forced or artificial in any way.

409
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,360
Because this person that you dated

410
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,000
and you guys had a good relationship

411
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,520
and you were very happy together,

412
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
but if you guys were that happy

413
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
and you spent that much time together

414
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,680
and he still didn't want to commit,

415
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,040
that has always to me seemed like evidence

416
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,360
of other shit going on.

417
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah.

418
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,280
What I've found is that if people aren't ready,

419
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,280
like if people are afraid of commitment,

420
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,760
even if they have rules for themselves,

421
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm not looking for something serious.

422
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,320
I'm not looking for a lifelong thing.

423
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,800
If it's right and it's the right relationship,

424
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,720
it's the right pairing, then that kind of commitment,

425
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,800
even if it's not, you know, marriage will follow.

426
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,640
I mean, that you will want to

427
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,280
just because you'll be into something so great

428
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,720
that you don't want to get out of it.

429
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,120
Maybe that's an overly romantic way of looking at things,

430
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,200
but that's seemed to be my experience.

431
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,920
No, I agree.

432
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,080
And I think the problem is that asking early on like,

433
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,400
hey, I just want to know that you're the type of person

434
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,920
that I feel like it's cheating

435
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,840
because I feel like it's like, you got to get to know.

436
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,640
And that's why starting a new relationship is always scary

437
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,880
because there are so many unanswered questions

438
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,560
that you learn over time

439
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,960
and wanting to get all those questions out of the way early

440
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,880
so you don't have to worry about it.

441
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,680
I think it takes a lot away from the discovery

442
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,280
and the newness of it all and getting to know the person.

443
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,480
So my honest answer is I don't think you can.

444
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
I think you just have to get to know them

445
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,800
and come to that conversation naturally

446
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,560
because I think if you try to force it

447
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,480
and it sounds like you're eager to have that conversation,

448
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,440
so chances are it's not going to come about naturally

449
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,920
of its own accord and so it will probably not be

450
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,880
at the right time.

451
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,360
And Laurie, you may find that you,

452
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,280
if you force that question too early,

453
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,040
you may find yourself in a relationship

454
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,480
that you don't want to commit to but are enjoying

455
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,160
and the other person's ready to like bat down the hatches

456
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,120
and get hit.

457
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,920
Which is so much shittier than the alternative.

458
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,040
It's way worse.

459
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,640
It's a lot, it's a lot worse.

460
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,000
To your credit, it's really, really good

461
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,600
that you look back on that older,

462
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
the last relationship that you were in

463
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,000
and you're still happy about it

464
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,240
because you recognize that you like had a good time

465
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,480
and you grew from it even though it didn't result

466
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
in like a lifelong thing.

467
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,360
Because if you don't look at your stuff like that,

468
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,640
that will drive you crazy.

469
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,800
Like, oh, four years, just gone.

470
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,920
Yeah, and you don't want to,

471
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,720
you don't want to be in a relationship

472
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,000
for four years again like that.

473
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,840
If somebody doesn't want to commit to you,

474
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,880
Laurie, you're the best.

475
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,720
If they're not going to commit to you,

476
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,440
then you've had plenty of time for the relationship

477
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,760
to evolve to a point where that would make sense.

478
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,400
You need to cut your ties, cut your losses.

479
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,560
You're a great, great lady.

480
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,200
Especially if you find that out early on,

481
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,920
if you're like,

482
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,080
hey, I'm the type of person that wants to get married

483
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,520
and they're like, oh, I'm not.

484
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,880
That idea of like, I'm going to change them

485
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,320
or I'm going to be the one,

486
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,680
it's going to be different with me.

487
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,680
It's like, well, if there was a possibility of that,

488
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,040
they wouldn't have said anything.

489
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,240
You know what I mean?

490
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,720
It's such a, it's such a cutoff to be like,

491
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,280
oh yeah, I'm not interested in getting married.

492
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,640
Like, okay, that's not going to change

493
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,160
with that person in this relationship

494
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,400
because the best you can hope for is you wear them down

495
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,560
and four years later they're like, okay, I guess so.

496
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,800
I also think that you are going to,

497
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,200
by setting up a question of marriage too early,

498
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,040
I think you can put it into a weird light, right?

499
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,920
Where they start weighing the pros and cons

500
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,800
of you as like a holistic person

501
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
rather than just someone they see movies

502
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,120
and eat dinner with sometimes, right?

503
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,240
I mean, if you're, if you're,

504
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,160
if the marriage question is on the table

505
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,360
at the very beginning,

506
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,640
then you lose a lot of the easier stuff to sort of,

507
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,240
to deal with.

508
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,480
You're raising the stakes very high.

509
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,720
They should be so fun in the beginning.

510
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,680
They should just be like,

511
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,440
I'm going to hang out with this cool person

512
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,600
that I like and I'm attracted to.

513
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,480
And it doesn't have to be anything more than that.

514
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,560
And then when it is something more than that,

515
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,640
it's so exciting and so great,

516
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,480
especially when it's mutual and it evolves from there.

517
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,000
If you introduce this question,

518
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,200
you lose out on that like,

519
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,960
that almost Shark Tank-esque,

520
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,040
I could walk, whatever.

521
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,920
You know what I mean?

522
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,160
That's, that is the, that's the true joy.

523
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,600
I forget, I do forget what dating is like though.

524
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,000
And I would wager that my two brothers

525
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,520
are also in the same camp.

526
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,240
I don't remember. No, I'm still dating a woman

527
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,840
and her name is my wife.

528
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,800
Oh, that's beautiful.

529
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,120
I can't remember her real name.

530
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,560
I think it's my wife.

531
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,160
I'm not certain.

532
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,560
Hey guys, hey guys, hey guys, hey guys, hey guys, hey guys.

533
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,040
Hey guys.

534
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,520
You guys remember Borat?

535
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,600
I'm sorry, one more time.

536
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,320
Let me hear it again.

537
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,280
It's awesome if I was melting.

538
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,200
Wizard sleeves.

539
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,880
Getting sucked into a black hole.

540
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,680
Come back, Austin.

541
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,560
Come back to us.

542
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,760
You guys, it's funny.

543
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,960
The longer we do this show,

544
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,960
I feel like we don't,

545
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
I don't get better at giving advice,

546
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,840
but I get better at knowing when people are going to tell us

547
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,360
we gave bad advice.

548
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,560
I don't think that was bad advice.

549
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,840
I don't know.

550
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,760
It just seems like people are going to disagree with us.

551
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,360
These things are so complicated.

552
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,400
I know, I know, but it just seems like objectively,

553
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,040
like I see like when I'm at the H-E-B,

554
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,440
buying some chips and guac, which I do daily

555
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,840
because I have to eat an entire tub of guacamole every day

556
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,560
to stay alive.

557
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,840
I see a Cosmo at the fucking register.

558
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,520
It's like how to get your man to commit.

559
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,440
And it's like if you have to fucking like,

560
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,160
if you have to trap somebody or trick somebody,

561
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,360
it just doesn't seem as good as like just finding the right person

562
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,480
and then both of you just very naturally slide into this state.

563
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,400
Like, oh shit, it's you.

564
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,000
Like, hey, it's you.

565
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,640
You're the one.

566
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:36,960
Yeah.

567
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,680
That's awesome.

568
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:38,960
I don't know.

569
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,440
I'm not saying it doesn't happen the other way

570
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,400
because I'm sure it does.

571
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,560
Like I'm sure it happens all the goddamn time.

572
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,080
I'm just saying like it doesn't seem like that should be

573
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,800
the default thing that you aim for.

574
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,440
You know what I mean?

575
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,360
You know what I mean?

576
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,000
Kind of put in the cart before the horse, I think a little bit.

577
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
How about a Yahoo?

578
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,560
Yeah, please.

579
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,800
Uh, this Yahoo, uh, as soon as my mouse starts working,

580
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,960
this Yahoo was sent in by Ron Conley.

581
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,920
Thanks, Ron.

582
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

583
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,640
Strong name, huh?

584
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,320
Can we just call him Ronley?

585
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,000
Uh, Ronley, thank you for sending this in.

586
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

587
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,400
Ah, fuck.

588
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,920
2.7182818, it's a bunch of numbers.

589
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,640
I think it's pi.

590
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,080
That's pi, right?

591
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,560
No.

592
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,360
Uh, thank you, Ron, for sending this in and thank you 2.7, whatever, for asking it.

593
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,160
He asks, God gave Adam nipples, intending him to be the female,

594
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,480
then changed his mind, but left the nipples on?

595
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,920
I don't understand the question.

596
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,640
God gave Adam nipples, intending him to be the female,

597
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,280
then changed his mind, but left the nipples on?

598
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,480
Many atheists used to have-

599
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,400
No, just repeating it doesn't help.

600
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,720
Uh, many atheists used to have fun asking why God gave Adam nipples

601
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,240
so he can help with breastfeeding?

602
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,440
I believe I have finally thought of the answer.

603
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,840
God originally intended Adam to be the female, then quickly changed his mind,

604
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,080
making Eve the female, but God decided to leave the nipples on Adam,

605
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,800
especially since Adam had already named them.

606
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,880
Does this sound about right?

607
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,720
This one's Steve and this one's Jerry.

608
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,760
Uh, replies from religion scholars and others appreciated.

609
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,360
I can't, okay.

610
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,480
So, in this person's mind, God made Adam, said, that's a lady, and then he said,

611
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,000
uh, I feel like the breasts should, like, do more.

612
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,920
So, in fact, God may be infallible, but everybody gets one.

613
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,420
Yeah.

614
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,880
And his was just right at the very beginning.

615
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,520
Right at the top.

616
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,560
Well, I mean, he made the sun.

617
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,600
It's not like he made the sun.

618
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,000
He was like, hmm, maybe-

619
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,360
He put nipples on that, too.

620
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,320
God, he put nipples and said, this is a female.

621
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,360
No, this is a sun.

622
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,160
How could he say-

623
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,680
This is a female.

624
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,040
No, that's the light.

625
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,800
No, no, that's the light and the death.

626
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,720
Remember, children, don't look directly at the sun because you'll see it's nipples,

627
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,080
and that's just sort of rude.

628
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,880
Don't stare at that.

629
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,560
It's not its fault.

630
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,000
I prefer to think of it that God, like, was making Adam, was making a woman,

631
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and at the last second went, no way to dude.

632
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,800
Oh, shit.

633
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,160
I'm like, just-

634
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,720
Hold up.

635
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,920
I can't, okay.

636
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,800
Okay, so God can make people, but he can't banish nipples off of them?

637
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,880
Listen, can God create a nipple so big even if he can't break it?

638
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,160
Are you saying that Adam had, like, one huge nipple?

639
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,240
He had to drag it-

640
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,400
Why did you do this to me, God?

641
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,920
Why do you punish me so?

642
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,480
Like a wedding dress, like, trail or something?

643
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,120
First off, we could just go point by point on this question.

644
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,640
First off, how bored are these atheists?

645
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,760
This is what they're doing for fun?

646
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,200
No, I mean, that's a thing, right?

647
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,520
Like, if God exists, why do dudes have nipples?

648
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,880
If God exists, why do dudes have nipples?

649
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,080
I mean, we're all stymied by that question, aren't we?

650
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,640
I mean, but-

651
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,400
Because God's a dirty bird.

652
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,280
I mean, they're-

653
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,640
You know why I think you made them?

654
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,400
Are you ready for this?

655
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,080
I'll crack this shit wide open.

656
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,920
National Treasure, Jesus edition.

657
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,960
It's because our chest would look super crazy if we didn't have them on there.

658
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,680
Think about that.

659
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,880
Think about aesthetically, it's like,

660
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,640
if dudes, it was just like, top to bottom, all right?

661
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,600
Hair, cool.

662
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,280
Eyes, it can be different colors.

663
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,560
Sometimes they're really pretty.

664
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,440
A nose, yeah, you need that for smelling.

665
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,240
A mouth, sure, you need somewhere for the sounds to come out.

666
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,640
And then like, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, dick.

667
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,680
Right?

668
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,360
Like, if we're still looking at the center pillar,

669
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,280
if we're looking at the chakras, hair, eyes, nose, mouth.

670
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,120
Yep, check, love all those.

671
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,040
Lots of variation, lots of differences.

672
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,880
And then nothing.

673
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,360
It is, that's a great point.

674
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,760
Fucking 20 miles of flesh, and then stuff starts happening again.

675
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,720
If God built us-

676
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,080
It's like the movie AI.

677
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,960
It's like a really strong beginning, and the ending is super exciting.

678
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,240
And then like, what happened in the middle?

679
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,400
Like, Jude Law took him to a fucking robot circus,

680
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,800
and he got lost and destroyed New York?

681
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,240
Like, who gives a fuck?

682
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,880
If God did build us top to bottom, he did get like, I think he got burnt out.

683
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,040
Yeah.

684
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,840
Like, oh man.

685
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,360
Well, I have to imagine he didn't-

686
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,280
I can't keep putting that much detail into things.

687
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,960
Right, he did it like the old Lego toys, you know, old toys where he said like,

688
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,560
okay, we've got a stock body,

689
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,240
and then we can just put different heads on it in different outfits,

690
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,520
and that will be the different people.

691
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,560
That's true.

692
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,920
That's a good point, Travis.

693
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:35,520
Like, he just had one idea for bodies, and he's like, I don't know, maybe just reuse that.

694
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,160
Just keep using it.

695
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,120
Yeah, over and over again.

696
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,720
Because, yeah, guys.

697
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,840
Yeah, the two of you.

698
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,120
Because every dude's body looks exactly the same.

699
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,760
That's why when you see like, me and Channing Tatum,

700
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,720
if we're wearing full head masks, you're like, God, that one's Griffin?

701
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,920
Oh no, that one's Channing.

702
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,160
Fuck.

703
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,960
No, but I mean, it's not-

704
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,680
Okay, fair, but if I were to cut off Channing Tatum's head, I'd go to jail.

705
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,840
But if I did cut off Channing Tatum's head, and I showed you Channing Tatum's bottom,

706
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,360
you wouldn't be able to tell if that was Channing Tatum or Kevin Sorbo.

707
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,720
I actually carved-

708
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,680
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

709
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,720
Those are your two go-to attractive in-shape dudes.

710
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,280
Channing Tatum and Kevin Sorbo.

711
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,440
Kevin Sorbo's Hercules, okay?

712
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,640
But I can't tell the difference between them physically.

713
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,600
Also, he was Hercules in 1981.

714
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,120
He's not Hercules forever because he's not actually Hercules.

715
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,080
Is that Kevin Sorbo or is that Channing Tatum?

716
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,400
I don't know.

717
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,680
I'll have to wait till they turn around.

718
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,880
I cannot see their face.

719
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,680
I actually-

720
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,840
I carved my initials into Channing Tatum's ass so I could tell them apart.

721
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,640
It's the only way.

722
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,280
I clearly meant Kevin Sorbo classic.

723
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,840
Oh, okay.

724
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,040
I wasn't implying-

725
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,240
Not new Sorbo.

726
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,280
Not new Sorbo.

727
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,520
Not Crystal Sorbo.

728
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,400
Crystal Sorbo classic Kevin Sorbo.

729
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,240
The original formulation.

730
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,960
Oh, man.

731
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,960
When he was Hercules.

732
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:14,720
Let's get the money's over here.

733
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,320
My Brother, My Brother, and Me is sponsored by Squarespace.

734
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,120
It's an all-in-one platform that makes it fast and easy to make your own website.

735
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,280
You want to spread the word about My Brother, My Brother, and Me, you go make your own website.

736
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,040
My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

737
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,280
And we will sue you so hard.

738
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,880
Take you down.

739
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,880
The good thing about that is that they offer a support team 24-7.

740
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,200
Do they offer legal support because we sued you?

741
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,160
I don't think so.

742
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
They have new designs.

743
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
It's got new features.

744
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,360
And it's just eight bucks a month with a free domain name if you sign up for a year.

745
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,520
Also, if you make a site, it'll make it like a mobile version of the site specifically for mobile

746
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,000
phones.

747
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,560
So that's kind of nice.

748
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,440
It's not without a lot of extra hassle on your part.

749
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,280
And you can start a trial with no credit card.

750
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,640
Start building today.

751
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,720
Don't wait to make your website.

752
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,000
The dot com bubble is just expanding now and it will never burst.

753
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,840
It's never bursted before either.

754
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,880
It's an infinite bubble.

755
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,000
Invest all your money.

756
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,500
Yeah.

757
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,600
I have so much money in pets.com, guys.

758
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,160
And that is how I'm sending my kids to college.

759
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,000
Good news is you're not going to have to invest all your money because we're going to save

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,080
you 10% off your first purchase.

Just use the offer code mybrother.

762
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:33,920
That's all one word, mybrother, to get 10% off on the first thing you buy there.

763
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,480
It's Squarespace, everything that you need to create an exceptional website.

764
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,920
And hey, if you do use Squarespace and create a thing, tweet us a link.

765
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,400
Yeah.

766
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,360
Let us see your website.

767
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,160
I want to see it.

768
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,440
Let us see your website.

769
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,400
I want to see the website you made with that and make it about us.

770
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,800
Yeah, because I don't actually read anything that's not about me, so that would be very

771
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,300
helpful.

772
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,160
Guys, I just tore January off of my Dilbert calendar.

773
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:10,240
The calendar is from 1997, so the dates don't exactly match up, but you get a general idea.

774
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,600
I legit forgot that Valentine's Day is coming up.

775
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
Oh, shit.

776
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,880
It'll sneak up on you.

777
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,680
You got to be careful.

778
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,640
Griffin, I'm in a panic now.

779
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,040
Yeah.

780
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,920
I don't know what I'm going to do.

781
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,960
Well, let me tell you what to do.

782
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,240
Okay.

783
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:24,880
Tell me exactly what to do.

784
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:33,280
You can avoid forgetting, letting Valentine's Day slip your dome by going to proflowers.com.

785
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,520
It's a flowers vendor website on internet that you can use to get the flowers, and then

786
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,560
you don't have to go to the store and smell them and it sets off your allergies.

787
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,840
You get them on internet, and then you get it delivered to your house.

788
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,680
Beautiful blooms in all sorts of different colors.

789
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,280
We have beautiful blooms here.

790
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,720
I'm talking about beautiful blooms.

791
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,520
Let me just hit you with some of the stuff that they have on proflowers.com.

792
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,960
Beautiful blooms, check, covered that.

793
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,440
You can get 100 blooms of love with a free glass vase for just $19.99.

794
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,880
I don't know if you guys know this.

795
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,920
That's crazy not expensive compared to other flowers.

796
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,680
That's not enough for me.

797
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,560
I want to upgrade.

798
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,600
I want to add gourmet chocolates and a teddy bear.

799
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,680
How much is that going to cost?

800
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,080
That's another $9.99 American US dollars.

801
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,280
Oh my God.

802
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,720
That's such a good fucking deal.

803
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,560
That's a crazy thing to get for that much money.

804
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:41,040
That's insane, and you can get it exclusively through us on us by using the code mybrother.

805
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,000
Now here's how you do it though.

806
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,040
You go to proflowers.com.

807
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,680
You click on there's a blue microphone, okay?

808
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,160
It's in the top right corner, and you type in my brother.

809
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,760
You can just use it as a coupon code.

810
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,280
You go to proflowers.com.

811
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,480
You click on the blue microphone, and you type in my brother.

812
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,200
And this is going to be like a crazy, crazy deal, and you'll have it sorted.

813
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,520
Like that's Valentine's Day, sorted, done.

814
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,200
We got sent some flowers from proflowers.com so we could see them in our home.

815
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,080
Which was a fun thing.

816
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,520
Because they're according to us.

817
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,640
Which was a fun thing to explain to my wife.

818
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,080
I don't know about you, how that situation went down with your respect.

819
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,120
Oh, you got me flowers.

820
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,880
Yeah, sure, yeah, sort of.

821
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,800
Yeah, yeah, of course I did, honey.

822
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,680
I love you.

823
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,720
Could you send me a picture of them though so I could see what they look like?

824
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,920
Yeah, they are gorgeous, and they are sitting in our home right now, and it's really nice.

825
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,320
It's a nice vase, the flowers came super fresh, and it's in a box.

826
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,400
It's insane that this technology exists, but you take them out of the box and they look amazing.

827
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,640
And you can get that right now.

828
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,080
Go to proflowers.com, click on the blue microphone, and in the top right corner,

829
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,760
type in my brother, all one word.

830
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,400
It's a microphone like a podcast, because that's how you remember.

831
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,440
That's a mnemonic device.

832
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,760
Yeah, and do it soon.

833
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,600
So like right now.

834
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,120
Yeah, because that won't last forever.

835
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,720
Yeah, oh no.

836
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,160
Unlike love, this order won't last forever.

837
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,960
You know who will live forever?

838
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,680
Who?

839
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,400
Yoshi.

840
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,120
It's from Mario?

841
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,800
No, from Brian.

842
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,080
Brian says, happy moving in together today.

843
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,960
Thanks for being the best girlfriend ever.

844
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,600
Whoa, really throwing down the gauntlet.

845
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,960
If, against all odds, you actually do become a ghost before I do,

846
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,120
please don't actually haunt my penis.

847
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,840
Yeah, you didn't finish reading that sentence before you said it out loud, did you?

848
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,240
No, I hope that's a conversation that Brian and Yoshi have had before,

849
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,760
and not new information that Brian is dropping on Yoshi.

850
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,200
We've got a new quiz game we're playing in this section called

851
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,600
In Joke or Terrifying Revelation.

852
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,960
Let's hope that's an in joke.

853
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,280
Also, I want the brothers to say they love you one after another,

854
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,960
because you're so obviously awesome.

855
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,360
You don't-

856
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,480
I can't just throw my heart around you.

857
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,040
No, you know what?

858
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,600
I'm going to say, Yoshi, I love you for putting up with Brian and all of his pee pee talk.

859
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:02,560
And I can say, I love Yoshi, and then maybe I'm talking about this person,

860
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,240
maybe I'm just talking about the fact that Yoshi is my favorite character from Super Smash Brothers.

861
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,680
Fair enough.

862
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,640
Does that awesome egg roll, and it's really hard to hit him, so.

863
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,200
I love you.

864
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,240
I love egg rolls.

865
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,740
Yeah, me too.

866
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,680
So happy, have a good one, guys.

867
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,120
Enjoy that journey together.

868
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:24,160
Uh, be patient, and be understanding, and give of yourself, and it'll all work out fine.

869
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,720
Wow, shit.

870
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,160
Deep.

871
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,960
Here's another message for Scott Foreman Murray,

872
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:35,680
who is 30 years old, American, in the American keeping of time.

873
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,560
This message is from Lindsay, who says,

874
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,600
Happy birthday, Victor.

875
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:47,840
Now, my memory is pretty short, but it's not so short that I forget that this dude's ass name is Scott.

876
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,120
What are you doing, Lindsay?

877
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,640
What kind of scam are you running?

878
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,800
Uh, happy birthday, Victor Scott.

879
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,760
You are the best, funniest, smartest person I know, and my favorite human in the world.

880
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,680
There's no one I'd rather spend the afternoon with, let alone the rest of my life.

881
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,160
Thanks for marrying me this year, and here's to another seven or so decades full of nonsense,

882
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,560
sandwiches, squeezels, and car rides, long car rides, listening to my bim bam as us.

883
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:19,360
Uh, I love that this person has put a fairly fine point on when they're going to terminate.

884
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,400
Yeah, 70 or so.

885
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,280
Yeah, I mean, if we can get 70 out of this thing, fucking great.

886
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,280
We'll beat the average.

887
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,000
What's your name again?

888
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,680
Victor?

889
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,600
Victor Scott.

890
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,800
Oh no, this doesn't-

891
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,440
Guys, when it turns out that Travis just put in the wrong message there,

892
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,080
be sure to email us so we can fix it next week.

893
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,400
I simply did not.

894
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,200
I am so proud to be an American and to be hosting Throwing Shade with you.

895
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,200
I am proud to have really deep brown eyes.

896
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,240
Well, this is actually supposed to be, you know, this is supposed to be a thing so that

897
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,040
people listen to our show.

898
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,240
I've just been so busy this week, but I'm very happy to be here.

899
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,680
The podcast is called-

900
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,640
It's called Throwing Shade.

901
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,520
You're the co-host, yeah.

902
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,960
So, uh, Throwing Shade, we talk about-

903
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,120
You're the gay co-host, I'm the female co-host.

904
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,760
I always forget.

905
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,320
We're friends in real life, kind of, and we talk about lady and gay issues.

906
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:14,560
Yeah.

907
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,480
And we talk about them in a way that is really disrespectful.

908
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:18,800
Yeah.

909
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,880
If you love the world and hate yourself-

910
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,320
Please listen to Throwing Shade.

911
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:22,820
Yeah.

912
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,600
I've had a Twitter account for a couple of years, but I've never really used it.

913
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,040
A year ago, I was hired by a company with roots in the video game industry.

914
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,160
I'm an artist.

915
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,840
And a well-known company began following my little personal Twitter account, which led

916
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,840
to several miscellaneous followers, ranging from a couple YouTube stars to minor league

917
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,640
music producers.

918
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:47,040
Now, I feel obligated to tweet in an attempt to build a personal brand.

919
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,160
But what?

920
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,400
I don't want to sound ditzy or boring, but I don't know how to form a decent thought

921
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,320
around 140 character restriction.

922
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,120
Help me, brothers.

923
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,200
How do I tweet?

924
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,520
That's from tongue-tied Twitter.

925
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,360
Now, you're both verified Twitter account holders, correct?

926
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,320
And listen, people, we fucking get it, right?

927
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,360
Justin and I are verified.

928
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,400
Travis isn't.

929
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,360
Ha ha ha.

930
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,640
It's a great joke that Travis isn't verified.

931
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,360
But it's not because Travis is worse than us.

932
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,760
It's not that he's like the worst brother.

933
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,240
It's not?

934
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,960
No, Trav-

935
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,680
No, Travy.

936
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:22,960
Everybody-

937
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,400
That's what people seem to imply.

938
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,560
Well, they can back the hell off.

939
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,920
It's just that they've implied such mean things.

940
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,760
We're allowed to goof on each other, but if anybody goofs on either two of you, I'm

941
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,640
taking them.

942
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,400
Downtown to Punch Town.

943
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,240
The problem is-

944
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,720
Which is this gym that I go to, and then I will make them watch me lift weights, and

945
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,600
then they'll be intimidated.

946
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,520
Trace up, and then we'll go around and around.

947
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,720
Travis is incapable of proving that he is who he is.

948
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,440
That's a problem.

949
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,000
Justin and me, we can do it.

950
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,320
Travis has a much, much harder time.

951
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,080
That's because Travis's tweet material is so erratic.

952
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,080
You can't fucking pin him down.

953
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:00,480
He tweets-

954
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,200
And erotic.

955
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,400
It's erratic, erotic.

956
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,240
He tweets in a serpentine pattern.

957
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,520
You can't get a beat on his ass.

958
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,200
Me, I'm pretty much always just talking-

959
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,760
Asking people for healthy recipes and complaining about video games.

960
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,520
That's pretty much my entire Twitter.

961
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,080
I mean, here's the thing.

962
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,280
If we give you advice on your own personal brand, then it's just gonna come from our

963
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:27,360
personal brands, and I do not need any more competition in my space, which is pseudo-ironic,

964
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,160
all lowercase tweets about the things that I did today.

965
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,080
Uh, here's, here's one thing.

966
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,960
One actual Twitter tip that I can give you is, uh, it's a really good time to tweet

967
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,560
when you're watching something on TV that a lot of people are watching.

968
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,080
Dude, I got all my followers.

969
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,560
That's when you can really harness the zeitgeist.

970
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,080
If you want to build a brand, that's when you do it.

971
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:46,560
This is what you do.

972
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,120
This is what you do.

973
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,920
Throw a party during, like, the Oscars.

974
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,880
Throw an Oscars party.

975
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,800
Get, like, 12 of your super funny friends in the same room.

976
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,200
Get them all drunk, and then one of them says something funny, fucking twerking.

977
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,880
If it's funny, fucking tweet it.

978
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,920
That's yours now.

979
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,800
That's your brand.

980
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,600
They don't have to know.

981
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,960
That's like a billi- or you could do, like, you can write in parentheses, like,

982
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,520
H slash T, Joey Bag of Donuts.

983
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,320
Cause then, then you're giving a hat tip to your friend Joey Bag of Donuts.

984
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:13,920
That's what that means.

985
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,360
But don't include his Twitter account name, or else people will just, like, fucking flock

986
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:17,600
there.

987
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,600
You don't want to bleed your followers.

988
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,360
It's all about SEO optimization.

989
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,400
Now, SEO does stand for search engine optimization.

990
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,240
You have to optimize your optimization.

991
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,000
Listen, there's fucking layers to this thing.

992
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,280
It's Dante's Inferno.

993
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,480
Don't be afraid to ask for a retweet.

994
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,560
When I was watching the State of the Union, I said, uh, I hope the commander-in-chief

995
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:42,320
has some Purell, because, uh, cold and flu season doesn't care what you're the president

996
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:42,480
of.

997
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,440
And then, later in the tweet, this is where a lot of people stumble, I used the hashtag

998
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,200
Purell please retweet this.

999
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,920
And then, the next day, okay, so they sort of missed the zeitgeist.

1000
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,360
Kind of fell off it a bit.

1001
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,960
Purell did retweet me.

1002
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,160
So, I have that.

1003
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,960
I have that in my sort of wheelhouse now.

1004
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,240
When I'm doing a bio, I say, once retweeted by Purell.

1005
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,400
And that's pretty exciting.

1006
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,240
Oh, the bio is so fucking important.

1007
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,040
Can we touch on that?

1008
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,680
You have to throw as many fucking buzzwords in there as you possibly can, including the

1009
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,480
word buzzword.

1010
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,240
Buzzword ninja.

1011
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,680
Social guru.

1012
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,360
Master of tweet karate.

1013
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:31,760
I want you guys to know, I, and probably all of our listeners, cannot tell if this is all

1014
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,080
bullshit.

1015
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,280
Forward thinker.

1016
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,560
Think tank thinker.

1017
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,360
Think, think, think.

1018
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,720
Good thinks.

1019
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,320
This all sounds pretty good to me.

1020
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,040
This sounds like how I do Twitter so far.

1021
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,880
Learning optimization guru.

1022
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,440
Are you reading my bio?

1023
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,040
Social coordinator and master of tweet foo.

1024
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,400
Yes.

1025
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,840
Do you guys ever see somebody's bio think, God's a good bio.

1026
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,720
I wish I thought of that.

1027
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,400
I honestly think I have the best Twitter bio on the entire internet.

1028
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,240
So, I haven't touched it since day one and I will never touch it.

1029
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,920
Can you tell us what it is?

1030
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,880
I cannot.

1031
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,080
You gotta go find out for yourself.

1032
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:12,880
All right, great.

1033
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,480
This is his fucking personal brand.

1034
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,320
Travis is all about establishing a mystery.

1035
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,960
That's why that motherfucker is not verified.

1036
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,160
They send him emails all the time.

1037
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,480
Like, Travis, do you want us to verify you?

1038
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,960
He says, if you can find me, try and just try and find me.

1039
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,360
You can.

1040
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,240
Like our friend Evan Minsker, right?

1041
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,120
His background.

1042
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,560
I think backgrounds are key too.

1043
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,560
That's your chance to sort of have fun.

1044
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,720
His looks like an image from an old cookbook from the 70s.

1045
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,040
And when I saw it, I thought, God, that's so cool.

1046
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,400
I wish that was my background.

1047
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,360
And now he's got that going for him.

1048
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,320
He doesn't even have to worry about it.

1049
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,240
And then his Twitter icon attacks on Jim Duggan.

1050
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:48,720
Yeah.

1051
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,680
He's like crushing it.

1052
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,840
It's a destination Twitter account.

1053
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,920
Go spend some time on there.

1054
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,600
He's a real smart fella.

1055
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,160
That's the thing.

1056
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,440
Your Twitter account has to feel like an event.

1057
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,520
When somebody walks in, they gotta think, like, whoa,

1058
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,400
I am just in time for this party because it is just getting started.

1059
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,000
And let me throw this out.

1060
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,280
Something for everyone.

1061
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,240
It's always great to throw like a, hey, do you remember this?

1062
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,160
And then like post a YouTube clip from like Rocko's Modern Life.

1063
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,360
And then not only did you not just come up with any actual original content,

1064
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:24,000
but you get to bask in all the glow of it as people go, thank you.

1065
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,400
Thank you.

1066
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,880
I think Travis just invented BuzzFeed.

1067
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:30,800
Here's the thing, though.

1068
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,200
When you are putting up quotes from Rocko's Modern Life,

1069
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,760
make sure you source them to Morgan Freeman.

1070
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,360
Because that's going to go viral.

1071
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,960
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

1072
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,160
Please.

1073
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,440
This Yahoo was sent in by Steven Schaus.

1074
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,000
Thanks, Steven.

1075
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,800
It's by Yahoo Answers user Lauren Dwan, who asks,

1076
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,360
what's the cheapest horse?

1077
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,960
And then additional info, I want a horse.

1078
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,840
You want to go with the cheapest horse?

1079
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,080
Well, guys, what's the cheapest horse?

1080
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,880
The problem is, is you get what you pay for.

1081
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,320
You go with those cut rate, you know, thrift store horses.

1082
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,720
It's only going to last you like two or three years

1083
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,880
before the knees and elbows start to wear out.

1084
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,760
You get a Shetland, like it's only going to put you back a couple grand,

1085
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,640
but like you're not going to feel the fucking wind in your hair

1086
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,560
that you would get from a premium horse.

1087
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:26,400
It's just like, I think when you buy a horse,

1088
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:32,400
it's sort of like buying a car, maybe.

1089
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,240
So you could buy a shitty car, sure.

1090
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,640
You're going to pay like a shit ton in terms of like upkeep and insurance.

1091
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,400
Like I imagine horse fees are like astronomical,

1092
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,760
and that's why nobody fucking has it.

1093
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,840
Let me throw out the differences.

1094
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,680
When you buy a shitty cheap car,

1095
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,120
you don't have to feel any kind of emotions as it falls apart

1096
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,600
as opposed to buying a shitty living being

1097
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,480
and then going, I don't feel like feeding it.

1098
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,920
I've done a little research.

1099
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:02,160
Okay.

1100
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:03,760
Here's the thing.

1101
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,080
They're free horses.

1102
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,040
What the fuck?

1103
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,320
What the fuck?

1104
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:08,560
What?

1105
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:09,440
What?

1106
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,800
I'm looking right now, I'm looking at equine.com.

1107
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,280
Okay.

1108
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,280
And I'm looking at free horses.

1109
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,440
This is a section that is just free horses to a good home.

1110
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:19,680
Okay.

1111
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,480
Can I just say then fuck all that other shit I just said?

1112
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,320
Cause then you can just, you can just get a burner.

1113
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:26,960
You know what I mean?

1114
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,200
I want to ride an untraceable horse.

1115
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,480
I want to ride a horse.

1116
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,560
I don't know if I'm going to be able to pay 300 bucks a month

1117
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,560
to just like fucking stable this bad boy.

1118
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,960
I'm going to get a burner, take him out for the weekend and yeah.

1119
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,120
Yeah.

1120
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:41,520
Come on.

1121
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,080
Come this way.

1122
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:42,640
Come this way.

1123
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:43,520
Bye.

1124
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,680
That horse will outrun you.

1125
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,960
Good luck getting away from that horse.

1126
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,960
But you can just leave them in a field somewhere.

1127
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,520
And then he'll, you know, horses lived for a long time

1128
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,640
before we like gave them oats and shelter and shit.

1129
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,840
They're very resourceful.

1130
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,800
They're horseful.

1131
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,320
They're going to be fine.

1132
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,440
They're going to be just fine.

1133
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,000
Get yourself a burner or a few.

1134
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,760
I'm looking at one listing that caught my eye.

1135
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,720
This is Smokey.

1136
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,880
She's a sweet senior pony looking for a retirement home.

1137
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,760
And you know what?

1138
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,440
I appreciate the coded language, but I know what you're saying here

1139
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,360
and it's that you don't want to deal with her death.

1140
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:17,840
Can you even-

1141
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,280
You want me to be the one who's carrying that emotional burden?

1142
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,080
No, thank you.

1143
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,600
Can you have a senior pony?

1144
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,360
Isn't a pony a young horse?

1145
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,360
No, no.

1146
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,360
We've been blasted for that before.

1147
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:29,600
Yeah.

1148
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,080
A pony is like a completely different thing.

1149
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:32,480
Did we get-

1150
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,240
Shetland pony is not a tiny horse.

1151
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,160
I mean, it is a tiny horse.

1152
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,200
I mean, it is a tiny horse, but it will not eventually become a horse.

1153
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,240
Just add water.

1154
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,120
Do not feed after midnight.

1155
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:43,920
Hold on.

1156
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:50,400
Have I been getting this wrong for a quarter of a century?

1157
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,600
Have I really been getting this wrong?

1158
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,840
I thought it was like when you call a goat a kid,

1159
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,840
because when it's a baby or a-

1160
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,880
No, it's a foal.

1161
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,720
A foal is a-

1162
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,720
And then a kangaroo has a joey, right?

1163
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,680
Uh-huh.

1164
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,480
And then there's a murder-

1165
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,040
A Joey Lawrence.

1166
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,320
A murder of crows, if it's a bunch of baby crows.

1167
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,080
A pony is not a baby horse?

1168
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,360
Are you fucking kidding me?

1169
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,760
No, this is the-

1170
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,640
Sorry, this is the way it is.

1171
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,880
I need to stop belaboring this.

1172
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,000
I need to just play it off like,

1173
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,920
I got you guys, goofs.

1174
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,880
Good jokes.

1175
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,480
This is like my character I do on the show.

1176
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,600
He's a guy who doesn't know just like basic, simple, first grade shit.

1177
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,400
I'm sorry.

1178
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,880
I'm still trying to compartmentalize the knowledge

1179
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,840
that I could just have a horse.

1180
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,800
Just go get a horse, sure.

1181
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,240
Just go pick up a horse that lives at my house.

1182
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:40,480
Yeah.

1183
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,720
What defines a good home in that respect?

1184
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,160
Because I would love the horse.

1185
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:46,800
Yeah, sure.

1186
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,960
And it would stand in my tiny backyard

1187
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,640
and my dog would probably bark at it.

1188
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,120
Does that work?

1189
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,760
You would be the fagan of horses

1190
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,560
in that you wouldn't be able to take especially good care of the horse,

1191
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,120
but you would create like a loving environment and atmosphere

1192
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,960
all so you would teach the horse to steal.

1193
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,800
Probably a good way of doing this

1194
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,880
is to go to someone's home when they're not there

1195
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,040
and then damage all their belongings

1196
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,920
and then put their horse into the house.

1197
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,240
And then when they show up, they're like,

1198
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,720
what happened?

1199
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,000
I gotta get rid of this horse.

1200
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,440
I gotta get rid of this horse.

1201
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,600
And then you show up like 15 minutes later,

1202
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,680
like, I heard you're having some horse problems.

1203
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,440
And then you're a real flimflamster.

1204
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,440
I came from the city.

1205
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,720
I work for horse control.

1206
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,720
It's a huge-

1207
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,240
You got trouble right here in River City with a capital H

1208
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,440
and that stands for horse.

1209
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,560
Doesn't rhyme with anything though.

1210
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,080
We got a call from a horse who said he was gonna,

1211
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,440
he said, and this is a direct quote from your horse,

1212
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,280
he's gonna jack up your shit.

1213
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,640
And then also he finished the fried chicken you had

1214
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,920
in your refrigerator.

1215
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,880
Go check, go check.

1216
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,160
I bet it's all gone.

1217
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,200
He ate all of it.

1218
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,240
He sounded drunk.

1219
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,120
God, what if a horse gonna taste for chicken?

1220
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,320
No chicken will be safe.

1221
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,200
No chicken's safe.

1222
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,200
Horses are so fast.

1223
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,200
And quite large, much larger than several chickens.

1224
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,520
Stop trying to ruin horses for me.

1225
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,640
Let's do another question.

1226
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,360
Travis, there are so many in Cincinnati.

1227
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,600
You could just have one.

1228
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,080
Just have a horse.

1229
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,160
I'll take it.

1230
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:28,880
I'll take it.

1231
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:29,920
It's free.

1232
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,440
Are they all old ass-

1233
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,920
Do not look in its fucking mouth.

1234
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,960
I have to assume if they're not old, they're crazy.

1235
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,600
Like they are ready to bite and down to kill.

1236
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,920
Which is what I am looking for in an equine companion.

1237
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,360
Oh, Travis, that'd be a nice business though.

1238
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,960
You get a young horse that's a kind of a dick.

1239
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,400
You break him.

1240
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,200
You bridle him and you resell him for a profit.

1241
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,080
Doesn't sound like any work at all.

1242
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,880
Sounds like I'd make money hand over fist.

1243
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,960
Now, when you worked at PetSmart,

1244
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,120
did you learn how to break and bridle a horse?

1245
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,040
Of course I did, Griffin.

1246
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,200
My education was three days long and all encompassing.

1247
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,680
For all animals under the sun, under God's domain.

1248
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,480
What do you got?

1249
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,040
The weirdest day was when we learned how to foster baby turtles.

1250
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,480
Yeah, when you birthed-

1251
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,600
That was one full day.

1252
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,760
Then you birthed that Komodo dragon.

1253
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,520
That was a life-changing experience.

1254
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,640
And it imprinted on me.

1255
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,880
That's why you always see me with that Komodo dragon all the time.

1256
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,840
I'm currently staying in a hotel now

1257
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,160
that serves complimentary breakfast in the mornings.

1258
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,240
Like a dummy, the only shoes I brought were big old hiking boots

1259
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,680
for the wintery weather outside.

1260
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,880
Is it acceptable for me to just wear my socks to the hotel?

1261
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,720
Ew, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1262
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,040
This is from pretty sure I should be wearing shoes in Pittsburgh.

1263
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,000
Oh no, no.

1264
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,800
I mean, you know it.

1265
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,080
You said it in the name, no.

1266
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,640
No, come on.

1267
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,320
No, no, I'm eating.

1268
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,800
I'm eating a waffle I made.

1269
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,280
This is the fucking highlight of my entire year.

1270
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,040
Can you fucking put some shoes on?

1271
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:04,720
Please.

1272
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,240
Do your socks have holes in it?

1273
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:06,880
Doesn't matter.

1274
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,200
Put on some fucking shoes.

1275
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:09,840
I'm eating.

1276
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,680
If someone walks in in socks, my meal is over.

1277
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,480
My meal is done.

1278
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:14,960
If you're okay-

1279
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,440
Well, if someone walks in, Justin's meal is done

1280
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,680
because he cannot stand to share the room with anyone else.

1281
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,400
If you're okay-

1282
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,800
How much do you guys love when you're at a hotel

1283
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,840
and that hotel also has a pool and then pool people

1284
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,600
come to other areas of the hotel in pool garb

1285
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:36,560
as though they're just trying to bring their fucking kick back

1286
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,760
Jamaican lifestyle to us of clothes?

1287
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,440
Every time we've ever been at Great Wolf Lodge, it's like,

1288
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,080
oh, I'm going to go down to the restaurant and also

1289
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,960
the elevator is full of people that are soaking wet.

1290
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,720
It feels so judgmental.

1291
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,360
It's like those commercials for Jamaica, right?

1292
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,840
Kick back, have a cocktail, relax.

1293
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,560
Why are you so-

1294
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,400
It's like, listen, I'm at a hotel.

1295
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,000
I'm trying to live my day-to-day life.

1296
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,320
I can't join you in your fucking wet bacchanal.

1297
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:04,800
Right.

1298
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,520
I can't do it.

1299
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,760
Some of us have jobs and shoes.

1300
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,200
Jobs and shoes that are trying to eat free breakfast.

1301
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,400
That's crazy.

1302
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,080
You shouldn't eat any meal with bare feet ever.

1303
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,120
I think that's a sin.

1304
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,840
I'm okay with it as long as you're okay with me

1305
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,960
sucking on cantaloupe or staring at your toes.

1306
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,520
Is that cool?

1307
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:26,720
Is that all right?

1308
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,200
Is that okay?

1309
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,600
Because that's what's going to happen.

1310
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,320
I'll hold the cantaloupe between my thumb and forefinger

1311
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,960
and I'm just going to think about your jobs.

1312
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,400
I bet this question asker is pretty hungry at this point.

1313
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:40,640
Yeah.

1314
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:40,640
Yeah.

1315
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,280
Don't wait on us.

1316
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,800
I would just wear the boots.

1317
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,880
I mean, I would prefer the boots, right?

1318
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,720
I would just wear the boots and a onesie long underwear set.

1319
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,040
Yeah.

1320
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,160
Oh, do the boots and the red flannel underwear

1321
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,320
and then an old-timey miner's hat.

1322
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,200
And then just go for it.

1323
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,960
Bring your own thermos full of mine hooch.

1324
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:06,960
Yeah.

1325
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,240
I'm loving all of this.

1326
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,160
Talk about the vein you hit yesterday and how you think it's really going to pay out.

1327
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,760
Use your old prospector voice.

1328
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,880
This is the finest grits I've ever enjoyed.

1329
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:18,720
Boy, howdy.

1330
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,720
Sure does warm up the insides.

1331
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,480
You have any more of that good oatmeal?

1332
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,480
Where's the scrapple?

1333
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,640
Scrapple?

1334
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,960
I think we dug up Cthulhu yesterday.

1335
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,280
Let me get some oats.

1336
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,800
Hey, can you do me a favor?

1337
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,680
Can you tell that lady to put her fucking shoes on?

1338
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,480
Some of us are trying to live in a civilized society, goddammit.

1339
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,760
We hope you've enjoyed listening to our radio program,

1340
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,320
My Brother, My Brother, Me, and Advice Show for the Modern Era

1341
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,360
half as much as we've enjoyed creating it for you.

1342
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,840
Thank you to people tweeting about the show.

1343
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:13,840

Chetur, Chelsea Care, Christina, Funny Girl from Floor 9, Eru, Recovering Ninja Cat,

1345
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,560
so many others.

1346
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,720
You're all the best and we sure appreciate all those tweets.

1347
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,360
If you want to tweet about the show, maybe include a link to our sampler.

1348
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:33,200
It's bit.ly forward slash mbmbam2013.

1349
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,000
Um, I want to say thank you to everyone.

1350
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,560
There was such an abundance of really good questions.

1351
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,560
Yeah, I got a shit ton of great yahoo's too.

1352
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,360
Thank you guys.

1353
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:45,440
I don't think I don't think I read a yahoo today that was sent in by somebody who has

1354
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,320
done it before.

1355
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,360
Like, that's awesome.

1356
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,480
Thank you guys so much.

1357
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,760
Welcome to the game.

1358
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,360
Yeah, and I don't think I've ever said it before, but if you know, we don't have time

1359
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,560
to answer everybody's questions.

1360
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:58,240
So if you've ever sent in a question before and you haven't heard us answer it,

1361
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,680
feel free to send it in again.

1362
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,120
I mean, it's quite possible that it's not that we didn't want to do it.

1363
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,160
We just ran out of time.

1364
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,880
Sometimes we have them on the on the list of questions to hit.

1365
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,680
We just don't get to them.

1366
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,800
Yeah, and we read everything.

1367
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,000
So so so do keep sending us in real quick.

1368
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,280
I want to thank John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme song, which

1369
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,760
is it's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1370
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:22,000
When I was putting together yahoo's this morning, I was listening to putting the days

1371
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,800
to bed.

1372
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,240
And like, it's weird whenever it's a departure comes on.

1373
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,320
I like get like freaked out.

1374
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,200
I think it's I think this show gives me a panic attack.

1375
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,920
And so when I hear it, I'm like, oh, God, do I need to be on right now?

1376
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:39,360
So if you want to have that same panic attack, you can get putting the days to bed on, you

1377
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:40,800
know, Amazon or iTunes or whatever.

1378
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,560
Our boss, Jesse Thorn, is doing a conference for independent creators called Make Your

1379
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,040
Thing.

1380
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,320
He's trying to kick start it now.

It's going to be on October.

1382
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,800
If you go to Google and just search make your thing, you'll see the Kickstarter there.

1383
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,680
Go kick in some bucks and maybe go to the event.

1384
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,840
There's going to be some other cool, cool shit there.

1385
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,120
Yeah, I forget all the big names that are going to be there talking.

1387
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,320
going to be there.

1388
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:12,320
Fucking Colt Cabana, the Art of Wrestling podcast guy.

1389
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,360
He's fucking fantastic.

1390
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,400
I saw him do his do his thing in Chicago once.

1391

1400
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,520
It's become one of my new favorites.

1401
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,640
I listen to it every week.

1402
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,840
And yeah, go look at all those.

1403
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,640
If you have any questions for our guestpert, it's going to be on next week.

1404
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,080
Send those in.

1405
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,080
What's the topic?

1406
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:55,440
The topic that our guestpert is a guestpert in is gays and lesbians in the media.

1407
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,680
So if you want to focus your questions on that, or if you just have any questions

1408
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:05,040
that you don't want us to answer because you know we don't know about it, that seems like

1409
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:10,240
a pretty safe bet to just make sure you put like guestpert in the subject so that we do

1410
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,600
not miss them and that we know that you want it directed specifically at our guestpert.

1411
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:14,480
All right.

1412
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,360
You guys ready for that final?

1413
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:16,400

And every week we're lucky enough to be joined by a guest, sometimes a comedian,

1435
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:20,560
or sometimes just somebody that we like and somebody probably you've never heard of.

1436
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:22,800
Trust us.

1437
