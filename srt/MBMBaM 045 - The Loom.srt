1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:45,680
Charlie Sheen reference.

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,640
You can do better than that. Everybody else is doing it. Something about a warlock.

7
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,320
I would like to change the title of our show, and I've been thinking about this really hard,

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,200
to Sheen-tervention. What do we do? What do we do in a Sheen-tervention? Basically,

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,160
we just we cry out to Charlie Sheen and tell him how his lifestyle is hurting us personally.

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,480
Yeah, I don't care if you destroy yourself with Drugs Charlie. Just stop saying such

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,920
cool things that my brother and my brother and me in a device show from the modern era

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,800
can't keep up. Do you know my favorite thing about the Charlie Sheen psychobility freakout

13
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,200
that's going on right now? My very favorite thing about it is that he's finally openly talking about

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,640
how he wants to make Major League Three, but it's like, dog, they already made Major League Three

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,280
and it has Scott Bakala in it, but I guess he doesn't accept Major League Three. That's not

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:41,520
canon. It's not canonical. Like, sorry, Bakala. I worry about how this is affecting that fat little

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,560
kid. I'm not a Major League fan, so I'm going to take your word that there's a fat little kid.

18
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:56,720
By the way, guys, that scene in being John Malkovich is like triply awesome now. How great

19
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,080
is that scene where he's hanging out with Charlie Sheen? Now that movie's even crazier, as if.

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,440
You think that's when it flipped.

21
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,440
That's when it flipped. Now it's even like, it's like triple. Hi, we're my brother and my brother

22
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,760
and me. It's an advice show for the modern era. I'm your host, Justin McElroy.

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,680
I'm another host, Travis McElroy.

24
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,720
And I am yet another host, Griffin McElroy.

25
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:28,080
So this is our fun drive? Is that our last fun drive show? Is that accurate?

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,560
It is our final fun drive show.

27
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,240
Yeah. The fun drive is ended and now it's just a slog to Christmas.

28
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,080
What you can't see is I'm slowly loosening my tie and rolling up my

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,120
sleeves and pushing a big broom to sweep up all the fun drive stuff. It's very sad.

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,320
No, it goes on for another week.

31
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,040
Why am I cleaning up?

32
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,880
Don't clean up. Leave that streamer up. That took me forever. I have to get a ladder now.

33
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,720
Thank you so much. But more on that later. Right now, let's get right into the advising,

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,880
the advice, the learning, the growing. Thank you, by the way, to those who have already given.

35
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,320
It is hugely helpful to us and we love you more than we can, words can say.

36
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,200
And for those about to give, we salute you.

37
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,600
And those who never give, suckle bub. Get out of there, you joke thief.

38
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,920
All right. Great. A friend wants to be my roommate, but I would rather not room with him.

39
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,200
What should I tell him? That's from Wobbly Orbit on Twitter.

40
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,920
Suckle bub.

41
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,800
Wobbly underscore. What, Griff?

42
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,240
Suckle bub.

43
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,000
You tell him to suckle bub?

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,640
I need to break that down. What are you saying exactly?

45
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,840
I think this is weirder. Suck... ol... bub.

46
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,960
Suckle bub. Suckle bub.

47
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,720
That's something that our dad used to say.

48
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,800
Not to us, like, in a grimy way, though.

49
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,000
No, God, no.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,960
Like, you didn't finish your homework. Like, what are you saying?

51
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,240
Suckle bub.

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,160
People who cut him off in the Kroger's parking lot, he would give him,

53
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,760
break him off a piece of his mind.

54
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,680
Yeah. Also, to be fair, yeah, he'd yell hat wearing geekaboy, which-

55
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,400
He'd call him hat wearing geekaboy, which I don't know.

56
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,240
Well, he was wearing a hat. To be fair, that gentleman was wearing a hat,

57
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,080
and he had sort of a geekaboy aura about him.

58
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,560
He was biting the heads off chickens.

59
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,640
Your friend, they don't sound like a really dope friend,

60
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,840
because you don't want to room with them.

61
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,880
So I would say, like, if you had a stratosphere of friends,

62
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,000
they're in the, not in the upper stratosphere,

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,520
I would say they're in the lower, sort of our earthbound stratosphere.

64
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,320
So just tell him straight up, because if you hurt his feelings,

65
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,520
you don't seem to like him that much. Right? I mean, does that make sense?

66
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,280
I'm sitting here, like, racking my mind, trying to come up with a sentence,

67
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,320
especially now that you've waited. Like, he's brought it up,

68
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,080
and you said, let me think about it.

69
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,120
Oh, no. Yeah.

70
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,360
Yeah. Like, you come back and go, listen, I thought about it,

71
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,040
and no, there's nothing worse than that situation you proposed.

72
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,000
Like, I can't come up with something to say that makes that not awkward.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,480
I mull it over in my mouth like a jawbreaker,

74
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,680
and what it comes out with is just sour in the inside.

75
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,800
Oh, God. This is not good.

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,320
This tastes like dirty dishes.

77
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,440
I have literally asked everyone I know,

78
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,760
and everyone thinks you would be a terrible roommate.

79
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,040
It's out of my hands now. It's in the hands of the people.

80
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,960
That's it. Tell them you took a vote,

81
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,000
and the vote came out against him, and there's nothing you can do about it.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,080
I took an American Idol-style vote,

83
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,040
and everyone dialed the number that said not to live with you.

84
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,960
I think, I don't know, I think you can explain to him.

85
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,800
I think that there's a really big difference

86
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,040
between being a good friend and a good roommate,

87
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,240
and you can just explain to him,

88
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,080
like, I don't think that we would be compatible roommates.

89
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,600
I don't think we'd get along as roommates,

90
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,840
but we can still be, you know, good friends.

91
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,880
I honestly think that the only way to go is to say,

92
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,040
listen, I really value our friendship,

93
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,040
and I know that sometimes living with someone can affect that friendship,

94
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,400
and I don't want to risk that.

95
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
That's great. That's just what I was going to say.

96
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,520
Like, oh, everybody I know that's roomed with somebody has ended up hating him,

97
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,440
and you're too important to me to that.

98
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,920
Yeah, and make sure you say it in the gayest way possible, too.

99
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,400
Just like, you're so important to me and my life.

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,320
Like, you really love him so much.

101
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,200
And then give him a suckle bub, just to put a little boo on it.

102
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,680
A little rivet in that one.

103
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,640
My best friend wants to experiment and try meeting some men.

104
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,360
There's a great gay club up the street from me,

105
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
and I want to take him there to help him out.

106
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,040
Two things, I'm straight and I've never been a wingman before.

107
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,080
An orientation isn't really a problem.

108
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,840
Been there a few times with my girlfriend, had a great time.

109
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,320
What I need is some advice on how to be a great wingman.

110
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,640
There are some rules I should know, no matter what the situation,

111
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,000
or does the scenario require something more specific?

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,240
That's from trying to help in Jersey.

113
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,680
I think the rules for being a great wingman are universal,

114
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,200
no matter what the situation is.

115
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,120
And they're pretty simple.

116
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,600
Like, in my opinion, the main job of a wingman is to be interesting enough,

117
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,280
but not more interesting than the person you're wingman-ing for.

118
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,000
Like, you are a facilitator of the conversation for that friend.

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,480
Have either of you ever wingman-ed, wingman-ed,

120
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,680
and A, ever tried, B, ever been successful?

121
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,920
I was once or twice in college.

122
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,240
I'm not very good at it, because I'm very competitive when it comes to being interesting.

123
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,000
And you're just so awesome that everyone wants you to be.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,760
Well, you know, Griffin, I'm not gonna say no to that.

125
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,600
I think the big...

126
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,680
If this listener's experience turns out anything like the ones that I've been a wingman,

127
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,440
this might conclude with him making out in the bathroom with a fat guy.

128
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,120
And I think you need to prepare yourself sort of mentally and spiritually for that very real,

129
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,040
very frightening possibility.

130
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,440
What am I doing?

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,280
This isn't worth it.

132
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,200
What steps did I take to get here?

133
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,320
I have another sort of angle that you need to consider on this.

134
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,760
You're a wingman leading gay men into a trap of a dude that may or may not be gay.

135
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,080
It's like a honey trap.

136
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,960
This is my friend...

137
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh, you bet it is.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,520
This is my friend Greg.

139
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,000
He thinks he might like dudes, but he's not sure.

140
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,360
You ready?

141
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,160
Let's discuss.

142
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,440
Ultimately, you're trying to provide evidence for him.

143
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,080
You're basically...

144
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,920
He's got a hypothesis that you're testing.

145
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,920
You're a bailiff in the court of love, and you're trying to swing your friend one way

146
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:47,600
or the other with as much sweet gay meat as you can procure.

147
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,160
That's your job.

148
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,720
So you're saying he needs to focus on quantity and not quality at this point?

149
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,800
Oh, well, I mean, you can do both.

150
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,760
Yeah, especially if it's a cool gay club.

151
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,000
I bet there's all kinds of fine, fine man meat there.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,240
Oh, it's like a fine man meat buffet.

153
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
It's like a golden corral of gay clubs.

154
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,280
It's like a shoney's breakfast of sweet gay dudes.

155
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,880
It's like a slaughterhouse.

156
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,520
Whoa.

157
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:13,760
Whoa.

158
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,680
Oh, that's a weird dip.

159
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,400
I just went of meat, like of all the meat shanks that are hanging around.

160
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,760
Come on down to the slaughterhouse.

161
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,120
Anything goes.

162
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,880
We'll punch your meat like in Rocky.

163
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
Hey, come on down to anything goes.

164
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,000
Slaughterhouse Saturdays.

165
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,440
God damn it.

166
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,680
Why haven't I opened up my own gay bar yet?

167
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,440
Why haven't you opened up all the gay bars?

168
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,040
I would change the name every week.

169
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,640
You know what?

170
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,360
I would love to open a gay club called Some Things Go.

171
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,200
It's the most restrained gay club.

172
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
Almost anything goes.

173
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,680
You want to go down to Some Things Go?

174
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,640
Oh, it's not that anymore.

175
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,000
Now it's called the Thirsty Snake.

176
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,000
Make your way down.

177
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,720
Red snake.

178
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,680
Griffey, you got an answer?

179
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,120
I got a few.

180
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,360
Got a handful.

181
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,960
That's rhetorical.

183
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,720
I know you probably came prepared.

184
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,200
I did.

185
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
I came correct and I came prepared.

186
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,880
How about this one?

187
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,800
This is going to open up an interesting dialogue.

188
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,360
This one was sent in by Atiana Kuriyama.

189
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,160
Thank you, Atiana.

190
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Edetweave who asks,

191
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,720
should the Bible be updated with online etiquette?

192
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,800
What?

193
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,440
That's all we get.

194
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,760
Well, we know how often the Bible is updated for things like radio etiquette and TV etiquette

195
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,600
and moving pictures etiquette.

196
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
So yes, of course it should.

197
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,240
Okay.

198
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,720
So now we know where Travis stands.

199
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,320
Thou shalt not lol with a man as I lols with a woman.

200
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,040
That's what you're saying, right?

201
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,440
Am I the only one?

202
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,600
Thou shalt not laugh at mean cats.

203
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,800
The three out of the three of us who thinks that it definitely,

204
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,560
definitely should be updated with online etiquette because everything that happens now,

205
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,240
anything that happens that's worth mentioning happens on cyberspace.

206
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,760
And Jesus spake.

207
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,840
Judas, thou shalt betray me.

208
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,760
And Judas spake. WTF?

209
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,400
Let's go with the story.

210
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,960
I will say this.

211
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,640
I think that I would only get behind this if they would make a few verses in there

212
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,600
where if you don't use punctuation, Satan himself would come up and drag you down to hell.

213
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:29,760
Sure.

214
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,840
He would come and swallow you up whole.

215
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,200
Thou shalt not read bee dogs once a day.

216
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,120
Every day. We can squeeze that into Leviticus

217
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,120
along with all the other sorta, some of the wackier laws.

218
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,880
Zanier.

219
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,400
Some of the zanier.

220
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,680
Bible's already pretty zany.

221
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:55,040
I bet you could slip in some online etiquette and not have too many people by line.

222
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,800
The thing is we would need to come up,

223
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,840
we would need to come up because obviously the internet wasn't around in the day of Jesus.

224
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:08,960
So what, what we would have to come up with a sort of archaic terminology for the internet

225
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,560
that, that people could read and sort of translate.

226
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,080
And I mean, Oh, Oh, that by this, they, they foresaw the internet.

227
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,440
This is how this applies.

228
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,720
Do you know what I'm saying?

229
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,360
Like it would have to be like the,

230
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,240
Like what?

231
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,120
Like a loom.

232
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,960
Like the loom.

233
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh my God.

234
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,360
If we start calling the internet, the loom, I will be on it way more because that's,

235
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,800
that's a cool metaphor right there.

236
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Just strings of pornography and

237
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,120
connecting anonymous strangers.

238
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:52,400
So it would say while, whilst thou looms don't do not thou shalt not whilst looming.

239
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:59,040
Thou shalt not forward emails about Obama destroyed the world's food reserves.

240
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,840
Not exactly.

241
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,640
We're talking specifically.

242
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,520
And Moses presented to his people the 10 commandments and they did respond T L D R.

243
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,320
Can we boil those down to five of them?

244
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,160
Maybe I, I spent, I, I don't, I don't get out much in the meat space.

245
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,960
Most of my time is, is online.

246
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,680
My online presence is strong.

247
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,920
I think that it would be nice to have some, some rules that we could teach to youngsters.

248
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,360
Something with some you know, some celestial might behind it.

249
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,880
Like if you, if you send someone a picture of your Dick online,

250
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,200
then, then there's going to be some retribution, some holy, holy retribution.

251
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,320
Uh, let's, let's, let's reconnoiter here, like an unrequested picture of your Dick.

252
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,720
Right?

253
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:50,880
Yeah.

254
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,000
Like if they want it, I think you'd be at a blessing.

255
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,560
I would think.

256
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,120
I think that it's time for the Bible to be updated.

257
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,840
So I'm saying, Hey Bible, give me the times.

258
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,200
Maybe, um, what would we call it?

259
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,040
The new Gawker version would be good.

260
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,520
This is the new, what are you reading?

261
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,680
Oh, it's the new Gawker version of the Bible.

262
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:09,920
Yeah.

263
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,800
It's got a, it's got a scroll bar on the side that everybody really hates.

264
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:21,840
But, uh, so listen, this week we mentioned it before is, is, uh, is max fun drive.

265
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,920
Uh, well, I think this is like a, it's like a, uh, and it's not a week.

266
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,280
It's a, an event.

267
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,560
It's like a Festravaganza, a two week festival.

268
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,760
Uh, we are trying to get new supporters for the max fun network.

269
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,560
And, and a lot of people wonder, well, what does that mean?

270
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,640
Well, basically it means you make a small donation as much as you could feel comfortable

271
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,680
affording anywhere from, we have donations starting at two all the way up to, uh, $200.

272
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,120
And we have some great, you know, prizes, prizes.

273
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,080
Like, you know, those are good.

274
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,880
I like prizes cause it makes you feel like you've won something.

275
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,520
You've won something.

276
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,360
It makes you feel like you're on Bozo's game show.

277
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,640
At the cheapest levels.

278
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,680
I mean, at every level, even the cheapest, you get, uh, some max fun stickers.

279
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,040
You get a maximum membership card.

280
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:14,000
Uh, you get, uh, access to bonus shows that we recorded sub podcast.

281
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,080
You have recorded, uh, Jordan, Jesse go recorded one.

282
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,960
And, uh, I believe there's a judge on Hodgman.

283
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:26,000
There is a bonus episode and there's three videos, the sort of like old timey

284
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,520
videos that we rift over.

285
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,480
Ours is called dating do's and don'ts.

286
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,520
And it contains basically any, any information you would ever need to, um,

287
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,960
secure the affection of, of a significant other.

288
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,920
It's all right there.

289
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,720
It's all right there.

290
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,520
And, um, and then as you go up, you get at $10.

291
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,680
We've got a tote bag for you that you will love.

292
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,000
Make sure you choose the right tote bag.

293
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,840
Um, and those tote bags are provided, uh, by eco bags.

294
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,480
Thank you very much.

295
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,880
You fucking shill get it together.

296
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,320
Travis, this is about tote bags, not about corporations.

297
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,080
And yeah, the ego bag folks are very, very kind, uh, to, to hook those up for us.

298
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,480
Um, as you go up $20, there's a cool one USB drive that has much shows on it.

299
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,480
$35 is, is my personal favorite.

300
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,160
It's the judge on Hodgman, uh, post-apocalyptic justice squad.

301
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,560
Is that right?

302
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,000
Have I, have I memorized that now?

303
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,440
It's ingrained in your mind.

304
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,560
It's ingrained in my mind.

305
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,120
You get a, like a boatload of stuff, uh, all the, the tote bags and all that stuff,

306
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:34,000
but, uh, like, uh, uh, the Eton am FM radio, uh, that it's like a full like nerd

307
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,880
emergency kit.

308
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,200
Yeah.

309
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,320
It is full on.

310
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,640
It's called a nerd emergency kit, which is boom, shakalaka.

311
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,680
Uh, and, and it goes up from there and, and the money that you give.

312
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,480
And I think maybe we didn't make this super clear for people last week.

313
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,000
The money that you give, uh, goes to the maximum fund network and then

314
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,640
the maximum fund network then in turn pays the people who make the shows.

315
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,200
So when you give to us and when you give the maximum network, you're saying.

316
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,720
I want to support Jordan, Jesse go and judge on Hodgman and, uh, my brother,

317
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,520
my brother, me.

318
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,080
And then that money goes back to us and we use it to, uh, we buy equipment

319
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,720
for the show.

320
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,680
We bought, we, uh, pay for hosting for the show.

321
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,760
Cause we have a lot more people downloading it now.

322
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,160
It would get pretty, uh, tough.

323
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,880
In the future.

324
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,480
Like I know that we've had people that have asked about, you know, live shows

325
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,720
and convention appearances and stuff like that.

326
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,480
That kind of thing is now a possibility because of our joining the max fund

327
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:32,880
network.

328
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,000
These are things that we're hoping to do in the future with support from

329
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,960
listeners like you.

330
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,520
Right.

331
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,760
They've really helped us to grow and to get the word, the message out to more

332
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,440
people, which I know is what you want.

333
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,560
I know that deep down that's, that's, that's what you, you want everybody to

334
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,120
be.

335
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,120
You don't want anybody to miss out on the, on the experience, the teachings.

336
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,760
I would say that you have had.

337
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,840
So if you can, and if you're comfortable doing it, if you're not and you can't

338
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,200
afford it, I get it.

339
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,600
I do.

340
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,560
I honestly, I mean, we have, and we love you just the same.

341
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,680
We'll never stop loving you.

342
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,400
Um, but, but if you can do something, uh, go to HTTP.

343
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,400
You got to include that.

344
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,560
It's forward slash forward slash www dot maximum fund.org forward slash donate.

345
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,640
And, uh, you can give there and you will feel better about it.

346
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,920
And as if to add, uh, make it more tantalizing, Jesse, our boss has drawn a

347
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,200
boner shaped thermometer quite accidentally, I think, but he did actually like he did

348
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
will the thermoboner into existence.

349
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,920
But as you give it just fills up.

350
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,320
So your generosity is just stroking it.

351
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,840
Like I want to see it get full.

352
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,360
Well, you've gotten a ton of, um, of one-time donations and those are awesome.

353
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,600
Uh, but we're, we're, we're shooting for 1200, uh, donors.

354
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,520
And for those, those are the, the monthly totals.

355
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,880
So, uh, yeah.

356
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,720
Anything you can give also monthly donors.

357
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,880
We have, uh, we have challenge donors as well.

358
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,040
So every new monthly donor we get the challenge donors chip in an extra, uh, $5 66 and a half

359
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,000
cents, which is still just such a ridiculous number.

360
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,400
Um, so, so any amount you give us a monthly donor, we get that extra, that extra bonus

361
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,720
too.

362
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,160
So, you know, just think about that.

363
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,480
Cause, cause that the, the monthly donors would keep MaxFund afloat and, and help us

364
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,960
reach that, that's the sweet, sweet tip of the Thermaboner.

365
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,000
Also, you know, people said that I only listen to you guys and I'm not interested in MaxFund,

366
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,280
you know, supporting the whole network.

367
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,000
First off, they've been a huge help to us.

368
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,040
Second off, uh, you should go listen to all the shows.

369
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,880
Third off, when you say that we are your favorite show, when you donate, uh, that, that helps

370
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,000
us out a lot.

371
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,400
Um, that, that first, I mean, for, for nothing else other than Pride at the very least, then

372
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,880
it's because I want to crush everybody else.

373
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,240
I want them to know our names, I guess is what I'm saying.

374
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,720
I want them to be ashamed of their poor ass fans.

375
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
I want them to quiver.

376
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,800
I want them to quiver at your riches.

377
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,200
God, my brother and my brother and me, they are rich.

378
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,560
They've got some rich fans.

379
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,040
I'm afraid of them.

380
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,680
They've got some Scrooge McDuck action going on.

381
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,600
Plus, if all of you give and you say that my brother made your favorite show, we can

382
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,280
go back to Jesse and be like, hey man, what's up with that cheddar?

383
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,200
Let's get, see if we can't.

384
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,720
Maybe next time you cut a little bit off for your boys, maybe you use the bigger knife,

385
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,600
if you know what I mean.

386
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:21,920
Yeah.

387
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,040
Get, slide a little more C-O-I-N our way.

388
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,400
We are trying to drown in Velveeta over here.

389
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,640
Some of us are trying to get so cheesy and we just need a little help.

390
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,800
I would say dangerously cheesy.

391
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,760
Help make some McElroy nachos.

392
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,000
How about some McElroy and cheese, if you don't mind.

393
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,800
Notch bros.

394
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,040
Notch bros.

395
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,000
Notch bros.

396
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,640
Cheesing it up.

397
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,720
So anyway, we've taken enough of your valuable time, but if you can, maximumfund.org first

398
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,280
slash donate.

399
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,600
Thank you.

400
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,760
That is our message to you.

401
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,360
I am having a hard time saving money and spending it wisely, ironically.

402
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,960
I'm 23 years old and already money is a big obstacle in life.

403
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,040
Do you guys have any tips or tricks for a would-be Feruga-lite?

404
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,720
Jake, if you figure it out, please let me know.

405
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,240
Send that memo around, Jake.

406
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,160
Circulate that, that knowledge.

407
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,760
I don't, I don't get it, guys.

408
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,440
What do you mean?

409
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,280
We've gotten this question before and I don't, here's what you do, Jake.

410
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:36,640
If you're about to spend money on something, just don't do, don't do it.

411
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640
Go do something else instead.

412
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,080
Here's the problem, and for me personally, and I'm going to assume that Jake is in the

413
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,800
same boat I am, the ebb and flow of money is like the tide where between paychecks,

414
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,960
as soon as I get paid, it's like high tide and I'm so excited that I'm like, yeah,

415
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,120
fuck it, I'm rich and like, I'll go and that's when I buy groceries and then I go,

416
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:04,400
I pay my bills and then I go out drinking and then by like two days before the next

417
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,280
paycheck, it's low tide and I'm so sad for two days and I can't do anything.

418
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,800
I can't even afford a cup of coffee.

419
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,400
But then it's paycheck time again and I'm so excited that I rush out and spend all my

420
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,440
money and it's just, it's kind of that hills and valleys.

421
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,840
Hey Scraps, hey Scraps, we know why it's fucked up.

422
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,360
I think he's pretty well aware of how it feels to be shitty at this.

423
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,520
Like, I don't think, but here's my advice.

424
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,960
There's a narration on that.

425
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,200
Never stop pretending like you're broke because as soon as you get that high of like

426
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
a paycheck, you go and you spend it.

427
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,440
Like, yeah, if you can say that in like your sense memory, like remember what it feels

428
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,160
like, that shitty feeling of like, I can't do anything.

429
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,320
I am so broke right now.

430
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,080
If you can like capture that and hold on to it in a crystal, maybe in like a talisman

431
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,280
that you keep around your neck.

432
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,800
Travis, can you give me an analogy for what a crimson tide would be?

433
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,720
A crimson tide is like when you become an assassin and all your money is from killing

434
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,200
people.

435
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,880
So the blood just rolls into this.

436
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,320
And the blood money.

437
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,320
I thought it would have something to do with when you don't have any money and also a bunch

438
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,760
of poisonous krill somehow washes up in your...

439
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,280
Krill humor.

440
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,040
A little something for everybody this week.

441
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,000
That's what I was gonna say.

442
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,960
Jake, I like, I've started using the internet a lot for this and I think I might've given

443
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,240
this pro tip before, but whatever.

444
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,120
Defer your gratification.

445
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,920
Get in that habit.

446
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,920
You see something in the store that you want to buy, just say to yourself, like, hey, I

447
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,440
bet it's cheaper on Amazon.

448
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,600
And then by the time you get home, you'll forget about it.

449
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,400
Guaranteed.

450
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,920
I know, at least I know I do.

451
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,200
There's too much good stuff to...

452
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,640
Also, it's really tempting.

453
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,600
Like it's, I find it personally hard to pay for the things I know I have to pay for.

454
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,640
And I instead want to buy the things I want to buy.

455
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:03,120
And so if you get paid and immediately like pay your bills, pay rent, pay your rent, pay

456
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,920
rent, pay, you know, off credit cards, anything like that, like immediately don't wait.

457
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:13,200
And then whenever money is left over, try to save that or try to use that money for

458
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,840
fun things.

459
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,760
Because if you spend your money on fun things first, you're gonna spend your sweet bill

460
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,720
money and you're not gonna be able to pay for, you know, your car and stuff.

461
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,360
Sell your teeth.

462
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,360
Sell your teeth.

463
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,240
Just sell those teeth.

464
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,880
There it is.

465
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,080
You got beautiful teeth there.

466
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,440
You selling?

467
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,720
Could I talk you out of those teeth for...

468
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,520
I don't know.

469
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,240
Cool hundo?

470
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,520
Nice chompers.

471
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,240
Want some cheddar?

472
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,120
My dearest, my brother, my brother, me.

473
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,480
I found myself in a predicament I've never been in before.

474
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,400
I've fallen in love with someone several magnitudes less intelligent than me.

475
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,000
I'm not going to laugh at this person.

476
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,680
I'm making this pledge to myself.

477
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,520
I'm not going to make cruel jokes at their expense.

478
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,720
I'm telling myself this mantra before I really raise the question.

479
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,200
Here we go.

480
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,520
We've been dating for five months and our relationship is absolutely wonderful.

481
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,400
However, I'm afraid you're using words you probably doesn't know.

482
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,160
Or making references to things not found on The Real Housewives in fellow figure.

483
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,800
Feel dumb.

484
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,360
Fuck you.

485
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,000
Can this relationship actually work out?

486
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,440
Thank you.

487
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,760
Dumbfounded in Indiana.

488
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,040
A follow up question.

489
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,560
Dear my brother, my brother and me.

490
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,640
I've recently started dating a guy who thinks he's much, much smarter than me.

491
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,800
He's a real dullard and an asshole, but...

492
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,600
Oh, shit, man.

493
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,520
Oh, man.

494
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,200
Oh, man.

495
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,840
Listen, of course, by default, this is a problem that we can't help but enter into.

496
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,280
Just because of our station.

497
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,720
I'm just going to dip my toe in there.

498
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:39,680
Yeah.

499
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,480
I love you so much, you fucking dummy.

500
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,440
Like, how does that work out?

501
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,720
You dullard.

502
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,280
I love you.

503
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,120
Love you, stupid.

504
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,640
Now, are you saying she's dull?

505
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,520
Like, she's dumb?

506
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,080
Like, she often runs into walls and you have to point her towards the door?

507
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,440
Or like, she just doesn't read the big fancy books you read?

508
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,320
He didn't say, he didn't say several IQ points less.

509
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,120
He said several magnitudes less.

510
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,400
The light from his star would take a million years to get to her earth.

511
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,360
I think is what he's saying.

512
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,120
I mean, if she's...

513
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,240
Let's get this out there.

514
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,800
If it's right, and you know what I'm talking about.

515
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,280
If that's right, then a lot of this stuff will work.

516
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,320
What do you, what do you mean?

517
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:26,880
What's right?

518
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,320
Like, you know, I don't want, I'm a gentleman.

519
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,680
Like that front, like that front meet?

520
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,160
It's that front meet is so right and so dope.

521
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,360
Then a lot of these things will sort of pan out.

522
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,640
Like, it's like, oh, that's a really fascinating story about what Gordon Ramsay's into this week.

523
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,800
I'm going to go ahead and bone you now.

524
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,520
Is that cool?

525
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,000
Can we skip to that?

526
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,840
I'm going to bet that in any relationship, there's always a balance.

527
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,720
And I'm going to bet that there is some way that she is massively better than you.

528
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,520
And it bounds that I'm betting she is supremely more attractive than you.

529
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,200
And you're supremely smarter.

530
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,320
You ugly fuck.

531
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,040
That's the balance right there.

532
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,840
This is fun.

533
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,440
I like this question.

534
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,040
Well, this question got a little mean, but I think, I think that we're just trying to bring you back down to reality.

535
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,120
Listen to this.

536
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,480
We're several magnitudes smarter than you, and we still let you listen to our show.

537
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,520
Exactly.

538
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,720
Think about that.

539
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,920
Because we've been trained in the arts of wisdom for many, many years.

540
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:38,160
So we know basically everything, despite what Bob Ball, our announcer, would have you believe.

541
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,520
Maybe she's street smart.

542
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,160
Ooh, I like that.

543
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,640
Does she spend a lot of time on the street?

544
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Like you lose your wallet and she says, it ain't no thing.

545
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,600
I'll go shake down Huggy Bear.

546
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,760
See what the word is.

547
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,320
From Starsky and Hutch?

548
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,760
No, but the new Starsky and Hutch.

549
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,200
I'm 30 years old.

550
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,640
What do you want from me?

551
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,680
Yeah, it's for the new one.

552
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,400
That's what I was.

553
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,280
Thank you, Travis.

554
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,400
That's what I'm talking about.

555
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,880
Can you tell me who played Huggy Bear in the new Starsky and Hutch?

556
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,440
Snoop Dogg.

557
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,480
That'd be Snoop Dogg.

558
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:10,880
Well done.

559
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,360
Well done.

560
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,080
Come on.

561
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,560
Come on.

562
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,640
It's my first time through Rodeo.

563
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,760
Maybe if you hang out with her long enough, she'll learn some shit.

564
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:18,880
Yeah.

565
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,400
Oh, but dear sweet God, do not approach it.

566
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,160
Like, I'm going to better you.

567
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,080
Oh, God, no.

568
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,000
I know you're lucky to be dating me, stupid.

569
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
I think we're planning on going on a date.

570
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,080
How would you feel about a tutoring session instead?

571
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,920
The rain in Spain falls mainly in the plains.

572
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,000
This is fun.

573
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,360
Isn't this better than a movie?

574
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,160
I think it is.

575
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,360
Well, no, sit back down.

576
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,960
We only have a few more hours left, but.

577
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,640
Oh, it looks like you got a 62 on your test.

578
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,280
So no, we can't watch Real Housewives tonight.

579
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,880
Sorry, sweetie.

580
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,400
It's a reward system and I got to adhere to it.

581
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,560
I think the absolute worst thing you can do and just the thing that you should avoid doing,

582
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:11,840
no matter what, is to write into an internet comedy program telling them how stupid your

583
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,560
girlfriend is.

584
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,280
Because I don't care how dumb she is.

585
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,800
She ain't too dumb to read the internet.

586
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,640
Yahoo Answers proves that out every single week.

587
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,140
Yep.

588
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,800
Griffin.

589
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,360
You want one?

590
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,200
Speaking of which, I got a taste.

591
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,700
I said it.

592
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,680
I got a taste for it in my mouth.

593
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,760
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker.

594
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,720
Thank you, Jacob.

595
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,080
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jerry Has Lion King.

596
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,120
Congratulations, Jerry.

597
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,840
Good work, Jerry.

598
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,480
Good job, Jerry.

599
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,440
I knew you'd afford it.

600
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,920
Who asks, what would happen if I knock out the pizza guy?

601
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,440
What if I'm running low on cash, but I'm really hungry?

602
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,800
What if three of my friends are at my house and we ordered pizza?

603
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,440
We have no cash and we called the pizza guy.

604
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,480
I'm wondering what would happen.

605
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,840
This is, for all intents and purposes, the perfect crime.

606
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,880
Can we agree on that?

607
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,320
I don't think there's any way this goes wrong.

608
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,000
How is the pizza guy supposed to track him down with just his name, telephone number,

609
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,800
and address?

610
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,680
Also, the pizza guy's going to wake up from the ground and be like, what just happened?

611
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,600
This mystery's never going to get solved.

612
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,800
He also knows your pizza preferences, too.

613
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,320
So the top of the jugs.

614
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,760
Can you describe him?

615
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,880
No, but I can tell you what kind of toppings he asked for on his pizza.

616
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,040
Can you describe the man who assaulted you?

617
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,880
Well, this is his name and his phone number and his address.

618
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
And also, he likes pineapples on his pizza.

619
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,800
And he asked me to draw a wizard on the bottom.

620
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,400
He asked me to draw a wizard on the box.

621
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,240
He's a Chovies and Pep man.

622
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:53,040
So you could just look for people ordering Chovies and Pep on their pizza and just arrest

623
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,240
them.

624
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,760
I want to know what kind of beefcake pizza guy you've got that you need three of your

625
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,440
friends to take care of.

626
00:30:59,440 --> 00:30:59,680
Yeah.

627
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,720
Waiting in the bushes, one on top of the roof.

628
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,000
He'll never see it coming.

629
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,960
See, what's disturbing is that if you ordered this pizza online, you could track it.

630
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
You could track who is delivering your pizza.

631
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,920
You could get a name.

632
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,080
That makes it more personal.

633
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,960
Shouldn't have brought that pizza, Derek.

634
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,280
Punch.

635
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,280
We're waiting for you, Derek.

636
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,760
Hope you get here quick.

637
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,520
Is there any other...

638
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,320
I've always wondered if you ordered a pizza from a dude and he looks a little dogged.

639
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,440
He looks a little tired.

640
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,360
What if you just invited him in?

641
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,880
It's like, hey, I'm not going to pay for this pizza.

642
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,040
But do you want to chill with us and eat this pizza with us?

643
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,720
Do you want to zomp with us?

644
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,440
And then when he's really full, you kill him and make a pizza out of him.

645
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,440
And then you eat that pizza.

646
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,720
Then it's the perfect crime.

647
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,120
Double pizza.

648
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,280
You guys want to hear a true delivery story?

649
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,160
Double pizza.

650
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,440
I don't know, Travis.

651
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,000
You tell me.

652
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,080
I worked for a...

653
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,280
I don't want to give the name, so what to say, a popular sandwich delivery restaurant

654
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,840
who may or may not be known for being freaky fast.

655
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,200
Let's call it Johnny Jacks.

656
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,800
Johnny Jacks.

657
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:13,200
I worked for Johnny Jacks and it was around the corner from my friend Trevor David's house.

658
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,840
And Trevor David would call during parties and order sandwiches so I could deliver a

659
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,400
sandwich and take a shot and then go back to work because I was not able to attend the party.

660
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,440
Good for you.

661
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,720
And so I would often deliver, I don't know, six or seven sandwiches a night back to that house.

662
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,860
Travis.

663
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,080
Living the life you want.

664
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,480
Getting blitzed to Jimmy Jacks.

665
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,720
Johnny Jacks, please.

666
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,080
Your older brother, Travis Griffin.

667
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,600
There's your role model.

668
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,600
You just, by saying that on the internet, you've been blackballed.

669
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,160
You can never work at another Johnny Jacks ever again.

670
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,000
You can never go back home.

671
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,520
Time out.

672
00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:01,600
Travis, are you telling me that you're becoming a progressively drunker driver as the night went on?

673
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,320
No, no, no.

674
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,120
It was literally down the alley from the Johnny Jacks.

675
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,360
I would walk the sandwich there and walk back.

676
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,240
But that drunkenness, I don't know if you know how drunk works, it stays with you for a while.

677
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,560
So if somebody did call in an order, you'd be like, guys, I want to get your sloppy mess to you.

678
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,960
But I'm fucked.

679
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,440
I messed up.

680
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:30,720
Hey, Jimmy Jacks, can I get a, let me just get a salami grand slam.

681
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,920
Um, dog, can you, what is on it?

682
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,280
Dog, please come here and make it.

683
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,160
I'm so fucked up.

684
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,360
Where's the bread?

685
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,320
Where do we keep it?

686
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,400
That does make ordering a sandwich a lot more exciting, though.

687
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,560
So there we go.

688
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,640
I hope that helps out.

689
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:55,040
My wife just realized that my favorite hat has the phone number of an ex-girlfriend inside the brim.

690
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,080
She did not buy it.

691
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,480
I did not have paper when I met her.

692
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,480
She did not buy it.

693
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,160
I did not have paper when I met her.

694
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,360
Should I throw the hat away?

695
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,360
Hey, Gmail, I don't know you very well, but I'm going to play law of averages and say that if

696
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:19,040
you're a man between, well, let's say 18 and 35, you should throw the hat away.

697
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,440
Yeah.

698
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,280
You should probably not wear it.

699
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,720
What was the, what was the thought process there?

700
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,240
I want to know the steps that got you from point A to point I'm going to write on my hat.

701
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,200
If decapitated, please call.

702
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,160
It just seems to me like there's so many, there's so many options.

703
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,120
Oh, I know.

704
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,520
There's your hand first and foremost.

705
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,120
I'd rather have it written on my face cause I can wash my face.

706
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,680
Yeah.

707
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,760
Did the ex-girlfriend write it on the inside brim?

708
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,760
Cause if so, that would be kind of a baller way of like, I'm in you.

709
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,920
Like you'll never forget this number.

710
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,800
Wait, when you say in like a bottom of the brim, are you talking about like

711
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,840
the flat bill of the hat you've written it or like inside the hat?

712
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,480
Ooh, that's a good point because if it's on the brim and you go to a NASCAR event

713
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,480
and you get sweaty, then that number is going to be on you backwards.

714
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,680
Backwards?

715
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,040
Hey listener, how bad are you at wives that you couldn't lie better than this?

716
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,320
Oh, this is the number at the hat company.

717
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,360
It's a hat store.

718
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,440
This is the customer service number.

719
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,400
It's the hat store.

720
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:24,720
Please.

721
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,720
We're trying to post for a family photo.

722
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:26,960
Please.

723
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,880
Hey lids, we need to have a talk about your hat.

724
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,320
I'm having some problems with it.

725
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,120
I think it's low on coolant.

726
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,960
Your hat is malfunctioning.

727
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
I'm having a malfunctioning hat problem.

728
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,560
And luckily I wrote the number of your, of your emporium, of your haberdashery

729
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,920
in, in just in case I needed to contact you about a defective product.

730
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,480
You don't tell her it's your girlfriend, listener.

731
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,480
You should throw the hat away as punishment.

732
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,520
That's your penance for being so stupid.

733
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,920
You own a hat with, that someone has written on.

734
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,840
Why haven't you already thrown it away?

735
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,720
Listen, we can lead, we can lead you guys to walk away.

736
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,040
You guys to water, but you got to lie to your wives for yourself.

737
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,800
We can only do so much for you.

738
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,160
I'm a native Texan who recently relocated to Melbourne, Australia for love.

739
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,560
And I'm at a linguistic crossroads.

740
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,320
People down here say mate all the time, like in the movies.

741
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,520
And I can't make myself do it.

742
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,000
I knew it.

743
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,640
I say man in the same way.

744
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,160
Like, Hey, thanks, man.

745
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,440
And then really fly down under.

746
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,920
Should I assimilate or should I shake them haters off?

747
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,680
Linguistic blunder down under a name created by Travis.

748
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,400
Um, right.

749
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,200
So my experience with this is that if you live in another country for any sort of extended

750
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,840
period of time, you know, like Madonna, you will eventually start to pick up some of their,

751
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,720
um, what idiosyncrasies.

752
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,000
What's the, what's the, what's the length of time?

753
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,160
What is the appropriate length of time?

754
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,760
Because I had friends in school who would go to a foreign country, come back two weeks

755
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,440
later and had completely reinvented themselves.

756
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,880
Just a completely different person.

757
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,320
Travel changes you, Griffin.

758
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,200
You know what?

759
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,680
You know what?

760
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,240
I'm almost certain that is only a problem in America.

761
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:16,800
Oh, absolutely.

762
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,320
I'd be willing to bet that English people don't come to America for two weeks and come

763
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,880
back on.

764
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,840
Well, how do y'all like, I promise that.

765
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,600
Oh, I bet they probably do.

766
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,720
It's America.

767
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,480
Like I would want everybody to know.

768
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,840
What's the length of time though?

769
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,880
I'm going to say anything less than two years.

770
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,000
And you're just being a dick.

771
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:41,040
Well, I think that once you pass a certain age, like if you're older than 22, you shouldn't

772
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,680
like you, you have formed your accent.

773
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,720
Shouldn't change.

774
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,800
I lived in a third world country with Sydney for a month and I did come back really hungry.

775
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,920
I don't know if that counts.

776
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:58,000
Um, and all your t-shirts were like a rat from 1985.

777
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I think that I think that you should soak it up.

778
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,760
I think you should say mate because I think everybody wants to say mate.

779
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,920
But, um, just if, if I hear anyone say mate that is not from Australia or the British

780
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,880
Isles, um, I get the strongest douche chills that I just want to fall to the ground and

781
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,920
shake uncontrollably.

782
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,200
Well, my friend Miranda is from Australia and she says like, good day mate and stuff

783
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,520
like that.

784
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,160
And it makes me, I still roll my eyes at it cause it's like, come on, you're in America.

785
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,160
You know, I think that you can import that language.

786
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,360
I think you can export it if you've been there long enough, but I just think it has

787
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,000
to be authentic.

788
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,920
And it sounds like you have the opportunity to, to make it authentic.

789
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,880
Well, let me tell you something.

790
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,560
I'll give you the same advice that I gave Miranda.

791
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,920
I told Miranda the beauty that you get from being from a foreign country, now an expat

792
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,440
living in another country, you can make up words and pretend like it's really common

793
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,400
phrases in America and be like, Oh yeah, we're just going to go flibble the doable.

794
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,200
And when they're like, what?

795
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,080
I'm like, Oh, sorry.

796
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,360
You guys don't have that here.

797
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,000
You know what I mean?

798
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,200
And like, those are little things that you can do to make yourself happy and make everyone

799
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,240
else think you're an asshole.

800
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,640
So many of my suggestions end up that way.

801
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,280
Don't Travis basically runs an asshole charm school.

802
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,720
It's going to go one way or the other.

803
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,680
Have you guys noticed how many listeners we have in Australia?

804
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,640
Yeah.

805
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,600
There's a lot, right?

806
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
And they're all super attractive.

807
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,960
They all, they all have a crocodile Dundee set.

808
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,400
Yeah.

809
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,400
And there's, they're very tolerant of being compared to Paul Hogan.

810
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,440
Well, they surprise you over all these years.

811
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,800
I, you have to have thick skin.

812
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,040
Uh, I, I'm coming to realize like a crocodile, I'm coming to realize that I'm maybe more

813
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,440
into live music than any of my friends or at least the only one into it enough to pay

814
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,600
a non-refundable $250 on a drunken whim to go to Bonnaroo this year.

815
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,360
I know at least Griffin is into music festivals, but if any of you had advice on a first time

816
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,480
attendee with seems like no backup, I'd really appreciate it.

817
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,560
Alternatively, what is the best way to guilt convince my friends into going with me?

818
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:04,960
Will G.

819
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,720
Griffin.

820
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,280
Hoo boy.

821
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,960
Help this man.

822
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,440
I haven't gone to Bonnaroo for two years, I think.

823
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,080
Last time I went was yeah, 2009.

824
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,840
I don't, this is not important.

825
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:23,760
Um, what you need to realize is that you're not just spending $250.

826
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:33,600
You're spending a week without shower, which if I were to apply a sort of a monetary sum

827
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,800
to that, I would say that that, like the grief that you suffer is worth at least $600, like

828
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,160
600 additional dollars.

829
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,640
Does that include like the shame of bathing in a fountain?

830
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,720
They don't even let you do that anymore.

831
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,000
Oh, Jesus.

832
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,880
There is a fountain, but you can't bring soap or shampoo into it.

833
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,400
Um, it's, it's, it's a, it's an endurance sport.

834
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,360
Depending on which one you go to, like there, there are some music festivals that are, for

835
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,360
instance, there's Pitchfork and here in Chicago and Lollapalooza here in Chicago, where I

836
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,600
can just go to those and then come home and sleep in my bed.

837
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,320
Like those are awesome.

838
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,280
And everyone should definitely go.

839
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,320
You should go to Bonnaroo too.

840
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,440
You just need to go ahead and realize that it's, there's toils.

841
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,400
It's rough stuff because it's 110, 110 degrees all the time.

842
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,680
And there's nothing you can do.

843
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,600
Like there's nowhere you can go to, to seek respite from that.

844
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:26,560
And what I remember from Griffin telling me is that to get in and get out, like plan on

845
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,960
a solid like half day of being in traffic and then last time campsite.

846
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,800
Last time I went and it took me 10 hours, uh, waiting in line to, to get in.

847
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,760
It was, it was a nightmare.

848
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,400
I only have one Bonnaroo pro tip to share with you.

849
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,280
What's up?

850
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,720
This is a frequent attendee.

851
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,600
Uh, don't be the guy who gets hit by the bus every year.

852
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,680
There's a guy and he's like, I don't know if he's hanging out.

853
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,720
He's hanging out.

854
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,000
He drops some, some opium and he's wondering who the, through the sound garden and then

855
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,120
what happens.

856
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,520
And then through the band sound garden, he hangs out with the band sound garden.

857
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,160
And then he, as they're leaving, he's waving goodbye.

858
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,640
Goodbye.

859
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,840
Sound garden.

860
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,200
Thank you for hanging out with me.

861
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,520
Oops.

862
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,360
I dropped my opium bus.

863
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:17,280
Like that once a year, there's a guy who gets hit by a bus and you just can't just don't

864
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,560
be that guy.

865
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,600
Don't be bus guy.

866
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,000
And if you hear about a guy getting hit by a bus, whoa, fucking chill out.

867
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,760
Like do whatever you're invincible.

868
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,120
Every year, every year a man does get hit by a bus.

869
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,680
And every year, shortly after that news hit that AP news wire, I would get a call from

870
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,080
my dad just to make sure it wasn't me.

871
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,640
Thanks dad.

872
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,160
And you're like, Hey, you, Hey, stop going.

873
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,960
Griffin stopped going to Bonnaroo cause he knew his number was up.

874
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,200
Were you the one who jumped in front of that bus, you big dummy?

875
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,080
Like, no dad, I have, I got sense in my head.

876
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,240
First of all, to get Bonnaroo takes place on a giant campground to get to a place where

877
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:52,960
buses are.

878
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,320
That's a journey.

879
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,360
That's a walk.

880
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,320
Like that's, that's a good couple of miles.

881
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,160
Oh, Bonnaroo, come for the music.

882
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,760
Stay to see the herd fin.

883
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,840
If you're floating on ope, if you're floating on ope, if ope floats, which is what I refer

884
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,720
to taking opium, you're not going to have the mental faculties required to find road.

885
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,280
Don't be dumb.

886
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,800
Don't be dumb.

887
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,480
Hey, listen, we wanted to say one last time before we go into the final stretch of the

888
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:22,720
show.

889
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,440
One last thing though.

890
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,400
What?

891
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,160
I did get prostatitis at Bonnaroo.

892
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,520
Okay.

893
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,160
Real talk.

894
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,240
Just watch your prostate cause it's going to try and do some shitty shit.

895
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,440
It's going to try and catch it.

896
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,880
It's going to come at you from all sides.

897
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:41,600
Um, so that's, that was worth, I would say $25,000 just hidden costs, hidden costs.

898
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,480
Keep them in mind.

899
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:42,800
Okay.

900
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,680
Hidden costs, uh, before we, before we head into the final rush, I did want to say thank

901
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,480
you so much to the people who've already supported us this week, uh, during the Maximum Fund

902
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,040
Pledge Drive, uh, we're, we're, our goal is 1200 new donors.

903
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:03,840
We have crossed 400 last night, so we're, we're on pace, uh, but we need you specifically

904
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:10,000
you, yes, you, uh, sitting at home, listening to this, driving, not driving, wait till you're

905
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,320
where you're going.

906
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:17,120
But, uh, I just want to say thank you to people like Dan Stapleton who gave, uh, our boss

907
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:24,640
and dear friend Chris Grant gave, um, LMM not only gave, but convinced his dad who's

908
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,160
only listened to one episode to give kind of a big coup.

909
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,880
I would like to say a special thanks because he, he tried to come up with a question and

910
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,360
he couldn't.

911
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:38,880
So he asked that we say this because he donated and I'm willing to give this to him.

912
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,000
Hey, Scott and Pocatello, you're doing all right.

913
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,120
Your kids love you.

914
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,840
And there's a lady out there who's itching to get down with you.

915
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,960
All right, Scott, chin up, buddy.

916
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,400
And in case you think he's not an OG over on the, the Maximum Fund Pledge Drive, we

917
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,440
have a D Hurry.

918
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:02,560
Yes, we are just 정말 the only people at vraiment how we can get our people to get

919
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,360
involved.

920
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,360
I'll ask reaping to get on there.

921
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:22,020
Literally, there's a whole bunch of federal

922
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,320
companies in our country that have access to information.

923
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,820
on Twitter.

924
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:26,660
Did you?

925
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,780
I did, and I promised spooning.

926
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,980
Oh shit, I'll spoon somebody.

927
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,960
Five minutes of spooning, your choice.

928
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,280
You wanna be big spoon, you wanna be little spoon?

929
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,240
Do you wanna be middle spoon?

930
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,080
Do you wanna be two average size?

931
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,520
If you ever find the three of us together,

932
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,240
we can do a four-way spoon.

933
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,080
Oh my God.

934
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,120
No, we can't actually.

935
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,960
We cannot do that.

936
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,940
We will make a full-on silverware drawer on you.

937
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,520
We cannot do that thing that you just said,

938
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,760
but other things, not that one, though.

939
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,760
Teaspoon, tablespoon, soup spoon, secret spoon.

940
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,400
That's us.

941
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,640
Is it?

942
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,480
Yeah.

943
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,760
I don't know that that is us.

944
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,160
Don't you ever tell, though.

945
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,120
Listen, also we wanna say Sunday,

946
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,120
which we won't get to talk to you again before then.

947
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:18,960
Sunday at nine to seven p.m. Pacific, so it's obviously-

948
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,560
Wanna try that again?

949
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,800
Seven to nine p.m.?

950
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,760
What did I say?

951
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,280
You said nine to seven.

952
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,200
Okay, yeah, it's a fuckin' all-night gym arena.

953
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,640
No, seven to nine p.m.

954
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,520
Of course, that's 10 to 11 on a, fuck it.

955
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,720
God, it's summer.

956
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,800
Jesus, Justin.

957
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,760
Bitch.

958
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,520
All right, Sunday, March 13th,

959
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,640
from seven to nine p.m. Pacific,

960
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,680
which is nine to 11 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

961
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,320
Not even close dog.

962
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,440
Fuck!

963
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,600
Still ain't got it dog.

964
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,480
10 to midnight, Eastern Standard Time.

965
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,920
Jesus, please us.

966
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,960
Jesus Christ.

967
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,040
That's gonna be the Max Fun Drive finale.

968
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,000
It's where it all comes to a head,

969
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,160
and there's gonna be a Jordan and Jesse go live video stream,

970
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,440
and they're gonna be givin' away a bunch of crap there, too,

971
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,280
in addition to asking people for last-minute donations,

972
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,800
like that scene in UHF.

973
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,680
There's gonna be an Xbox 360 being given away,

974
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,640
some games, cool stuff like that,

975
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,240
so make sure you tune into that,

976
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,960
and then just go to maximumfun.org.

977
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,600
Also, I wanna, just quick thanks to everybody on Twitter

978
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,960
that has donated and made a point of saying,

979
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,520
hey, I donated, and you should, too.

980
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,480
We really appreciate everybody challenging their friends

981
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,200
and followers, and everybody who's just brought

982
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,480
any kind of attention to the Max Fun Drive.

983
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,360
We really appreciate it, and I'll try to keep up

984
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,560
with retweeting those and giving you guys

985
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,680
as much attention as I can.

986
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,520
Thanks, everybody.

987
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,920
Yeah, if you donate, don't be shy.

988
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,080
Go ahead and shout it out,

989
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:47,920
and talk about how you donate.

990
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,000
Everybody else feel bad, and if your people don't give,

991
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,840
shun them.

992
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,660
Just shun them.

993
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,500
Turn your back on them.

994
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,400
Shun them.

995
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,720
I don't know if our dad's given, and he's shunned,

996
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,400
and he's in the bonus episode.

997
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,920
Oh, we can tell you, the bonus episode has our dad,

998
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,200
has John Hodgman, has Jordan and Jesse,

999
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,640
has Brent.

1000
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,000
Has my friend Brent O'Floss from the show.

1001
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,360
From his show.

1002
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,280
And Dave and Graham from Stop Podcasting Yourself.

1003
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,120
Dave and Graham.

1004
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,400
Oh my god, it's jam-packed.

1005
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,880
So, again, MaximumFun.org forward slash donate,

1006
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,720
if you can.

1007
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,080
We really, really do appreciate.

1008
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,640
You guys made, seriously, a great, great showing

1009
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,440
from NBNB AM, but we want them to know how we do.

1010
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,040
We want them to know.

1011
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,680
We're trying to bring the thunder.

1012
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,980
Some of us are trying to bring the thunder over here.

1013
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,200
But anyway, thank you so much.

1014
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,040
I have a question that I've been looking forward

1015
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,520
to asking you guys for a while now,

1016
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,520
but I've managed to restrain myself.

1017
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,400
Serious problemo in England.

1018
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,240
That's not.

1019
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,400
What?

1020
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,240
Problemo?

1021
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,480
That's not English speak.

1022
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,480
That's what they say.

1023
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,800
Serious problemo in England.

1024
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,400
I recently impregnated my wife for the third time,

1025
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,640
and she is now insisting that I close down my baby factory

1026
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,920
by having the man snip, but I'm not sure I fancy that.

1027
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,960
What are your thoughts?

1028
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,700
And please help me.

1029
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,780
Dave in England.

1030
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,680
Dave, I'm almost certain that by man snip,

1031
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,960
you mean cutting off your penis, and I can't get behind that.

1032
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,960
No, he means a doctor with a degree taking a scalpel,

1033
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,480
cutting his wiener open, and hurting it,

1034
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,480
and hurting it in a.

1035
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,320
No!

1036
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,700
Yes, that's what he means.

1037
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,540
Like, that's the.

1038
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,380
No!

1039
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,200
Yeah, that's the gag.

1040
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,040
That's what he's saying.

1041
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,200
Hey, Dave, listen, straight up.

1042
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,500
All your life, from birth till now,

1043
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,000
you have had one true friend who's always been with you,

1044
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,320
and it's your wiener.

1045
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,920
Your wiener's there for you when your wife has not been.

1046
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,640
24-7, your wiener has been there to support you

1047
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,080
as much as he can, and this is what you're gonna do to him?

1048
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:53,000
I have to interject here and say that those few weeks

1049
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,640
when I got back from Bonnaroo,

1050
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,400
my wiener and I were not on speaking terms.

1051
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,600
Well, sometimes you and your friends quibble.

1052
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,680
Sometimes you got beef with your friends.

1053
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,680
Sometimes Griffin's friend dribbles.

1054
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,960
There was some bad blood there.

1055
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,920
Literally.

1056
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,040
Literally.

1057
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,400
What is a vasectomy?

1058
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,240
How does that work?

1059
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,320
I've never understood a vasectomy.

1060
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,880
Is it just like, you don't jizz anymore?

1061
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,960
Like, what happens?

1062
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,400
No, your vas deferens transports, basically,

1063
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,400
the sperm into your semen is snipped and sewn off, yeah.

1064
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,680
So you're still shooting blanks, basically.

1065
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,560
So you got the powder, but you don't have the lead.

1066
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,000
The surgery works like this.

1067
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,240
They cut your wiener open,

1068
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,600
and if you're lucky, you die on the table.

1069
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,800
You know what I think is even freakier?

1070
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,520
It's like an outpatient procedure.

1071
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,280
Like, you're in, you're out, half hour.

1072
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,560
You haven't even finished your copy of Highlights

1073
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,040
before you're back out in the world with a cut-up penis.

1074
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,600
You're reading Goofus and Gallant

1075
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,440
while they're flaying your dick.

1076
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,560
Like, while they're flaying your...

1077
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,200
And P.S., if that's happening to you, you're a Goofus.

1078
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,320
You won't find that in the magazine,

1079
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,360
but I've been reading for a while, you're a Goofus.

1080
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,760
Trust me on this.

1081
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,680
Gallant doesn't let his dick get eviscerated

1082
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,200
like a fried hot dog.

1083
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,520
Goofus, however, cannot say the same.

1084
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,600
Gallant learns to wrap it up

1085
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,360
before his wife wants his wiener cut off.

1086
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,960
Hey, Gallant, hey, Goofus, maybe try, like, a condom?

1087
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,520
If you, I mean, I don't know.

1088
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,840
It's a one-two punch.

1089
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,760
Dave, there are so many solutions

1090
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,080
for you to pursue before this one.

1091
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,880
How about the old Princeton pullout?

1092
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,040
What's that?

1093
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,840
The old classy, classy pullout.

1094
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,680
It's where you pull out while waving a banner for Princeton.

1095
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,520
Shit.

1096
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,720
You're wearing knee-high socks at the time.

1097
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,480
Cursed local Harvard men.

1098
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,720
In your fur jacket.

1099
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,280
Make sure you have a tiny pennant.

1100
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,000
You dress like John,

1101
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,320
fat John Farro from Rudy.

1102
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,920
Dave, don't do this thing.

1103
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,840
This thing that you're saying, don't do it.

1104
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,200
It's just so scary.

1105
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,240
It's just horrifying.

1106
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,160
Like, I will say, though,

1107
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,840
as somebody who has been married for years,

1108
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,840
if you do this thing,

1109
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,840
this thing that she is saying to you,

1110
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,480
you've won.

1111
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,320
Yep.

1112
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,960
You've won the relationship forever.

1113
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,800
Yeah, there's not a-

1114
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,320
That is a pretty big trump card.

1115
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:31,080
That would, that wraps up every single,

1116
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:36,080
hey, you didn't leave the toilet seat down for me.

1117
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,440
Yeah, I started looking at my dick scar

1118
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,920
and thinking about how I'm half a man.

1119
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,240
So maybe you'll just put it down yourself.

1120
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,400
Do you want to rent the expendables or eat pray love?

1121
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,240
I don't know.

1122
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,760
Let me consult with my ruined member.

1123
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,520
See, and let's just see what he,

1124
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,040
oh, this just in, expendables.

1125
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,680
It's just, the more you talk about it,

1126
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,160
the more I'm just getting sad for Dave Zawina.

1127
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,360
Yeah. Poor Dave Zawina.

1128
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,800
That's- He has no input in this.

1129
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,800
Dave, don't do it.

1130
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,160
Dave, don't do it. Dave, don't do it.

1131
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,000
Do it.

1132
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:07,960
Griffin says do it.

1133
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,760
I don't know why Griffin said that, but-

1134
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,120
I hear that it makes it,

1135
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,560
it makes sex feel better after it.

1136
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,240
Oh, like downtown?

1137
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,080
Like down there. Yeah,

1138
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,920
cause nothing like numbing surgery

1139
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,600
to make something more pleasurable.

1140
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,440
Mm-hmm.

1141
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,280
Ugh.

1142
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,120
That only lasts for so long.

1143
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,380
Scar tissue.

1144
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,320
So I want to hear Griffin's last-

1145
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,520
No, sir.

1146
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,360
No?

1147
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,560
No, you want more show?

1148
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,920
I got something.

1149
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,560
You got something?

1150
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,700
As you know, we've done flip the calendar over.

1151
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,940
It's a whole new month.

1152
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,000
Ah, fuck.

1153
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,440
And you know what that means?

1154
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,280
God damn it.

1155
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,120
I knew that.

1156
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,100
I know, I do know what this means, Griffin.

1157
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,400
It means it's time for us to,

1158
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,280
to take appreciation,

1159
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,720
take some stock in our lives,

1160
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,200
and share some wisdom for some March monthly observances.

1161
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,040
Oh, Jesus.

1162
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,640
Now, my alarm didn't go off this morning,

1163
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,880
and I basically ran full throttle into this show

1164
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,240
and didn't have time to pick something out of this list.

1165
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,280
So I'm going to go down,

1166
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,220
and I think we should focus all our attention on one,

1167
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,320
but I need your guys' help to help me pick that one.

1168
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,240
So I'm just going to name my favorite ones off this list,

1169
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,360
and then we can choose the one

1170
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,760
that we want to share wisdom about.

1171
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,880
Got it.

1172
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,600
Bell peppers and broccoli month.

1173
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,520
Crunchy, good.

1174
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,640
Exotic winter fruit and leeks and green onions month.

1175
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,180
A lot of produce.

1176
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,340
A lot of produce this month.

1177
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,000
I'm not sure I know enough about them,

1178
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,180
but I'm glad they can all hang out in their own month.

1179
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,020
Yeah.

1180
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,200
International expect success month.

1181
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,520
Okay, there it is.

1182
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,360
I like that.

1183
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,300
International mirth month.

1184
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,520
That's every month here.

1185
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,980
My brother and me.

1186
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,700
National cheerleading safety month.

1187
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,540
I like that one.

1188
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,560
It's dangerous.

1189
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,540
National clean up your IRS act month.

1190
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:58,860
Excuse me?

1191
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:59,700
Sure.

1192
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,220
Hey MC Hammer, that's been gone long enough.

1193
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,940
I think this might actually be the winner.

1194
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,980
National eye donor month.

1195
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,800
Okay, let's do it right now.

1196
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,700
We don't need to go any further.

1197
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,540
I'm going down the list.

1198
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,360
National eye donor month.

1199
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,200
Nothing beats eye donors.

1200
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,060
Friends, March is national eye donor month.

1201
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,420
So think about it.

1202
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,780
Are your kids really worth looking at with both?

1203
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,060
My brother, my brother, and me.

1204
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,260
Look around, see the flowers blooming

1205
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,500
and the children smiling.

1206
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,760
Well, some people can't, Stingy.

1207
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,100
Give up one of them.

1208
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,340
My brother, my brother, and me.

1209
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,060
That one didn't flow quite as well

1210
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,380
as you anticipated did it.

1211
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,220
No.

1212
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,060
How about this one?

1213
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,660
You know that Jessica Alba movie, The Eye,

1214
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,060
where she gets the eye donation

1215
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:47,960
and then she sees demons and it really fucks her shit up?

1216
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:52,380
That only happens like one out of every five eye donations.

1217
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,560
So don't worry about it.

1218
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,860
My brother, my brother, and me.

1219
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,900
I only have eyes for you.

1220
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:57,980
Literally.

1221
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,260
My brother, my brother, and me.

1222
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,260
Now again, I don't think you.

1223
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,080
Damn it.

1224
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,500
No.

1225
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,660
You're, you want to be a cyclops?

1226
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:08,980
My brother, my brother, and me.

1227
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:16,560
It's like, I just, nope.

1228
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:21,020
The air has just been sucked out of this room.

1229
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,780
It's like taking your contacts out

1230
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:25,020
only like times a thousand.

1231
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,660
My brother, my brother, and me.

1232
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,940
There you go.

1233
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,260
See you back on the horse.

1234
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,060
Eyepatches.

1235
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:32,900
Uh-huh.

1236
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:37,940
What else are you going to do with all those eye patches?

1237
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,440
It's like a permanent wink.

1238
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,060
My brother, my brother, and me.

1239
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,420
Hey, do you need a tiny hole

1240
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,380
to hide a secret treasure map in?

1241
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:51,640
We got you.

1242
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,480
My brother, my brother, and me.

1243
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,380
You know what you've been wanting to try for a while?

1244
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:55,420
Skull fucking.

1245
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,980
My brother, my brother, and me.

1246
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,320
Maybe I'll get one of Justin Bieber's.

1247
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,220
My brother, my brother, and me.

1248
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,820
I like that the idea is that everyone

1249
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,340
is trading one to the left.

1250
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:11,060
You're presupposing there's some crazy eye swap going on.

1251
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:13,660
Does that come on that?

1252
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,120
Change places.

1253
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,160
Musical eyeballs and somebody ends up Helen Keller.

1254
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,000
At the end.

1255
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,680
My new left eyeball is too big,

1256
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,480
and now I look like Forest Whitaker.

1257
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,480
That's what happened.

1258
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,800
Something happened to Peter Lorre at some point, I guess.

1259
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,360
His is just trying to get away.

1260
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,320
It's like one of those dogs in every Disney movie ever,

1261
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,080
like Milo and Otis, that eye's just trying to get home.

1262
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,840
It's unruly.

1263
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,960
I like it.

1264
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,880
I'm going down this list,

1265
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,200
and there's also Play the Recorder month.

1266
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,040
Play the Recorder month.

1267
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,820
I think we could have turned some comedy out of.

1268
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:00,580
Because people, you thought that people were indifferent

1269
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,080
to you playing guitar in the quad.

1270
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,400
Well, just hold on one second.

1271
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,360
Play the Recorder.

1272
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,200
It's like a flute for bitches.

1273
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,040
My brother, my brother, and me.

1274
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,880
My brother, my brother, and me.

1275
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,880
You're just tenth the man Zamfear is.

1276
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,040
My brother, my brother, and me.

1277
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,360
Zamfear reference.

1278
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,960
Yeah, Starsky, and Hutch, and Zamfear this week, I think.

1279
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,800
I'll take it.

1280
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,380
How deep are those cuts?

1281
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:24,220
There?

1282
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,840
I'm going out to the boneyard this week.

1283
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,980
I'm gonna get some deep cuts.

1284
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,920
So now I do actually want to hear Griffin's last question.

1285
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:40,380
But first, just real quick, this is a big, big deal.

1286
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,960
Right now, where can people find it, Griffin?

1287
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,400
This thing that we've created.

1288
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,700
Well, not we've created.

1289
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:49,540
We did the minimal amount of work on.

1290
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,800
But has been created for us.

1291
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,880
No, well, I mean, we were involved.

1292
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,700
In what?

1293
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,760
Oh, the comic?

1294
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,120
Yeah.

1295
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:01,080
I'll put it up on the MaximumFun.org front page.

1296
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,680
And you will see it there.

1297
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,760
And it is a four-page comic

1298
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,680
called My Brother, My Brother, Me Origins,

1299
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:11,680
written by me and illustrated by our dear friend,

1300
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,340
Michael Maney.

1301
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,100
You should follow him on Twitter, by the way.

1302
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:21,100
It's M-I-C-H-A-E-L-M-A-Y-N-E.

1303
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,180
You follow him.

1304
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,940
He has a great comic called Body Lasts.

1305
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,260
And he-

1306
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,540
I'm not lying when I say that the comic

1307
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:30,860
is one of the greatest things I've ever seen.

1308
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:34,160
It totally beats the shit out of anything we've ever done,

1309
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,980
which is kind of disappointing.

1310
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,740
It kind of is depressing, yeah.

1311
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,780
But if you like it, follow him.

1312
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,500
Tell everybody to go get his comic, Body Lasts.

1313
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:48,680
And because it is a sort of a faux origin story, I guess,

1314
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,180
of My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1315
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,600
A foraging story of how My Brother, My Brother, Me

1316
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,440
got started.

1317
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,820
It's, like I said, he did a lot of work on it.

1318
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,420
And I think it's, even if I hadn't written it,

1319
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,740
I would think it's really funny

1320
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:06,680
because it is just objectively great.

1321
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,560
And also you can go to, mainly because of what he did.

1322
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,400
I didn't really do that much.

1323
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,900
But you can go to bodylastcomic.com

1324
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,760
and see some more of his work.

1325
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,300
But it's a super nice thing he did.

1326
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,140
It's actually his idea.

1327
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:19,340
We didn't have to badger him into it,

1328
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,460
which is kind of nice too.

1329
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:26,380
This week, you should come see us at PAX East,

1330
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:27,980
if you're headed out that way.

1331
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,220
I think Griffin and I will both be

1332
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:33,040
at the Joystick Podcast Live, Friday, 7.30.

1333
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,160
I forget the-

1334
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,740
I can't stress enough how much I will not be there.

1335
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,820
The extent to which Travis will not be there

1336
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,940
cannot be measured by traditional instruments.

1337
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,780
I mean, he will really not be there.

1338
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:45,340
This would be a good time for you to come

1339
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:48,820
and tell us that you donated and come get your spoon on.

1340
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:50,260
Come get a spoon.

1341
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,740
I am gonna say hugs,

1342
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:53,700
but Griffin will be offering some spooning.

1343
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,120
Where are we laying down?

1344
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:58,060
I don't know, maybe on this ocean of sumo chairs

1345
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,760
that are all over the place.

1346
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,580
God, it's gonna be like a comfortable,

1347
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,740
like it'll be like nirvana.

1348
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:04,580
Yeah.

1349
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:07,780
And of course, one last time before we go,

1350
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:08,740
and think about it,

1351
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,660
this is the last time I've talked about this for a year.

1352
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,860
If you guys step up and really just crush it,

1353
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:16,700
it's the Max Fun Pledge Drive.

1354
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,580
At the very least, get in there,

1355
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:23,260
make your five buck pledge and get your stickers

1356
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:25,840
and your membership card and your bonus content,

1357
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:29,180
your free shows, your free videos, all that loot,

1358
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,860
and walk away with, most importantly,

1359
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:35,020
a warm and toasty feeling inside of you

1360
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:37,780
because you helped develop the thermoboner, A.

1361
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:40,860
B, helped to support something you like

1362
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,420
as much as we hope you like us.

1363
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:48,020
And if you can't get five bucks, give more.

1364
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:51,860
Because come on, step up.

1365
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:52,700
Make it hurt.

1366
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,840
All we want, all we ask is that you take it to the limit.

1367
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,900
Just take it to the limit.

1368
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:01,100
If you can do $35, you get a fricking AMFM radio

1369
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,580
that charges itself like some sort of magic thing

1370
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,140
and charge your phone too, it's incredible.

1371
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:06,540
If you donate, let me ask you this.

1372
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:10,700
If you give a one-time donation of a million dollars,

1373
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:11,940
I will have sex with you.

1374
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:14,660
You're welcome.

1375
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:17,100
No, no, no. You're welcome.

1376
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,220
What's that movie, Indecent Proposal?

1377
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:20,220
Sexy Proposal.

1378
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:21,360
Sexy Proposal Time.

1379
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,200
Million bucks?

1380
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,040
I'll fuck you.

1381
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,420
I'll break you off your fuck, no big deal.

1382
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:25,420
Dude or lady?

1383
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:26,260
Dude or lady?

1384
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,820
You making any boundaries?

1385
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,940
If it's a dude, I'm gonna say 1.5 mil,

1386
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,180
just because that would be a pretty significant change

1387
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,020
in my life.

1388
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:35,300
That would constitute a pretty big sea change.

1389
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,420
It's a pretty crazy branch that you just said.

1390
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,700
In order for that to pan out,

1391
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,460
I'm gonna need a little extra cheddar,

1392
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:43,080
a little extra Velveeta on them notch bros.

1393
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,320
But for a lady, beautiful, beautiful lady, 1 mil.

1394
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,340
For a not so beautiful lady, 1.2.

1395
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,580
We'll cut, we'll, we'll, we'll.

1396
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:53,000
What about a beautiful man?

1397
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,980
Beautiful man?

1398
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:54,820
1.2.

1399
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:57,820
Sounds good.

1400
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:01,140
Hey, I think we just learned a Griffin McElroy secret,

1401
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:03,900
which is hot dudes and ugly women

1402
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,780
are in the same sexual hour three days.

1403
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:08,220
In the same biosphere.

1404
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:13,180

and thanks for hanging out with us.

And we hope you appreciate the comic,

1409
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,240
which is just sort of our little way of saying

thanks for being here and thanks for,

1411

thanks for being our friends still.

1412
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:29,780
And Griffin, last question.

1413
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:31,300
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker as well.

1414
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,260
Thanks, Jacob Locker.

1415
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:36,780
It's by Yahoo Answers user Spanna, who asks,

1416
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,660
can babies see spirits?

1417
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:45,860
I'm Justin McElroy.

1418
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,020
I'm Travis McElroy.

1419
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:48,500
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1420
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,380
This has been my brother, my brother Nate.

1421
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:51,220
He's your dad.

1422
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:56,220
Let's go wear on the lips.

1423
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:58,300
Keep your heart, three stacks.

1424
01:03:58,300 --> 01:03:59,340
Keep your heart.

1425
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,500
Hey, keep your heart, three stacks.

1426
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,460
Keep your heart.

1427
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,460
Man, these girls are smart, three stacks.

1428
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:06,180
These girls are smart.

1429
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:25,180
Play your part.
