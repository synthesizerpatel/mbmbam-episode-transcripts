1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:44,560
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

6
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,440
Frankenstein was the first in line, Wolfman came up next.

7
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,120
Dracula wasn't doing his stuff, breathing down my neck.

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,880
Jump back, make tracks, here comes a hunchback, better get out of his way.

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,480
Fee-fee-fie-fie-fo-fo-fum, it was a monster's holiday.

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:14,400
Hey folks, welcome to part three of our Halloween 2018 celebration. The prices-

11
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,160
Skullabration. Justin, can I- Skullabration.

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,800
Well see, I said celebration because we slashed prices on all the late model Fords

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,480
that we've got cluttering up our showroom floor. We gotta make room for the 2020s people.

14
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,600
The 2020s are coming in. We got Ford Cadillacs, we got Ford Priuses,

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,640
we got Ford Lincolns, we got all the Fords. We got the new Ford Prius, it runs on hate.

16
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,840
That one's coming in at 36 large, you can walk out of the showroom in it for $34,

17
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,840
and then that one's yours, you're gonna drive that puppy home today.

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,480
Bad credit, no credit, reverse credit. My credit, your credit.

19
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,000
Oh shit, we owe you money, oh damn. With prices so low, it's scary.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,480
Please come in and let us settle our debts with you.

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,120
Please. Please, we owe you a car.

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,640
We feel so guilty. That time when you saved our life, we owe you this car, please.

23
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,520
Hey, come on in, we just refilled the soda machine and now we got hot dogs.

24
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,880
Please, come in, we froze Griffin in a block of ice so that you would come look at him.

25
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,120
Oh, I'm frozen, let me out. They didn't add a pee hole.

26
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,840
Oh no. It's just filling up.

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,800
You gotta say your fucking name in the name of the show, I am in hell.

28
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,640
My name is Justin McElroy and I'm the oldest broooother.

29
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,320
Okay. My name is Travis McElroy,

30
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,920
and I am the middlest broother. Come up with your own thing.

31
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Well, you didn't really come up with your own thing, so.

32
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,880
I'm your youngest broother and 30 big skeletons, Griffin McElroy.

33
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,360
30 big skeletons sitting on each other's shoulders and driving a late model Honda

34
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,200
that's gotta get out of this showroom.

35
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,560
We are out of room between all the skeletons and these late model Hondas and Fords

36
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,680
and Ford Hondas. We need you to come take some of them

37
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,880
because they're in the bathroom and we haven't been able to use the bathroom for weeks.

38
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,200
Folks, if you don't come by these cars, these 30 tiny skeletons sitting on each other's shoulders

39
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,920
dressed in a trench coat are gonna come take them all.

40
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,360
And I, I hate it. I hate it when they're around.

41
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,000
We don't know how to drive, but we'll gone in 60 seconds your ass and your full family's ass.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,640
Yes, please, please come. And listen, we'll give you the money directly.

43
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,120
No need to go through a blood bank.

44
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,400
All right.

45
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,640
Okay, well, anyway-

46
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
I think that was a 30 second radio spot.

47
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,440
And this is also an advice show for the modern era.

48
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,640
We're pumping, we're pumping them full of gas before you take them up a lot.

49
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,880
We're pumping them full of gas.

50
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,000
That's really good.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,040
Do you think people are confused because when they're listening to this, it is November 5th.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,960
Yeah. So you do want to vote tomorrow, but we, we figure a lot of people,

53
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,840
a lot of famous people that you trust are telling you to do that.

54
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,440
And you should obviously do that.

55
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,560
And Future Us is probably telling you to do that as well.

56
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,040
But Past Us, it's the 31st.

57
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,560
And we're just trying to fucking kick it for like a second.

58
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,440
If you could just let us kick it.

59
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,840
Fucking people talk about Christmas for weeks and weeks and weeks.

60
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,160
Sure.

61
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
Before and after.

62
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,560
Not after though, Trav.

63
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,400
To be fair, not after usually.

64
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,120
You don't normally hear people mid January like,

65
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,520
damn, I love Jesus and his birthday and Santa and all his miracles.

66
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,520
I feel like there is a window between the 25th and the 1st

67
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,000
where you can still have some remnant Christmas.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,880
The week between.

69
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,400
Yes, of course.

70
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,680
The dead zone.

71
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,320
Yes.

72
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,240
And we are, we have as many late model Fords and Hondas as we need.

73
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,480
Excepting no trade-ins.

74
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,880
No trade-ins.

75
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,400
There's one Mazda on the lot.

76
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,080
If you find the Mazda, it's yours.

77
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,000
Please, if you find a red sports car with a giant grill that looks like a mouth,

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,680
that is a teenager that we are waiting to cool off.

79
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,920
So he will transform back.

80
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,240
Please don't buy this turbo teen.

81
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,360
We are getting so late in the year to make our turbo teen reference for 2018.

82
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,800
Thank God we got there.

83
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,960
When the turbo teen transforms back,

84
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,080
we always focus on the one transformation into the car.

85
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,360
If there's someone driving the turbo teen when he transforms back,

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,680
does the turbo teen just absorb them or does he-

87
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,280
The word is digest, Griffin.

88
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,840
The word is digest.

89
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,880
When a human being-

90
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,440
Well, or is it just like he's like standing in human form,

91
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,720
but he has like two sets of every appendage?

92
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,520
Do you know what I mean?

93
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,480
A real Zayfod Bebebrock situation.

94
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,640
As he transformed back at the end,

95
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,120
you're just left with like your finger in his mouth.

96
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,240
Yeah, so then it's just like awkward, but it's fine.

97
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,600
But if his finger is spicy, if he just ate some Flamin' Hot Cheetos,

98
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,200
here I go again on my own.

99
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,880
And then you're back in and driving.

100
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,120
That's actually the only way to get into boy cars.

101
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,720
That's the keys.

102
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,680
If you're taking a long road trip with your friend turbo teen,

103
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,640
you just have to keep sticking your spicy finger into his mouth every 20 minutes.

104
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,280
It's miserable.

105
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,040
Are there times when turbo teen regains consciousness

106
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,560
and he's naked on a highway with oncoming traffic coming at him

107
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,480
because he didn't get spicy foods?

108
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:26,800
Yes.

109
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,040
Yeah.

110
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,080
If turbo teen car gets in a crash and transforms back into human,

111
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,800
what's he look like?

112
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,840
Is he all messed up?

113
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,960
Does he get all jacked up?

114
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,120
If he like has a bladder infection and it burns when he pees,

115
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,840
does he turn into a turbo car?

116
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,160
I don't remember any of this show,

117
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,240
but I do wonder what kind of mysteries or adventures they were having

118
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,600
since like a bunch of teens and their one friend who's a car sometimes

119
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,800
are equally as like threatening as a bunch of teens,

120
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,440
one of whom is rich enough to own a car.

121
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,760
That's basically their superpower is they know how to get a car.

122
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,800
For a second.

123
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,440
The only superpower I can imagine turbo teen having

124
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,600
is like one of the bad guys lifts him up

125
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,840
and while he is above the bad guy's head,

126
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,880
he eats a pepper.

127
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,160
He eats a buffalo tender.

128
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,640
Squish.

129
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,360
Crushes him.

130
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,320
Squish.

131
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,480
This is gonna freak you guys out.

132
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,120
Okay.

133
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,280
Do you know that there were exactly and only 13 episodes of turbo teen ever made?

134
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,920
Really?

135
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,080
We have probably talked more about turbo teen

136
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,560
than it would take you to watch the entirety of-

137
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,280
The entire duration of the program.

138
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,600
From September 8th, 1984 to December 1st, 1984.

139
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,360
And that's it, folks.

140
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,400
That's the ball game.

141
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,480
That's all you got of turbo teen,

142
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,640
which will be, let me run the math, 35 years old.

143
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,320
Damn, it's older than me.

144
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,120
Now, hold on.

145
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,240
You said 84?

146
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,960
So I was only about a year old.

147
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,240
Griffin was still two years away from being born.

148
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,760
How do I know about this show?

149
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,480
Just from you telling me about it when you were four, Justin?

150
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,960
I guess I was just wild about it

151
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,840
and telling this baby that lives in my house

152
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,280
about the car that can transform into a person, I guess.

153
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,600
I got a reboot and it's about a grandpa

154
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,640
that whenever he eats sour food,

155
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,400
turns into a helicopter.

156
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,360
Oh, that's pretty good.

157
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,880
Can I please, please let me tie this?

158
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,920
It's called Chapa Papa.

159
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,840
Chapa Papa, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

160
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,320
Oh boy, that's very good.

161
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,360
Or Sky Grandpa.

162
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,360
The Sky Grandpa sounds like when you've retranslated it

163
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,640
back from the Japanese title.

164
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,960
Overseas, it will be known as Sky Grandpa,

165
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,480
but here, Chapa Papa.

166
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,400
What if we did a crossover event?

167
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,160
We set the reboot in the world of Pixar's Cars

168
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,560
and this will be like whenever Mater eats some cold food,

169
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,400
he turns into a man.

170
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,680
Oh, I would love to see that.

171
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,760
I would love to see what just a human looks like

172
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,560
in that world.

173
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,640
Should we do advice?

174
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,160
Because it's been almost 10 minutes now.

175
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,680
I'm starting to get a little antsy

176
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,920
that it's going to be one of those episodes.

177
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,880
My boss and I were working on a project on my computer

178
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,560
and she asked me to bookmark a link

179
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,880
probably for murder.com or ghost.org or something spooky.

180
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,000
Something like that.

181
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,040
Haunted.pizza.

182
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,240
Haunted.pizza.

183
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,840
Hey, oh, hold on real quick.

184
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,720
Sorry, stop the podcast.

185
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,160
Jesus Christ.

186
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,120
Hey, Griffin.

187
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,160
Hey, Griffin.

188
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,360
Can you stop the podcast?

189
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,800
Yeah, I'll pause it.

190
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,200
Go ahead and everybody stop your podcasts, please.

191
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,240
And that is, yeah.

192
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,520
Okay, folks, $38.

193
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,240
I don't mind if I do.

194
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,160
Haunted.pizza is your home.

195
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,960
We got it.

196
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,240
We got it, folks.

197
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,200
Everybody relax.

198
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,800
Haunted.pizza is your home for the latest and greatest

199
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,680
in podcasting.

200
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,760
Okay, so I got Haunted.pizza.

201
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,320
Let's move on.

202
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,640
How do you do that so fucking fast?

203
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,000
That was not edited.

204
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,080
Justin really did that that fast.

205
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,720
It's wild.

206
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,560
Do you just keep it open when we record?

207
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,240
Do you just have like the cursor over the box to enter in?

208
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:17,440
I'm just always logged into our domain host and I know the

209
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,840
interface like the back of my hand at this point.

210
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,040
Yeah, at this point, I would say.

211
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,760
How's that domain host?

212
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,400
Do they call you now and like, hey, are you okay?

213
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,440
We're worried about you.

214
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,520
No, they're like, you're going to be rich someday when teen

215
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,640
Google pays off.

216
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,440
I'm like, yeah, I know.

217
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,600
At what point did the bank stop calling you for fraud alerts?

218
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,520
Right around this time that I sold them, pressx2jason.com to

219
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,880
redirect to Fifth Third.

220
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,360
Anyway, okay, so boss working on project computer bookmark

221
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,520
link, when I did the computer gave me the option to put the

222
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,080
bookmark in one of the bookmark folders that I have set up.

223
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,320
The first folder on my list is labeled meats.

224
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,600
My boss saw the name of the folder and said meats, M-E-A-T-S,

225
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,040
by the way, and then chuckled.

226
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
I didn't think anything of it because the folder was full of

227
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,960
links about different game meat vendors that I had been

228
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
researching for Christmas present.

229
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,200
After a few minutes, I realized that my boss likely thought

230
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,160
that my meats folder was a cheekily named folder where I

231
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,920
keep all my porn links.

232
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,240
By then, enough time had passed, I couldn't backtrack and

233
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,160
explain the name of the folder without looking like I was

234
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,520
trying to cover up having a folder of porn links.

235
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,120
So brothers, what's the best way to casually convey to my

236
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,840
boss that I don't have a folder of porn on my work computer

237
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,040
without making it seem like he thinks he doth protest too

238
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,000
much situation?

239
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,640
And that's from Not A Dirty Bird in Brooklyn.

240
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:52,400
All right, I mean, you can't fix this.

241
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,440
You cannot fix this because you could say like, no, no, no,

242
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,240
come back here and look in my game meats folder.

243
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,520
You're going to love it.

244
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,520
I have so many venisons and they're just going to think

245
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,440
that you fucking changed it since they were last there.

246
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,720
It is because that is a really wild sort of...

247
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,160
Usually I don't take it on this tack with our listeners,

248
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,680
but I think you're lying.

249
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,520
I do think you have pornography in there and then now you're

250
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,400
like protesting too much that you like had to email the

251
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,280
entire universe by way of our show about it.

252
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:33,520
Man, this is tough.

253
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,560
This is something that other people can learn from.

254
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,880
You shouldn't overthink things.

255
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:45,120
You should just sort of say whatever the obvious thing

256
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,480
is sometimes, you know?

257
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,600
You don't have to overthink it.

258
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,320
Sometimes if somebody questions something, you shouldn't

259
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,720
get too lost in the pros and cons, the whys and wherefores

260
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,440
and whatnot.

261
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,640
Just say, I'm going to buy meat for Chris's.

262
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,120
And do say that specifically.

263
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,160
Don't say, I'm shopping for Christmas presents for you

264
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,000
so I can't tell you about it.

265
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,280
Because that does seem non legit.

266
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,160
Yeah.

267
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,600
Hey, why are you bookmarking a bunch of meat for a present?

268
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,200
I've never worked this hard for a present in my entire life.

269
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,600
How many different options are you looking at that you

270
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,360
can't keep track of them in your head?

271
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,680
Yeah, that's wild.

272
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,280
I don't believe you.

273
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,720
Yeah, it's not true.

274
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,680
It's a falsehood.

275
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,680
I kind of was thinking about it.

276
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,040
I was trying to give you a bit of the doubt with just, I

277
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,520
don't believe you, kind of.

278
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,600
I don't actually believe what you're saying.

279
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,120
I think that the boss caught you.

280
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,920
OK, if I could back up for a second.

281
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,320
I'm sorry that I got so suspicious of you.

282
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,160
I thank you for your support over the years.

283
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,720
I assume that you're going to maximumfund.org

284
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
forward slash donate and give me money to the show.

285
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,840
And I so appreciate that.

286
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,560
Thank you.

287
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,680
I'll believe you if you do that.

288
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,640
That's easy.

289
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah, that's an easy one, it's a slam dunk.

290
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,280
I don't know that your boss necessarily thinks it's a porn

291
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:17,760
thing because that would be wild to have a folder on your

292
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,120
computer called meats and that's for porn.

293
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,800
That's like very close.

294
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,200
That's barely, that's a semi cloak.

295
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
That's not even actually cloaking it.

296
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,480
Everybody's porn links are in the same directory and it's

297
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,280
labeled productivity and finance spreadsheets for business.

298
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,600
It's definitely not.

299
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,840
Or simply media.

300
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,840
Because that's not a lie.

301
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,880
It's not inaccurate.

302
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,280
It's not an inaccurate sort of filing mechanism.

303
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,520
The only reason you would label the folder meats is if you're

304
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,800
trying to be sneaky, but also you know how forgetful you are.

305
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,920
Like you also make your password password one, two, three.

306
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,640
And you're like, well, I want to hide my porn links, but I

307
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,520
don't want to lose them.

308
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,760
Yeah, I don't think there's anything you can do except, oh

309
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,240
my gosh, if you get your boss a meat for Christmas, when you

310
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,800
give them the gift, you say, this is going to sound wild,

311
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,520
but do you remember when you saw a directory called meats on

312
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,320
my computer?

313
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,640
This is assuming you haven't been summarily fired.

314
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,360
You remember when you saw the directory, that was what this

315
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,920
was for.

316
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
I couldn't tell you back then.

317
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,920
Because then it seems like commitment.

318
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,520
It doesn't seem like you're backpedaling.

319
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,200
It seems like you are committed to surprising everybody with

320
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,240
some great meat.

321
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:44,560
And they're going to say, this is Hillshire farm sliced roast

322
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,240
beef that you got from Kroger's.

323
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,720
It was pornography.

324
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,080
Just own it.

325
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,880
Own it.

326
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,000
It's fine if it was.

327
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,640
Can I offer a very drastic solution to this?

328
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,080
Even more commitment?

329
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,120
You're going to have to go into work tomorrow, quit and

330
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,520
announce that you're leaving to become a butcher.

331
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,560
I mean, you've been dreaming of this for months and it's time

332
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,760
that you finally committed to your lifelong passion,

333
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,960
butchering.

334
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,560
Perfect.

335
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,600
Yeah, that should work too.

336
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,080
Either one.

337
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,520
We've given you a lot of good stuff to go on.

338
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,640
How about a Yahoo?

339
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,360
I'd love that.

340
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,240
Thank you so much.

341
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,720
I got a good one here and it's from Alex P.

342
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,880
It's from Yahoo Answers user Akash.

343
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,520
And we've never really done one like this, but I thought it

344
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,760
would be a fun sort of conversation starter on this

345
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,400
light and loose third Halloween episode of the year.

346
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,440
Okay.

347
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,640
Akash asks, would you rather have a cat with a human face

348
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,960
or a dog with human hands instead of paws?

349
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,600
A cat with a cat with a human face.

350
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,200
Still meows?

351
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,000
Should we assume?

352
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,640
Let's let Justin finish because that Travis just brought

353
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,960
up something that's going to really change the dynamic.

354
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,080
A cat with a human face or a dog with human hands

355
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,880
instead of paws?

356
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,720
Correct.

357
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,320
And feet or four hands?

358
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
Yeah, that was another question.

359
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,360
Yeah, it just says hands instead of paws.

360
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,720
So I was assuming two, but it could be four.

361
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,560
No, it has to be just two.

362
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,000
I can almost wrap my mind around that, but there's something

363
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,240
about it having four hands.

364
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,360
Yeah.

365
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,080
That's really, because I could see the dog then maybe

366
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,600
walking on its hind legs and having hands a la like

367
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,360
the funny dog from Family Guy, but like-

368
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,040
Oh, I love him.

369
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,480
I love this human.

370
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:41,280
I love the way he drinks, but the idea of four human hands

371
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,040
plodding along on the ground.

372
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,400
It's too many.

373
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,520
It's more than I have.

374
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,360
It's more than I have and therefore he would pose

375
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,920
a threat to me and my family's safety.

376
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,080
I mean, he's going to with two hands, four hands,

377
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,760
like we're all done, right?

378
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,320
Yes.

379
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,680
This is so tough because it's like the face cat is going to

380
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,760
be no good, especially if it talks human language.

381
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,440
That's no good.

382
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,120
That is so bad.

383
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,760
Sometimes I'll be like peeing, right?

384
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,480
And like the cat will be in the bathroom because that is

385
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,840
where her food bowl is.

386
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,680
And like, she'll look at me and it's fine because she's

387
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,200
a cat, but now imagine that that was a human face.

388
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,720
Yeah, that's rough.

389
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,520
It is rough.

390
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,480
It's going to look and the thing is, the law of doppelgangers

391
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,360
says that it will look exactly like somebody on Earth.

392
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,520
And we don't know who.

393
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,880
It could be anybody.

394
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,960
What if it looks like Hugh Jackman?

395
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,560
What if it looks like my brother Justin?

396
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,880
What if it looks like Justin dresses Wolverine?

397
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,440
It's impossible to say.

398
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,080
I want to give a counterpoint because this is actually

399
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,120
a very good question.

400
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,000
I think at this point.

401
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,240
Yes.

402
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,160
The problem I have with dog with hands is this.

403
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,240
Guys, you've created this crime, right?

404
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,920
This crime against the natural order that's sure to live

405
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,280
in a lot, I mean, a lot of spiritual and sort of

406
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,400
existential pain.

407
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,480
And what you've done is in addition to making it monster,

408
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,560
more monster than canine, you've also given it all the

409
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,160
equipment it needs to use a gun.

410
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,320
And that I hate.

411
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,960
That I hate.

412
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,520
I hate the fact that it can now use use tools and including

413
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,880
tools, one of those tools being a gun that can use to

414
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,760
take vengeance on you for willing it into existence.

415
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,360
And I hate that part.

416
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,480
Facecat, you have not made more lethal by creating.

417
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,200
There's no choice.

418
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,000
It is facecat.

419
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,040
You must choose facecat.

420
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,960
Hand dog will kill you.

421
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,120
Hand dog will kill you for making it facecat.

422
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,480
We'll try to kill you, but we'll have no enhanced lethality.

423
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,120
Not only that, like facecat's going to suck to be around and

424
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
you got to be around it because you can't throw it out because

425
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,720
it has a human face, right?

426
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,640
But dog, hand dog, if it doesn't kill you, it's still

427
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,920
going to get up to no good.

428
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,680
He has a dog's brain.

429
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,120
So maybe he won't think to kill you.

430
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,760
Maybe he still loves you because he's got a dog brain.

431
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,360
But he also has a dog brain.

432
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,400
He has a dog hunger.

433
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,200
So he's going to go in the kitchen and, you know, eat all

434
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,720
of the eat all of the lunch meat.

435
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,440
And you can't tell him.

436
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,360
No, that's like telling a roommate, like, no, no, you

437
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,480
can't eat the lunch meat.

438
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,240
But they have human hands, so they're going to do what the

439
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,440
fuck they want to do.

440
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,120
But that's assuming that then hand dog is capable of

441
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,400
utilizing the hand.

442
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,360
Because right now it's not like my dog with her paws is walking

443
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,520
up and trying and getting frustrated because it doesn't

444
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:29,760
work.

445
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,720
They can shake them.

446
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,600
They can shake.

447
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,400
They can sit on their hind legs and use the hand to shoot a

448
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,800
gun.

449
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,840
No question.

450
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,560
No question.

451
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,360
But you've just made me- that sealed the deal right there.

452
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,800
The idea of doing, like, shake with a dog and a human hand.

453
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,400
A full, meaty sailor's hand just extending out and taking

454
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:46,640
years.

455
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

456
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,640
You- I can't- I can't have a cat with a human face, though.

457
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,080
I don't want that either.

458
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,160
You-

459
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,080
Cat eyes or human eyes?

460
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,040
Okay, can it talk?

461
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,400
Yes.

462
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,840
It has to talk.

463
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,400
I'm out.

464
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,760
I'm so fucking out.

465
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,000
Actually, I have less of a problem with that.

466
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,880
It can talk and it sounds exactly like Lorenzo music.

467
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,360
Yes.

468
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,320
I love that.

469
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,200
Now I'm back in.

470
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,560
Does it eat cat food?

471
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,840
I'm backed out again.

472
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,880
I don't want to see that.

473
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,760
That's the thing.

474
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,280
If the cat can talk, then at the very least, I can A,

475
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,920
apologize and B, like, that- like, I get that.

476
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,720
But if it just has a human face that meows, I'm always going to

477
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,960
be looking at it thinking, do you understand?

478
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,840
Like, do you know?

479
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,000
Do you know what's happening right now?

480
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,520
Like, are you watching me?

481
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,400
Do you hate me?

482
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,680
What's happening?

483
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,000
And I don't want to see what the human face looks like when

484
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,640
the cat makes brown in the litter box.

485
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,360
Mm-hmm.

486
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,800
I don't want to have to confront that.

487
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,280
Catches a mouse?

488
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,920
Or catches a mouse and- oh no, Trav.

489
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,440
Yeah, or licks itself.

490
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:03,520
But you can put sunglasses on it and-

491
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:03,680
Yeah.

492
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,240
Come on.

493
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,080
But you could put mittens on the dog.

494
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,040
The only reason I'm going face cat, face cat sucks unilaterally,

495
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,600
but it won't try and kill me like hand dog.

496
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,320
I'm done.

497
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,080
It's face cat for life.

498
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,120
Okay.

499
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,160
I can't.

500
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,360
You- you gripping?

501
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,880
You have to- you have- okay.

502
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,880
The dog won't want to kill you, probably.

503
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,640
The cat will have the face of Rush Limbaugh, definitely.

504
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,080
And it'll just be waiting for you in the dark all the time.

505
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,240
Imagine, Griffin, imagine that you wake up at three o'clock in the morning

506
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,360
because you need to get some Imodium, and you walk into the hall,

507
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,720
and who's that waiting for you?

508
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,880
It's the face of Joe Pantlione.

509
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,720
He's trotting towards you, sashaying back and forth from your cat's body.

510
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,680
And what if it can talk, but it can just say,

511
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,560
hey, in a human voice over and over.

512
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,480
No, don't try to take the legs out from this.

513
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,040
It talks.

514
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,840
It talks human.

515
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,120
I can have a conversation with it.

516
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,760
I work from home.

517
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,320
I'm lonely.

518
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,600
Now I want face cat.

519
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,360
Now it's not, I don't want hand dog.

520
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,680
Now it's, I want face cat very badly.

521
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,360
Science, make me a face cat.

522
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,760
You want a cat that's just like other cats,

523
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,440
except it screams, why am I, at the top of its little lungs.

524
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,280
Why have you done this, creator?

525
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,920
You'll scream that for a bit, but then you'll be into it.

526
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,880
Then it'll be fun.

527
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,400
Acceptance therapy.

528
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,640
Is it like a full human head or just the face?

529
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,200
It looks like a cat, like Mario in a Tanooki suit, right?

530
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,760
For sure.

531
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,800
Yeah, that's pretty good.

532
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,920
And now hand dog.

533
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,640
Can this guy play a guitar?

534
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,760
I don't think the hands would be,

535
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,880
maybe ukulele is maybe the best.

536
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,200
All right, now we're coming.

537
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,960
See, now I'm trying to frame this like,

538
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,680
which one do I want very badly more?

539
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,680
Not which one is the least bad.

540
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,360
And if you look at it that way, I'm kind of torn.

541
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,640
What's his words per minute?

542
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,360
Does he know how to, can he edit a podcast?

543
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,560
Can he edit a podcast?

544
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,200
Yes, yes.

545
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,400
Can he use Squarespace?

546
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,240
Probably, it's very user-friendly.

547
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,920
Now, hold on though.

548
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,080
When he cranks it, does he use his human hands?

549
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,920
I'm back to face cat.

550
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,960
Hi, face cat.

551
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,400
Welcome back, Griffin.

552
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,240
See, Griffin, what if his voice

553
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,720
wasn't that like beautiful bear tone?

554
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
He's still not gonna jerk it with human hands.

555
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,920
I'm good, I'm good.

556
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,840
Face cat, can't face cat for life.

557
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,560
I'm gonna have to, I think I'm going hand dog.

558
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,160
Hand dog plus mittens, I'm okay with that.

559
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,000
See, that's cruel though.

560
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,400
That's cruel because you've not only transformed him

561
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,600
into a complete monster,

562
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,720
you have sort of taken away the only like agency

563
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,120
that you have given him in this monstrous form.

564
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,960
That's the most fucked up option, Travis.

565
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,320
Okay, the mittens won't be an all the time thing.

566
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,000
Well, when it's cold, right?

567
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,880
Just like a human.

568
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,020
Sure.

569
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,920
God, I feel like I felt such strong conviction both ways

570
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,960
at this point and I feel, I mean, I'm glad neither,

571
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,040
but I'm sad both, you know what I mean?

572
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,640
Yeah, I do.

573
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,200
Like it seems like if the world is gonna make one of them,

574
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,880
it should have to make both of them.

575
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,280
Both of them, yeah.

576
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,520
Like they should have to be friends

577
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
or in the same house or whatever.

578
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,160
Where are we at?

579
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,280
I mean, let's just take a vote.

580
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,720
I could love hand dog.

581
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,840
No, let's just take a vote.

582
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,040
I wanna take a vote right now.

583
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,320
I already love face cat.

584
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
Griffin votes face cat, Travis.

585
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,200
I vote hand dog.

586
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,320
Tiebreaker, and the other one dies, so.

587
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,040
Yeah.

588
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,440
The problem is I already have two faces

589
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,320
that are very dependent on me in my journey

590
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,520
and I don't know that I need a third face

591
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,760
no matter what it's attached to, truly.

592
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,000
I don't need a third face that's sort of dependent on me

593
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,800
and sort of needing my guidance and expertise

594
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,720
and wisdom and coddling and what have you.

595
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,800
I think it's very beautiful, Justin,

596
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,560
that you're counting your children's faces

597
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,840
but not your own.

598
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,040
Well, nor my wife's

599
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,240
because they're not dependents.

600
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,760
I'm saying that I have two babies

601
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,120
that live in my house.

602
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,360
Your face is pretty dependent on you.

603
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,600
Yeah, you do need to feed your own face, my pal.

604
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,680
Yeah, but I'm saying that these faces,

605
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,760
these two, it's like a third child.

606
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,400
I get what you're saying.

607
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,960
You hate my fucking precious baby.

608
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,920
I get what you're saying, Justin.

609
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,640
Go ahead and say it.

610
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,920
I'm a hand dog, you idiot.

611
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,640
It's just like I'm an introvert kind of by nature

612
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,040
and I'm trading away those precious moments of solitude.

613
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,600
Okay.

614
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,080
Have fun getting strangled by a dog, you two jerks.

615
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,960
Have fun getting strangled by a dog.

616
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,560
She doesn't have human arms.

617
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,280
Yeah, that's fine.

618
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,400
I'm still stronger.

619
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,840
It doesn't have the power of the human arms.

620
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,840
I don't even think that it could bend the middle way.

621
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,160
I don't think it could flex the hands.

622
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,440
Sure, yeah, yeah.

623
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,080
No, he could totally just inject poison into your neck

624
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,120
while you're asleep.

625
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,240
There's a lot of different ways.

626
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,600
What's he getting poisoned?

627
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,160
No, have fun.

628
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,520
I'll do the podcast by myself

629
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,360
because you two have been killed by your dumb dogs

630
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,440
that you wanted to get instead of my cool face cat

631
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,800
who looks like Joey Pants.

632
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,000
You stinkers.

633
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,960
Joey Pants face cat could talk anyone into murdering you though.

634
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,000
It's a cat with a mouth

635
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,200
and that mouth pet is mightier than the sword kind of thing.

636
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
That cat could lead a rebellion.

637
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,680
It could create sort of a krang suit around itself.

638
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,480
Oh, absolutely.

639
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,360
I'm as surprised as anybody

640
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,600
but we're gonna have to take a break at this point

641
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:29,680
and go to the proverbial money zone.

642
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,160
I want to tell you about Zip Recruiter.

643
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,200
You gotta hire people for stuff.

644
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,000
Look around you.

645
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,760
You have all the cubicles set up.

646
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,720
You bought the coffee.

647
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,400
You have all the spreadsheets ready to be filled in

648
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,760
but what did you forget?

649
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,040
You forgot to hire people and you know what's not smart?

650
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,560
The way hiring used to be

651
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,120
or like job sites that overwhelm you

652
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,040
with tons of the wrong resume.

653
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,080
I'll tell you what is smart.

654
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,920
Going to ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

655
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,360
Zip Recruiter is powerful.

656
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,160
Matching technology finds the right people for you

657
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,080
and actively invites them to apply.

658
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,280
You're not just waiting.

659
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,160
You're not just waiting.

660
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,440
They say, hey, you're perfect.

661
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,480
Get in here.

662
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,040
So it's no wonder that Zip Recruiter is rated number one

663
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,160
by employers in the US

664
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,040
and this rating comes from hiring sites on Trustpilot

665
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
with over a thousand reviews

666
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,480
and right now our listeners can try Zip Recruiter for free

667
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,800
at ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

668
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,400
That's ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

669
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:37,520
Would the face on the cat age in relation to the cat's body?

670
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,520
The cat never dies nor does the dog.

671
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,000
Okay, because just thinking about it getting old and wrinkly

672
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,400
very, very fast just kind of bum me out.

673
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,600
But if it's eternal, then that's better.

674
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,440
Can I tell you all about Casper though?

675
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:51,760
Yes.

676
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,440
They are fantastic.

677
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,640
They have the mattresses.

678
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,240
They have the mattresses that you need.

679
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,680
They're the mattresses that you want.

680
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,280
They're the mattresses that you crave.

681
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,840
Delicious scrumptious mattresses.

682
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,960
The mattress you deserve.

683
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,600
On the table.

684
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,360
They are so good.

685
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,600
We're supported by Casper this week.

686
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
They're a sleep brand that continues to revolutionize

687
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,000
its line of products to create an exceptionally comfortable

688
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,080
sleep experience one night at a time.

689
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,560
They got affordable prices because they cut out the middleman

690
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,600
and sell directly to you.

691
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,280
We, I think, all have Casper mattresses at this point.

692
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,120
And my guests, when they stay at our house, get rave reviews.

693
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,680
Well, they give them, but they also get them.

694
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,240
Before they lay down on the bed, I say, listen, here's how good

695
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,520
this bed's going to be.

696
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:31,920
Charles M.

697
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,920
Oh, I thought you meant you look at them and you say,

698
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,760
let me tell you how great you are.

699
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,720
You're doing great.

700
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,400
But Charles M. from Des Moines says this mattress is da bomb.

701
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,440
Five stars.

702
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,040
So look forward to it.

703
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,520

704
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,840
for a quality sleep surface with the right amounts of both

705
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,040
sink and bounce.

How about another message here from Jenny?

713
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,440
And it's for Peter.

714
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,200
And it goes a little something like this.

715
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,040
Happy meat-aversary, Peter.

716
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,200
Now this one, I'm going to be real clear and say it's

717
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,480
M-A-E-T-aversary, Peter.

718
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,400
You are so wonderful.

719
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,640
And every moment with you is pure magic.

720
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,320
Thank you for introducing me to bim bam, saw bones,

721
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,040
and wonderful.

722
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,920
I'm super excited for our next loft's adventure and cuddles

723
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,040
in the coming years.

724
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,800
I cannot wait to marry you.

725
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
I love you to the moon and back.

726
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,520
And that is so sweet and was supposed to be read eight

727
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,280
months ago, but it's still so sweet is the thing about it.

728
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,280
And you know what else is sweet?

729
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,960
Like saw bones is good.

730
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,680
Wonderful is good.

731
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,360
But have you tried shmanners?

732
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,000
And that message comes to us from Travis.

733
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,920
Yeah, pay me and Justin $100 right now.

734
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,240
I will in kisses.

735
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,040
No, Venmo me $100 fucking dollars right now, you creep.

736
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,040
You know what?

737
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,360
I'm going to do the other one too, because that's how I'm going

738
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,680
to do it.

739
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,160
It's for Dylan and it's from your cat, special boy.

740
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,400
Oh, no.

741
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,520
Oh, no, no, no.

742
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,020
Meow.

743
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,840
Hello.

744
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,640
I love you.

745
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,560
Sorry I don't understand soft paws and break the no slapping

746
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,840
rule constantly.

747
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,480
Also, sorry for running out the front door all the time.

748
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,560
The hallway is just so interesting, but also scary.

749
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,160
So please continue to rescue me.

750
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,480
Meow.

751
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,320
Oh, no, no, no, no.

752
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,680
That's great.

753
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:48,320
How did the cat get the money to can face cat get a job in

754
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,680
like customer service?

755
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,480
Yeah, yeah.

756
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,760
I'm all about that.

757
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,520
Love this crazy cat.

758
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,560
Crazy cat, but then hand dog could totally be a typist or

759
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,800
manual labor for sure.

760
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,200
This is what I'm saying.

761
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,680
Not enough people are interested in manual labor jobs like

762
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,840
mechanic and plumber and electrician.

763
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,280
Hand dog could fill in that it is.

764
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,040
It is starting to raise the question of which one could move

765
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,760
out, which is usually desirable.

766
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,240
Which one can become autonomous and not my problem.

767
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,640
I feel like face cat is going to be able to get a social

768
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,880
security number much easier than hand dog would, right?

769
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,640
Hand dog could drive.

770
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,280
No, here's what it's going to be in the eyes of the law.

771
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,000
And this is it.

772
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,560
This is a dog with human hands.

773
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,400
This is a human with a cat body.

774
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,520
Oh, you're right.

775
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,400
Oh, shit.

776
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,520
Yeah, it's true.

777
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,360
He has a passport now because he's a human with a cat body.

778
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,520
We can't discuss, but I'm not going to give a passport to a

779
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,720
fucking dog.

780
00:32:52,720 --> 00:33:22,640
Note this far, no further.

781
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,600
A sister's guide to teens through the ages.

782
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,080
I am a teenager and I was two.

783
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:42,960
Butts, butts, butts, butts, butts.

784
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,080
My husband and I live in a small haunted apartment building

785
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,920
with just six units, mostly occupied by other couples and

786
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,200
also some ghosts.

787
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,520
We've lived here for seven years and have become friendly

788
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,040
with some of the other tenants, occasionally having meals or

789
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,800
cocktails at each other's places.

790
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,840
Here's my dilemma.

791
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,760
When I'm at another tenant's place and I have to use the

792
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,080
bathroom, should I use the one there or leave and use my own

793
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,520
mere steps away?

794
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,200
Oh, huh.

795
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,960
Of course, I want the sweet, sweet security of my own

796
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,080
porcelain haven.

797
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,640
But is that weird or even insulting?

798
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,000
So far, I just held it and waited until I got home.

799
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,360
That's the right answer.

800
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,560
Usually, when we socialize with other tenants, it's just us and

801
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,280
the other couples.

802
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,680
So it's not like a party situation where I could just

803
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,760
slip out and back unnoticed.

804
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,560
Help me.

805
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,880
There's no place like home in San Francisco.

806
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,120
This one, this is so easy.

807
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,320
Can we just move on to the next?

808
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,200
Because you can give a nearby guest your pee pee, but you

809
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,320
can't give them your poo poo.

810
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,240
If it's a poo poo, you have to go home and do it there.

811
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,280
If it's a pee pee, you do it wherever you want.

812
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,440
I'm so glad we agree, Griffin.

813
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,240
Yeah, because we've dealt with that with our hotel rules.

814
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,240
If you're hanging out in a friend's hotel room and yours

815
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,680
is 20 feet away, you can give them your pee pee, but you

816
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,800
can't give them your poo poo.

817
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,440
That's it.

818
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,000
Next question.

819
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,880
Huge problem.

820
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,640
Do you have to explain that?

821
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,400
If what you're saying is the accepted law and from your

822
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,400
tone, that is, it seems to be settled law from what you're

823
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,640
saying, then we are creating a culture where if you say,

824
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,200
excuse me, I have to go to my apartment for approximately

825
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,720
five to 10 minutes.

826
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,760
You are then announcing your intent to have a bowel

827
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,960
movement, which is not necessarily part of the culture

828
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,920
is not announcing I'm going to go shit.

829
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,440
We just, it's simply not done.

830
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,360
Well, another part of the culture is not dropping a big

831
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,960
one inside of this domicile when yours is so very close

832
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,800
and they're definitely going to notice how long you've

833
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,520
been in there and they're also going to notice the bad

834
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,080
smells that you did make with all of your process.

835
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,600
Not necessarily arguing that.

836
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,880
I'm arguing that if you have this standard where I pee

837
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,720
pee at your house, I poo poo at mine, you are making it

838
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,400
so people can always track if you've left to go poo poo,

839
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,120
which is not great.

840
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,000
This is why we need a social understanding.

841
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,440
We need something like how pirates have the black spot

842
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,080
where you just like slide a card onto the table and

843
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,680
everyone knows what that card means, but in using that

844
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,680
card, everyone is also agreeing like if this was me,

845
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,320
we would all pretend like this wasn't happening.

846
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,560
And let me also say, if I know that the two of you left

847
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,880
my house or room so that you could go and poo poo somewhere

848
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,160
else, when you come back, I will have a Harry and David

849
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,200
cheese basket waiting for you as a thank you gift.

850
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,120
I don't know why you think this is an embarrassing thing

851
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,760
as much as it is me knowing that you've done me a great

852
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,040
service this day.

853
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,600
I cannot tell you how many times every single one of us

854
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,720
on this call have been on tour with the other ones and

855
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
they've been in their room and they say, well, I'm going

856
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,400
to wreck your bathroom real quick and then go back to

857
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,280
my room.

858
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,720
It happens constantly.

859
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,000
Yeah, but now we must put away our childish things.

860
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,160
Please do not poo poo in my hotel room anymore.

861
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,440
It is so bad.

862
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,720
I don't know what you two do.

863
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,480
Well, because here's the thing, it's especially why

864
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,160
you're doing your favorite because you could wreck your

865
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
bathroom and leave three minutes later.

866
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,080
Like you're basically saying like, this is yours now.

867
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,720
You know what I mean?

868
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,320
Like, no, no, no, no, no.

869
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,960
And if they don't notice right away and pin it on you,

870
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,600
they're going to pin it on somebody who uses the bathroom

871
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,240
at some point.

872
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,200
It's just so bad.

873
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,000
Poo poo at home.

874
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,120
Can I do a Yahoo?

875
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,680
Yes, please.

876
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,360
Here's a good one.

877
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,040
This one is sent in by lots of people.

878
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,760
It's from a Yahoo answers username, Jack, who asks,

879
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,600
do planes, do planes move faster, slow?

880
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,600
When I look at a sky plane, look slow.

881
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,920
I run faster than I see plane move.

882
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,640
Like what?

883
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,400
How plane look like move so slowly?

884
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,720
Well, it's okay.

885
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,280
So, and they won't teach you this in school because

886
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,880
they're afraid, but basically the plane hovers in the air

887
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,440
and then the earth turns underneath it.

888
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,000
Okay.

889
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,920
And then the plane lands back down.

890
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,560
Yeah, they're part of that's probably right, Trav.

891
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,960
So like, I would say the plane moves probably about as fast

892
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,480
as question askers running, but then add to that rotation

893
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,200
of the earth.

894
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,200
And that's why the plane gets to Phoenix slightly faster

895
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,800
than if you ran to Phoenix.

896
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,160
Okay.

897
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:26,400
Yeah.

898
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,280
So if I could jump up super high, like a Mario brother,

899
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,920
I could be in Phoenix right now.

900
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,640
I wouldn't like, it would be like that movie Jumper,

901
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,680
but quite literally.

902
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:35,840
Yeah.

903
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,360
So that's why skipping is faster.

904
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:38,880
Huh?

905
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,040
Yeah.

906
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,560
Here is the problem.

907
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:41,760
Yeah.

908
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,720
Sky is big.

909
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,960
Oh damn.

910
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,960
And plane fast, but sky is big.

911
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,080
And not like ground.

912
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,160
Ground is small and you can walk around pretty much

913
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,400
anywhere you want to, but sky is so big that it take plane

914
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,960
long time to cross.

915
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,640
So that is the main kind of issue is that sky so big.

916
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,120
But less to move around.

917
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,120
Less to move around, Travis is right.

918
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,360
Ground, building, mountain, tree.

919
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,960
Now the problem is I go in house and sky go away.

920
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,600
So it can't be that big, can it?

921
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,080
Fickle.

922
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,520
Yeah, it's a fickle baby.

923
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,960
Well, sky sneaky.

924
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,280
Let's also remember, hold your thumb up and look at plane.

925
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,920
Plane.

926
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,880
Plane very small.

927
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,120
It's so fucking small.

928
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,760
And I don't know how they do like the shrinking machine

929
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,800
inside of it or when, because I've been on so many planes

930
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,960
and I've never felt the shrinking machine go off,

931
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,320
but I know they're using it.

932
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,360
Maybe that's why you're not allowed to stand up when the

933
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,400
plane's like going up because it's shrinking very quickly

934
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,800
and your bones aren't good and you might fall over.

935
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,000
Griffin, you dullard.

936
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,560
The Earth is getting bigger.

937
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
That's ridiculous because it would have to get bigger

938
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,080
for every flight that's going on.

939
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,400
Yes.

940
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,920
No, Travis, no, come on.

941
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,360
You're getting kind of silly, Trav.

942
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,160
We were all having a lot of fun.

943
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,720
No, I'm telling you, hey Travis, I know it's a little out there.

944
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,240
We were all just having a lot of fun.

945
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,440
I'm a big Earther.

946
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,080
I'm sorry.

947
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,600
That's a real hand dog way of thinking about this situation.

948
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,360
Just telling you, Earth get bigger.

949
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,680
I'm the one who looks at the glass and says, face cap.

950
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,280
Do you think this has been our weirdest episode of like 2018?

951
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,680
Oh, it's our spookiest one for sure.

952
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,840
So I have a coworker who took my cookie.

953
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,480
It was a wrapped cookie like you would pick up at a gas station.

954
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,200
So it definitely was obvious that it wasn't for sharing.

955
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,200
It was meant as a treat for me between doing work.

956
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,200
Another coworker told me he saw him take a big bite out of it

957
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,880
and set it down like it was his.

958
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,600
When confronted about the cookie, he said,

959
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:59,920
Oh, my bad, you can punch me if you'd like.

960
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,960
With no offer of recompense, brothers, what do I do?

961
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,120
I just wanted a sweet chocolate chip treat

962
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,000
that's from Lost Munch in Midland.

963
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,520
That is amazing because what it has said is like,

964
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,960
I can't make it up to you.

965
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,240
I don't have another cookie.

966
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,720
But we're square because I offered you the chance to do violence to me.

967
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,240
Yeah, I'll shoot.

968
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,600
Well, beat my ass, I guess.

969
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,880
Hey, no, it's not my kink.

970
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,320
I don't know why you...

971
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,440
No, I eat your cookie and you beat my ass.

972
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,640
It's just a regular thing.

973
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,360
I don't understand.

974
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,640
Yeah, this is how we do the cost of doing business.

975
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,320
I knew when I took a bite of that cookie,

976
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,720
I was running the risk of getting my ass beat.

977
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,080
And that's why I justified it

978
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,680
and thought it was an okay thing to do to unwrap a wrapped cookie.

979
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,320
Unbelievable.

980
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,880
You fucking murderer.

981
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,840
That is definitely the calculation that this person did, right?

982
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,280
Like, if I bite this cookie, they're probably gonna wanna punch me.

983
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,720
But I will have gotten a bite of the cookie.

984
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,480
You shouldn't work at this place anymore.

985
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,200
That's obvious, right?

986
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,160
We're all agreed on this.

987
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,600
You have to get a new job.

988
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,200
You can't work with a person like this.

989
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,800
No way, no how, no where.

990
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,680
This is step maybe two, maybe three of like a 10-step path

991
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,760
in which they end up probably killing you.

992
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,840
Now, can you punch them so hard they go through the glass of the vending machine?

993
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,720
And then you can reach in and get all the fucking famous Amos that you want.

994
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,840
A victimless crime.

995
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:30,160
A victimless, well, there's two victims, actually, as far as I can tell.

996
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,680
It's a double victim crime.

997
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,760
The person you punched in Amos?

998
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,640
And Amos.

999
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,000
Amos Lee.

1000
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,720
Famously, that's why he calls himself Famously Amos Lee.

1001
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,200
What would they have done if you had just fucking laid them out?

1002
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,640
They might have.

1003
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,080
What if you had punched him so hard that he died?

1004
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,920
What if you punched him in his appendix and at first-

1005
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,360
Like your dainty and he died.

1006
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,360
And then you had, oh, happy Halloween.

1007
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:05,040
But then you had to go to court and the judge was like,

1008
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,320
so what happened?

1009
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,040
And you're like, well, long story short,

1010
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,240
he took a bite of my cookie, so I killed him.

1011
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,920
Yeah, the jury would find you guilty,

1012
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,320
but then the coroner would run in last minute and be like,

1013
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,720
hold up, we just finished cutting his tummy open.

1014
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,160
There is a bite of cookie in there.

1015
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,840
And then the judge is like, okay.

1016
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,280
And then note in his pocket that says,

1017
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,720
if I took a bite of someone's cookie,

1018
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,720
they're allowed to punch me as hard as they can.

1019
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,840
Did you do it though?

1020
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,600
That's what I need to know is if you did it,

1021
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,280
because you didn't say if you did it or not.

1022
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,560
Because if not, what you need to do is you need to wait.

1023
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,120
You need to hold that and then one day punch him.

1024
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,560
And when he's like, what the hell?

1025
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,000
You're like, that's for the cookie.

1026
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,240
Yeah, and he didn't specify where to punch him.

1027
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,480
You could punch him on the crown of his head

1028
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,760
and he wouldn't like that, I bet.

1029
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,560
Ooh, wait till he's eating a cookie.

1030
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,440
This could be years later and you punch his hand,

1031
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,920
knock that cookie right out of his fucking hand

1032
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,520
so it shatters on the ground.

1033
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,200
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

1034
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,280
Yeah, that's fucking good.

1035
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,040
Punch his butt so hard his wallet comes out

1036
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,120
and you get cookie buying money from it.

1037
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,480
There's a lot of options actually.

1038
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,640
It depends on how accurate your punches are.

1039
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,120
Can you punch a wallet out of a dude's butt pocket?

1040
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,200
This week on Mythbusters.

1041
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,640
This week we brought it back for this one special

1042
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,720
and it's a McElroy Brothers special.

1043
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,080
Can a cat have a face?

1044
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,280
Where should you poo poo?

1045
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Where should you make poo poo?

1046
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,800
Poo poo.

1047
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,560
We tried doing it at our friend's house.

1048
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,520
He didn't like it.

1049
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,320
Myth confirmed.

1050
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,560
I got a Haunted Doll watch.

1051
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,680
Yeah, I know, that's what that song means.

1052
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,200
It's a Halloween episode and I thought this was perfect

1053
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,440
to help us bridge the gap between seasons

1054
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,040
so I was very excited to find it.

1055
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,960
Got a Haunted Doll Gloria active paranormal winter

1056
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,960
slash Christmas spirit dolls.

1057
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,460
Ooh.

1058
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,160
I am sharing my special winter

1059
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,920
and Christmas spirit doll collection.

1060
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,640
Meet Gloria.

1061
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,840
She was 22 years old when she passed away.

1062
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,600
She had high ambition to accomplish a lot of different-

1063
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,240
Happy holidays!

1064
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,360
Happy holidays.

1065
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,720
She had a high ambition to accomplish

1066
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,840
a lot of different things.

1067
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,000
She was an activist and often would protest

1068
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,160
against issues that she felt were unjust.

1069
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,360
I'm not sure how she died

1070
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,160
but she has strong willed, independent spirit.

1071
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,840
She will speak up when she sees someone lying

1072
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,440
or treating someone else badly or unfairly

1073
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,200
by slamming a door or turning her lights off

1074
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,080
to get your attention.

1075
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,160
I have heard her yell no before

1076
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,680
when she didn't like something.

1077
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,080
She will talk to you through a spirit board

1078
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:34,960
and in your dreams.

1079
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,160
She is a loving, compassionate spirit

1080
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,560
who really cares about what happens to others

1081
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,640
and will watch over you and your family

1082
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,400
with protection and care

1083
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,160
and will stick up for you when needed.

1084
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,920
Do you know how bad your self-confidence has to be

1085
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,120
for you to be like,

1086
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,120
don't let my doll hear you talking that way

1087
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,480
because she's got my back.

1088
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:55,780
Yeah.

1089
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,900
The doll itself is 16 inches high

1090
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,460
and has brown curly hair and blue eyes.

1091
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,180
She's wearing a beautiful dark blue velvet dress

1092
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,060
with white fuzzy trim and has a matching hat.

1093
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,380
She has bloomers, socks, and black boots.

1094
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,060
She is also holding a silver gift.

1095
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,180
Gloria will make a wonderful Christmas gift

1096
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,340
for you or someone you love.

1097
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,220
I don't know what is wilder.

1098
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,340
Or the idea that you would say,

1099
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:30,660
Merry Christmas, it's a doll with a dead activist inside.

1100
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,340
Or that you would say,

1101
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,620
Merry Christmas, me, surprise,

1102
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,980
I got you a haunted doll for yourself.

1103
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,780
Maybe you need someone who's gonna give you

1104
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,260
that little boost of self-confidence every day.

1105
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,700
Who's gonna be like,

1106
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,700
here's you like looking in the mirror

1107
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,340
and you're like,

1108
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,660
ugh, I don't wanna, I'm such a loser.

1109
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,580
And then you hear a door slam and you're like,

1110
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:55,060
hey, thank you, doll, you're right.

1111
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,140
You hear the doll yell, no!

1112
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,380
Is that what it sounds like?

1113
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,540
Can you imagine being anywhere at your house

1114
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,460
at any time of day with any number of people there

1115
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,460
with any level of security

1116
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,300
that you feel in your heart of hearts

1117
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,860
and just hearing yelled out loud, no!

1118
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,900
That's bad, that's bad, that's not good.

1119
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,060
What if a face cat did it, Griffin?

1120
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,140
Then I would know, I would expect it,

1121
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,180
I would anticipate it.

1122
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,180
Yeah, I mean, how is this doll boosting my self-confidence?

1123
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,300
Is it like a Teddy Ruxpin

1124
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,020
where it's got a cassette tape of Wilson Phillips' hold on in it?

1125
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,900
Because I could be for that, I could be all about that.

1126
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,780
It's just there is never gonna be another doll.

1127
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,700
Justin, you've jumped the fucking shark.

1128
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,700
You cannot shock me anymore with this segment

1129
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,740
after the very sexual, very sensual spirit.

1130
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,540
You can't do it anymore.

1131
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,740
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go back to the woodshed

1132
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,140
and chop up some of these dolls,

1133
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,180
glue them back together,

1134
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,860
and see if we can find something a little spookier

1135
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,300
than a sexual doll.

1136
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,060
The thing is that this doll,

1137
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:57,220
I just didn't know that dolls had seasons and trends.

1138
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,500
Because if you look at this doll,

1139
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,940
like its dress is blue,

1140
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:05,060
and it looks kind of like it has that frosted,

1141
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,740
kind of snow-like trim,

1142
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:09,380
and it's got like silver holly on it.

1143
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:12,580
And it's definitely a Yuletide haunted doll.

1144
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,260
A question for you.

1145
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,860
If you had this haunted doll that was very Christmassy,

1146
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:23,860
would you feel okay about packing it up

1147
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,420
10 and a half months out of the year?

1148
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,020
How would you feel about that?

1149
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,340
If this thing's yelling no in my house,

1150
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:37,540
I believe it will find itself packed up 12 out of 12 months.

1151
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,340
No, but-

1152
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:38,980
That's worse.

1153
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,140
I actually, I'm more okay with the doll randomly

1154
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,540
like from a shelf somewhere yelling no

1155
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:52,420
instead of yeah, for the ad, I just no, no, no, no, no, no.

1156
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,380
We're talking about maybe the most effective form

1157
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,860
of elf on the shelf imaginable.

1158
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:58,980
Because it's not just like,

1159
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,580
oh, don't steal a cookie because it's a sin, I guess,

1160
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,020
and the elf will tell Jesus

1161
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,700
and you won't get any presents or heavenly reward

1162
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,820
at the end of your life.

1163
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:13,140
You also have this doll as maybe backup for this elf

1164
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,140
who literally will chide the child,

1165
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,100
just chide them so good and so loud and so scary.

1166
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:22,740
Oh boy, it's kind of sad, this one.

1167
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:26,260
Oh no, I just got a sad doll.

1168
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,780
You know, I don't know.

1169
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:33,460
All right.

1170
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,060
I bummed myself out with this one

1171
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,580
because somebody is gonna buy themselves

1172
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,020
a haunted doll for Christmas.

1173
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,140
Oh yeah, yeah.

1174
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,060
That bums me out, I shouldn't have thought about that.

1175
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,900
Well, maybe it could be like a Christmas shoe situation.

1176
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,400
Ooh.

1177
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:50,660
And it's like if mama meets Jesus tonight

1178
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:54,100
and needs a ghost to guide her up the spiral pathway

1179
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,900
into the crystal heavens.

1180
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,060
If mama meets Jesus tonight,

1181
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:02,580
I wanna have a doll for her spirit to leap into.

1182
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:06,500
I'm channeling my mom's ghost into this special Christmas doll.

1183
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:10,980
Do they sell husks on eBay or is that just,

1184
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,340
can I go, if I go into any like American girl store,

1185
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,260
is it just Husk City, baby?

1186
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:16,820
Husk, Husk City.

1187
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:21,300
The way this population is expanding daily,

1188
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,820
we are soon going to have two designations,

1189
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,700
dolls and not haunted dolls.

1190
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,500
Those would be the two different things there are

1191
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,420
because it would be such a rarity to find

1192
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,500
one that doesn't have a ghost inside of it.

1193
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,220
Yeah, it's like trying to find an apartment.

1194
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:37,700
You know what I mean?

1195
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,660
You're gonna have to find a real,

1196
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,860
like when you die, you're like,

1197
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:40,900
I'd really like to,

1198
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,500
but I can't find an empty doll anywhere, Jesus.

1199
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,660
Yeah, this is how like Polly Pocket

1200
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,180
and all that shit came about.

1201
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,620
This is just sort of efficiency.

1202
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,460
Just that you get a big box full of Polly Pockets,

1203
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,500
you fit like, you know, 60,000 people in that one.

1204
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,900
You ever see that Matt Damon movie?

1205
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,700
Yep, it's awesome.

1206
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,260
He gets shrunk down and he gets put in a hell box

1207
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,980
full of just a bunch of writhing flesh.

1208
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,980
It's really, it's funny.

1209
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,540
It's a funny movie.

1210
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,780
Honey, I Shrunk the Matt, I believe it was called.

1211
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,860
Meet Matt, because he pilots a giant Matt Damon.

1212
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,460
Hey folks, that's going to do it for us

1213
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,820
for this episode of our podcast,

1214
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:19,780
My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1215
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:23,700
We hope you've had a deliciously spooky time with us here.

1216
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:28,260
We would remind you, though, that you should please go vote.

1217
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,660
Please go vote, freaking people, please.

1218
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,220
Did I go vote? Did I go vote?

1219
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,700
Did you? Please go vote.

1220
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:42,740
So we got a mailing list that is going to get rolling here.

1221
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:46,900
The first one may have already gone out, possibly.

1222
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,780
Is that possible?

1223
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:51,060
May have, but you want to sign up for it.

1224
00:51:51,060 --> 00:52:00,260
Go to bit.ly forward slash McElroy Mail, M-A-I-L.

1225
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,340
It's not a pyramid scheme.

1226
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:06,180
And a lot of people have been buzzing about that.

1227
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,020
I don't know who keeps saying that.

1228
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,260
It's not a pyramid scheme, just a regular mailing list.

1229
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:15,060
I also want to say, if you are anywhere near the Cincinnati area,

1230
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,300
I've got one of my Underground Society shows

1231
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,220
coming up November 16th.

1232
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:24,660
You can get tickets for that at bit.ly slash cus November 2018.

1233
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,740
We've got a lot of fun guests,

1234
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,460
and you can come out and hang out with a bunch of cool people,

1235
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,860
and you'll find out who the guests are once you get there

1236
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,260
and join the society or whatnot.

1237
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,180
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1238
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,940
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1239
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,700
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1240
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,540
Fantastic song, fantastic album, good band, great band, great dude,

1241
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,900
good times, great oldies.

1242
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,540
I also want to thank MaxFun for having us on the network.

1243
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,740
Go to maximumfun.org.

1244
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:52,500
Just start clicking on shit, and you will find so many good shows.

1245
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,020
And you're going to love listening to them.

1246
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,340
We have other stuff at mcroyshows.com.

1247
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,380
Anything else, boys?

1248
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1249
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:02,740
We've got exciting new stuff at mcroymerch.com,

1250
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,700
including, I believe, some like Candle Night stuff

1251
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,740
you should go check out.

1252
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:13,300
And also, we've got our shows coming up in Denver and Austin,

1253
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,380
so please send your questions in for that

1254
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,540
with Denver and Austin in the subject line.

1255
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,500
And the Adventure Zone graphic novel, Book 2,

1256
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:25,700
is available for pre-order now at theadventurezonecomic.com.

1257
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,060
How about a final Yahoo?

1258
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:27,620
Yes, please.

1259
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,060
It was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

1260
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:29,780
Thank you, Adrian.

1261
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:31,540
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

1262
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,020
who I'm going to call Julian, who asks,

1263
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:39,620
if I can catch a scorpion, does it become my pet?

1264
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,220
My name is Justin McElroy.

1265
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,580
I'm Travis McElroy.

1266
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,180
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1267
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,460
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1268
00:53:47,460 --> 00:54:02,260
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

1269
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,180
Maximumfun.org.

1270
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,220
Comedy and culture.

1271
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,340
Artist-owned.

1272
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,380
Listener-supported.

1273
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:14,500
We've all made mistakes in book club, right?

1274
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,940
You drink a little too much.

1275
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,300
You don't actually read the book.

1276
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,420
And if you're under the bubble in Fairhaven,

1277
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,620
your individual will get subsumed by the collective.

1278
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:27,060
Hey, maybe I just let him go and whip us up some guac.

1279
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,980
We do not require guac.

1280
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,420
We require only nutrients and expansion.

1281
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,820
You will become book club.

1282
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:37,940
You will eat, pray, and love with us.

1283
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:38,740
Join us.

1284
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,300
Eat, pray, and love with us.

1285
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,580
Join book club.

1286
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,420
