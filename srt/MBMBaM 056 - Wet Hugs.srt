1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:49,760
Welcome to the first My Brother, My Brother, and Me direct

6
00:00:51,120 --> 00:01:00,000
from heaven. The Holy of Holies. Post-Rapture, got swept up, what's that, swept away? If you

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,080
didn't get left behind, you got swept away. Uh, and now we're here. We're up here and we did it.

8
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,640
We did it. It's super nice. Um, nobody has belly buttons, which is kind of weird. That was a

9
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:20,800
surprise. Um, and they, they show, uh, to catch a predator reruns all day cause that shows pretty

10
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:27,120
much always great to always goes down super smooth. There, there is one downside. Tell me.

11
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,760
Griffin got left behind. Griffin did get left behind. Uh, what we have done is made a deal with

12
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:40,000
the devil that once a week we can go back to earth to record an advice show for the modern era.

13
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,600
Uh, not this week, this week, Jesus let Griffin come up to see what he's missing. Guys, guys. Yeah.

14
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,360
You guys, seriously, me and Kirk Cameron are tight, tight bros now. Yeah. Did he get, wait,

15
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,160
did he get left behind? He did as sort of an envoy. Okay. That's his new, his new role is

16
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,000
Kirk Cameron envoy to the stars. Uh, it's just me and him just fucking rapping about bananas

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,240
and how good they are. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is Kirk Cameron in bananas?

18
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,760
He's like super heavy. Never seen that, that clip that YouTube clip. Now he's like,

19
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,040
he talks about bananas and he's like bananas prove that God exists. Um, because there's just

20
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,840
so perfect. It's just so perfect. These bananas could not possibly be some sort of cosmic accident.

21
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,560
And like, I get it Kirk, like they're delicious and they fit right in your hand and they have

22
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,760
a natural shell and they have potassium and shit. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. They're delish.

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,600
Um, so, so yeah, it's just me and Kirk now. Wait, so everyone got swept up except you and Kirk

24
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,520
Cameron. Yeah. We are the only two people left on earth. Whoa. Is that weird? Is that awkward for

25
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,400
you? Uh, it was, I'll be honest, it was weird at first and I'll be even more honest. It's still

26
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,920
really weird. Still pretty weird, right? Still like pretty weird all the time. So, um, I miss,

27
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,400
I miss you guys. I miss, I miss everyone who isn't Kirk Cameron at this point. Um, oh wow. So,

28
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,120
so like a lot, there's a lot of people you miss. Is that weird to tell him that?

29
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,720
Fucking nonstop bananas. Like dude, I get it. Talk about something else. Like you were on

30
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,440
growing pains, right? Let's rap about growing pains. Please. Anything but these bananas.

31
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,560
What was it like literally anything else? The video game hoard. Was that fun? Just tell me

32
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,320
anything Kirk. So if Griffin had a question about how to best handle Kirk Cameron, he could turn to

33
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,840
my brother, my brother and me. It's an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

34
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,760
Justin McElroy heaven. I'm your middle, this brother, Travis McElroy. I am your youngest,

35
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:53,360
uh, he even his brother, I guess. That's true. Evilist heathenist. Well, let's, let's be honest,

36
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:01,120
Jewish ist of the three of us. I think that that no, that's fair. Yeah. You're the most Jewish,

37
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,640
I think. Which again, another huge point of contention between me and Kirk loves bananas.

38
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,360
Not quite as big a fan of the chosen people. Kirk loves bananas. Griffin loves Elaine Boozler.

39
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,120
I think she's just a hoot. Let's get it right in the questions. My, uh, six month anniversary is

40
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,440
coming up and I don't know what I should do. I've been told everything from just dinner to a movie

41
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:31,760
to flowers to jewelry. What? What do you guys think is the appropriate thing to do for six

42
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,600
month anniversary? I am 22. My girlfriend is 21. Our anniversary is on Monday the 23rd,

43
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,360
but I'll listen to your show in the morning and won't be seeing her to the evening.

44
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,440
So I will be able to act on your wisdom before I see her. That's from Joe. Joe,

45
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,160
do want to clarify real quick. We do not advise you take any of the advice we give you. There's

46
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,200
a lot of pressure on me. Now this feels like do you skip the first 45 seconds of the show?

47
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,040
Like how do you not know? Don't do our shit. Our shit is bad. The shit is bad. Now this,

48
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,120
what I'm about to say is going to sound like one of those like,

49
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,880
wow, Travis just said really bad advice. Wow. When Travis has to preface his bad advice,

50
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,400
you know it's about to get dirty. I'm almost certain that a six month anniversary,

51
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,960
what you have to do is say, oh hey, happy anniversary. It's been six months, I guess.

52
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,360
I go, you know, I'm going to go with Trav on this one. You do not want to set,

53
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,240
at if anything, the six month anniversary is the appropriate time for an expectations

54
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,960
lowering game. You do not want to start pushing the bar up. Is that just so you can flip it at

55
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,240
the one year when it really counts? Do a dynamite job at the years, but six months?

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,600
Just figure out right now what you are going to get her at one year and then cut that thing in

57
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,800
half and give, uh huh. Well cut like, baby, I got you this sweet diamond brooch. Uh,

58
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,200
just kidding. I got you half of a sweet diamond brooch because this doesn't matter what we're

59
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,760
doing or it will, it will in six months. And I do want to thank you for my gift,

60
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,240
crumbed lawn, a broad sword that cuts diamonds.

61
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,200
That was very thoughtful of you. You got me to give me crumbed lawn.

62
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:21,440
You got me the blessed sky blade and I used it and I cut. This is, this is Rufus. He is your dog,

63
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,120
but this is half of him. You'll get the other half in exactly six months.

64
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,880
If when in doubt, ask your partner, ask like, Hey, so we're going to do something for the six

65
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,880
month anniversary. What would you like to do? Yeah. Get that dialogue going now.

66
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,360
I want to treat you right. How do you want me to treat you?

67
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,480
Come back and be like, I want to do something special or more than likely,

68
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,600
she's going to come back and say, I don't really care.

69
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,320
I hear Burger King has a new sandwich. Let's check it out.

70
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,800
Honestly, man, six months. The victory is going to be that you remembered.

71
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,040
Yeah.

72
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,800
A card, a card. Yeah. I remember this. You impressed the odds were against me.

73
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,040
We're calling this, but I did. I triumphed over the odds. Um, I,

74
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,720
people who listen to this show regularly know that we have, we do have a romantic streak,

75
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,760
but this is the sort of empty sentimentality that I don't think serves anybody any good.

76
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,760
It only is like a stressor for you. And, um, it's false importance.

77
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:27,040
And, and just to break it down and take it a little bit further anniversary, like the word

78
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:33,680
means the celebration of a year gone past Anna is a year. So to say what it's a, what it's a

79
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:43,120
versary, a versary from the old times, a pagan ritual. We fucking did it. It means we fucking

80
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,760
did it in the old days. Like, like a couple of like sports players high-fiving in the changing

81
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,560
room. Oh yeah. Give your girlfriend a nice pat on the bottom and say good game. They said it

82
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,040
couldn't be done. That's a good tone to set for the day. Actually. They said it couldn't be done.

83
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,840
Maybe you should finally tell her that you love her, Joe. You've been holding onto that car for

84
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,840
a while. Joe, play that card. She's ready. Hey, get this next question. This is weird.

85
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,640
I've been dating my boyfriend for almost six months and we don't live together. I know.

86
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:22,800
It's a crossover. It's a crossover event. Uh, I have it sweeps. So we gotta go big. I have way

87
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,920
more vacation time from work than he does. And that sucks, but I want to be able. Did you like

88
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,640
the, uh, how emphatic I'm reading questions? You really got in there. I'm really bringing it.

89
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,640
And I want to be able to have fun with my time off. Even if he can't be with me,

90
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,080
I love to go backpacking and I'm in a backpacking group. That's not exists. Refuse to believe that

91
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,240
exists. That plans on five or six trips a year. There's an awesome one plan for the end of the

92
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,720
month. But my boyfriend said he can't get the time off from work. He is self described as very jealous

93
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,200
and he doesn't like any of the men he knows who are going on this trip. I want to go. He doesn't

94
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,600
want to go. And we've been fighting about it every day for too long. If you brothers tell me I'm

95
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:10,720
wrong, I am ready to give in help. Please. Controversial in California. Oh God, this is a

96
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,760
fucking sticky one. Listen, it is. That is exactly right. Cause things are going to get sticky on

97
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,600
that backpack. We know what happened on the backpacking trips. What do you have in that

98
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,480
backpack? Fucking whipped cream. Fucking those like the, the balls that you put in your butt

99
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,280
to make the sex feel better. We know. Why does your backpack say lube bag on it? We know what

100
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:40,640
you're doing in those deep, dark, stinky woods. We know what you're getting up to. Like don't

101
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,120
play us and don't play your boyfriend on these backpacking trips. When you want to keep bugs

102
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,800
away, you spray on because that's how, that's how on it is. That's how deeply, deeply on

103
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:58,000
uh, backpacking trips go. It gets sticky in there. It gets so sticky that the, that deep

104
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,480
has pheromones in it that just drives fellas wild. Hey, Hey Phillip, do you need me to help you

105
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,160
put your tent up? Bad news, Shelly. I already popped a tent. Check it down there. You done?

106
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,480
Did I mean my dick? That's what you did to me with your curves and your Berkeys and your Birkin

107
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:24,800
socks and your sweet khaki shorts. Let me get some of that gorp. I'm starving. I gotta carve

108
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:35,120
up before I love you. Uh, I, uh, I, oh man. Jealousy is a, is a bad vibe, especially for

109
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,520
somebody you've been with for six months. Like that six months is a really important amount of

110
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:49,760
time. I mean that, I think that that is, this is like one of those, we've been together six months.

111
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,000
He's got this big problem. How do I sort of step around it? And I honestly think that whether it's,

112
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,160
you know, whether this is your battleground or not, kind of get past that jealousy thing.

113
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,240
Yeah. That's it. Cause what jealousy, like the root of jealousy is always trust. You know what

114
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,520
I mean? Like, yeah. And guys will always say, people always say, it's not that I don't trust

115
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,400
you. It's that I don't trust everyone else. Yeah. It's like, well, you should probably still trust

116
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:21,360
me. And the root of a tree is a root and you got to get up in nature while it's still here. How much

117
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,840
longer do we have all these trees? Oh, you're saying I read an advantage. I read a science

118
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,560
book the other day and it was like, guys, we got like maybe another five or six years with these

119
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,080
trees and then they're all gone. And then they paved paradise and put up a parking lot, just the

120
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,000
whole planet, just one big parking lot. And then who's going to feel fucking silly. Then you have

121
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,960
to go backpacking through the tree museum. And then it's like, get those people out of here.

122
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,480
You're going to have these giant natural sex orgies and you won't have the shade provided by

123
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,320
mother nature. And everyone's going to get burns on their privates. Everyone's going to get private

124
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,760
burns. So just do it while you still can. God, you're so young. You're so young. Just go love the

125
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,120
world. Just get out there and love Philip. It's a guy you're backpacking with. Have fun. Eat some

126
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,640
gorp. Maybe you have a little sex. Climb a tree. Watch out for mosquitoes. And don't tell him about

127
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,000
what happens. Don't you ever tell him. Just to relieve your guilt that he'll never get over that.

128
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,360
Griffin. Three barn owls watched me have sex in a tree. It was the most spiritual erotic experience

129
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,200
in my life. Do you want to Yahoo? Is that what you were saying my name for? Who is boning so good

130
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,840
down there? Hey, how about this Yahoo? I'm going to go snatch a field mouse out of that man's.

131
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,080
Why does that man have a field mouse down there? This is weird. I'm going to turn that into a

132
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,360
bolus. Why is there a condom in this pellet? Hey science, get over here and look at this pellet.

133
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:52,160
Um, this Yahoo was sent in by Curly Head Poet. Thank you Curly Head Poet. It's by Yahoo answers

134
00:12:52,160 --> 00:13:00,960
user Kevin B and it's the saddest thing I've ever read. Okay. Kevin B asks what do hugs feel like?

135
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:10,160
I see people hug in school all the time. What's it like? I've never hugged. I've never hugged

136
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,800
or been hugged by anyone. Can you please describe it in detail? Oh God, no.

137
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh Jesus. I'm going to cry. I know. Oh, it got real. It got so real in here. Give me the guy's

138
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,400
name again. Kevin B. Kevin B. Kev. Um, I mean let's break it down. You're not that great Kev.

139
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,960
Yeah, hugs are gross. I wish I had never had a hug on me from a parent or family or a loved one.

140
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,680
It feels like the beginning of a Pixar movie where Kevin B now goes off and invents a robot

141
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:54,320
to hug him. I just can't. How do you go your whole life avoiding? I hug people. I work from home and

142
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,920
rarely leave my home and I still hug 10 to 12 people every day. Yeah. You know what Kevin,

143
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,000
you got to get out there and start hugging strangers. Is it possible he's like a human

144
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,920
porcupine? Oh, you think he's got porcupitis? Yeah. You guys remember that Dave Matthews

145
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,200
band video every day where you just like go, the guy wakes up and he just walks around the street

146
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,880
hugging people and it's like, lift me up love. And he just goes around hugging people. Uh huh.

147
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,960
You know that music, the music video I'm talking about. Yeah. Is that who that is? Uh huh. All

148
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:34,240
right. That's wow. Travis, you're like a fucking DMV. DMV scholar over there. Yeah. That's what you

149
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,440
got to do. You got to go get your hands dirty and by hands, I mean arms because hugging is a dirty

150
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,280
thing. Do you know how, you know, Dave Matthews band is weird because pretty much every band

151
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:53,040
that people like to brag that they were into them before something. I think that Dave Matthews band,

152
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:00,160
the more impressive thing is to, is to be a fan after. Yeah. I'm still into them. After violin

153
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,720
guy died, I was still there. Like I was still, I was into Dave Matthews band far, far, far after

154
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,680
it was fashionable. Even after he just became Dave Matthews and then realized he still needed his

155
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,440
band. I'm still there. Still there for him. Um, a lot of people heard American baby and were like,

156
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,520
oh, this is the worst goddamn song ever crafted by man. I can never listen to this band again.

157
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,720
A lot of people. Crank it up. I will see you in Charlotte. It was like a Dave Matthews rapture.

158
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:38,640
Yeah. And I was left behind. Um, hugs, hugs feel like you're wearing another person. Is that a

159
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:45,280
person jacket? It's like you're wearing another man or woman as a jacket or coat or scarf.

160
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,440
And they protect you. A lot of people say sex is like the closest the two people can be to each

161
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:59,440
other. I disagree. Cause I think sex is like a wet hug. Sex is like a wet hug. Go on.

162
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:08,000
You've got me so far. Sex is like a wet hug that you can only do with like one or two people

163
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
once you marry them. Okay. A hug, a dry hug, if you will, which is the parlance I'm going to use

164
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,200
for the rest of my life. A dry hug. That was a good dry hug we just had. That was a good dry hug.

165
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:26,400
It could have been moisture, but we don't, we're not at that level yet. Um, I think a dry hug is

166
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,080
the second closest you can be to a person, I think, but you can do it to more people and you won't get

167
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:39,600
any STDs unless, can you? From a hug? Yeah. A really good dry hug. I don't know if you're at

168
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,960
a Dave Matthews band concert. Absolutely. Certainly. Certainly. You're not coming out of that,

169
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:50,480
that, uh, dog pile without a few fleas, a few sex fleas, you know, if you know what I mean,

170
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,720
I think you do. Um, as a, as a home brewer, a few times every year, I host a beer party

171
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,320
to share my works with about 10 to 15 friends. I decided trying this with an MB and BAM listening

172
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,600
party could be fun. I would be compelled, however, to make a brothers McElroy ale,

173
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:14,800
which brings me to my question. What should it be in the BIM BAM brew? What should it be called?

174
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Brian? Hmm. I think my BIM brew. My BIM brew is pretty good. Yeah. My brewski, my brewski and me.

175
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:30,560
That's good. What about, what about sex gas? Like it gives you that, it gives you like the energy

176
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:38,560
that you need to make sex. Sex fuel. That seems, I would never say that about beer. I've never,

177
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:44,560
I've never, I can't think of a single beer I've ever drank where I felt more virile after

178
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:53,040
consuming the beverage. Um, I would like it if it had notes of coriander. Okay. And blueberries.

179
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Fennel seeds just floating in there. I don't want the flavor of fennel seeds. I want whole fennel seeds.

180
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,520
Whole fennel seeds. You know what? Let's just say, think of all the flavors and notes and hints

181
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,320
you could get into a beer and just put them all in there and call it my brother, my brother and me

182
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:17,680
flavor explosion. What if, um, what do you. It would be disgusting. Like hands down. What do I like?

183
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:26,880
I like beer. A crisp pale ale. Um, I also like candy. So, um, what if we threw some Skittles

184
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,040
and Starburst into a pale ale and we called it my brother and my brother and me candy beer?

185
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:39,200
Candy beer. Candy beer for kids. For the rest of us. Diabeardies. I've always thought of pale ale

186
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,840
to be like a medium through which candy can be delivered. I've just never had the, the,

187
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,720
I don't know, courage, I guess, to mix those two worlds together. Hey Brian, this is pretty good

188
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,800
beer. This, uh, sex fuel that you've made, uh, this MB&B AM sex fuel. Uh, why is there a whole

189
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,080
Werther's original in, in the bottom of this? How do you even do that? Is I'm trying to get drunk,

190
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,080
but there, this, this beer is just full of gummy worms and I don't know how to think. I don't know

191
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,640
how to deal with that. Brian, this is delicious. Are these sugar babies? Cause I didn't even know

192
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,000
they made these anymore. Where did you find sugar babies, Brian? This beer kind of tastes

193
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,840
like Necco wafers and I'm upset about it. Who could I talk to? But I'm getting drunker. I am

194
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,120
drunk. That's good. Isn't this bubble tape? The whole beer is wrapped in bubble tape. That sounds

195
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,760
delicious. There's some, there's a lot of possibilities here. A lot of spaces we could

196
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,600
explore. Actually, it doesn't even have to be the same candy in each beer. Like we, one could,

197
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,080
like you could buy a six pack and in that six pack, oh, this one's got dots and this one's got

198
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,960
a bit of honey and this one has an entire Snickers bar. How did they get that Snickers bar in there?

199
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,000
This is incredible. They must have brewed it in there like the mouse in the Coke bottle.

200
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,640
So Brian, I look forward to drinking your beer. Travis made beer one time. You remember that?

201
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,080
Yes. How would you rate the flavor factor of the beer that you made?

202
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:11,440
I thought it was just fine. Okay. Did it do the job? It did. I always think that's a satisfying

203
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,960
drunk. The drunk that you made yourself. It's like the little red hen though. Cause no one

204
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,320
would help me brew the beer, but then everyone wanted to help me drink the beer. That's not true

205
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,000
at all. Except no one wanted to drink the beer. Yeah. It's like the little dead hen.

206
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:37,440
My BF broke up with me six months ago and I was devastated. He moved home. We only talk about once

207
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,480
a month now. He constantly texts me saying I miss you or I've been thinking about you a lot, or

208
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,560
I am still very much in love with you. Oh no, no. She's still very much in love with him

209
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:55,520
and is confused by the mixed signals. What's the deal? Confused and love. The most bullshit.

210
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:03,120
He's such a cocksucker. I fucking hate this dude. Insanely. What a bitch. Fuck that guy.

211
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,040
Hey, try this one on for size. Next time he texts you with any of that garbage or anything at all,

212
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:16,560
I don't care if it's like a mass happy birthday Jesus Christmas text. Tell him to go fuck himself.

213
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:22,080
Yeah. Go right and fuck himself. Trust me on this one. Burn this fucking bridge. This

214
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:29,600
cocksucker moved on, said I'm going to find a BBD that of course stands for as developed by Richard

215
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:37,120
Ginny in the hit film The Mask. A bigger, better deal. He went on for the BBD and he got some other

216
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,880
something that he liked better. Something new. A girl he met at a Dave Matthews band concert.

217
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,640
Hey, before these crowded streets, I want to have sex with you behind the port of John.

218
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:56,240
And then he moved on. It's hard for you to move on. Next time he texts you, just right away text

219
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,320
back. Go suck a dick. What he's doing is he's either A stringing you along so that when he

220
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,760
comes to visit, he's going to try to sleep with you. No strings attached. Like that movie. No

221
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:15,360
strings attached. Exactly like the movie. No strings attached. On DirecTV now. Or he's using

222
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,800
you as an outlet for like he's kind of lonely sitting at home and he wants to flirt with

223
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,920
somebody and he thinks you're low hanging fruit and you need to tell him to fuck right off.

224
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,720
You are the highest hanging fruit. You are perched atop the tree like a Christmas star.

225
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,960
You are not in love with him. You may think you are. You're not because he's an asshole.

226
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:44,800
Listen, he may be just not that into you as they say. Available on DirecTV. Available on DirecTV now.

227
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,920
But you need to get out of this sort of this tete-a-tete. You need to stop being into him

228
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,400
at all. You need not to be. Whatever the opposite of into somebody is, you need to be that.

229
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:05,120
Do you want me to fight him? Griffin will fight him for your love. That's what we're saying to

230
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:12,240
you. And it would mean more to me. That's for god damn sure. I need it. I'll fight for it.

231
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,160
Griffin needs to fight somebody for something god damn it. How about a yahoo answer? Yeah.

232
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,520
Um, how about this? Uh, this one was sent in by Gali Ayali. Thank you, Gali Ayali. It's by yahoo

233
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:30,400
answers user Yeti Education Committee. Do you want to go ahead and imagine what the tone of

234
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,720
this question is going to be? Somebody finally step up and started educating these yetis.

235
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:44,320
Yahoo answers user Yeti Education Committee asks, do you think it is possible for Yeti

236
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,480
to accept Jesus Christ as their savior or does God not want Yeti in heaven?

237
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,440
Assume the Yeti speaks English, the language of Jesus.

238
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:02,880
Fuck me. Fuck. Okay. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. This question supposes so many things. First of all,

239
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,160
do people who not speak English, are they just automatically, they just don't get to go to heaven?

240
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,960
Uh huh. Okay. That shouldn't be my main problem with this question, but nope. It's the first thing

241
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:21,840
that gets sprung to mind. Yetis have souls, I think, but they're like pet souls. Every rock

242
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,240
and tree and creature has a soul. Rocks I'm going to quibble with you on. Okay. And probably trees.

243
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:35,600
All right. Well trees grow. What kind of trees? Not fir trees. No, fuck fir trees. Deciduous trees.

244
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,560
Deciduous trees have souls. Caniferous? No. No. Are you saying you don't want trees in heaven?

245
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,720
That's what this, that's what this has to boil down to. I don't want deciduous trees in heaven.

246
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,880
God may or may not want Yeti in heaven. I certainly don't. What if like maybe he lets him in heaven,

247
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,200
maybe he doesn't, but he starts spreading a rumor that there's some Yetis up there.

248
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,320
Wouldn't that be a bummer if you got to heaven and again the existence of the Yeti was not confirmed?

249
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:08,640
It was, it was rumored like can you leave giant paw prints in clouds? All right. If, if my choices

250
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:16,400
are to be ever tortured by the possibility of Sasquatches. Yeah. Or to have my, to be literally

251
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:24,160
tortured by having my arms torn off by Sasquatches, which is their favorite activity. Yeah. I would go

252
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:30,800
with the former every time because I love my arms. I hug with them. If you're Kevin's friend,

253
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,560
of course, that wouldn't, wouldn't matter so much. Wouldn't be quite so big of a deal,

254
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,760
but I'm not, I'm, I don't, I'm not acquainted with Kevin. I like my hugs.

255
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:48,400
The Sasquatch that is a, is a mythical creature, which means that he comes down from heaven

256
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,800
whenever he's on earth. Like if you see him on earth, that means he's

257
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,040
vacationing basically from heaven. The Yeti is an angel?

258
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:01,280
Yeah. He's down there spreading the word of God in English, Jesus' language to the penguins.

259
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,040
Do you guys know my favorite episode of Touched by an Angel?

260
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,400
It's the one where the Yeti came down and fucking hung out with that Scottish chick.

261
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,440
Touched by a Yeti.

262
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,480
I like the one where Roba Downey-

263
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,360
Crushed by a Yeti.

264
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,800
I like the one where Roba Downey ripped that dude's arms off.

265
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,600
I'm a Yeti sent by grrrrrrrrrap.

266
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,640
Give me that arm.

267
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,160
Arms ripped off by an angel.

268
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,720
I, uh, I, uh, I think the big surprise for this guy is gonna be when he gets to heaven

269
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,840
and Jesus is a Yeti.

270
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,280
This whole time.

271
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,080
I know you guys were like arguing-

272
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,360
He speaks Arabic.

273
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,440
You guys were arguing like, is he white? Is he Arabic? What's this? Nope, you missed it.

274
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,760
Not even human. I'm a Yeti.

275
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,160
Yeti.

276
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,080
Guess what? The big man, big God, he's a Yeti too. I'm cutting his image.

277
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,000
Pretty much everybody. Loki, he was a Yeti.

278
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,720
He's a Yeti. He's up here making tricks and jokes.

279
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,600
Thor is half Yeti.

280
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,800
Thor is half Yeti. Jim Morrison was a Yeti this whole time.

281
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,520
Full blown Yeti.

282
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,280
Jim Morrison won't be in heaven.

283
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,320
Don't be ridiculous.

284
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,200
Jim Belushi, complete Yeti.

285
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,720
Shaved Yeti.

286
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,440
Getty Lee, his actual name is Yeti Lee.

287
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,080
He's not dead yet, but he is a Yeti.

288
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,920
Yeah, that's where he gets all his base groups from, from his Yeti powers.

289
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,040
Bootsy Collins, most bases and bands are Yetis.

290
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,640
Most people you see on the streets are Yetis, I would say.

291
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,520
Guys, I have something to tell you.

292
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,080
Yeah, tell me.

293
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,600
I'm a Yeti.

294
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:46,160
That's why I didn't get into heaven, because I'm already like a resident.

295
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,080
We've been saving it for the season finale, and this is the twist.

296
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,440
Shocking reveal of my true nature.

297
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,560
I've got Yeti DNA and skin and like Yeti skin and fur and teeth and stuff.

298
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,360
That person you had the live show didn't look like a Yeti.

299
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,240
It's because it wasn't me.

300
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,000
What?

301
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,360
It was an actor?

302
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,320
It was my familiar.

303
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,760
Every Yeti gets a familiar.

304
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,120
A one human familiar.

305
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,640
So that was mine.

306
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,080
His name is Mike.

307
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,040
He's pretty cool, I guess.

308
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,000
Yeah, that's just something I hope that you will still let me do the show.

309
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,520
Honestly, Griffin, I don't know that I'm comfortable.

310
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,440
I think after the summer, we'll leave this as like a cliffhanger.

311
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,960
To recap, Griffin told us a Yeti, and we may not let him stay on the show.

312
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,680
Bernard, our lovable lab tech, was shot in a hold up, and he's in the alley.

313
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,280
We don't know if he's going to live or die.

314
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,640
He has no arms, but I had nothing to do with that.

315
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,400
Stop trying to pin this on me.

316
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Especially you without arms.

317
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,440
That's impossible.

318
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,560
Could be so Yeti-ist.

319
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,720
Yeti-phobe.

320
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,280
Yeti-phobe.

321
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,600
Griffin, all this talk of Yetis has watered my mouth for money.

322
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,240
Yeah, me too.

323
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:24,320
Such a happy trip to the Money Zone this week.

324
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,960
First off is our buddy Michael McLaughlin, who wants to congratulate his friends

325
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,160
Jenny and Zach on their recent wedding.

326
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,720
Travis, tell me about Zach and Jenny Murphy.

327
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,480
Well, they've been together for six years, beginning of their sophomore year in high

328
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,880
school.

329
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,200
Wow, high school sweethearts.

330
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,000
Love it.

331
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,040
They said it wouldn't last, and look at them killing it.

332
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,120
They have a beautiful child named Kennedy.

333
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,440
Have they been together for six years, or have they been together for 12 six-month periods?

334
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,720
It's something to think about.

335
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,560
Jenny is a big fan of podcasts, especially our podcast.

336
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,600
Zach, not a fan.

337
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,200
He's not enjoying our show.

338
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,160
Door's that way.

339
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,880
Hey, Zach, don't let it hit you where Yeti God split you.

340
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,960
He will tear you in half.

341
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,880
By that, I do mean tear your arms off, yes.

342
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,000
All right, so we got some good vibes going on to you guys from Mike, Courtney, and Kyle.

343
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,320
That's Courtney with a K in case you know Courtney with a C.

344
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,120
And Kyle with a C.

345
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,960
And Kyle with a C.

346
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,840
And Jenny with an I.

347
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,200
Mike with an R.

348
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,120
Zach with a T.

349
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,320
They wish them all the best and many happy years.

350
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:47,120
How many, can we make that less, can we just clear that up like exactly how many years?

351
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,600
For $100, they get 20 happy years.

352
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:51,920
Whoa.

353
00:30:52,560 --> 00:31:03,040
If he had paid a little bit more, we can guarantee you up to 25, 26 to 27 years tops.

354
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,040
Enjoy the next two decades because it's all downhill after that.

355
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,640
Well, then they can re-up and pay another $100 for another 20 years.

356
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,200
I can't guarantee the same rates, but yeah, they can re-up.

357
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,480
Oh no, by that point.

358
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,840
With inflation and whatnot, it will be like a thousand Mars dollars.

359
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,080
And the popularization of space credits, sure.

360
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,580
Yeah.

361
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,080
Also another one, Ryan Math wants to congratulate his girlfriend Kat Crosslin

362
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,640
on getting admitted to the NYU nursing program.

363
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:28,960
Nice.

364
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,840
Hey, congrats.

365
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,720
Way to go, Kat.

366
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,600
She's currently living like a bum without a job in Brooklyn.

367
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,400
I say like a boss without a job in Brooklyn

368
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,840
till she starts nursing school in September while the rest of us slave away in the heat.

369
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,440
So Kat, that's exciting.

370
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,360
We're proud of you.

371
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,320
I'm proud of you.

372
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,280
I'm proud of you too.

373
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,360
I'm not proud that you don't have a job.

374
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,560
What's up with that?

375
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,840
Just because you're in school, you think you're too good for employment?

376
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,520
I will emphatically say that I do not respect your choice to not be employed,

377
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,960
but it sounds like Ryan's able to pay to have us take congratulations.

378
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,480
So he's obviously rolling in it.

379
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,760
Could I suggest as a job freelance nursing?

380
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,440
That's illegal, I'm pretty sure.

381
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,640
Oh, so like he gets, she gets like an early start before she knows anything.

382
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,680
Yeah, so she just starts rolling around and like she sees someone fall down,

383
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,720
she slaps a bandage on him.

384
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,920
She's like, that'll be 10 bucks.

385
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,400
Well, listen, from what I know about nursing, it's a lot of disimpacting bowels,

386
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,480
which I'm not sure you want to do to a stranger.

387
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,160
There's a lot of touching dick, like shaving dick, like a lot of shaving dicks.

388
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,000
Like Kat, I don't mean to burst your bubble, but this is a life that you have subscribed to.

389
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,120
Um, and maybe you don't want to do that to strangers on the street.

390
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,840
Uh, I'll, I'll shave a stranger's balls.

391
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,680
Maybe she could have me come in as a sub, as a substitute.

392
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,360
Like tag team those balls.

393
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,480
Now, Justin, were you going to finish that sentence with for money?

394
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,440
Are you just saying like in general, you're out of money?

395
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,680
Yeah, that's what I, that's what I meant.

396
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,480
It would have to be for money.

397
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,920
Sure, for money.

398
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,840
I wouldn't, I wouldn't shave a man's scrotum for free.

399
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,280
Well, it depends on the man, right?

400
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,880
Like, um, what if it's George Lucas?

401
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,960
I wouldn't mind hanging out with him for like a minute or however long.

402
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,880
Well, it depends on what the minute is.

403
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,320
Like for that minute, I think I would mind it pretty bad.

404
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,520
You can't think of it like a person you want to hang out with so much that like you wouldn't

405
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,320
want to hang out with Elvis Costello so much that you wouldn't mind that during that minute

406
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,680
you'd be shaving his balls.

407
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,840
There's not a human being on this God's green light.

408
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,760
On God's green earth.

409
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,440
On all of history.

410
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,240
On all of history?

411
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,040
There's not a single person in history whose balls I would shave to hang out with.

412
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,160
Thomas Jefferson.

413
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,840
You wouldn't shave his balls so you can hang out with the father of America.

414
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:52,640
No.

415
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,400
George Washington.

416
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,600
He had slave wives for that.

417
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,320
Amadeus.

418
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,920
Amadeus, he was hairless.

419
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:06,960
Nikolai Tesla. Tesla fried all his ball sack hair off in a failed experiment and he looked

420
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,840
like David Bowie.

421
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,040
I'm going to reject the person question.

422
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,400
David Bowie.

423
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,280
David Bowie?

424
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,640
Cosplaying as Nikola Tesla maybe.

425
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,400
In the hit film Prestige.

426
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,360
Prestiginist.

427
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,280
That's all I could- those are the best people that I just named that have ever happened

428
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,680
to us.

429
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,080
Yeah.

430
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,680
Why don't you give me a quick list there?

431
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,200
Where- where'd he?

432
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,760
Your future child all grown up.

433
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:32,960
Think-

434
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,680
Oh God.

435
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,400
Think about that.

436
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,440
You're saying- you're saying to get to see him, this future theoretical baby, as an older

437
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:41,600
adult.

438
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,760
Well he's grown up, he's an adult.

439
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,480
He's all grown up.

440
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:52,080
Like see- okay, if I could see all- if I could see all of my ancestors, like through history,

441
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:58,000
like the ones that would come after me, if I could see you down that particular future

442
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,280
well, like seven, eight, nine, ten generations down, I would shave each of their balls to

443
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,080
get to meet that, because I think that would be pretty special.

444
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,200
I found it!

445
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,440
I knew I could find it if I went long enough.

446
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,440
You could get a sports almanac from one of them, where you get all kinds of sweet facts

447
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,840
and it'd be like, what's the secret to your success?

448
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,000
And it's like, oh I shaved my grandson's balls.

449
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I shaved my great-great-great-grandson's balls.

450
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,440
So congratulations, Kat.

451
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,960
Oh, this is gonna be a fun jingle.

452
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,200
Yeah, yeah, well I almost moved on without the jingle that they paid for.

453
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,000
Oh Christ.

454
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:47,440
I forgot that we do these, because I haven't done it in a while.

455
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,440
Nope.

456
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:49,440
Nope?

457
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:56,160
Something old and something new And something borrowed, something blue

458
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:04,320
And something shaved and shorn and shiny Yeah, the first thing is about Zach and Ginny

459
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,880
They got married yesterday And the other thing is about

460
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,800
Justin and Kat Crosland They formed a crime-fighting team

461
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:22,560
Shaving grandson balls They are the worst crime fighters

462
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,720
That I've ever seen They don't fight crime

463
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:36,160
They fight hair on balls Happy wedding

464
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,600
I edited that one on a minor chord to show how very displeased I was with that jingle.

465
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,640
That was the worst jingle I've done so far, and I'm sorry that you paid for it.

466
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,240
Well, it beats shaving your great-great-grandnephew's balls, that's for sure.

467
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,440
I think it's time for Yahoo Answers.

468
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,080
Yeah, I think so too.

469
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,240
Okay, this one was sent in by Question Mark.

470
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,040
Thank you, Question Mark.

471
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,320
It's by Yahoo Answers user Bill Steven, who asks,

472
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,760
How can I touch my girlfriend in class?

473
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,640
Me and my girlfriend want to touch each other, just squeeze her ass or squeeze her boobs,

474
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,840
but we can't hang out after school because she's grounded.

475
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,400
We only have one class together and we sit in the back and I need to know how I can do

476
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,000
that kind of stuff without anyone like other kids or the teacher seeing us.

477
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,560
Help, please.

478
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,080
So, like, they're like,

479
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,040
Hey, Jennifer, can I come by after school and maybe just squeeze your boobs?

480
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,320
Oh, Alyssa, Alyssa, I am going to squeeze your boobs all night long.

481
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,800
Hey, this is a text from me.

482
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,320
I just wanted you to start thinking about how I'm going to squeeze your boobs tonight.

483
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,280
There is nothing more romantic than just, like,

484
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,680
a vicious, unending groping of someone's bottom and or breasts.

485
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,040
I can- I will latch onto that boob, that left boob,

486
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,960
and I will just hang on it all night like a three-toed slob.

487
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,480
It's going to feel so great, Jen.

488
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,560
I hope you don't have to run to the convenience store for anything last minute,

489
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,800
because once Griffin's on there, he is not coming off.

490
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,760
Are we done?

491
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,920
Are we- are we- because I'm latched.

492
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,200
You are done moving.

493
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,720
I bought these special gloves.

494
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,000
It's like putting on sweatpants.

495
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,800
Once you're in, you're in for the night,

496
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,880
so get comfortable with the fact that he is going to be groping your boob that hard.

497
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:37,600
I've got a- I've got a dry hug that I do that involves squeezing a boob for hours.

498
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,840
I'm like the sting of boob squeezes.

499
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,480
Also, really sorry about the bruises.

500
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,320
No, that's the thing.

501
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,480
I might- I'm so good at it that I don't-

502
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,240
Like a tantric hug?

503
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,440
I don't leave any evidence.

504
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,880
Now, as far as the question asker,

505
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,640
if you want to do this kind of stuff in school,

506
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,800
first- the first thing you gotta do is take a bullshit class.

507
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,400
Cooking would work.

508
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,080
Acting.

509
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,400
That- if you have a theater class, oh, forget about it.

510
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,600
That's where the gropes are happening.

511
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,760
Are they by the most attractive people?

512
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,520
Nah, you know, probably not.

513
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,160
There are people on, like, berets and-

514
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,480
Does your school offer a, um, like a mammogram training seminar?

515
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,600
Because that would be- that would be very on the nose.

516
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,480
Also, you could consider a big blanket.

517
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,520
There are- there are- there are laws that prohibit a school from-

518
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,120
because of religious reasons-

519
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,000
that prohibit a school from looking underneath a big blanket.

520
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,320
And then maybe your math teacher is going to be very confused

521
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,760
as to why you've spread a big blanket over two desks in the back row.

522
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,120
So you just tell him, I'm a blanketarian, and I don't like the persecution

523
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,000
that you're putting me through.

524
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,640
I'm going to bring a civil- a civil trial against you.

525
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,040
I am quiltish, and I don't actually appreciate this hate that I'm getting from you.

526
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,440
Why are you so anti-Snuggie, is what I want to know.

527
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,640
You know what's going to be embarrassing, though?

528
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,160
When there is a quiltist, like, a real one right next to him,

529
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,760
they'll have to look at him with that judgment.

530
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,920
Aren't Quakers- aren't Quakers quiltists?

531
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,640
Isn't that a thing?

532
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,140
Mm-hmm.

533
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,040
Don't- isn't that one of their beliefs?

534
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,960
God damn it, you guys, I miss high school.

535
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,720
Do you remember when the biggest concern in your life

536
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,160
was that you wanted to squeeze a boob?

537
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,440
And you were like, oh, how do I- there aren't enough hours in the day.

538
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,400
I gotta- I gotta come up with some sort of heist

539
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,160
so that I can squeeze boob through school because that's all I think about.

540
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,400
You're standing there looking at your- the schedule and your trapper keeper,

541
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,400
and you're like, well, I got math at 11, and then I have band at 12.30.

542
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,480
When am I supposed to squeeze in squeezins?

543
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,800
If I eat my lunch really quickly, maybe we can go out into the commons

544
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,760
and hide behind a tree, and I can squeeze a fucking boob.

545
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,800
Do you remember the feeling of it being three o'clock in the afternoon?

546
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,120
Yeah.

547
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,760
And you are done with your day?

548
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
Like, you don't have fuck all else to do.

549
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,400
Yep.

550
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:44,640
Yeah.

551
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,880
Being an adult is like, be at school all the time forever.

552
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,360
Like, you're never not at school when you're an adult.

553
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:57,760
But I have to say, my- my boob squeezing career improved drastically

554
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,040
after I got out of school.

555
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,960
So I guess that there's a trade-off is what I'm saying.

556
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,640
It's like school that you can never get out of,

557
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,320
but there's so many more boobs to squeeze.

558
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,840
Uh, I- I- I- I'm in a bit of a pickle.

559
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,760
I- see, a lot of- a lot of emotion this week I'm bringing.

560
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,260
Mm-hmm.

561
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,640
Uh, I have to plan a bachelorette party, but here's the kicker.

562
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,560
We can't have booze.

563
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,920
The other bridesmaids don't drink for religious reasons.

564
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,160
Sorry, Padre, I stopped drinking for religious reasons.

565
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,520
Can- I don't care how much you offer me this vino.

566
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,880
Uh, the only reason I drink is to party, to get down.

567
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,160
No religious- no religious drinking for me.

568
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,920
Now I have to come up with something sassy and fun that doesn't involve drinking.

569
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,720
I got it.

570
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,520
And I'm betting that penis paraphernalia, uh, will be frowned upon as well.

571
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,480
That's from bum-fuzzled bridesmaid in Nashville.

572
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,040
Cashville.

573
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,840
You know what's always fun with parties?

574
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,320
Yeah, like to do a theme party and your theme could be worst party ever.

575
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,040
Yeah, bad.

576
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,760
What's your theme?

577
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,120
It's bad is my theme.

578
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,120
The theme is boring.

579
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,800
We do boring things.

580
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,440
Like you're gonna have a party without drinks or dicks?

581
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,160
No dick paraphernalia?

582
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,280
What's the point?

583
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,320
I want to know.

584
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:24,480
It sounds like the- the problem is I feel like the premise of a bachelor slash bachelorette

585
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:31,200
party is one last time to cut loose and be stupid and like, let's do something that you're

586
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,600
not going to be able to do once you're married.

587
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,000
So we're going to go, you know, say it's a bachelor party.

588
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,360
You're going to go drink all day with the boys and play miniature golf.

589
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:47,600
But to say I need a really chill party that fits into the bounds of religious specifications

590
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,200
is like, well, then don't have the party.

591
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,960
What is- what is her- what is her, like, the way that she cuts loose that she won't be

592
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,800
able to anymore after she gets married?

593
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,160
Maybe you kind of focus on that.

594
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,680
Like maybe you get all the girls together and watch a marathon of NCIS LA and talk about

595
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,960
how hunky Chris O'Donnell is.

596
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,280
Oh my gosh.

597
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,720
I think of that time Chris O'Donnell takes his shirt off, you take a bite of a cookie.

598
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,080
Yeah.

599
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,800
Not a dick shaped cookie.

600
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,520
With no nuts.

601
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,520
You have one time in your life, one time, where you're allowed to eat dick shaped foods

602
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,000
and it's during your bachelorette party because it's fun.

603
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,560
It's fun and it's funny.

604
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,160
Why would you give that up?

605
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,280
You don't get to do it again.

606
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,680
I just don't get it.

607
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,280
You know what you should do, though?

608
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,400
Tell me.

609
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,080
You just squeeze each other's boobs all the time.

610
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,800
That's a good feeling.

611
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,640
That's okay, right?

612
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,400
I guess that's permissible.

613
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,040
I'm saying dry hugs all around.

614
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,280
Dry hugs with boob latching.

615
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,880
With optional boob latching.

616
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,240
You know, there'll be so many girls latched onto boobs, it's gonna look like somebody's

617
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,320
playing barrel of monkeys in there.

618
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,600
Like you just can't even start to separate this tangle.

619
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,800
Exacto mundo.

620
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,920
I just recently discovered that I am gay.

621
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,920
I couldn't be happier.

622
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,680
Well, that's the definition of it, isn't it?

623
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,920
However, I had been going out with a girl for a few weeks before my discovery and now

624
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,600
I need to end it between us.

625
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,120
How could I break up this relationship while keeping her as a friend?

626
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,760
Oh, no.

627
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,960
Mitch, Mitch, I can't stress this enough.

628
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,480
You need to just flat out break up with her.

629
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,960
Do not mention the gay thing.

630
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,920
She can never know, ever.

631
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,640
Although she probably kind of does a little bit.

632
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,920
Probably knows.

633
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,120
She probably knows.

634
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,440
But you can break up with her for any reason.

635
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,240
I would rather you break up with her because she's really fat.

636
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,720
Even if she's not fat, she's like, I'm breaking up with you because you're fat.

637
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,160
Then tell her you are breaking up with her because while with her, you realize that you

638
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,280
want to be with someone who's the complete opposite of her.

639
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,480
Physically, biologically, the complete opposite.

640
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,200
Hormonally, like this is the opposite of you.

641
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,760
I get what you're laying down.

642
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,320
I want not that, basically.

643
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,080
I want the reverse of that.

644
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:09,600
Maybe you can, maybe the best way to end this is for her to mix the disappointment of the

645
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:15,120
relationship ending with the satisfaction of knowing all along that you were gay.

646
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,160
Like maybe you walk up to her and just be like, hey, you got me.

647
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,680
Catch you later.

648
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,920
And you guys are done here.

649
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,200
God damn, this must, I'm trying to piece together a timeline of Mitch's discovery.

650
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:27,760
Okay.

651
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,920
He's been dating this girl for a few weeks.

652
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:36,000
A few weeks, how did, was it, it's like flipping a switch, right?

653
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,280
Like a few weeks ago, you were like, toad straight, gonna, me and Jennifer are gonna

654
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,720
be together, full Fs.

655
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:48,240
And then at some point in the past few weeks, that just seems like an awfully long amount

656
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,840
of time or a short amount of time to just be like, gay now.

657
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,760
I'm pretty much gay now.

658
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,040
I'm pretty much, I like guys now.

659
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:01,920
She was, she was probably, part of an extensive, maybe sort of like a denial type thing.

660
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,360
You're my like, she was, he was trying to convince himself, trying a little something

661
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:13,200
of everything, you know, like a little trying anything to sort of keep, keep that part of

662
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,840
himself sort of quarantine busted loose.

663
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,920
It's like your first plate at golden corral.

664
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,880
You get, you get a little bit of steak and you get a little bit of fried chicken and

665
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,040
you get a little bit of pasta, a little bit of potato salad, and then you try them all.

666
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,360
And your second plate, you know that you're supposed to focus on fried chicken.

667
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,880
And your second plate, you get dick.

668
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,240
And the second plate, you get, oh, just a buffet of dicks.

669
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,800
This is a special thing.

670
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,440
And this is good.

671
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,240
This is great.

672
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,640
And we're all very proud of you.

673
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,240
She won't be, though.

674
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,800
She's not proud talking in general.

675
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,480
I mean, in this one specific conversation.

676
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,480
All Charles is saying is, in this conversation, he is embarrassed to be gay.

677
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,160
This is the one where it's okay.

678
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,240
Do not expect any high fives is what we're saying from this particular woman.

679
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,480
But on the upside, honey, I'm really happy.

680
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,800
So I'm like the happiest I've ever been.

681
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,400
I wish maybe things would have been different if you could have made me feel this happy.

682
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,120
But we are beyond that point in the conversation.

683
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,920
And now I I'm I'm gay now.

684
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,840
Hey, listen, if I'll cheer you up, maybe you're in bed.

685
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,440
I'll introduce you to Tim Gunn.

686
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,400
How would that be?

687
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,120
Wait, what?

688
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,080
Hold on.

689
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,600
Because we've already established that this has been a sudden, immediate thing.

690
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,880
Like a switch flipping.

691
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,480
You're saying that as soon as that switch gets flipped, Tim Gunn.

692
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,400
In your email the next day, welcome aboard.

693
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,960
When you join MySpace and Tom is immediately your friend.

694
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,440
That's exactly what it's like.

695
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,480
Like when you turn 100 and the president sends you a letter.

696
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,920
Yeah, sort of like that.

697
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,120
And some smuckers.

698
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,000
Is that right?

699
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,720
Yes.

700
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,760
Is that what the president does?

701
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,000
Yeah.

702
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:59,280
So so I think that he'll really I think that that'll help to turn turn that frown upside down.

703
00:47:59,280 --> 00:47:59,920
And you know what?

704
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,680
She's everybody remembers the guy they were with when he discovered he was gay and he didn't want

705
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,400
to be with you.

706
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,640
You got to make sure that you're the first and only person this ever happens to.

707
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,000
That's the important thing.

708
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,760
It can happen once and it's funny.

709
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,840
If it happens more than once, it's a it's abysmally devastating to her.

710
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:22,640
What you've got to do is make sure she doesn't date any more secret gay dudes because because

711
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,600
then it would be bad.

712
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,840
You've got to be like Batman for her, except you're protecting her from secret homosexuals.

713
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,000
So you have to be her.

714
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,520
Although I do think Frank Gorshin was a secret homosexual for what it's worth.

715
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,080
You have to be her dark super gay knight.

716
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:42,320
Yeah, protecting the city by it by wearing leather, wearing leather.

717
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,240
And are you saying like you should like blow a dude in front of her?

718
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,760
Like, never forget this.

719
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,840
Keep this in your mind forever.

720
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,880
Remember this feeling.

721
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,720
If you see her talking to a guy who is secretly gay, you need to stand next to her and just

722
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,680
kind of shake your tush a little bit like a distraction.

723
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,480
Look at how you look at.

724
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,520
He likes this.

725
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,040
I bet he likes this.

726
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,040
You don't want to have anything to do with this guy.

727
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:09,920
Where's Falcone?

728
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,000
I'm gonna fuck him.

729
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,760
Don't forget this.

730
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,640
Remember this feeling.

731
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,600
Remember this pain.

732
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,160
Pray to me.

733
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,200
I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first super quick.

734
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,600
We have we neglected to do this last week, and we have to say this week.

735
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,760
Patrick and Jimison both got MBMBAM tattoos.

736
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,280
One of them got at MBMBAM, one of them got hashtag MBMBAM.

737
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,240
Here's the fun thing about this.

738
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,080
Jimison, professional tattooer.

739
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,120
Yeah.

740
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:46,080
Patrick, never a tattooer, nary a tattoo applied to a human body.

741
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,640
Has he done?

742
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,440
It's unthinkable.

743
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,360
This whole this whole setup.

744
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,480
The whole setup is bad.

745
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,760
But I'm proud of them, and I'm grateful.

746
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,200
I'm very grateful for it.

747
00:49:59,200 --> 00:49:59,600
Certainly.

748
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,520
They joined the tattoo club, MBMBAM club of three.

749
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:09,120
Which if you want to join that club, I really ask you to just sit down for a second.

750
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,880
Talk to a loved one.

751
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:17,200
Maybe take a look in that deep, dark, truthful mirror and really consider the possibilities

752
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:17,440
here.

753
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,240
But if you go for it, we're happy.

754
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,040
God bless.

755
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,160
Immediately let us know.

756
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,240
Yeah, do send us pictures.

757
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,560
Just a reminder, June 12th, we are sold out for our Cincinnati show.

758
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,800
Tickets sold so briskly.

759
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,760
I think we pretty much have got to do one again soon.

760
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:42,560
But yeah, and not that I'm encouraging this, but there is going to be a waiting list day

761
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,280
of in case people don't show up.

762
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,000
So if you're in the area, I wouldn't recommend driving like eight hours hoping to get in.

763
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,280
But if you're in the area and you didn't get a chance to get a ticket,

764
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,280
feel free to stop by the theater and check and see if maybe there's some seats available.

765
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,240
Should we talk about our opener?

766
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,200
We got an opener for the show.

767
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

768
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,680
Dizzy Gillespie.

769
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,360
Dizzy Gillespie is coming back for the dead.

770
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,160
Uh, no, you're close though.

771
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,600
You're not too far off.

772
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,560
Felicia Gillespie.

773
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,200
Oh, yeah, I mixed them up.

774
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,920
She mixed them up.

775
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,440
She's a stand up comedian, super funny.

776
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,600
Uh, we, we reached out to her and she was, she was into it.

777
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,800
She's going to be there.

778
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,040
Um, going to do some comedy before we do some jokes.

779
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,880
Do us a favor and we'll remind you there, but like buy our CDs or something.

780
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,520
Like tell her that she did a great job and buy our stuff.

781
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,920
I don't think I do not think that they are going to need us to tell them to do that.
