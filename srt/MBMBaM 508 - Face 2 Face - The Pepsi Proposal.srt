1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,480
Hey, this is Griffin. Real quick, wanted to preface this one by saying it's a live show,

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,960
which is strange to listen to these days from the before times from when we performed on the

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,840
Joko Cruise, which was just going off my own sort of internal calendar about 400

8
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:09,040
patrillion-scrillion-minillion-thousand-trillion years ago. So it's actually cut together from

9
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,680
a couple of shows that we did on the Joko Cruise, so it's a bit patchwork and a bit weird,

10
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,280
and you know, we edited out a lot of very extremely local boat-specific humor. But yes,

11
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,520
that is the episode this week. We were not able to record a new one. We will be back with a regular

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,640
episode next week. Until then, enjoy this incredibly strange thing to listen to of our

13
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:42,080
ma-boom-bam goofery aboard the Joko Cruise. I run an after-school fantasy larp for eight to

14
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,640
twelve-year-olds, and I write the story and play all the major NPCs that the characters,

15
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,840
kids' characters encounter. The problem is that I'm not a very intimidating person.

16
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,880
You're gonna need to start over. I missed all of those words.

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,120
I run an after-school fantasy larp for eight to twelve-year-olds. I don't know why I almost

18
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,360
turned it into a Barenaked Lady song. I run an after-school fantasy larp for eight to

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,560
twelve-year-olds, and I write the story and I play all of the major roles.

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,920
Wait, I didn't...

21
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,040
The problem is that I am not a very intimidating person. So even when I try to portray an

22
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,040
appropriately scary villain, the kids tend to always think, quote, we can take them and mob me.

23
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,880
Brothers, how can I strike fear into the hearts of gamer children?

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:37,440
That is from Cora. Cora, are you here? All right, much better. Nailed it. Got it in one.

25
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,800
Much better. Nailed it. Got it in one.

26
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,480
When I was a gamer child, the thing I think I was most afraid of

27
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,720
was having to mow the lawn. Can you dress up as a lawnmower that they would have to use?

28
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,680
Can you dress up as chores? Can you dress up as the idea of reformatting a memory card?

29
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,040
Can you dress up as the concept of your dad really thinks you'd be good at baseball?

30
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,480
So get out there, Tiger. Just whisper in their ear, like,

31
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,520
I took all your V-bucks. When you weren't watching, I took all your what?

32
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,880
V-bucks is the Fortnite money. God, I hate doing this show with old people.

33
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,240
None of them reacted. They loved it. They were scared.

34
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,560
V-bucks? They were scared that their Fortnite money would be...

35
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,280
That sounds like something that happens at Bucky Cheeses.

36
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,480
Now, Justin, I hate to stifle your creativity over there, but as you approach to Whisper This,

37
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,840
they've already thrown a balled-up wad of tinfoil at you, hitting you for 15 points of electricity damage.

38
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,280
Is there a safe way to set kids on fire? Just like...

39
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,760
Oh, safe fire. A safe fire for kids?

40
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,880
Yeah. This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles. Thank you, Adrian.

41
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,080
Adrian, you're not here, are you?

42
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,080
No, that'd be wild. We're in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. That would be fucking bizarre.

43
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,440
So this is an anonymous Yahoo Answers user I'm gonna call. Aquaman asks,

44
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,560
how did the first parents know how to take care of their children?

45
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,840
Fuck, yeah. Yeah, right? Right? Yeah. It must have been weird the first time the baby shit in a diaper,

46
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,520
and you're like, where do we get more diapers?

47
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,120
Sorry, we're all parents up here, and we know this crowd skews younger,

48
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,160
so when the baby is born and come out, it has a diaper.

49
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,480
Yeah. And it's called, it's birth diaper. And you know how just like in movies, right,

50
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:01,120
baby come out, start screaming. Has diaper. Yes. Person with milk glands just start spraying it out

51
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,520
like super sugar? That must have been weird for... Yeah, like, hey, Doug, I think I'm making food.

52
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,600
I don't want to like freak you out. Hey, are we having a weird party? Yeah, I think I'm making

53
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,680
food right now. Isn't that wild? Let's put it in little U's mouth. Yeah, see if they like other food.

54
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,960
And that must have been frustrating. You're like, hey, put on baby shark. It's like,

55
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:32,240
what the fuck is baby shark? There is a baby shark over here. Put baby shark on baby? No.

56
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,560
Honey, he wants to play with the baby sharks. I don't know what to tell you. Well, I mean,

57
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:44,240
I mean, a small me just came out of you. Maybe feed it some of the brontosaurus? Oh, nope. Nope.

58
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,280
Now we gotta wait to next baby. But this is it. Trial and error. We'll get this right sometime,

59
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,280
baby. Baby do bad. We should have done the you milk that's coming. Yes, Travis. At some point,

60
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:02,240
that baby, that successful baby, started talking. That must have freaked him the fuck out.

61
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:10,080
What? Oh my God. This weird small you pet is turning into a you. It isn't like right now,

62
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:17,840
your hamster went, I actually would love a carrot. What? Where's my hamster? It's at school.

63
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,960
What? And now I have to teach you to drive? Where did we get a car? You teach us to drive

64
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,600
a dinosaur. Yeah, obviously. Yeah, obviously. This seems like the type of crowd that would

65
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,720
actually get very angry and send some things on Twitter about how human beings and dinosaurs

66
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:44,560
didn't exist at the same time. As far as we know, yes. It's a bit and a goof. Let me point towards

67
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:52,560
the documentary Flintstones. Yes. Griffin, if dinosaurs and human beings didn't exist at the

68
00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:00,720
same time, how do we know about them? How do we know about them? How do they play their records?

69
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,160
Oh yeah. Because? Yours is a Flintstone. Okay. Yes. Justin, how about another question? Yeah,

70
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,840
here it comes. Because we, hey Jews, we could say a lot of Flintstones things up here,

71
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,640
but I think it would be good for us to go to another question. How do they make vitamins?

72
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,320
Yes. Cereal. How do we still have their cereals? Jurassic Park, it would just,

73
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,320
they wouldn't look like dinosaurs, they'd look like big weird monsters because we didn't see them.

74
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,800
Right. With our human eyes. Not like the super accurate Jurassic Park. We're fucking dying up

75
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:35,680
here, Justin, please. Thank you. We got a Honda Doll Watch. Oh fuck, we didn't ask before, but

76
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:43,040
who in this room has no idea who we are? Okay. Oh shit. Oh no. Okay, so Honda Doll Watch is a segment

77
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:49,680
on the show where we find Honda dolls for sale on the electronic bay and see what the story with

78
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:57,120
those are, because that's wild. This doll is called Melissa Tangible. Holy shit, that's a good name.

79
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,600
It's a fucking good name, actually. Melissa Tangible is what this doll is listed as. Meet

80
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:08,720
Melissa. Melissa is, they don't say, it doesn't say to the tune of Train. Meet Melissa. Melissa

81
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,480
is what she likes to be called. Oh. Though a tangible doll, she was neither human nor non-human.

82
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:22,160
Okay, that's everything. That's actually all the things. Everything. Are you actually skipped

83
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,960
over the first part of that sentence? Read that one more time for me. Meet Melissa. Nope. Though

84
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:34,560
a tangible doll. Like all dolls. No. There are intangible dolls. Travis. Do not step to Justin

85
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,720
on this exact subject. On the electronic bay, sometimes you get a doll, sometimes you get a

86
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,440
picture of a doll, because they're not specific about it being a tangible doll. I would argue

87
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,600
that even there, it's a doll one could conceive. No, it's not. I don't think you know what the

88
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:57,920
word tangible means. Fuck. That is the actual problem. She is a pure evil, tangible, physical

89
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,400
doll. As a seller, I'd like my customers to know that my house backs up 600 acres of woods.

90
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,280
On the other side of those woods is a medium-sized cemetery.

91
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:17,040
So, important things for all of us to know. So I assume your house backs up in like a 300...

92
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,280
Incorrect. 600 acre woods, and it's a medium-sized cemetery. So that's the kind of like oaky tannins

93
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:30,160
you can expect from this. The terrar of this haunted doll is extremely good. I'm sorry to

94
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:37,840
keep revealing my known ass. How big is an acre? Is 600 acres between your house and a cemetery

95
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,640
a good distance? Well, Winnie the Pooh lived in a... Winnie the Pooh lived in a 100 acre one,

96
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,840
so it's six times better than him. Oh shit. And the Winnie the Pooh cemetery was quite large.

97
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,600
It was every animal ever. Eeyore lived in it, and that's why he was kind of bummed out. I'm sad.

98
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:03,360
Oh, why? Because... No, because of the spirits. You don't understand. I've never had a night's rest.

99
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:10,880
This isn't... The wailing. This isn't my tale. That's right. Think of the implications.

100
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,640
I'm a patchwork monstrosity. It's the telltale tale. Yeah.

101
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:31,760
Don't patronize him. The ghosts come a-runnin' when they hear the spirit box. I do believe

102
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,480
that that is why I have so many negative or evil spirits on my property and in my home.

103
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,280
This spirit, however, really does not have a name. We agreed on Melissa. She seems to like that,

104
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,400
although she is neither female nor male. We have established that she is neither human

105
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,480
nor non-human. I don't think we need any more specifics. This spirit, you must be 18 or over

106
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:04,400
to purchase. What? Also, this spirit is for the dark arts only or seasoned investigators.

107
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:13,280
Oh, okay, I'm back in. Okay, yeah. This is my favorite. I bought her at another consignment

108
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:23,520
shop and she was not a haunted doll. However, she is now. Huh. Yeah, huh. Funny how that works.

109
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,800
Yeah, okay. Jesus Christ. Is this person's house for sale? Because it sounds like maybe

110
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:36,240
it's a haunted doll factory. Yeah, quick point for you, Fire Torch Findings on eBay. You probably

111
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:43,440
shouldn't buy more dolls. That's maybe where I would start is your house transmogrifies

112
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,600
regular dolls into bad evil dolls that are neither human nor non-human but are named Melissa.

113
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,480
Hey, why do you think this eBay user bought the doll carcass in the first place? Well,

114
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:03,120
we have a name for doll carcasses, Trav, and they're dolls. It's just a regular doll. I do

115
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,920
like this backstory, though, of I'm just a doll lover purchaser and now this one's haunted, so

116
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,440
I got to get rid of it. I created a whole eBay account. Yeah, for this one specific one and

117
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,840
according to the listing, the 270 other haunted dolls that they have in there. Sorry about your

118
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:29,760
luck. What keeps happening? What's the connective tissue? Anyway, that is Haunted Doll Watch.

119
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,920
Hey, how about another question? I'd love that, Griff. Thank you so much.

120
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,040
My boyfriend says bless you after I cough. This makes me feel very uncomfortable.

121
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,480
How can I get him to stop? And that's from Bless You in Boston. My boyfriend says,

122
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,160
is the uncomfortable thing that that is not when we do that or is it what they're actually

123
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,080
saying, do you think? What part is causing the discomfort? Well, can it be both? Because it is

124
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:05,680
both of the things. Okay, let's try it out. Oh, bless you. What do you say back?

125
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:14,320
I would say thank you for the blessing. Have you heard the good news? And then I would bow.

126
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,000
Bow like, oh, like that? Yes. Let me try. I'll cough. Okay.

127
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,120
Hack'em, hack'em, hack'em. Bless you. And also with you.

128
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,960
Nice, religious. Do you want to try? Yeah, so, okay.

129
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,040
Bless you. You will never take Jenny from me.

130
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:44,560
Okay. That's that kind of possession thing. We've got three different good options.

131
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah, he'll definitely stop after one of those. Hold on, let me do it. I'll do it.

132
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,920
Bless you. I wish you'd stop doing that.

133
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,680
Okay, I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now about our relationship.

134
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,680
Oh, hold on. Bring me some popcorn. You always fucking do this, Jerrick.

135
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,240
Jerrick, I want to move back to Portland with my sister.

136
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,680
Wow, a new vibe. Okay, what's next? What happens next?

137
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,320
You know what? You're right. Okay.

138
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,000
I think we can make this work. Honest communication, I'm loving it.

139
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,720
Once I get out of here, we can be together. My character's in prison.

140
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,160
Well, we'll see about that. Three, two, one, blast off.

141
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,480
Oh, no. Wait, what is happening now?

142
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,520
I'm in a rocket ship now. To where?

143
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,880
Portland, Oregon. Well, here's my brother,

144
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,360
Elon Musk. Aw.

145
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,800
Two. He built a rocket ship for me.

146
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,080
Oh, no. It's an old-fashioned breakup rocket ship chase.

147
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,880
Yeah, and it's a steampunk rocket ship, so you know it's cooler, guys.

148
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,160
And what's that? It's Captain Mal Reynolds. Oh, shit.

149
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,720
Anyways, do you want to have sex in front of Captain Mal Reynolds?

150
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,280
Actually, Travis, I stopped playing the part, like, 15 seconds ago.

151
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,640
So now it's just uncomfortable. And so for me, Trav, that's a firm no.

152
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,720
How about Yahoo? Yeah, here is a Yahoo from the Yahoo

153
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,920
Answer Service. This one was sent in by several people,

154
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,720
and it's sort of just like a fun sort of linguistics, like, origin, like,

155
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,720
a smart people thing. For all the smarts on this here boat.

156
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,360
Anybody here smart? Okay, a lot of people sent this in.

157
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,280
It's from Yahoo Answers user Negotiator, who asks...

158
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:49,280
I like that. What exactly is a gravy train?

159
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:55,280
Oh, boy. I assume it is. Travis, don't assume.

160
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:01,120
Okay. Know it. From a book you read

161
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,600
about this subject yesterday. Thank you. You know how

162
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,600
there are trains full of... Yeah. Gasoline.

163
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah. Okay. I see where this is going. You're saying... Are you trying to say

164
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,040
that maybe... How else does gravy get places?

165
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,200
Thank you. Are you saying maybe that cars use

166
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,880
gasoline, like, they call gasoline gravy as, like, slang?

167
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,160
Yeah. Like, gravy is slang for gasoline?

168
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,280
Yes. No. So, somebody has a big gasoline train? Not now.

169
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Not now. I'm saying a hundred years ago. Travis is embarrassed, and he's trying to walk it back.

170
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,880
I have never been embarrassed in my entire life. Have you heard the jokes I

171
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,880
make on this show? I'm saying a hundred years ago, everyone

172
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,480
said, oh, yeah, Henry Ford and his car gravy.

173
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,680
He loves that shit. We're not talking about... And that was before

174
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,560
cars existed. Right. We don't say they're in the gravy

175
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,120
car. They're not driving the gravy Prius and

176
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,840
getting great gravy mileage. No, they just say

177
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,800
horsepower. They say horsepower, which is a fun

178
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,720
another... We're not actually going to talk about smart shit on the stage, Travis.

179
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,760
We're talking about the gravy train. People say it.

180
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,560
Why, Justin? The weird thing is that the gravy train is good.

181
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,480
Yes. That is the surprising thing. Like, that has pulled into town.

182
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,240
I'm feeling pretty good about this gravy train. It's arrived. That does mean at

183
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,520
some point, somebody had something that could be

184
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,720
referred to as the gravy train and said, thank God. Yes, yes, it's here.

185
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,280
My matcha potatoes are getting extremely cold.

186
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,440
Thank goodness the gravy train has arrived. A butler came in going,

187
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,080
chugga-chugga.

188
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,760
Chugga-chugga. Would master like... Okay, hold on. They don't say the gravy

189
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,320
train car. It's a... Every car in the gravy train

190
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,840
is a gravy train. It's a gravy locomotive. A gravy... A gravy

191
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,120
caboose. Everything is gravy, gravy, gravy, gravy. A

192
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,280
gravy sleeper car. Yes. Slosh, slosh, slosh.

193
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,120
Do any of y'all know why it's gravy train when we say that?

194
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,160
No, but really. Just shout it out all at once.

195
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,120
Because there is a gravy boat. So we're all just saying that constantly and

196
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,240
have no idea what it means. I see someone pointing to

197
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,120
someone. Are you pointing at anyone? Are you a train,

198
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,800
sir? I swear to God. Hey, come here. No, no, no.

199
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,720
If this is a joke, I'm gonna be fucking furious.

200
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,000
Okay, everyone be completely silent. I just wanted you to go, okay.

201
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,320
Yell it. Yell. Yell about gravy trains. Oh, fuck off. No, not what your parents told

202
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,960
you. Unless your parents are gravy train

203
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,560
conductors. No, keep going. Keep going. I want to hear.

204
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,400
So it's the wagon that has all the food in it in like a convoy. Hey, don't you all

205
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,840
clap? No, that was good. Like a wagon train.

206
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,000
And there was one wagon that had all the gravy. The wet brown one

207
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,240
that had all the gravy in it. But here's the thing. That person stood up with

208
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,840
confidence and said that made up bullshit.

209
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,960
And you all tried to clap like we all knew that too.

210
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,240
The next time you fucking join us. What's better?

211
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,640
What they said or the idea of a train that every time it turns a corner a

212
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,200
little bit of gravy sloshes out every window.

213
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,320
Which world would you rather live in? And that's where

214
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,160
corn comes from. Hey, how about another Yahoo? Yeah, I'd

215
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,960
love that. Thank you. So, this one's

216
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,960
presented by Adrian Cowes as well. Thank you, Adrian. It's from Yahoo

217
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,520
Answers user Blue Fox Socks who asks

218
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,160
I wish hot salad existed. Anyone else?

219
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,800
Now, hold on. Hey. Calm down. Let's all open our minds. Let's play in the space.

220
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,280
Yeah, let's check it out. I'm seeing some very enthusiastic thumbs up from a

221
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,960
one to two people in the audience. You're now on a list of my own creation.

222
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,280
I'm sorry. You all also know that like warm spinach

223
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,200
salad is a thing. No, that's nothing. It's not hot though.

224
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,160
To be fair. Yeah, we're talking about a salad that you put in your mouth and go

225
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,240
I do like that they started calling it warm

226
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,600
spinach salad because room temperature spinach salad is

227
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,680
pretty nasty. You know, I actually had one of these

228
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,600
I think last night. Did anyone make you? Well, the nice thing about being on a

229
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,480
cruise ship is you can put fucking anything on a salad. Nobody's

230
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,840
gonna say anything to you. So, I got a regular salad and the lady

231
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,160
looked at me with like pride as I walked away like,

232
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,120
dang, Justin really did a good job. Yeah. What a good salad boy. That's a lot of

233
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,240
cookie points. I'm so proud of him and then as soon as I fucking hove out of

234
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,720
view from her eyesight, I handed my bowl to the person

235
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,840
on the counter is like, can you throw some grits on there please?

236
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,240
Some grits Travis. Grits? Grits for dressing.

237
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,880
It's 2020. I'm changing the game. Grits for dressing. This is from a man

238
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,240
who used to put marinara as dressing. That's old news.

239
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,840
Hey Juice. The new shit is grits on dressing.

240
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,360
Rule of thumb, if you can throw something at a wall

241
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,200
and it sticks there, that's not dressing. Hey Griffin.

242
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,160
Pasta salad. That's a salad not a dressing. That's a salad not a dressing but

243
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,760
good try. Wow. What do you think the next peanut butter dressing?

244
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,320
What's next Juice? What's hot for spring 2020?

245
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,640
You'll have to ask the fine chefs here at the New Amsterdam what they plan on

246
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,240
putting at the bar. They didn't offer grits Justin.

247
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,920
They didn't offer grits. Grits wasn't on the list of dresses.

248
00:21:53,920 --> 00:22:00,080
That was Chez Justine. I love you so much. There is no way that they said

249
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,680
ranch, vinaigrette, grits. Here's the food grits. Here's what

250
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,200
you're gonna give. Do you want some porridge on there baby bear?

251
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,680
Someone from the dive in outside was like, you want a hot dog on it?

252
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,960
We'll blend it up real good. You can sip it in.

253
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,280
We'll put the whole thing in the blender. You won't even have to look at it.

254
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,120
Hey, how you doing grits? How low is the bottom of the barrel?

255
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,560
How about just a bowl full of grits with one spinach on top?

256
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,600
Hun, now you're like a big man. Prove them wrong.

257
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,920
Anything can be a salad. Fuck you. Do you want a big bowl of honey?

258
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,440
Winnie the Pooh. Here's what you get with grits as a dressing.

259
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,240
One, judgment. Two, texture. Three, warmth.

260
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,080
Four, it's everything salad isn't and now they're together.

261
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,880
It fixes both. It's both okay because grits and salad.

262
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,080
Hey listen, if you have synaesthesia, please never eat a grit salad. It sounds

263
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,680
like the worst possible sensory experience.

264
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,800
No, it's good. I can imagine. It had lemonade. I dumped the glass in

265
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,960
and someone paid me three dollars to eat it. My wife asked me where the lettuce

266
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,040
was and I had to look at her honestly and say,

267
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,320
I no longer remember if there's lettuce in here.

268
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,600
Justin, did you eat a bowl of grits? I might have made a KFC famous bowl, sort

269
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,240
of sweetened one, accidentally. I could have sworn I did

270
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,520
get some salad stuff on there. Pretty sure about it.

271
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,560
You know it's bad when you're at the salad bar and you have to point at least

272
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,240
four different things to be like, what's that? I'm not that familiar

273
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,840
with, can I have the little round ones? Do you mean chickpeas? Okay, cool. Yeah, yeah,

274
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,760
yeah, absolutely. Give me those Pac-Man pellets. Yeah, give

275
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:12,800
me that. Sorry, I messed up in that sense. I'm sorry.

276
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,560
I hope everybody's enjoying the show. I sure am.

277
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,360
And I have bad news for you. While you have been so distracted,

278
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,400
if you will reach up and feel an area of your body that normally grows hair

279
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,320
where you would rather there not be hair, I'll know. There it is.

280
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,240
Oh, I don't worry about that. I'm happy to grow hair all over my body, as anyone

281
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,600
who has seen me at the pool will attest. It's kind of a Rip Van Winkle

282
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,640
situation, but sort of like a small one. You don't have like a full

283
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,000
lush white beard, but it's more just like a

284
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,840
general growth. Oh, this is just my peach fuzz.

285
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,600
I have good news for you, though.

286
00:24:51,600 --> 00:25:01,280
There's razors. Harry's is a company that makes a great shaving experience,

287
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,720

288
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,960
cut out the middle person manufacturing blades in their German

289
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,320
blade factory, which is a fine thing to do at a German

290
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,720
blade factory, if you ask me. I'm a layman. They've been hunting

291

00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,760
Harry's, what do you think is their favorite

301
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,760
Wesley Snipes movie? Well, I don't know, Trav, what's your joke?

302
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,320
Blade. Probably Bridges of Madison County. It's Blade. I don't think Wesley Snipes

303
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,360
was in that one, was he? Blade. He played actually the bridge.

304
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,520
What do you think is their favorite Jessica Alba movie?

305
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,480
I think it's Honey.

306
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:31,200
And listen, we all shop online a lot, and finding promo codes to buy

307
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,680
Jessica Alba's complete movie discography. Is that something, is there a

308
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,360
criterion collection of just Jessica Alba movies of like Honey

309
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:46,080
and Fantastic Four, and the Alba album? Yes, the Albatross.

310
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,640
Do you think she ever got called the Albatross in high school? Anyways, back to

311
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,800
the back to the copy. It is an easy one. No, this is in the

312
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,120
copy. Holy cow. Yeah, and then talk about Jessica Alba a

313
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,440
lot. Here it says some suggestions. Talk about Jessica Alba,

314
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,760
then it says, bullet point, have you ever noticed how Albatross has Alba in it?

315
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,440
Maybe that's something. God, it was even better the second time,

316
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,360
Justin, wasn't it? So I'm losing it over here. I will take

317
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,760
this ad from you by force, please. I'm begging you. Okay, so finding promo

318
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,440
codes that work isn't easy. Said that.

319
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,200
Unless you use Honey, the free browser extension

320
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,720
backed by PayPal that scans the internet for the best promo codes and

321
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,480
automatically adds them to your cart. Just download Honey to your computer,

322
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,600
shop like normal, click the apply coupons button,

323
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,320
and watch the prices drop. It's 100% free, unlike the movie Honey.

324
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,520
I don't know, maybe it's streaming somewhere. Can you check real quick why

325
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,560
I finished this, Justin? Yeah, sure. I don't want to have to pay to rent

326
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,600
Honey. I mean, at that point, I'd just own it, you know what I mean? Because I'll

327
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,440
watch it enough that would justify buying it,

328
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,520
you know what I mean? Because $3.99 to watch it once or like $12.99 to watch

329
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,800
it whenever I want, it's hard to choose. I've got Honey on

330
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:06,000
layaway at my local movie store that I've been paying

331
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,640
off for. I'm nearly out of the woods on that one.

332
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,480
You could get it. The juice is running is the problem.

333
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,240
It's $4 on YouTube. Move on. Okay.

334
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,560
Honey, the website is 100% free to use and installs in just a few seconds.

335
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:26,320
So get Honey, the website, for free at joinhoney.com. It's not a website.

336
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,080
It's a browser extension. The browser extension, not the movie.

337
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,960
I just want to make sure people don't think I'm talking about the movie now.

338
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,560
At joinhoney.com slash brother. That's joinhoney.com slash brother.

339
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,320
And that is to use the browser extension Honey, not to be

340
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,520
in the movie Honey. I just want to make sure that's clear because I've talked a

341
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,720
lot about both in the last couple minutes. If you want to

342
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,200
be in the movie Honey, I'm gonna give you a Bitcoin address

343
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,520
that you will send Bitcoins to and then they will figure out the rest. They will

344
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,440
need a very high-res JPEG of your face in a well-lit environment.

345
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,880
Hey, if you enjoy all these great jokes about Honey that we've been doing

346
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,600
and all the other shows on the MaxFun Network have been doing because we

347
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,240
coordinated it. It's Honey Week, baby. Guess what? MaxFun's running a survey to

348
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,520
help figure out which advertisers are a good fit for our audience.

349
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,640
We are still a, you know, primarily an audience-supported

350
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,160
endeavor and that'll always be the case but advertising can be a very helpful

351
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,680
source of income, especially right now. And the results

352
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,960
of the survey will help us talk to some new advertisers and convince them to

353
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,400
give us a shot because Honey's almost certainly going to pull out after this

354
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,560
one. The survey's short, shouldn't take any

355
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,960
more than 10 minutes. But Jessica Alba might come in. Might come in, might swoop in

356
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,840
there. And it's doing us a big favor. This is

357
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,480
a short survey. It shouldn't take any more than 10 minutes and

358
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,400
we sure would appreciate it. Just go to MaximumFun.org

359
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,240
slash ad survey to fill it out and do it now and you find out which Harry

360
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,400
Potter house you belong to also. Yep. You do it. I'm a

361
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,880
Huffleclaw. That is going to do it for this

362
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,200
interruption. This brief interruption. This brief Honey-centric interruption.

363
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,520
Have you guys seen that? I've never seen the movie. Let's head back to the show.

364
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,120
Video games. Video games. Video games. You like them? Maybe you wish you had more

365
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,080
time for them. Maybe you want to know the best ones to play. Maybe you want to know

366
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,600
what happens to Mario when he dies. In that case, you should check out

367
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,080
TripleClick. It's a brand new podcast about video games. A podcast about video

368
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,880
games? But I don't have time for that. Sure you do.

369
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,000
Once a week, kick back as three video game experts give you everything from

370
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
critical takes on the hottest new releases,

371
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,440
to scoops, interviews, and explanations about how video games work,

372
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,360
to fascinating and sometimes weird stories about the games we love.

373
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,520
TripleClick is hosted by me, Kirk Hamilton. Me, Jason Schreier. And me,

374
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,120
Maddie Myers. You can find TripleClick wherever you get your podcasts and listen

375
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,960
at MaximumFun.org. Bye!

376
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,680
Here's a yahoo that was sent in by Adrienne Cowles. Thank you, Adrienne.

377
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,800
Sometimes if you've never watched our show or listened to it,

378
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,920
if you've watched our- if you've never listened to our show but you watched our

379
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,520
short-lived CSO production, you don't exist. If you're one of the many people who never

380
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,000
watched our TV show. Okay, Adrienne Cowles sent this in. It is

381
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,520
by Blue Fox Socks who asks,

382
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:21,440
do pizza chefs ever hate their creations?

383
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,960
What an oddly specific question. Say a pizza chef

384
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,960
really hated putting pineapple on pizza. Would they be ashamed of making that

385
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,480
pizza if it was ordered? Would they even have pineapple on the menu?

386
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,040
Or would they suck it up? Well, rarely does a- okay, if we're

387
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,360
talking about like, uh, say, uh, Little Caesars. Yeah.

388
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,880
The pizza chef at Little Caesars does not own Little Caesars. Okay, that's fair,

389
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,400
Travis, but I would argue the pizza chef at Little Caesars hates

390
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,120
every pizza that they're sending out. That's the thing is, you bring up the

391
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,960
idea of like, I had to put a combination of these that I didn't like, as opposed

392
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,280
to just the chef finishing the pizza going,

393
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,360
I fucked that up. Yeah, but I'm stuck on Little Caesars, Travis, because in your

394
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,760
mindscape, I want to undercover boss a Little

395
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,640
Caesars with you, because you imagine there will be at least

396
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,000
one of these franchises where you dip into the back room and see somebody like

397
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm going to work hard on this and get sweaty and sell it for

398
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,160
five dollars. I have to believe that of all the Little

399
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,400
Caesars across this great planet of ours, in Little

400
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:38,240
Caesars in, say, America, Canada, Italy,

401
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,440
that there is one chef who's like, another masterpiece.

402
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,360
This question does... I'm so glad I went to the cordon bleu.

403
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,920
This, uh, this, uh, why did they name the cordon bleu after chicken cordon

404
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,960
bleu? That's confusing. It's confusing as all get out. They

405
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,880
teach you to make other things there. Did you know that? Anyway, everything that

406
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,880
actually comes out of there is, hamburger, cordon bleu, only the chicken

407
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,120
stuck. This question does raise an

408
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,240
interesting sort of moral quandary, and that is to say,

409
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,480
if a chef gets an order for an immoral pizza and they still,

410
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,760
like, I'm saying specifically something with perhaps pineapples

411
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,800
or cheese and pineapple, Canadian bacon,

412
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,040
Canadian bacon, which is ham, we all know that, if they get an order for an

413
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,000
immoral pizza and they make it, they're complicit, right?

414
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,040
They should walk, they should, they carry some of that stain,

415
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,080
perhaps literally. Yes. What if someone says, uh, just hold the cheese,

416
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,480
hold the pepperoni, add sauce and jalapenos, and hold the crust.

417
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,840
So you're envisioning the chef sort of holding all these things.

418
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,440
And it was just a box of sauce and jalapenos.

419
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,680
I would love a five dollar, hot and ready, just come breathe in my face a little

420
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,560
bit. Yeah. What if, what if someone said with

421
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,160
extra arsenic? What the chef would say? Oh, Trav, this is a

422
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,880
good start of a riddle, dude. Yeah, is that murder? Can the cop, the cop

423
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,760
would be like, that's a murder you did, and then you'd be

424
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,680
like, he asked for arsenic, then what?

425
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,000
And he stood on a block of ice. Yes.

426
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,280
While grocery shopping recently, I gave in to temptation and threw a box of

427
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,000
chocolate peanut butter pie Oreos in my cart. What, can you say those words again?

428
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,600
Hey, let the, let the wiki show, I said all those words right on the first try.

429
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,680
Good job. Yes, but they were all, they were all very confusing ideas. A box of

430
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,800
chocolate peanut butter pie Oreos in my cart. Two aisles later,

431
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,640
I shed the rest of my dignity and ripped open the packaging. Then, anytime I was

432
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,880
alone in an aisle, I would pop one in my mouth. I made it to the checkout

433
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,960
line, and when the teenage cashier got to the

434
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,800
open package of Oreos, they exclaimed, wow, you must have been hungry.

435
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,240
Before I could finish paying, they commented. If a human being said those

436
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,920
words to me, I'd melt into a puddle. Yeah. Before I could

437
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,680
finish paying, they then commented that their dad would have never

438
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,040
opened snacks in the store, and I must be a cool dad.

439
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,440
I am a childless 25-year-old man.

440
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,600
How do I atone for my voyeuristic Oreo eating behaviors, or have I been

441
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,200
punished enough? Okay, first of all, it's

442
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,920
exhibitionist Oreo eating behaviors. Yes. You weren't watching other people eat

443
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,280
Oreos, so let's get that. Although, I bet you're

444
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,880
just a few keystrokes away on youtube.com

445
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,080
from enjoying that very specific kink. I would argue that the person who

446
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,600
commented, my dad would never let me do that, you must be a cool dad.

447
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,200
Maybe that moment has nothing to do with you whatsoever. Yeah, I think they were

448
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,360
just wanting to share a little bit about their dad.

449
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,880
Is the boat moving the table, or are we just leaning

450
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,280
hard? Yeah, I'm leaning both. I want every inch of this show. Maybe the rest of that sentence was,

451
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,000
and will you be my dad and watch me eat Oreos?

452
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,400
I am confused by a strange part of this question.

453
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:05,280
Okay. Of seeing somebody at the store eating Oreos and saying, boy, you must

454
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,760
have been hungry, as if Oreos is something you eat

455
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:16,560
to satisfy a powerful hunger. Okay, all right, okay,

456
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,360
did you want them to just start gnawing on some

457
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,720
like dry fettuccine? Like, what do you want?

458
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,320
Did you want them to, not specifically targeted at you, I'm sorry, I could pick

459
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,640
anything, but like... Nobody's ever been like,

460
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,680
it's dinner time,

461
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,080
I have a hamburger here, I also, ooh, these Oreos would

462
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,000
fill me right up. Okay, hold on, stop, no, wait, they're at the grocery store,

463
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,840
they don't have a hamburger here. What I, let me frame this better.

464
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,440
If I was this cashier and somebody came through and

465
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,720
had an open thing of Oreos, my response would be,

466
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,160
wow, Oreos sure taste good, huh? It would not be,

467
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,880
boy, those will fill you right up like food does at a meal.

468
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,000
Yeah, but you wouldn't, yeah, you wouldn't say anything.

469
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,160
If you watched someone eat 10 Oreos, you wouldn't assume,

470
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,120
I bet they weren't hungry. That's a wild thing to say though. Because I'm pretty

471
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,640
sure in the question it said, an empty pack of Oreos. You can have a

472
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,000
hunger for lots of things, and sometimes you have a hunger for Oreos.

473
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,400
I'm sure they would have loved to have a nice sit-down meal with some grilled

474
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,320
asparagus. Yeah, and a... Does anybody understand the point I'm

475
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,240
trying to make, or am I? No, I, listen, I understand what you're

476
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,560
saying, but I think what you were ignoring is, I am a

477
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,600
human being in the world, who exists in society,

478
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:42,400
if I saw anybody eat anything, even if it was asparagus and steak or whatever, I

479
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,440
wouldn't say, you must be hungry, because that person's

480
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,560
a monster. Yeah. Like, walk, okay, tomorrow, everyone in this room,

481
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,440
walk around the Lido Market tomorrow. Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry. You must be hungry.

482
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,480
Because the answer is always, yeah. Yeah, for sure. And here's a sneak peek,

483
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,160
I'm gonna be hungry again in six hours. Catch me then,

484
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,840
for a new meal called dinner. I'll be there.

485
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,200
I think the better, what they should have said is, oh, someone wants to be

486
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,520
shoplifting. Oh, someone's doing a bit of tummy

487
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,560
smuggling. So you don't sell these Oreos by weight.

488
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,600
Okay, I'll take my business and my Oreos elsewhere.

489
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,760
Hi, I don't think I want to buy these Oreos. I tried 10 of them, and I don't

490
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,960
like them. I thought they were regular, but they

491
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,480
taste like peanut butter. They taste too much, there's too much peanut butter and

492
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,040
too much chocolate. It's just overall too flavorful.

493
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,040
I want my money back. I didn't buy them, my mistake.

494
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,080
Goodbye, you'll never see me again. Oh no, I brought these Oreos from home.

495
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,000
I need to, don't get freaked out if I run as fast as I can

496
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,760
out of the store. It's part of my exercise I do. I left my money in the

497
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,240
car.

498
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,640
Hey, here's a Yahoo that was sent in by approximately

499
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,360
every living human being on the planet. It's asked by an anonymous Yahoo answers

500
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:15,520
user who I'm going to call Jambus. Jambus asks,

501
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,880
horse funeral supplies?

502
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:26,000
Where can I buy horse funeral supplies? Big box store.

503
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:34,320
We did it. America, we did it.

504
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,840
There's only three people that have stood up to leave the room. No,

505
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:44,480
four. Okay, bye. Still a good job. Catch the rest of it. Yeah, we usually turn the

506
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,600
house lights off so we don't get real-time data. But this is good.

507
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,880
This is theater of the mind. No, Travis, it is not. This is theater of

508
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,640
the watching the analytics as they happen. We can pretend the

509
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,440
balcony is ride or die. It's all full. It's done.

510
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,720
See, a big... To be fair, it's not like the ship was sold out.

511
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,800
Oh, no. Hey, so like a big box store. I should explain it. Yeah. Anyway, a

512
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,200
big box store, but also a big box is like for a

513
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,360
horse's coffin. Yeah. Imagine a horse has died. You didn't

514
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,360
care about it personally. How do I get my co-workers to compliment

515
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,240
me on my leftovers? One of my co-workers often gets

516
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,480
compliments on the leftovers he brings for lunch like,

517
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,840
ooh, that looks good and that smells nice.

518
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,760
Whereas, you know, compliments. You know, compliments. Ooh, food. Whereas, I get

519
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,320
none. I pride myself on being a good cook and

520
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,920
I'd like some validation from my peers. How do I make my famous chili look as

521
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,720
delicious as it tastes? Doesn't sound like it's very famous,

522
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,800
this chili. And it doesn't seem about looks. Who is ever... Like, it's mostly

523
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,520
about smell, right? Smell, yeah. Because no

524
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,560
matter how good it looks, if you're like, oh, that's a good looking dish,

525
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,800
it smells like shit. Yeah, especially chili. All chili more or less looks the

526
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,800
same. I need to huff it to know. That looks like a mistake you made by

527
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,280
blending ingredients together. Oh, a beans mistake.

528
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,640
Let me huff it. That's good. It might also be...

529
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,600
There's a possibility that your co-worker's food is

530
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,880
so bad that the other co-workers are saying,

531
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,320
that looks great. Oh, it's reaction formation. Yeah, you say the opposite of...

532
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:31,040
Yeah, that makes sense. Oh, good job. Might I suggest a little garnish? Just a little green.

533
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,320
A little bit of green. And thus, receive him king.

534
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,160
Just a little bit of garnish on there can relate. Maybe some

535
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,760
scallions? Or... Like fresh scallions from your office box?

536
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,920
From your desk drawer? If you saw someone pull out

537
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,040
a container of Tupperware chili and taped to it

538
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,960
was a small envelope of scallions, that is something you would comment on.

539
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,400
That person needs you to compliment their chili.

540
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,920
It's extremely important. And they just start narrating

541
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,560
in the moment, like, and I'm just gonna microwave this at three minutes on high.

542
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,240
Oh, a little bit of sour cream on there. Cut up scallions. Voila!

543
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,760
I did it. It doesn't look good. It's chili. Yeah. No one's ever gonna

544
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,080
look at your stinky bean soup and say, hmm, looks good. There's a thousand

545
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,720
recipes for chili. You know what that means? Chili is a food

546
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,400
that you cook by, I don't know, it's just what I had. I put it all in a bowl and

547
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,280
cooked it for a long time and now it's chili, I suppose.

548
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,320
No one's ever gonna say, hmm, looks good. They're gonna say, looks like you had

549
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,480
those ingredients handy. Is it? There is a moment in every chili

550
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,800
cook's life where they said, I think this is chili.

551
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,080
Yeah, I think I did chili. Is it possible that maybe we could glow

552
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:48,240
up the container that the chili is brought into the building? Maybe it's

553
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,040
just a, maybe it's a sight lines thing, right? You

554
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,920
carry a bowl of chili into a building. Who the fuck are you? What is that? That's

555
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,040
a bowl of chili. Get it out of my sight. A red wagon

556
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,400
full of chili. A radio flyer wagon. Full of chili. Full of chili. How have

557
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,080
you protected the radio flyer? Uh, yeah, good question,

558
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,520
Justin. How have we protected and captured the smell inside of the wagon?

559
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,680
You stupid idiot. No, I'm just saying, I feel like if you

560
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,640
tried to dump a bunch of chili into a wagon, it would fall right out.

561
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,960
All right. Open your mind, Justin. I'm asking you to open your mind. It's thick

562
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,680
chili. It's thick chili and there's no chili. It's solid chili. It's frozen in a

563
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,160
block. There's no chili thick enough to not

564
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,040
slip between the cracks in a red rider wagon. Thank you for asking.

565
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,160
My chili. It's Griffin's problem to solve. You don't have to help him.

566
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,840
It was Griffin's bad idea. You don't have to fix this. But I'm going to shark tank it.

567
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:49,680
Griffin, how do you keep the chili in the wagon? You're right. I'm sorry.

568
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,360
What if you carry it into the office one handful at a time?

569
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:01,680
Dump it right on your desk. Leave. Dump more. Next handful. This will take all day.

570
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,840
You will not be paid for your work on this day.

571
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:10,640
Oh. Maybe if you wrote on the package, Nana's last chili.

572
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,840
But then you kept bringing it in every Friday.

573
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,960
Yeah. To a point where they're like, should we still be having it?

574
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,000
Eventually someone will call you on it and be like, no, no, no. It's a chili

575
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,560
starter.

576
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,240
You call yourself a chef.

577
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,080
This question comes to us from someone here on your team.

578
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,840
The short version is their mom sends them

579
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:42,000
a lot of things in the mail. So she sends me cutouts from magazines,

580
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,360
old bottles, junk mail from my high school.

581
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,680
I'm 33 and haven't been back to high school since 2006.

582
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,240
That's true of most people. Yeah, it would be weird to go back to your high school.

583
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,280
A lot of people don't go back and they're like, you know what? Let me try math

584
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,120
again. I'm gonna do math again. Unless you're dreaming, that does

585
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,320
happen to me a lot. Sometimes it's even things that she found around the house

586
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,160
that just made her quote, think of me. And she always puts a little

587
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,760
note in the box or letter that says, just look at it and then throw it away.

588
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,200
I've asked her to stop sending me what is essentially trash,

589
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,720
but she won't. Brothers, how do I keep my mom to stop

590
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,800
turning my mailbox into a garbage can? That's from trying to keep it clean.

591
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,200
Kelly, Kelly are you here? Your mom thinks you're garbage.

592
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,200
Your mom is burning you left and right.

593
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,280
I saw this garbage and thought of you.

594
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,680
Go back to high school. It's nice that you do have a permission slip to not

595
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,800
care about something that your parents have sent you is always

596
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,000
a real relief. That would be nice if dad when he texts me like, hey do you remember

597
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,760
Jim Johnson? He died. If the rest of that text was,

598
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,520
and I don't expect you to care about it at all.

599
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,840
Your dentist's uncle died, but it's fine. It's fine. Ignore this. But hey,

600
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:10,880
it's chill. Keep doing what you're doing. I realized that you had no personal

601
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,440
attachment to it whatsoever. I just needed to use up some minutes I

602
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,080
had on my phone. This is a test and if you've actually

603
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,760
been throwing these things away, I regret to inform you you have been

604
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,000
failing the test catastrophically. She's gonna come to your house and be like

605
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,880
where's the bottle? Oh. Just, she may not even say anything. You will just see her

606
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,240
looking around. No, it is for a scrapbook of some sort.

607
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,480
I would throw it in the trash without opening it because that way there's no

608
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,600
guilt. It's kind of a Schrodinger's trash situation.

609
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,800
Maybe it was good, maybe it was bad. You'll live with the mystery and you

610
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,040
won't live with the trash. Unless. But what if? Unless. Unless.

611
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,520
Unless. Oh is it mine? I said but it and that's nothing.

612
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,040
No, unless it is possible. Does your mom ever send you like just $100 bills

613
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,680
because they don't do Justin's thing. I was going to say

614
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,440
a check. There was a story that we heard in church

615
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,760
literally monthly about someone getting a Bible as a gift for graduation

616
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,560
and then throwing it away and they left a hot check for a hundred dollars in the

617
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,920
Bible. Like literally, monthly we're hearing

618
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,960
this story like don't throw away the Bibles that your dad gets you.

619
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,920
Don't throw away any Bible. It could have a check for a hundred dollars in it.

620
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,960
What's great about that is that literally the pastor is saying

621
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,240
normally it's worthless but maybe there is secret money in it.

622
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,560
Which way you look like a dick. Yeah, I probably look like a real

623
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,400
goober at every hotel that I went to that had a Gideon's in the jar.

624
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,960
The Mormons love Gideon's. You had a very straightforward national

625
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,400
treasure experience. Flip, flip, flip, adventure over.

626
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,760
All that lesson I taught you is look in the Bible

627
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,280
before you throw it away. Hello, I'd like to be moved.

628
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,680
Hotel rooms please. 16 times if possible. I have very

629
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:08,000
exacting standards. I'll be honest with you, I've used the Bible up.

630
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,560
Hey, this Bible's empty. This Bible empty. Next room. Another one

631
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,520
of these calls.

632
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:34,160
I want to munch, squad. Boy, I want to munch, squad.

633
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,800
So this is Munch Squad. It's a podcast within the podcast that profiles the

634
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,400
latest and greatest in brand eating. Oh, Juice, you actually just did the Munch

635
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,240
Squad with your wild salad. Hey, welcome to Justin Brand Eats.

636
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,080
Prepare your proposal. Pepsi debuts diamond engagement ring made

637
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,720
with crystal Pepsi. Consumers can enter to win a sustainably made ring via

638
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,800
social media. Oh, thank God. Yeah, thank God this one crystal Pepsi

639
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,160
ring was sustainably made. That should fix everything. Thank you, Pepsi.

640
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,280
You fixed it all. That sweet young girl can retire now.

641
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,280
She put her feet up, go fishing. Yeah. Pepsi fixed everything with its one

642
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,320
sustainable crystal Pepsi diamond. For people about to pop the question,

643
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:20,640
Pepsi has introduced an unusual new engagement ring. The beverage company

644
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,960
has debuted the Pepsi engagement ring made with one big difference. This

645
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:30,160
diamond is infused with crystal Pepsi. Fuck off.

646
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,720
Just hear me out, Trav. How do you infuse a diamond with the... Oh, my God.

647
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,120
Let me see your ring. It's got... If you think I'm not going to

648
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,800
detail exactly how this is happening, you're wrong. Okay, let's let him

649
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,440
get through it. Yes, this is my great-grandpa's ring.

650
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,520
The brand is asking fans on Twitter to tweet their most creative, bold, or

651
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,960
bizarre proposal ideas with the brand's social handle and

652
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,800
hashtag's hashtag Pepsi proposal. Okay, so Pepsi worked with a creative

653
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,400
agency that I will not name because they don't get the free publicity

654
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,080
to create the ring. It says here McElroy Brothers industry. Oh, no.

655
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,320
So, according to the brand, the ring was made by boiling down Pepsi's clear

656
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:17,680
beverage to its most basic carbon form, resulting in a powder. This

657
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,520
powder was then added to the process for creating a lab-grown diamond,

658
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,360
which requires using a small piece of natural diamond that is placed in

659
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,360
the carbon under high-pressure temperature.

660
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,960
Quick aside. They figure out how to make diamonds? Because why are we making this

661
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,920
fucking podcast? I thought only Superman could make

662
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,320
diamonds. We could just go and make diamonds, boys.

663
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:40,240
Sell them on a cruise ship, I guess. Not everything that can be made by man

664
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,240
no longer has value. You'll see that point. No, listen to podcasts.

665
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,960
Yeah, that's fucking true. So, okay, I could have stopped there and it would

666
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,680
have been pretty terrible, but I thought, wait a minute, you just

667
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,560
gave me the hashtag. So, let me get up on Twitter and see what

668
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:59,360
we're doing. Let me see what's cooking. So, here's some proposal ideas that

669
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,760
people sent to the brand Pepsi. Fluffy said, up in a hot air balloon, a

670
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,240
daybreak.

671
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:12,720
Sure, cool. That sounds good. Creative. Julie tweeted this

672
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,280
to Pepsi. I would invite you out for a picnic,

673
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,960
Pepsi, the brand. I'd spread the tablecloth out on the

674
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,880
ground and reach in the picnic basket and pull out a Pepsi

675
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,120
and then set the Pepsi engagement ring next to it and ask the question.

676
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:35,680
April followed up just moments after, tweeting directly at Pepsi,

677
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:42,320
I'd love to get engaged to Pepsi. Folks, you're not marrying Pepsi. Wait, hold on,

678
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,600
Justin. Aren't they? You're not. I would get,

679
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,480
Dennis said, I would get down, this is all caps,

680
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,240
I would get down on my knee and propose very loud so she can hear me with my

681
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:57,600
crystal Pepsi ring. Why? Because she's 300 feet away.

682
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:03,920
As is legally binding. Yeah. Mikey said, well, I gotta find that love.

683
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:09,680
Oh, Mikey. Oh, no. Hey, so Mikey's here tonight if anyone's...

684
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,920
I gotta find a love who loves cherry Pepsi as much as me.

685
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,080
Winky face? I don't think so, Mikey. Yeah, it's not a cherry, it's not a cherry

686
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,800
Pepsi diamond. Yeah, and I don't think that winky, that's

687
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,840
a ring pop. Go to the beach with her and hand her,

688
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,600
while on one knee, a cherry Pepsi with this awesome ring

689
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,560
around the straw and say, will you marry me?

690
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,160
Hey, like, it's so weird that you got the soda wrong, Mikey, that I'm going to move

691
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,800
on instantly. Then William burst through the

692
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,040
door. Please permanently bring back Pepsi

693
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,400
holiday spice as an annual tradition or rename it

694
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,520
Pepsi Spice and keep it permanently. And then William departs. How romantic.

695
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,960
William jumps out the window. That, no, that's how he'd propose.

696
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:56,480
Uh, Liu just... I will! Liu just tweeted a still image of Medea.

697
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:02,640
So I don't know, I don't know exactly what the plan is, but it's just a single

698
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:08,000
still image of Medea. It's what I've been waiting for since I was a little child.

699
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,240
Omar says, how would I do it? Hmm, probably like James Bond.

700
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,200
Pull up in an Aston Martin. Act like someone or something is in danger.

701
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,760
Get her into the car and drive to the beach. Then Pepsi responded to

702
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:28,400
that one and said, hashtag sounds cool to us. What the fuck, Pepsi?

703
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,000
It sounds cool for the person to drive up, pretend like someone's

704
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,880
in danger. You know that great scene in every James Bond movie

705
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,320
where he pulls up in a car, he's like, uh, your dog

706
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,320
has... Imagine it like this. Griffin is my love. Screech!

707
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:49,360
Someone's gonna die! Oh no, I'll get in the car with you.

708
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:55,840
Anyways, I love Pepsi. Do you forever? Pepsi sounds cool to us. Kim said, I would

709
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:00,240
say as I got down on one knee, you're as beautiful as the sound of opening

710
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,440
Pepsi. You're as sweet as the taste of Pepsi,

711
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,080
and I like Pepsi. I want you to know that I have you

712
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,280
forever. Will you be mine forever and ever until

713
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,000
the end of time? Sure, Kim, that sounds nice. Stephen

714
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,640
swoops in.

715
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:25,280
Traditional on one knee in place of particular interests to myself and my

716
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,080
S.O. Crowds are unnecessary. Photography is

717
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,280
required. And then I'd kill both of you. Yeah, hey

718
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,360
Stephen, that sucks. Like, all of that energy that you just

719
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,800
brought to a single tweet really stinks, and I hope that Pepsi throws this ring

720
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,560
in the trash as a result. I hope that Pepsi passes that tweet

721
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:48,080
onto the FBI. Yeah, that person should be on a watch list. I hope whoever gets

722
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:54,240
proposed to with the Pepsi ring says, do you have coke?

723
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,240
That's gonna do it for us here. My brother, my brother, and me,

724
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,400
thank you so much for coming.

725
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:09,040
Let's see, there's some, oh god, this is crass, but I'm

726
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,280
Travis. There's merch up there. We have the

727
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,400
Adventure Zone graphic novel. We have some

728
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,560
Cruise inspired pins of our faces where we're in

729
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:26,000
jaunty sailor caps. Yes. We're going to be doing a second

730
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
shot. A lot of different things, yeah. We're doing a signing where we'll be

731
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,640
signing the Avengers Zone or whatever the hell you want to bring.

732
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,680
Yeah, look for it in the schedule because we don't know where it is.

733
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:42,400
I've got a Disney sing-along coming up on Thursday.

734
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,560
Hey, and thank you to everybody, thank you to Jekyll and Cruise for having us.

735
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,080
This is the best week. And thank you to Mike and Joyelle for

736
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,360
their opening. Oh yes, they were so good. Thanks

737
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,040
also to John Rodgick, the long winners for their theme song, It's a Departure,

738
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,960
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

739
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,480
And I know what you're wondering, isn't John Roddick on this boat? Why isn't he

740
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,280
here? He's doing the intro song for another

741
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,200
podcast on the other end of the boat. Yeah.

742
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,880
It's so embarrassing. If you've never heard our show,

743
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,160
we have one ending question that Griffin reads, and it's a final Yahoo,

744
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,800
and it's one that we think about and come back in the next episode and kind

745
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,000
of discuss our thoughts on. Yes, a few people sent this one in. Oh, so this is

746
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,160
fun. We'll get to talk about it in like an hour. Yeah, sure.

747
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,880
A few people sent this one in. It's from Yahoo Answers user Big Frog who asks,

748
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:35,280
who else thought Alvin, parentheses, Alvin and the Chipmunks,

749
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,240
was an asshole?

750
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,000
My name is Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy. This has been

751
