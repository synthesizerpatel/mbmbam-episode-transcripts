1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,020
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,020
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:15,820
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modular

9
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,600
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

10
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,380
Travis

11
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,780
Yeah

12
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:28,660
Yeah, this is Griffin McElroy. This one's good. This one's got Griffin on it. This one does have Griffin in the mix

13
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,060
putting a little bit of

14
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,060
sauce on it and

15
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:39,700
Yeah, welcome welcome guys. Hey guys, are you gonna ask me about cuz I did it there. No, we're not

16
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,540
Pointedly, we're not doing well cuz I I was thinking about what's fancy. Thank you for asking

17
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,860
I was thinking about what's fancy and I think I was doing too much and that's not fancy and you know

18
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:54,140
It's fancy like a one name name, you know, that's cool. Yeah. Yeah

19
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:01,140
Or Kesha. Yes, a lot of people when they think about fancy they think about

20
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,820
aristocratic like

21
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,820
Pass me my right my my very thin toast, right?

22
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:14,020
I fancy but my main exposure to fancy people has been at

23
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,640
Like a bar, but they're wearing like a business suit. Yeah, and they're like

24
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,860
Why don't you get out of here kid?

25
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,540
Do you know like that, huh? Yeah, like this stinky kid in here

26
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:35,980
yeah, and but they'll be like the only fancy person in there and yeah, I'll walk up and I'll be like to the bartender be

27
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,980
like can I get a

28
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,500
Drink and then the guy I'll be like

29
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:48,180
Are you sure about that kid wait, is this the bartender speaking to you or a businessman at the no

30
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,820
It's the businessman sitting at the counter and he's got like fucking 20 babes. Oh

31
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,460
Wow. Well, that's probably why he wants you to get away because he needs those stools for his babes

32
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:07,060
Yeah, I I whenever I walk up for a big table kid. We didn't make a reservation for my birthday

33
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,980
We forgot to I was supposed to but then I got too busy being rich

34
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:20,260
It's my 15th birthday kid. I'm so excited to eat here at Applebee's

35
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
That's my plane

36
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:30,580
That right. I crashed it into the Applebee's because I was so excited for the Jack Daniels burger

37
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,460
I'm very hurt

38
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,620
But I'm eating good in the neighborhood kid. My voice box is damaged

39
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,580
That's why I sound like this

40
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:49,380
He sucks and he sucks the atmosphere the joy out of the Applebee's room that I'm in. Yeah, but fuck he looks cool

41
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:56,100
He looks so cool. And does he have one name? Is that related to this in any way? He doesn't have any name

42
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,300
Oh, that's how he forgot it in the crash. He forgot it in the crash

43
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:07,700
He refers to himself as plane because I think maybe like that's the only word he could remember because this head got so fucked

44
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,700
Up in the crash. Yeah

45
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:16,020
These 20 babes are all paramedics. Yeah, then they're doing a surgery on me

46
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:23,500
But I can be awake and eat my Jack Daniels burger while they do it. Oh fuck. I see my grandpa

47
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,980
Bye kid

48
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:33,380
He's been dead for 10 years in case that wasn't clear in this audio format. I hate this bully this 15 year old

49
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,900
This 15 year old fancy bully. Who's dying in the Applebee's. How'd he get so rich?

50
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,460
I don't know. Is he even rich? Is there actually a plane outside? We don't know

51
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,620
We don't know. That's the thing. That's how they get you the fans. Anyway, that's the fancy

52
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,940
I think of and it makes me worried that

53
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,500
Maybe this isn't a good year theme because I don't want to turn into that

54
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,300
No, no

55
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,820
Whoa

56
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,760
That scared the ever-living shit out of me. We got a blart watch

57
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,940
Now if this is okay if this is what I think it is

58
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,580
This is our segment blart watch where we keep you updated on literally every scrap of information

59
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:20,900
About a possible third Paul Blart movie. Yeah, sometimes sometimes news only covers big moves

60
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,260
We cover even like the involuntary twitches

61
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,980
This has been a segment that we've had for years. Yeah, this is just the first

62
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,900
The segment has been ongoing for years. We've been doing it the last five years. Yeah

63
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,940
Yeah, this has been an ongoing segment Paul Blart mall cop

64
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,580
three

65
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:48,140
Everyone literally every single human babies come out of the womb first word

66
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,140
Like everybody's asking about it

67
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,620
and

68
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,340
Kevin James, mr. Kevin did dr. Kevin James did a story at the interview

69
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,860
I guess you'd say that turned into a story with screen ramp

70
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,420
And they asked him about it. They're like blart 3. What's up? We've heard a lot of bugs

71
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,340
We've heard a lot of buzz most of it created by us

72
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:17,420
Okay, and here's what he said and and really like read between the lines. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well

73
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,860
Well, you gotta work that one out. I would love that. I

74
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:30,820
Don't know what the story is yet, but it was so much fun shooting in Vegas. That was a great time. There's

75
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:37,380
Something there there's something there right you guys feel that too, right? There's something there

76
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,820
There's something there, but I don't know if it's maybe the thing you think it is so much

77
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,680
Well, no, listen Trav. Huh? You've forgotten history

78
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:55,160
Kevin James got pretty burnt up in the big Sony hack where they reveal all this stuff about so he can't

79
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:03,120
Say outright like we're doing it baby because then that the hackers will crash is and they'll find on own

80
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,880
We'll get him and they'll find it his fucking like PowerPoint presentation. That's yeah having fun with friends

81
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,880
Vegas again

82
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,760
Gambling risk and love of family question like the big the big bullet points of three and then we're all gonna be spoiled

83
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,840
Aren't we so instead my man James comes out and does

84
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,040
little

85
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:31,360
Crypt cryptic little messages for the true fans little ARG's that you really have to dive into right? I think I I

86
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,920
Okay, I'm not saying that's not the case

87
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,960
But I think that maybe one of the clues of the ARG

88
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,120
Here that he's laying down is that he's taken on what I like to think of as the Sandler mentality, which is yeah

89
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,860
I'll do a movie if it's in a place. I would also like to take a vacation

90
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,680
Yeah, oh, yeah. No, no kidding. That's because I mean he throws it right in there when you say hey Kevin James

91
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,840
What you know, we're talking about a third Bart and he's like, oh, yeah

92
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,280
I love making Bart too because I got to go to Las Vegas

93
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,940
I had a lot of fun with my buddies, right and let me say a lot of people can hate on the happy Madison squad

94
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:12,240
And have a lot of justification for doing so they're living their best lives. They've well, they've they've got it

95
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,680
They're living their best life to their own capacity for best life, I guess

96
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:24,400
Yeah, but they can probably be using their time better, right? Kevin's reached the point though. We're like he wants to also make

97
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,080
Art and shit like he's like, um, I want to have a good time

98
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:35,100
But also like it's it's Oscar season. He needs his punch drunk. Love is what he needs. Yeah

99
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:41,660
Do you say you what? You've been quiet and I feel like usually when you do that you are googling something

100
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:48,300
I'm just listening to you guys. I did my job. I brought you do you know how hard I had to work to get these scoops?

101
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:54,260
Yeah, we tweeted it out us Justin. Kevin James is a very religious person. Do you guys know this? Oh, really?

102
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,260
It's a man tracks, right?

103
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:02,980
If you came to me who's like Kevin James hardcore atheist like I'm really belligerent about it. I'd be like, well really Kevin

104
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:09,540
Can I tell you something? Here's a quote from a little bit ago. He said I am involved in my faith

105
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:16,680
It becomes a difficult difficult position. You have a platform and you don't want to do anything that doesn't glorify God in every way

106
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,260
So I just wanted to say that one time

107
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,480
Kevin James was lying on the floor of a Vegas hallway

108
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,940
Interior mall and he lied there while actress

109
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,620
the young actress

110
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,940
Glomped melted ice cream into his mouth. Yeah. Yeah curious diabetes to glorify God

111
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, and he was thinking like this is glorifying God in every way. Well and everything I'm doing right now

112
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,920
This is this is for God. I'm gonna say this knowing that in four days

113
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,940
So much can change but it is kind of refreshing to hear

114
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,380
Kevin James say that but also not be shitty about it all the time

115
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,500
As happens so often with some people

116
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,580
I've heard some things. Oh, no

117
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:08,980
Do you I remember in grown-ups too when mr. James burps and farts and sneezes at the same time and it's like you raise me

118
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:21,100
This actually gives me a lot of hope because I we talked in a I believe this past year's till death do us part

119
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,540
about the possibility of having a

120
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:29,660
um Paul Blart set in heaven one a place James wants to go to

121
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,500
Would glorify God right? So like we're setting up

122
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:39,180
Like the two biggest it seems like check marks for a bar three, right?

123
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:46,120
Now we just need I think some way to get another like maybe get Adam Sandler in there

124
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,860
He reprises his role as little Nicky get the fuck out. Yes. Yes

125
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:56,340
Yes battle for the fate of humanity. That's good. That's good stuff. Anyway, this is a vice show

126
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,780
I actually just got way too excited about

127
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,440
Like I said it and I felt like I unlocked something like I was doing an escape room

128
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,500
And I just found like a three-letter word somewhere

129
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,580
I'm in the creative process and we like to do that here where there are no stakes and no one listens

130
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:19,420
To absolutely and also no next step like I said follow up. Yeah, I'm not yeah. I'm not gonna create like a

131
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,740
You the listener

132
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:29,100
My sister's fiance only drinks out of empty mason jars when they visit my parents night. Mm-hmm

133
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,220
At first I thought we were just out of glasses

134
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,820
Which is weird because we have so many glasses that it's hard to fit them all in a cupboard when they're all washed

135
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,740
Oh, don't you hate that whenever somebody gets to be new mugs at this point?

136
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,500
I'm like, well, some of y'all are going to the farm. Come on

137
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,740
For all the mugs I own I've already curated my mug collection to a point where I they all spark joy

138
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,060
I'm so I'm so picky about mugs

139
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,780
So pick you know that the Austin City limits mugs that you guys guys given those are perfect

140
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,380
Yeah, this guy bigger than the stand. I can't have a standard 12-ounce mung. Look now now

141
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,460
Are you kidding me?

142
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:06,100
After it happened a few times we decided to hide the darts in a different cabinet to sway him away from them

143
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,340
So they he went to get some water and walk back to the living room with you guessed it a mason jar

144
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:15,060
Is there something wrong with our glasses? Who is this jar man?

145
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:21,840
Does he know something that we don't that's from novel sipping in Nova Scotia now we grew up in a house where our mom

146
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,820
would

147
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,020
routinely

148
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,340
Clean out jelly jars. Oh, yeah, and they would become the cups. Those are the cups for you

149
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,620
Now these are what we drink out of these jelly jars

150
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,420
Which is I think I I think it says a lot bad sad things that society's moved away from that

151
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:44,120
Because I remember time where Welch's if I remember correctly it was was it Garfield themed like inside

152
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,140
Oh, those were the fucking days baby, and it was like yo, you finished this tiny jelly jar. Hey, guess what?

153
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:57,800
It's Garfield Garfield cup now, baby. Enjoy your liquid and now we're all just like using cups. Oh

154
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,620
Oh now I will say there's one aspect of this question that

155
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:09,380
And we I mean, I you know, we're all about context on the show and I just kind of context like yes, I assume

156
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,100
That he rooted through the kitchen and found one of the mason jars you hid

157
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,940
But it does leave just enough wiggle room for me to wonder

158
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:23,200
Did he bring his own mason jar just in case he couldn't find a mason jar. That's interesting

159
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,960
Hey, let me say this fuck glasses the glass fuck glass cups. Okay, I will always

160
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,800
spring for a plastic cup over a glass cup because I don't know who had this idea of

161
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,400
Hey, let's take this stuff that gets really really crazy sharp when you do a whoopsie with it

162
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:49,500
I put it as close to our mouth and face as we possibly get like you you it's an unnecessary risk, isn't it?

163
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:56,300
I bet there is if I drop a plastic cup worst thing that happens liquid on the floor if I drop a glass

164
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,620
Liquid on the floor and also a bunch of invisible knives everywhere. Cool. Awesome

165
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:09,100
I bet it was so fucking frustrating for the like scientists that invented like the polycarbonate to make cups out of and they're like we did

166
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:16,100
It we changed the game. Everyone's gonna be safe now. No more. Okay time for you guys to all start. Why aren't they?

167
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,420
Okay, you know cuz we did it so everybody can start you're still buying

168
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,060
Glass though. Why is everybody?

169
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,740
normalize

170
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,180
Plastic glass plastic stemware normalize it. Yes. Oh my god

171
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:34,060
I've shreked so many glasses over just by turning my huge terrible body around

172
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,760
I

173
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:42,100
Smash a glass now it also like to have a five-year-old and now a two-year-old that I smash something and they just yell like oh

174
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:48,140
No, or what did you do? And it's like I know don't also didn't want to do this

175
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,380
Don't worry, sweetie. Daddy made a big purple mess and also invisible knives everywhere

176
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:59,020
Have fun. You're gonna stay on that chair and never walk on the ground ever again. It's ridiculous. Get that glass out of here

177
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:05,820
Anyway, and without fail I will like hands and knees like scour that place to try to pick up all the glass and then two

178
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,940
Hours later Teresa will come to him back. Hey, did you break a glass? I'm like, yeah, she's like yeah

179
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,460
There was glass everywhere. I'm like where I

180
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,940
think a mason jar is one of those things that is charming it like

181
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,260
aesthetically, right it is

182
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:28,100
By definition kind of a cutesy thing to drink out. We got me and Rachel got married in, Texas

183
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,180
So, of course we came home from that wedding with approximately six hundred thousand mason jars

184
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,300
Yeah, and we drink out of before a while, but then eventually we were like

185
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:42,140
This is this is too many of the same type of thing that is made out of glass to have in our home

186
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,060
And so we took it out on the street. We threw them on cars that went by

187
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:51,380
No, wait, wait, like that's bonding. That's a romantic thing for us to do

188
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,660
Hey, can we approach the Wizards throne? Wait, just real quick. I'm betting that this is like his thing, you know

189
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,220
I mean, I'm the mason jar guy, you know, this is that's interesting. I'm a cowboy

190
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,540
baby, I drink out of mason jars that don't

191
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,180
sleep inside

192
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:16,900
Probably part of it. It's just like you get used. I'm like I said, like I like four cups

193
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,580
There's four cups. I like

194
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,480
Maybe that's just all he likes. He doesn't it doesn't make him feel good to drink out of other cups

195
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:29,420
Maybe you have like I don't want to be this guy. But like maybe you have bad guys

196
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:35,660
Ooh, does he got big hands and you got a little thing cups and makes him feel like a monster because that happens to me

197
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,500
Sometimes I'm just saying it's possible. You have bad cups. This is true

198
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,220
Maybe he's never used a cup before and he sees your cups and he's like, I bet that's for science

199
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,220
I'm gonna use the drinking jars

200
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,120
interesting interesting

201
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:55,260
Okay, so this this this little magic spell from the wizard is a great wait

202
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,940
Is he approaching us? Did he bring it to us this time? We approach each other and been home

203
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,740
That's nice Ben can't kind of facilitated it. Thank you, Ben

204
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,020
It's how to find gifts for people who bug you

205
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,580
wait, oh

206
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,900
I guess

207
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:15,940
Did you just cough and mute it because it sounded like you just gasped like a like an actual dinosaur

208
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,340
I'm a radio and professional. I don't like to come off into the mic

209
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,060
So I do like how you let us see other build up to it though

210
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,000
Yeah, well, I wasn't that quick on the trigger, but it kind of came out of nowhere. I'm gonna start reading

211
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:36,340
There's something there so funny there are people in life that no matter how hard you try to be open and think good of

212
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,020
Bug you for one reason or other. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder what that's like

213
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,620
Finding gift for these people could be imagine doing a podcast with them

214
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,060
Because your head bugs you that much listen

215
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:52,500
Fine age for these people can be really really hard because your head is saying find the cheapest nastiest thing out there while your heart

216
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,380
Wants to do the right thing

217
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:01,860
So this I guess is their way of threading that needle although it is I would say it it trends much more toward the

218
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,940
Nastiest cheapest thing out there side of things. So it's not wait

219
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,100
It's not about what the your heart was the right thing. Yeah, you have to be the bigger proof

220
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,940
So they're annoying but you're great

221
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,500
So yeah, you're gonna give them a bunch of really clever gifts juice. This first one's great for you

222
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
So I'm just a hot tip

223
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,800
Purchase a large wooden spoon for the troublemaker in your family or workplace that person who is always causing trouble

224
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,600
Stirring up a mess and sticking their nose where it isn't wanted this gift says watch it

225
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,860
We think you're a pot stirrer for the less obtuse. This present is nicely pointed

226
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:44,340
So what was so fucking wicked? This is already can I say the wildest one of these?

227
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,020
I've ever yeah, this is off to such a tremendously forceful start

228
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,740
Yeah

229
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:56,540
What if me and Travis spent the whole episode making fun of your dumb cough and then two days later you shipped us

230
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,740
Big wooden spoons and you're like get it you fucking jerks

231
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:07,900
Well, I'll ship you like tiny wooden coffins and be like now who's coffee. Whoa. Wait, that might be

232
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,980
Can I say something though?

233
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:17,260
Fuck I love wooden cookware. Oh my god. Oh, I was a tiny wooden coffin. I'd actually think I was really cool

234
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,740
Yeah. Oh, yeah, you know, I've got a spoon chilla made out of wood

235
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,340
It's got a slot on the side where it can rest on your pant on your hell. Yeah. Oh, I

236
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,780
Love this guy. That's it, baby

237
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,580
Now, let me just say that if I were the receiver of a giant spoon and I wouldn't say I'm obtuse

238
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,900
You know compared to I don't know. I'm probably

239
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,820
Slightly above average as far as not being obtuse goes

240
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,300
I think I would open it and be like what the fuck is this?

241
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,340
I think someone would have to say cuz you're always stirring up the pot

242
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,340
I'm like, so you went to a lot of trouble, huh?

243
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:59,020
I'm like because I know you can't just pick up giant spoons like this anywhere you go

244
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:04,900
Is this cuz why hey, just give me a big box of dirt or so next time man

245
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,860
This next one goes I would say in the polar opposite direction

246
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,180
Wrap up some personal hygiene products for the person who never bathes or who breathes down your neck

247
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:21,740
Lasciviously even though this person knows you're taken those are two profoundly different things. That is yeah. Hey

248
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,100
Yeah, I got you this hygiene kit cuz you stink and hey Marcus

249
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,980
I got you this one cuz you're trying to fuck me and I don't yeah

250
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,480
I I would actually argue the person who's trying to fuck you and you give them a bunch of like

251
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:38,380
Bath and shower stuff. Yes, that seems like make yourself ready Marcus. Yeah

252
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,260
Going down on Sunday, dude

253
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,260
and

254
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:48,440
Can I also just say this kind of makes it seem like how to be a bully because if you're like, oh, you know

255
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,020
That guy he really bugs me because of his hygiene issues

256
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:58,580
And I'm gonna call it out in front of everyone at the white elephant party or whatever and be like, whoa in middle school

257
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,020
At Comac middle school

258
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:07,660
The most brutal thing you could do to somebody for a good long time was to walk up to them and say take a bath

259
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,780
Wash yourself. Yeah, and people would do that to each other and the other person would just

260
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,340
Crumble they would collapse in on themselves

261
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:22,580
Like a dying star like oh fuck. There's no come back to that. You can't be like no actually you're the one with bad hygiene

262
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,180
Anyway, yeah

263
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:31,660
This one's great blaster first. There's no yeah, you can't come back with that cuz it's like oh you would say that even if

264
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,580
You have impeccable hygiene. This one you also can't say like I bathed this morning Derek

265
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,020
This one is so fucking brutal if I ever got this one

266
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,420
I would oh I would just leave

267
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,060
Give that lazy son-in-law a cooking set and a food processor

268
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,640
It's time. He understood that cooking is for anyone in the household. Not just your daughter

269
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:03,020
Holy crap. Yeah now, okay. This is can I just say assuming a lot of things?

270
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:09,640
sometimes people share responsibilities and sometimes people split responsibilities and it's a like

271
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:17,700
This is a wild thing to do, right? Not only that but it's also like hey Derek you lazy fuck. Here's

272
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:25,680
$750 in William Sonoma cookware and it's like, yeah. Oh my thank you. Holy shit. This is beautiful. This is a no

273
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:31,640
You don't get it. You need to learn to cook. Well, I will now this is awesome. Thank you. Great. Thanks

274
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,760
I feel like my message isn't landing

275
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:42,200
Uh, the that one that can never be punctual let them know that they're always being late for everything is annoying by buying them

276
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,440
A watch so next time they late you can ask them. What's wrong with the watch?

277
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,000
I got you once again, like if someone got me a watch I'm like, oh, it's beautiful. Thank you. Like got him

278
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,440
This next one's not fucking weird at all

279
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,440
So perish the thought of it being weird

280
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:04,280
But give a sexy lingerie set to the prim and proper daughter-in-law who is driving you crazy with her perfectness. Oh, what?

281
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,280
Got him. What?

282
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Hey, hey

283
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,800
Samantha

284
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:17,400
I've been stuck on the name Samantha. I feel bad that I I feel like we're on a Samantha like try Judith

285
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,920
Hey Judith

286
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
You're so prim and proper

287
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,360
Check out this sexy lingerie

288
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,080
Marjorie

289
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,840
It's gonna say like maybe it's from the mom in this but even then there is no scenario in which this isn't like

290
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,440
Both curvy and also kind of like have fun having sex with my kid

291
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,080
Oh, sorry, then the next couple sentences are pretty dope

292
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,320
She'll be embarrassed at what possible thoughts are going through your head about her relations with your son

293
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,640
But your son will be totally cool with all this but be forewarned that given even as a joke

294
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,860
You may forever be labeled as a dirty old man or woman by everyone present. Yeah, it seems like a good trade-off worth it

295
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Worth the risk. No

296
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,560
Okay, okay, that's great

297
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,360
What happens though if your sign gives you a big thumbs up like thanks guys. Thanks dad. This is gonna give me mad voters

298
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,320
a

299
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:21,720
Lot of stuff about in-laws because this next one is give uncaring parents-in-law a large photo of you in a beautiful frame

300
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,640
I'm actually so into this

301
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,040
So they didn't put your picture out with the rest of the family or at least not one large enough to match the others make it

302
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,920
Up make up for it with this wonderful in-your-face addition to the family photo collection

303
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,960
It's a difficult gift to wriggle out of displaying. Make sure your smile is large. I feel like my smile is always large

304
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,800
are we talking like like I'd like a like a two by

305
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,480
Like what are we talking like a giant, you know

306
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:53,560
Like would go over the mantle four foot by eight foot kind of deal because I'm way into that like hey

307
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
I got you this

308
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,320
And I expect to see it every time I come over and I could come over anytime

309
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,400
there's an amazing illustration here of what looks like a crash test dummy with a wig on holding up a picture frame of

310
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,800
Himself and it's about the size of his torso. So that's a big one

311
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,280
Hey, how come we never use the adjective large to describe somebody smile?

312
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,160
a

313
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,120
beautiful

314
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,520
Large would if you were talking about like the Cheshire cat or some kind of demon

315
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,080
That's fair. Make a whistle and stopwatch kit. Give this to the bossy person in your life

316
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,800
It sends a message to them that you haven't exactly enjoyed their need to tell you what to do and when

317
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:38,020
So really this this article should be titled how to tell the people annoying you that they fucking suck

318
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,820
But also you spent money on it. Yeah, but also in like

319
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,300
the most annoying way possible like also the most like

320
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,520
Give me a second to let me just explain why this do you get it? I'm sick of your shit

321
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:58,540
You don't get this but it's like honestly like a really good burn and just give me a second to explain it to you

322
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:03,660
Please now I do actually like this because it could be fuel for your frustration fire that you're like

323
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:10,260
I put together this fucking great whistle and stopwatch bit and then this asshole didn't even bother to get the joke

324
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,260
fuck him I

325
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,300
Consider music what person consider music a song, you know

326
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,780
They don't they don't much like can turn into an entire CD by the artist in question after they open it

327
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,700
It's that's a sorry a song, you know

328
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:34,940
They don't much like can turn into an entire CD by the artist in question if you bury it in the ground

329
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:40,940
I think yeah, I think that their language here is a bit more passive

330
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,700
Like it can't turn into that with some I don't know the machinations given the right circumstances

331
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,580
After they open it insist they play it for everyone to hear

332
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,520
This is a great Christmas showstopper an album or mixy

333
00:26:53,860 --> 00:27:00,660
That touch on your frustration with this person can also have an interesting effect. Everyone clear your schedules for the next 45 minutes

334
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:08,580
Yeah, I've made an Enrique Iglesias mixy day and we're all gonna sit here and listen to it cuz cuz Dave doesn't like by Lamos

335
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:14,500
Yeah, hey doesn't like by Lamos. Hey dad put that CD on that. I got you sure son click

336
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:24,180
That's right, I have frustration with you provide I was just gonna say I love rage against the machine

337
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,660
Yeah, sure provide a set of knives to someone who backstabbed you

338
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:34,380
Well, it doesn't have to be real knives plastic toy ones from the dollar store still carry the message perfectly. Well, yeah

339
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:41,500
Just get this person knives and a spoon and a cookware set and their kitchen is furnished. Well done. You got him

340
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,020
Got a wiki how author

341
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:52,580
if I opened okay, you're telling me that me opening a set of like real ass like kitchen knives and

342
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:58,060
An opening a dollar store by a beautiful ornate

343
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:03,980
Yeah, it's nice is the same message as me opening a set of dollar store

344
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:10,640
Plastic like toy knives and I'd be like, oh I get it. I'm a backstab. Yeah. Got it

345
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,580
Keep your sense of humor throughout this exercise. It's meant to be a light-hearted

346
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,460
Weird kind of say something if you have a box of knives in a tasteful case

347
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,020
Yeah, and you wrap it up and you give it to someone and they open it and they're like, oh

348
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:32,520
Look at this. This is lovely. Thank you so much. So that's that but if you take a single knife and just wrap it

349
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:40,480
Sort of like unconsciously in wrapping paper. Yeah, and then give it to the person then they get all weird about it

350
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,700
It's like I'm sorry. I couldn't afford a whole set but like you don't need to be

351
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:49,220
Weird about and if you deliver those knives to them like to their front door anonymously one at a time

352
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:56,220
Like over a long period of time like stab into a pumpkin or whatever or just like wrapped in a Kroger bag or something

353
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,140
Yeah, you know and and suddenly you're arrested

354
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:06,980
That sucks. Yeah, I'm just trying to send the message that you're a backstabber Stephen. Keep a kid sense of humor

355
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,540
It's meant to be a light-hearted response to real challenges that you're facing

356
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:15,420
And it may backfire with some recipients if that is an outcome you're prepared to face these gift ideas might be for you

357
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,260
If not try more constructive means for approaching the nagging mother-in-law the overbearing boss

358
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,780
the faithless lover

359
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,400
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas Diane Oh plastic knives. Yeah. Yeah, I know

360
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:38,920
I know. Wait you got me and John the same present. Yeah, I know

361
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:46,200
Can I just say a quick question here. I got you a cuckoo clock because I know I

362
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,880
Know what you've done to me in my own house

363
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:56,680
And also here's a big spoon John you pot-stirrer. I got you the big spoon and her the little spoon because I know

364
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,680
everything. I know

365
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,760
Ding-dong cuckoo cuckoo. Wait, you actually made the bird say cuckoo. Yes

366
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:10,880
I did a lot of free time since you've been entertaining my wife and you you recognize that voice. That's Steve Goomba

367
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,880
I got him to do it on cameo

368
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,760
Worth it. Can I also just say real big just a little note?

369
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,600
I love that they say these might backfire it is unclear to me what the front fire hope is like

370
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,080
What were you hoping would fire out of me? I guess you got me

371
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,900
I love this and it's taught me a lesson about not bugging you. I guess the last one is just an image

372
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,020
I want maybe we can share it on the sushi after this episode comes up

373
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,640
I'm gonna send it to you guys in a minute

374
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:44,320
But the title is for those bad folks bad-mouthing you while their glass house reveals that one or both of them are married to someone else

375
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,000
Paper mache initials painted red either with a craft brooch pin on the back or hanger for a tree

376
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,280
Most won't get the scarlet letter reference, but you will that's fucking well

377
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,960
What's even wilder is that that tool tip is accompanied by this image?

378
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Which I've just sent to you boys on slack

379
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,600
What

380
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,760
This is deep. This is a deep. This is a demon

381
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,880
This is a demon with the current

382
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:16,020
It looks like a monster from a Dragon Ball or something like somebody's like kind of a lot a sloppy one

383
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,760
I'm kind of falling down a hole slow

384
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,560
it's like a

385
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,680
looks like somebody was doing like their math homework and started doodling on the side of this and

386
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,040
Like I got real like just got way too into this creature. They were making

387
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:36,240
The the the picture is wild for those folks bad-mouthing you while their glass house reveals that one or both of them are married

388
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
to someone else

389
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,240
What is that? What? What is that Mary?

390
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:48,440
What does that mean one or both of them how to reveal people? You knows his infidelities use this demon

391
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:56,360
This demon will shout in the middle of the city. Hey, I heard that John Judith were together John and Judith been

392
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,400
Anyways, here's an ornament for your Christmas tree. It's a scarlet letter. We couldn't find an a though. So it's a D

393
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,720
Do it. Do you get it still anyway time to turn you all into stone?

394
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,560
That's not part of the thing. That's just for me. That's for me

395
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:19,360
So also Stephen said he wants to try to work it out still and that's really how to zap

396
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,520
Zap them folks. You hate those with nice things from Williamson Sonoma. Oh

397
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:33,520
Okay. Yeah, Justin is broadcasting so hard. He's having a nosebleed. So it's time to go to the money's on no

398
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,160
I want to I mean, okay, we can channel that energy

399
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:42,920
In the money zone, I guess. Yeah, you guys got this. I'll be right back

400
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,800
Hey Griffin, this isn't for the show, but I was wondering do you know anything?

401
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,520
About babble that you could tell me not not like all like off-air. Oh

402
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,640
Shit. Yeah

403
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,200
Yeah, it's like a like dope way to learn a new language

404
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,560
Because it's just like it's so easy

405
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:14,160
You do these like 15 minute lessons that make it so simple to learn a new language on the go

406
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,280
Yeah, and like they have 14 different languages

407
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:23,220
Including Spanish French Italian and German they have German. Yeah

408
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,420
Yes, and they also it's not just like you they are like say

409
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:34,260
Bueno and then they're like we trust that you said it, right?

410
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:39,940
They have speech recognition technology that helps you improve your pronunciation and accent. Oh, I could really use that

411
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,700
I know. Do you have any way that I could like save money on it though?

412
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,260
I mean they do

413
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,660
Unfortunately not for us but for our listeners

414
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:53,300
Yes, because when you purchase a three-month babble subscription, you can get an additional three months for free

415
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,940
That's six months for the price of three

416
00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:00,860

00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:10,820
Are we not supposed to be using our own promo codes because I do that all the time. Am I gonna get in trouble?

419
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,420
I did actually just sign up for something that we have advertised for in the past and

420
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:21,060
Punched in my promo go like I heard about this one from a little show from my three favorite guys

Well, allow me to step in here and tell you all about honey. You shove some toilet paper runos or what?

424
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,980
What I see irrelevant

425
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,660
Listen, let me tell you about

426
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:48,300

You gotta go online and your best friend for online shopping is honey

Inside the tag and you had a friend's like here. This is not this much. Let me fix this for you

If that doesn't win us the best advertising on a podcast award like Justin playing through the pain

465
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:15,020
I don't know what will you know what I mean? Like no one else is out here playing hurt everybody

466
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,740
Conan O'Brien gets a nosebleed and he takes two weeks off. Yeah, you know what I mean? Like

467
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,380
I think consistently producing a good

468
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,740
Quality show is probably the best way to get awards

469
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,060
Okay, Griffin. Yeah, but what about stunts? There we go

470
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:36,300
Can we do a stunt right now? I'm gonna freeze myself in a block of ice and hang over time

471
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:41,420
I'm gonna freeze myself in a block of ice and hang over time square for the rest of this episode

472
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:46,380
I could do the I could do we finally have saltines. I could do the saltine challenge if we need a stunt

473
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,580
Finally, how long have you been looking?

474
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:56,540
For the saltine. I just happen to have saltines now as we're recording and thinking about saltines and stunts came came up

475
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,740
That's all yeah saying cool. So I don't badass man

476
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,060
I don't need to do this stunt though. If you guys think it's kind of like childish

477
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,700
I mean, it's definitely childish, but that doesn't mean you don't need to do it

478
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,060
But I'd like you to do it on your own first to see how it goes because if you dies

479
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,260
I would like it to not be on the phone with me

480
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,940
That's not funny. It doesn't have to be funny. It'll go

481
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,260
What?

482
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,820
like if I do it by myself, then I'll know how it'll go and then I do it here and it's like

483
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,300
Whatever, you know what I mean? You don't think David Blaine practices his stunts at home

484
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:35,420
No, every time he's like fuck. I hope I hope this works. I fucked it up again. I'm gonna put myself in a giant fishbowl

485
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,580
Can you swim? No, no, I can't. Bye

486
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,460
um, yeah, like I did uh, I

487
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,020
speaking of dares the um

488
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:50,380
Arby's has a new diablo dare sandwich. Yeah, right. Yeah, you can get it in like

489
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,140
beef

490
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,140
Or chicken. Are you saying beef?

491
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,140
Beef? They have it in beef

492
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,940
and it's like you could get it and it's supposed to be like

493
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:05,180
This is so fucking spicy do a tiktok of how you eat it. It'll kill you. It'll die in real life

494
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,580
and I tried it it's like

495
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,260
A little spicy. It was like it's just a little spicy

496
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,260
Cool, man

497
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,100
Well, I recorded the audio because I was thinking like oh this will be so fun

498
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:23,580
I'll play it on the show and like it'll be great to bring to the show and it's just this audio of me like

499
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:29,660
Like eating a mildly spicy sandwich. It's like this is a pod. This isn't even podcast worthy

500
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,220
And that's saying something

501
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,020
Yeah

502
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:37,100
Uh, is this a munch squad? Are we did you back door? Okay

503
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:42,220
No, it's just just friends talking about but we don't but it's not a bit. You know what I mean?

504
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,460
What do you mean? Well on this show we do on this show we do bits

505
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,420
Oh, so you prefer me to be like dumb

506
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,560
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba yeah, that's good. Um, exactly

507
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,980
I want a munch

508
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,140
No, i'm not going to go

509
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,260
I want a munch squad

510
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:12,240
Welcome our squad it's podcast within a podcast profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating

511
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,820
I have two lessons for you real quick

512
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,860
There are some levels of energy that I feel comfortable i'm eating you at

513
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,940
And then there are some that I just can't, I can't get to.

514
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,780
Yeah.

515
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,540
That didn't confront me.

516
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,380
It's all good.

517
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,200
Okay.

518
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,040
It didn't bother me.

519
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,620
I'm out here on my own, a star sailor, you know?

520
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,040
I've always said that about you.

521
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,880
Yes.

522
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,700
I don't need a tether.

523
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,620
I'm like the little prince.

524
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,880
I just grabbed a comet, my net, and I'm zooming away.

525
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,720
You know, it's all right.

526
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,540
You can't come with me.

527
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,380
Oh, I did mean to tell you,

528
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,100
I finished that drawing of a sheep you asked me for,

529
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,300
but I did draw it inside a box so it wouldn't eat your rose.

530
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,220
Here you go.

531
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,380
That's an NFT, so that is going to cost you

532
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,020
about 50,000.

533
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,340
Our line of NFTs is coming.

534
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,180
Yes.

535
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,000
It's all little prince-themed.

536
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,420
It's all little prince-themed.

537
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,180
Make sure you water the NFTs roots and not their petals.

538
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,060
Thank you very much.

539
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,180
God, guys, if you missed a few weeks ago

540
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,460
when Richard Karn was like, I'm fully doing an NFT,

541
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,200
and then everybody's like, fuck off.

542
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,540
And then he's like, I've thought about this.

543
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,700
Now is not the right time for me to enter the NFT market.

544
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,740
Yeah, now is not the moment for my NFT.

545
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:15,660
So McDonald's is going to start serving fan-inspired mashups.

546
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,820
Huh.

547
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,260
Menu hacks.

548
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,380
Order by name and build by hand.

549
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,100
Do you know what I'm saying to you right now?

550
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,940
What I'm saying to you is you will order the menu hack,

551
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:32,780
they will give you the components of the hack,

552
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,140
then you do it.

553
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,140
Huh.

554
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,100
Then you make this.

555
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,380
That seems like the opposite of why I go to a place

556
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,580
to get food. It feels like them

557
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,100
trying to limit their liability, right?

558
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,520
Like you order it and they'll give it to you,

559
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,220
but they're not going to hand it to you.

560
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,060
Like they're not going to,

561
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,380
they're going to hand you the bullets and the pistol,

562
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,220
but they're not actually going to load it for you.

563
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,400
I still want you to feel like it's a hack.

564
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,380
And also they don't want to do the work.

565
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,600
But it's kind of bad-ass, right?

566
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,300
It's kind of like Korean barbecue, you know?

567
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,660
When is McDonald's going to install a grill

568
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,500
right there in the middle of my car,

569
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,980
come into my car, make the burger for me while I watch?

570
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,260
I got two of these to get through.

571
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,260
This is starting January 31st, only in the app.

572
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,940
I want you guys to guess what these are.

573
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,320
The first one is a gimme, hash brown McMuffin.

574
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,160
Is it McMuffin with a hash brown?

575
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,500
Oh, it's a McMuffin with a hash brown, yeah.

576
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,380
Sausage McMuffin with egg and hash brown.

577
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,220
Great. Yum.

578
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,280
That should already be a thing, by the way.

579
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,420
What is that? Intuders parlance.

580
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,980
Is that a mountain ear?

581
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:36,280
I think that's a mountain ear.

582
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,740
I only get a raw beef, so I don't know.

583
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,900
Crunchy double.

584
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,740
Yeah.

585
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,860
This is a sausage sandwich with bacon on it?

586
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,820
No, this is the-

587
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,020
That is the only breakfast offering.

588
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,740
The rest of these are lunch and dinner offering.

589
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,860
Is this a chicken sandwich with bacon on it?

590
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:55,420
Is this a hamburger with a fried chicken patty on it?

591
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,940
No, very close though.

592
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,620
The crunchy double is a double cheeseburger

593
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:03,260
with six chicken McNuggets and barbecue sauce.

594
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,140
Well, those are just going to fall

595
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,220
all over the fucking place.

596
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,300
Yeah, it should just be one patty.

597
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,180
Next up is the surf and turf.

598
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,020
Now, this one I know.

599
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,600
This is Filet-O-Fish and a hamburger.

600
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,220
That is correct, Travis.

601
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,820
Well, no, it's incorrect.

602
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,540
It's a double cheeseburger.

603
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,380
Okay, whatever.

604
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,020
Oh, that's a lot of patties then, huh?

605
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,020
It's a lot of patties,

606
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,940
but not as much as the land, air, and sea.

607
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,540
Now, this one I also horrifyingly know.

608
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,540
This is a double cheeseburger with Filet-O-Fish

609
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,100
and a chicken patty.

610
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,140
Well, no, it's a Big Mac with a McChicken and a Filet-O-Fish.

611
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,380
You knew what I meant, Justin.

612
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,500
No, Travis, you said a double.

613
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,100
That would be four- The three menu items.

614
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,660
If you want to see, look at this.

615
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,620
Fuck, yes.

616
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,460
Yes.

617
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,860
Feed my family for a week.

618
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,260
Yes.

619
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,940
You said- Those are.

620
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,940
I thought you said five offerings.

621
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,020
No, just four.

622
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,460
They're beautiful.

623
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,300
They're beautiful.

624
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,220
You can order them in the app and, ah, damn it.

625
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,740
Justin bled too much.

626
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,780
Are we in a new season or is there a new donut out?

627
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,620
Hello, boys.

628
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,460
It's donut-based.

629
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,220
What a pleasure it is to be with you.

630
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,060
Hi, there.

631
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:10,220
Oh, there's blood everywhere here.

632
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,060
Oh, God.

633
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:11,900
Oh, I didn't even consider.

634
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,860
I'm getting so incredibly hungry.

635
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,060
Did you come from inside?

636
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:15,900
Do you come from ins-

637
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,220
Hold on, I must lick Justin's face.

638
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,420
Do you eat blood?

639
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,620
I thought you ate donuts.

640
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,380
Is- I don't discriminate.

641
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,220
They're two different things.

642
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,580
Is donut just your name?

643
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,580
Count donut.

644
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,860
I love donuts aesthetically, but-

645
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,140
Oh, okay.

646
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,820
That which sustains you no longer sustains me.

647
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,940
Oh, that's horrible.

648
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,540
You love donuts, but you can't eat them.

649
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,380
I could.

650
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,820
Oh, you can eat them.

651
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,740
I don't prefer-

652
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,300
They make them very sick.

653
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,140
Yeah.

654
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,780
Like, I can eat donuts, but if I ate blood,

655
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,580
I would get a big tummy ache.

656
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,900
I have a gluten intolerance.

657
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,940
Oh, no.

658
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,020
Your only weakness.

659
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,420
That's what makes this story so perfect for me.

660
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,580
Okay.

661
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,060
Krispy Kreme is of art.

662
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,300
I'm Count Donut.

663
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,100
If this is your first time listening,

664
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,500
if this is their first time listening,

665
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,900
they already turned it off, yeah.

666
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,980
Yeah, they're gone.

667
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,420
Krispy Kreme offers a free dozen

668
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,140
to Red Cross blood donors.

669
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,740
How sick.

670
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,340
A dozen donuts if I just give away a little bit of blood?

671
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,340
The American Red Cross is facing

672
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,980
its worst blood shortage in over a decade,

673
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,860
and Krispy Kreme has announced it will thank everyone

674
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:32,860
who donates blood or platelets January 24th through 31st.

675
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,540
This includes my favorite donation, Power Red.

676
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,820
Do you know about this?

677
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,140
Delicious.

678
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,340
They just take out the blood and put back in the stuff

679
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,180
they don't need.

680
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,020
Fantastic.

681
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,620
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

682
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:48,540
Since then, severe weather has further complicated efforts

683
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:51,740
to rebuild the Red Cross blood supply,

684
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,140
including hundreds of blood drives

685
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,300
canceled due to winter storms.

686
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,540
Due to the severity of the shortage,

687
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,700
the Red Cross continues to limit certain blood product

688
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,820
distributions to hospitals, depending on current inventories,

689
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,940
which seems like perhaps too much context

690
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,180
for a news story about free donuts, but I digress.

691
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,700
It's vital that donors continue to come forward

692
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,700
in the days and weeks.

693
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,540
And what's happening?

694
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:24,540
Well, Dave Skinner, the Krispy Kreme CMO, is here to help.

695
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,620
We're grateful for all that the American Red Cross

696
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:30,380
does for our country, and we want to help them.

697
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,980
Hopefully, a free original glazed dozen

698
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,300
will increase awareness.

699
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,140
Okay, you can't even spring for frosting, Dave.

700
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:38,980
Okay.

701
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:42,660
No, you don't get to pick, and you can't fight us for it

702
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,940
because you're weak from blood loss.

703
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,460
You will take what you are offered, you bloodless baby.

704
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,700
If I give two pints, can I get sprinkles?

705
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,940
If you give two pints, your only donut will be the grave.

706
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,540
It'll be the grave.

707
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:02,540
We're encouraging, oh, this is my, this is the good part.

708
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:06,140
We're also encouraging all of our employees

709
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:10,300
who can donate to do so, says Dave Skinner.

710
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,260
So in case your employer, Krispy Kreme,

711
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,260
has not offered you enough,

712
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,980
as if the labor shortage was not dire enough,

713
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,700
now this donut store is making its workers

714
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,300
give their succulent blood.

715
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,380
Do they also get the free dozen, though?

716
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,340
Or is that like?

717
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,620
This is a fantastic question.

718
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,780
I assume every Krispy Kreme employee is at home

719
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,580
with hundreds of donuts that will be inedible

720
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,860
by the following morning.

721
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,580
Cool, yeah, I don't see anything wrong

722
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,820
with any of that stuff.

723
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,340
People should go donate blood if they're able to.

724
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,180
Do you?

725
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,300
I mean, donuts are not, but.

726
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,380
Well, well, well, go do the right thing.

727
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,940
I'm Travis.

728
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:51,940
But for real, though, I've got so much blood.

729
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,060
And you know what I don't have?

730
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,580
12 donuts now.

731
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,220
Is it a, do you get a baker's dozen

732
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,660
or is it just a dozen?

733
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:59,900
Oh, this is an important question.

734
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,940
Is this a one-time offer?

735
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,180
Because I have a lot of pints saved up.

736
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,020
Oh, yeah.

737
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,700
That I could like turn in, like Pepsi points.

738
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,700
Yes, turn in your Pepsi points.

739
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,980
My Pepsi points of blood, my pint points.

740
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,980
I never get cuts or scrapes

741
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,620
because of the way that my incredibly sedentary lifestyle.

742
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:21,340
So I must have, I must be like a tick.

743
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,820
Like so much. Deeply engorged.

744
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,700
So engorged.

745
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:29,380
This is unfortunate timing in a way

746
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,180
because Justin just gave blood last week.

747
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,940
Are you able to like show the receipt and get it still?

748
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,500
Yes, yes. Guys, hold on a sec.

749
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,340
Hold on, sorry.

750
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,500
The sound on my track is gonna be weird for a second.

751
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,820
There's a parade outside on the street for Justin

752
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:48,020
for giving blood and they're making a lot of noise.

753
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,180
They're chanting, Justin, Justin, he gave blood.

754
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,900
He's a good guy.

755
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,420
Didn't even do it for donuts or nothing.

756
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:58,180
Well, this is the problem that he now faces.

757
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,380
If he redeems this offer,

758
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,780
with the general sort of like body

759
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,860
he's walking around the earth in,

760
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,020
if he goes the Krispy Kreme,

761
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,100
they are going to know two things immediately.

762
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:15,860
One, this man drove an hour to get these free donuts.

763
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:19,820
And two, this man gave his blood to get these donuts.

764
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:22,100
What? What? What?

765
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,500
How desperately does this man love Krispy Kremes?

766
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:28,820
There's a cost in gas for your car to drive that far.

767
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,660
And there's also a cost in body gas, which is blood.

768
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,900
The gasoline for your body.

769
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,220
Right.

770
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:38,980
But anyway, if you are able to donate,

771
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,500
please find a drive near you.

772
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:46,300
Go to redcrossblood.org or 1-800-RED-CROSS.

773
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,460
People need this delicious blood.

774
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,060
There's something, something tells me

775
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,380
that might've been a little more effective.

776
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,060
I can tell from Justin's, he's a positive.

777
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,540
Yeah, would have been more effective

778
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,700
had it not been in Count Donut's voice,

779
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,020
but a good message.

780
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:01,500
I just like, it makes me feel relaxed

781
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,780
knowing that there are buildings

782
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:07,220
that hold oodles of free, delicious blood.

783
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,860
Okay, this is why I'm saying

784
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,500
that you might be kind of undermining,

785
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,460
like, it's fine.

786
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,460
It's great, yeah, do that.

787
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,460
I just buy the blood types.

788
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,060
I steal the blood types that nobody wants.

789
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,500
The shitty ones.

790
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,340
Like D.

791
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,180
Yeah.

792
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,500
If you have D, I steal the shit.

793
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,140
Why is your blood so chunky?

794
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,620
Oh, it's a...

795
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,460
I love a chunky blood.

796
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,340
Well, thanks Count Donut.

797
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:33,620
This was the first sort of, I don't know,

798
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:36,340
beneficial service you've ever provided, maybe.

799
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,340
Who's Count Donut?

800
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,460
Now, you know who Count Donut is, Justin.

801
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,660
You know who Count Donut is.

802
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,860
This is not part of the,

803
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,260
is this a My Brother, My Brother, Me character?

804
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,100
Because I don't know.

805
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,540
You've never listened to...

806
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,580
No, why would I listen to my own podcast?

807
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,500
It's wild.

808
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,060
Yeah.

809
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:51,900
Yeah.

810
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,100
Where'd all my blood go?

811
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,740
Wait, does he drain it from the inside?

812
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,780
I had no, I had piles of it surrounding me.

813
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,900
Oh, what?

814
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,300
Yeah, it's all gone.

815
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,740
Didn't you just donate blood?

816
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,140
Oh no, you know what?

817
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,020
I didn't even think about this, Griffin.

818
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,020
I did donate blood.

819
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,500
Thank you for bringing that up, by the way.

820
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:14,500
Not enough people have really celebrated me for that.

821
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,180
I just wish there was a way

822
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:18,660
that I could get free donuts out of it.

823
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,620
That is what we need.

824
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,100
You should wicked listen to our show sometime.

825
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:23,940
Okay, yeah, I'll check it out.

826
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,100
It's pretty funny sometimes.

827
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:25,940
We do skits.

828
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,340
Yeah, nice.

829
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,180
How about another question?

830
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,020
Yeah.

831
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:30,860
Yeah.

832
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,700
Yeah.

833
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,020
I work for a funeral home.

834
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,500
My boss expects me to hand out business cards.

835
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,540
I would love to reach out to families that need us,

836
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,780
but how on earth do I do this

837
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,460
without looking like capitalist vulture?

838
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,540
That's from embalming in the Emerald City.

839
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,500
That's interesting.

840
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,340
That's interesting.

841
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,180
Speak on that.

842
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,340
I guess they can't.

843
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,860
No, they're not here.

844
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,180
Yeah, that's not possible.

845
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,060
I think you have to,

846
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,580
your only option here is to be a pickpocket

847
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,380
that can sort of slip these into people's.

848
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,260
No, because that's terrifying.

849
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:04,260
It's terrifying, right?

850
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,540
I mean, it's beyond terrifying.

851
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,380
That's worse.

852
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,500
You have described the worst version of this.

853
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,340
It's good.

854
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,540
Now that we've found bottom,

855
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,380
let's crawl up from here.

856
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:14,260
The worst version is like you see someone,

857
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,820
like a little kid playing chess with their peepaw

858
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,660
in the park and you go over to the little kid

859
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,140
and like, mm, peepaw, huh?

860
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,380
Just keep this in mind.

861
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,540
And you hand them a business card.

862
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,860
Sorry, wait, stop.

863
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,020
Hand the kid a business card?

864
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,580
Yeah, that's the worst version.

865
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,660
I'm saying that's the worst version of like,

866
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,180
you do need to clarify for me

867
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,420
if you are handing the card to the child.

868
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,260
To the child.

869
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,060
You are assuming we'll be the executor

870
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,460
of Peepaw's Miss Fortune.

871
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,340
Peepaw's not gonna do it, he's dead.

872
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,180
Yeah, Peepaw.

873
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,420
Yes, but.

874
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,540
Okay.

875
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:49,300
No one's playing with their own elderly father in the park.

876
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,900
It's always grandchildren and peepaw, Justin.

877
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,420
When was the last time you and dad sat down at the park

878
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,740
to play a round of chess?

879
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,340
This is the problem with funeral homes

880
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,740
is that they only do that.

881
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:02,580
You know?

882
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:08,700
If I see a sign for a funeral home while I'm driving around,

883
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:12,180
I'll avert my eyes, because I don't need it right now.

884
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,020
You know what I mean?

885
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,500
I don't need the anxiety, I don't need the existential,

886
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,340
all that stuff.

887
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,740
I just don't, whatever, it's bumming me out,

888
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,580
I'm not gonna pay attention.

889
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:23,940
But, if the sign said, embalming Aunt Fro-yo.

890
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,260
Ooh.

891
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:28,100
Then I might stop in

892
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,620
and start to get a little bit more comfortable,

893
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:33,740
work through these deeply American ideas

894
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,940
about death and mortality and stuff like that.

895
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:39,420
Cause like, oh, I know that place,

896
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,020
that's where I get Fro-yo.

897
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,700
So you can hand me a little business card and be like,

898
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,260
you look like someone who's going to live

899
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,940
a long natural life, but also enjoys Fro-yo.

900
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,900
So why don't you hold onto this card?

901
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,380
It's a punch card.

902
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,180
And it does have the number for you.

903
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,020
It does.

904
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:54,860
I'll have some cases.

905
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:55,700
That's just okay.

906
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,940
But, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

907
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,380
Can I take it and add a little spice?

908
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,220
Add a little flavor?

909
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,220
That's what you do, Travis, that's what you do here.

910
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,340
That's why they call you the spice man.

911
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,300
The spice, let's flip.

912
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,460
Funeral home slash arcade, right?

913
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,220
And you can turn in tickets.

914
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,700
That's great for the kids too.

915
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,540
Well, and here's the great thing about it, right?

916
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,540
Funerals, ugh, so expensive, right?

917
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,540
Big lump sum.

918
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:22,540
But over time, I'm paying in quarters over like 20 years

919
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:25,100
and then I can cash in those tickets.

920
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:28,180
And it's like, oh, that very nice gasket?

921
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,900
You're going to need 20,000 tickets for that.

922
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,700
I don't think there should be,

923
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,820
for my idea to be a good one, and we all know it is,

924
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,820
I don't think there can be any connection

925
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,460
between the two businesses.

926
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,780
It's literally just about knowing,

927
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:44,660
oh, that's the place, I do know of one funeral home,

928
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,660
it's the place where I go to play spin to win

929
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,060
and get giant inflatable teddy bears.

930
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,100
You know what I mean?

931
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,620
There's no connection between the two businesses.

932
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:56,500
It's like how sometimes there's a Chili's 2

933
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,060
inside an airport.

934
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,940
No one would go to an airport

935
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,380
if there weren't restaurants there.

936
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,540
Well, I think they would

937
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:06,420
because of the main function of an airport.

938
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,980
But I see what you're saying.

939
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:08,820
Listen.

940
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,660
I don't know what they have against Southwest Egg Rolls.

941
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:11,500
They're already there.

942
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:16,500
It's Googling and Yelping places to go

943
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:21,140
for a not bummer thing already kind of sucks, right?

944
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:25,420
When it's like, oh, well, we have to go find a notary public

945
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:29,180
or whatever, let's get on Yelp to find the right one.

946
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,260
That sucks.

947
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,100
Having to do that for, it's like, oh man,

948
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,740
Peep's Paw beefed it.

949
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:36,580
Who does good?

950
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:40,020
Hey guys, who does good death parties?

951
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,300
It's like, oh shit, I don't know.

952
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:45,300
So maybe giving them a business card is upfront,

953
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,060
pretty terrible.

954
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:52,060
But when Peepo falls down that big hole and does pass away,

955
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:55,260
to be able to be like, fuck.

956
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:59,540
Well, at least we got this great recommendation

957
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,700
on this business card.

958
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,300
And we don't have to go around searching

959
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,100
for who does the best dead parties

960
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,700
because we know that they've got it on lockdown.

961
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,340
Now, Griffin, you've made me think

962
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:10,380
that it might be a branding issue.

963
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,260
Funeral home, bummer.

964
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,700
End game strategist.

965
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:15,540
Awesome.

966
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,860
I love that.

967
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:20,220
This is what I'm saying because I don't want to go,

968
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,900
oh, if I'm getting up there and it's like,

969
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,860
I need to plan this shit out.

970
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,500
I don't want to go to a funeral.

971
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,060
But if I can do the Nintendo helpline of dying,

972
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,300
fuck yeah, dude.

973
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,580
I'm doing that.

974
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,620
Encore.

975
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,780
Ooh.

976
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,620
Encore.

977
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,100
One more number.

978
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,460
One more performance.

979
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,300
Encore.

980
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,420
Ooh, I like that.

981
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,100
Welcome to Curtain Call Embalming.

982
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,980
Final countdown.

983
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,740
Welcome to Curtain Call Embalming and Arcade.

984
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:47,860
Ooh, I like that.

985
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:48,700
That's good.

986
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,540
Oh yeah, I like that.

987
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,540
And you know what?

988
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:53,900
We're looking to expand it into go-karts in the spring.

989
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,340
Oh man, this would create a weird dynamic though

990
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,420
for kids who aren't that close to their great grandparents,

991
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:02,180
who like, we want them to live a nice, long, natural life.

992
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:05,700
But do understand that when something does go wrong,

993
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:09,060
they will get to go, they will get to go play skee-ball.

994
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,620
Great pappy, great pappy.

995
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,460
Just checking in.

996
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:12,300
How are you feeling today?

997
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,380
Because I did just get my allowance

998
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:17,620
and I need to know if I should save it or not.

999
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,460
Can I spend it?

1000
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,100
Are you going to be kicking another week?

1001
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,420
I wish nothing but the best for you.

1002
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,700
I'm just trying to do some financial planning here.

1003
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,500
And I do have a $10 bill

1004
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,820
and I need to know if I should save it for skee-ball

1005
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,580
or is it cool to go ahead?

1006
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:30,420
Oh, what?

1007
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,260
Did you just cough?

1008
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,740
Okay, I'm going to put that right here

1009
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,460
in the old banger roomie.

1010
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:37,060
Let me hit you with this, Funeral Home.

1011
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:42,060
And this one is just like outdoor celebration.

1012
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:47,540
Just kick my dead ass body down the hole raw and bury me.

1013
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,620
And then DJ Khaled is like, all right, let's fucking,

1014
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,420
let's get it started.

1015
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,940
And also Funnel Cakes.

1016
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,980
Funnel Cakes could be there.

1017
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:55,980
We all love Griffin.

1018
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:57,500
He did a great job.

1019
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,900
Here's a rebranding, Container Store.

1020
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,220
Okay.

1021
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:03,500
Okay.

1022
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,940
Like in the back room of the Container Store there is.

1023
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:09,980
Or Bed Bath and Beyond is also already right there.

1024
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:10,820
Way, way beyond.

1025
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:11,900
Yeah, that's fun.

1026
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,460
Bed Bath and the Great Beyond.

1027
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,860
All right, hey, thank you so much

1028
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,020
for listening to our podcast.

1029
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,940
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1030
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,900
We are so thrilled to be here with you every week

1031
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,140
to share a little time with you.

1032
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:26,740
We're so flattered that you have made that choice yet again.

1033
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:29,060
If you enjoyed this week's show,

1034
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,500
and we almost never mentioned this,

1035
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,620
but it would be very helpful if you would like rate

1036
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,900
or review the show or, you know what?

1037
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,580
Just tell a friend like, hey,

1038
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:40,340
I know it seems overwhelming to get on board

1039
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,700
with the 595th.

1040
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,900
But this is when it's starting to get good.

1041
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,660
But it's just starting to get good.

1042
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:52,740
Hey, thanks to Montaigne for the use of our theme song.

1043
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,060
My life is better with you.

1044
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,180
And for everything.

1045
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:56,220
And for just everything.

1046
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:59,500
All of her incredible artistic contributions to humanity.

1047
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,100
Back in WW2, Montaigne saved me.

1048
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,820
There was an army of tanks bearing down on me.

1049
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:08,300
And out of nowhere, Montaigne came, shredded on a guitar,

1050
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,180
and it sent out powerful sound waves

1051
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,740
that cut the tanks in two.

1052
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:15,820
But also, it created peace.

1053
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,260
We played soccer for a little bit.

1054
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,380
All right.

1055
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,100
Yeah, it was awesome.

1056
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,700
There's new merch out on Tuesday.

1057
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,380
You can check that out at macromerch.com.

1058
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:24,980
We got a brand new pen of the month.

1059
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:29,220
It's Sawbone's number two books based on a recent episode.

1060
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,100
I'll let you put all that together.

1061
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,100
And that benefits the National Black Women's

1062
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,460
Justice Institute.

1063
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,580
They research, elevate, and educate the public

1064
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:38,460
about innovative community-led solutions

1065
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,620
to address the criminalization of black women and girls.

1066
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,620
So a great cause.

1067
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,460
And 20 rendezvous pens.

1068
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:48,500
We got two pens, one prom style of us,

1069
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,540
and one of the three of us floating on a tandem bike.

1070
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:52,980
You know, basic stuff.

1071
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:55,180
They're available individually or as a pair.

1072
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:59,180
Those are designed by Lucas Hespenheide.

1073
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,740
And that's at Moosley based on Twitter.

1074
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:07,220
And we've got an I'm Not Ashamed of My Clown Husband sticker

1075
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:11,820
designed by Jacob Bailey at JSBailey817 on Twitter.

1076
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:14,060
And that benefits the Huntington Children's Museum,

1077
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,540
which is creating child-centered spaces that

1078
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:20,020
promote exploration and a love for learning through play.

1079
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:21,940
I also, man, if you like gaming,

1080
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:23,940
I've been doing a lot of Fortnite recently

1081
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:28,060
on my Twitch page, twitch.tv slash the Travis McElroy.

1082
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,100
I'm having fun.

1083
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:32,340
And surprisingly, I'm not terrible at it.

1084
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,180
So come on over and check that out

1085
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:35,580
and check out our YouTube channel

1086
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:40,580
where Griffin has been doing a Legend of Zelda run.

1087
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,300
Speak on that, Griffin.

1088
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,060
Oh, that's interesting.

1089
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:44,900
Speak on that.

1090
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,580
I've been playing a randomized link to the past game

1091
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:49,220
as Guy Fieri, but also I die in a single hit.

1092
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:53,620
And it's been, I've been making slow but steady progress.

1093
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:54,620
I'm very proud of you for that.

1094
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:56,420
Justin, anything you want to promote?

1095
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,340
Nope. Nope.

1096
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,300
Okay. Empty Bowl.

1097
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,140
No. Okay.

1098
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:04,060
Empty Bowl is a meditative serial podcast

1099
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:04,900
that Justin has- Stop.

1100
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,100
No, I'll promote it. I'll promote it.

1101
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,740
End of show. Okay.

1102
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,300
It's a meditative podcast about the cereal.

1103
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:10,660
It's very relaxing. Okay.

1104
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,500
Griffin, bring us home, baby.

1105
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,540
Yeah, it's from Yahoo! was sent in by Raj.

1106
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,380
Thanks, Raj.

1107
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:16,620
It's from Yahoo! answers user, Plippins,

1108
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:20,420
who asks, do you,

1109
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,980
this one was sent in by Raj.

1110
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,620
It's asked by Plippins, who asks,

1111
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:32,660
who's,

1112
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:38,180
Quack, quack, quack.

1113
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:39,260
Where to, how?

1114
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:43,580
So far, so good.

1115
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:45,580
How?

1116
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:47,140
That's one of the classics. Plippins, how?

1117
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:48,460
That's one of the big ones.

1118
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:50,420
Yeah, that's one of the main questions.

1119
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:51,980
Why? Let's do a why.

1120
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:56,420
Why is it, hey guys, it's me, Plippins.

1121
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,400
Why is it that?

1122
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:00,520
What is the?

1123
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,140
Well, he tried what?

1124
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,460
And that didn't seem to go anywhere either.

1125
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,060
Why doesn't seem to be getting me there either?

1126
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:10,660
Is this all what Plippins wrote?

1127
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:11,500
Yeah.

1128
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:16,500
Hey guys, it's me, Plippins.

1129
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:24,820
I don't actually think I'm gonna get there this time, guys.

1130
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:27,520
And I don't know, no, no, no, I don't know what that means.

1131
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,860
Like, is this, do we?

1132
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:30,100
Does the show not end?

1133
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:33,540
I mean, is the show continuing after the file had stopped?

1134
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:37,540
Griffin, try, I'm just gonna throw up the land before time.

1135
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:38,940
Is that anything?

1136
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,980
Hey guys, it's me, Plippins.

1137
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:45,980
Do they make baby gas drops for big boys like me?

1138
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,140
Plippins?

1139
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,640
Hey guys, it's me, Plippins.

1140
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,980
If I take a lot of baby medicine,

1141
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:58,380
does it count just as big boy medicine?

1142
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,580
Thanks, it's me, Plippins.

1143
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,620
I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis.

1144
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,260
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1145
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,700
My brother and my brother make kids who dance grow the lips.

1146
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:11,860
I punish them precisely because the Evet Universe incident

1147
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:14,260
is happening because I help keep my diet improvements.

1148
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,500
Hey, I'mLip 지.

1149
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,660
I'm from the Yes Universe area.

1150
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,920
So, I have to learn a lesson in our community

1151
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,860
and I'm planning to visit those places yourself.

1152
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,940
Okay, this week, I'm going to meet this guy.

1153
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:24,340
He was really somebody.

1154
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,600
So, I've got to meet this guy today,

1155
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:20,400
and he's a first grader who became a

1156
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,420
Goiyori.

1157
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:30,100
I can't wait to meet this guy because

1158
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,720
I'm going up control of my Corona.

1159
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,520
And to get to know him, I'm going to make him

1160
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,660
meet my big brother.

1161
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,480
And we're meeting the real dude,

1162
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,480
It's a battle with you
