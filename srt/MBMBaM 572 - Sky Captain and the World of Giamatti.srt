1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
One, two, three, four!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's the start of something beautiful.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A small acquaintance has blossomed, it's ripened into a precious friendship.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I could have never seen what was coming for me.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hangs at the skatepark, hangs by the beach.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My life, it feels like life.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, it's better, it's better with you.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My life, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is true, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My life, oh, it's better with you.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hello and welcome to my brother, my brother mean advice show for the imaginary.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis big dog woof woof McElroy.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't know that I have the same level of energy as my two brothers.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Rarely.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Get it together.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I mean, here's what I'll say.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I watched Jungle Cruise.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes, you did.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But I don't feel like I saw it, and here's why.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Because you experienced it in your blood?

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No, it's bad.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What?

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's negative.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And honestly, I blame the filmmakers and Diz.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I blame Bob J. Pack all the way down, the whole Diz family.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I blame them.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Because 10 minutes into this fucking flick, Giamatti pops up.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're fucking kidding me.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now, my kids, obviously, from that point on, that's all they can talk about.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Big Giamatti fans.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Dad, when's Giamatti coming back?

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
When's the G-Man back?

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Dad, what's with Giamatti's accent?

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Dad, do you think Giamatti made scale for this, or do you think it's a payday?

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Or do you think it was a favor to the Rock?

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Do you think he shot out in one day, or do you think he was there for a while?

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Exactly.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, do you think they just gang shot all the Giamatti stuff, Daddy?

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Then it's like 30 minutes into this fucker, and Giamatti's not hiding her hair of Giamatti.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Not even a post-credit sequence.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Not even a hint that Giamatti will return.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Fuck off.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, in Jungle Cruise 2, Jungle 2s.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You don't even get that bit where he reaches in and grabs the gauntlet, and he puts it on,

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and he slides some Infinity Gems in it, and he's like,

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
it looks like it's time for Giamatti to go to work.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What was interesting to me is, so I watched it, and my 18-month-old daughter,

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
all she was wondering was, we haven't seen Giamatti in a while.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
How much of this is makeup?

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's something she kept asking.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's been a while since I've seen Giamatti.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
How much of that is just his look now?

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because not all of it's bad, frankly.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The problem is, with COVID interrupting, they had to do a lot of it with computers.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So about 70% of it is CGI-Matti.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's CGI-Matti.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No, it's better when you say it faster, honestly.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
CGI-Matti.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
CGI-Matti.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
CGI-Matti.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
There you go.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Dot kept asking me, how much of this do you think is just Giamatti single shot with him looking at a tennis ball,

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
but then they cut together with the rock scenes.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How much was he on set in these scenes?

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Because there's a lot of single shots, not a lot of doubles.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah, he's like Sky Captain in the world of Giamatti.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, right, right, right, right.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And that's the episode title of today's episode, and we got that out two minutes in.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He didn't even fly out, from what I heard.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He didn't even fly out.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Here's what happened.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Giamatti put on one of those tennis ball mocap suits.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And they said, Giamatti, we can do it with ping pong balls.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And he said, no, I only work with tennis balls.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No, I only work with tennis balls because I want my movements to be very specific.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So the balls need to be much larger and yellower.

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But he didn't do this movie specifically.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So what Giamatti did, and this is smart, he stood in front of a camera and said every word.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah, in the dictionary, not just English.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah, Giamatti said all the words, because China's the future.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And China's the future of entertainment.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He did all the movements, too.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And he was nude T-posing the entire time.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He was fully naked.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, tennis balls glued to his nude body.

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Right, and he just said, and just use this however you want.

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah, and he kept saying, I'm nude, glued, and totally rude, which was weird.

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He kept saying that over and over again.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
75 years after his death, Paul Giamatti will be the only actor that is in the public domain.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah.

101
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So you can use a Giamatti performance in anything.

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let me show you around.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm hollow Giamatti.

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You can use him to basically advertise anything at that point.

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
True.

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I didn't see the fucking flick, but I have been on the Jungle Cruise ride.

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So is most of the film Dwayne cutting up, pointing at things in the water?

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hey, bud, I know that you're having some fun here, but this is the danger of having fun when you don't have the contacts.

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's a lot of the movie.

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Absolutely.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's like a lot of the movie.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It is one of the most accurate theme park ride to movie adaptations I have ever seen.

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So much of it is a Jungle Cruise, first of all.

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You would expect the cruise to be the first half hour, right?

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
No, no, no, no, no.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No, no, no.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
There's probably more Jungle Cruise in this than there are pirates in Pirates of the Caribbean.

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Absolutely.

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You know how in Pirates of the Caribbean when they made the movie, if you've seen it nine times in theaters, which I did,

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
there will be little winks at the ride where it's like, oh, now the pirates are trying to tempt the dog with a bone, right?

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's like with Jungle Cruise, they said, what if we did that, but it's hints at a movie within the ride adaptation that we made.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay.

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And to the point where I felt at one point that much like they do sometimes where Disney would be like,

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
we stared at lions for two weeks before making Lion King.

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Imagine that Dwayne The Rock Johnson rode Jungle Cruise endlessly for like a week to prepare for this role because he is nailing it.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I did deadass read that he led some Jungle Cruise rides.

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Hell yes.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Which like, how lucky do you have?

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That is some make-away shit right there.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay.

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But here's the problem with what you just said is it's not true.

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, it's not?

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
No, but here's the weird thing about it.

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I watched this Jungle Cruise, it's like behind the attraction or whatever, right?

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes, yes.

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Of course you know I'm loving that.

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Right.

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I live for it.

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And The Rock said to prepare for this role, I have actually led several Jungle Cruises.

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This is what I saw.

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But here's the thing that he said right after that in this special.

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And he says, and if you're wondering why you never saw anybody talking about The Rock doing that, it's because it all happened in my mind.

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Oh.

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, that's interesting, Dwayne.

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Isn't that interesting?

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Huh.

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Isn't that interesting?

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So like you can picture him like sitting in his bathtub, eyes closed, like just pointing.

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And he has like put little like tape marks everywhere where he's supposed to point.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And he's practiced until he can just nail it eyes closed every time.

153
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And if someone walked into the room, they would get really worried about The Rock.

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah.

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He's like, he's just, I mean, it's just what he's, I mean.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Just like laying in bed surrounded by his crystals and just saying like, and there's the back of the water.

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And everybody's like, yeah.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I know how complete the visualization was, you know, like to what extent was Dwayne, you know, imagining all of it, every second of it?

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Did he do the cue? Because it can get up there, you know?

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah, sure.

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Did he picture himself as a scrawny teenager leading it with a little bit of apathy, frankly?

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's possible, possible.

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Hey, is there a scene in the movie where Dwayne points over the side of the boat and is like, and there's a, check out that wily witch doctor with his shrunken head.

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's no way to get a head in business.

165
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And then Emily Blunt is sitting in the front of the boat and she's like, this feels bad.

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Like that feels problematic.

167
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Not quite that, Griffin, but not far off.

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Like this feels like a pretty problematic portray.

169
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Like, I'm not here to tell you your job, The Rock, but even the Disney ride is starting to sort of leave some of this stuff on the old cutting room floor.

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Hey guys, I don't want you to think I'm fucking with you.

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So I just went ahead while we were sitting here having some fun.

172
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I cued up this exact joint because I want you to hear it.

173
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Cool, cool.

174
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I have had a chance to skipper many Jungle Cruise boats over the years in multiple parks.

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh, hopefully not like this.

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And you're probably thinking, wow, I don't remember ever seeing you there, Rock.

177
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He's absolutely right.

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Of course you didn't because it all happened in my mind.

179
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And it's so good.

180
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's one of the wilder things I've ever heard a human being, Rock or non-Rock, say.

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You know, it's like, it's a very wild thing to say from The Rock.

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Can I tell you with that context, Justin, thank you very much.

183
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's not like he's saying in preparing for this role, I pictured myself.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He says in multiple parks over the years.

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Over the years.

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Why even add that detail?

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's such a specific, it would be as though he said, I remember actually in the, it was July 13th, 2017, I did one.

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's when I did the Tokyo Disney one.

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I did Tokyo Disney July 13th of 2017.

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, whenever I get really stressed out on set, I just close my eyes and picture myself leading one of the Jungle Cruises.

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Jungle Cruise, take me away.

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, God.

193
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I just don't know why that would be the case.

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm so happy it was the case, but I don't know why it would be the case.

195
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You know what I'm saying?

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Have you guys seen the clip of Emily Blunt and The Rock doing a press tour, press day for Jungle Cruise,

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and a reporter asked them about Vin Diesel talking about getting the best performance out of The Rock through confrontation with him?

198
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Did we not talk about that?

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We talked about this.

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Did we?

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Oh, yeah, and then Emily Blunt.

202
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
We talked, I told you this, but it was after the episode.

203
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

204
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We hate that the two of them are fighting, and it makes us so sad that we don't want to talk about it.

205
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Well, they're the Pacino and that other guy of the modern day, you know what I mean?

206
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Bambino?

207
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah, Pacino and Bambino.

208
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This is, of course, an advice show.

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I only want to talk about The Rock imagining that he's The Rock.

210
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He looks like that.

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
His body's crazy and strong, and he's affable and charming and famous.

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Incredible body.

213
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And he also has dream visions where he is the skipper of the Jungle Cruise ride at Disney at several parks.

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Griffin, over the years, you've made me realize that while many a celeb,

215
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
by putting on perhaps a low-hanging hat and some sunglasses,

216
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
might be led on a VIP experience through a park and ride the Jungle Cruise,

217
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
when you are a living mountain as The Rock is, you have to imagine that it's tough to blend in.

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
He might have never been able to ride it.

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What could The Rock do?

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm not detracting from The Rock, who is, I think, more of a movie star first and an actor second.

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So I'm not trying to denigrate his talent.

222
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
He absolutely has his superpowers.

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That said, what could The Rock do to where he could host your Jungle Cruise ride,

224
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:13,000
and you would not instantly just be like, is everyone seeing this? The Rock is in charge of my Jungle Cruise ride.

225
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I think what you're actually seeing is they would probably do that, right?

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You don't even have to write your own gags.

227
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You choose from a selection of different gags to be a Jungle Cruise skipper.

228
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah, you think The Rock would do that? You think The Rock would go stay on script, Justin?

229
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No, I'm just saying it's not that hard.

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The Rock could do it. They would write some gags for him if he was nervous about it.

231
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It doesn't seem like he would be, but I'm saying it would be doable.

232
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But he can't, and what's sad about this is it's a prison.

233
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The Rock's life is a prison.

234
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
He's trapped in a beautiful prison.

235
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He could do this, and he has the juice to get it done, but he actually couldn't,

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
because people would be hurling themselves into the boat like a fucking scene from World War Z.

237
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You know what I mean? Just catapulting themselves into this Jungle Cruise boat.

238
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'd swim up to the next one.

239
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
If I see The Rock through the backside of water in another boat, I'm jumping out.

240
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's going down. It's going down for real.

241
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's got to be so rough for him to be on the Jungle Cruise.

242
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And by the Jungle Cruise, I mean any entertainment experience ever.

243
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And he's sitting there, and the skipper's like,

244
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Look over there at that hippo. Those hippos don't lie.

245
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And The Rock is like, I'm stronger than this person.

246
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm funnier than this person. I'm more handsome than this person.

247
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Absolutely. Charismatic. I'm more affable.

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
More philanthropic, I bet.

249
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The Rock is saying, I should be the skipper because I'm stronger, faster, smarter, and funnier than this person.

250
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But also, everybody else on the boat is like,

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm having fun on the Jungle Cruise with my dipshit kids,

252
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
but fuck, wouldn't it be so much cooler if The Rock, who is sitting across from me, was doing the skip?

253
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Like, it's wild they're not letting him skip this one since he was the guy in the movie of it.

254
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Why isn't Disney letting Johnny Depp hide out in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride?

255
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He may be one of the pirates.

256
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Right.

257
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Why aren't they letting The Rock leave there?

258
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It sucks.

259
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The poor The Rock, man. It's such a bummer.

260
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
He should be allowed to do what he wants.

261
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Just let him do what he wants. If he wants to do the boat, just let him do it.

262
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I trust him.

263
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
This is the thing, too.

264
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Sometimes, if you're ever getting on the tram ride at Universal,

265
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
or you're getting the Jungle Cruise, where so much of it is about,

266
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
man, even a fucking ghost tour, I would love to have the ride.

267
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'd love to have The Rock lead anything.

268
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But you get on it, and it's like, well, the ride is the same every time.

269
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's all about the energy that the host is bringing to it.

270
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If I saw that it was The Rock, I would be like, oh, fucking strap in everybody.

271
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This is going to change our lives.

272
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
This is going to be like senior year of high school level.

273
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Change our lives, everybody.

274
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Everyone in this boat is going to want to exchange contact information

275
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
so that 10 years from now, we can talk to each other.

276
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
We didn't dream it, did we? It really happened.

277
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It was real, right? What happened to you?

278
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Well, after that, I cleaned up. I got my life together.

279
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That was the kick in the pants that I've been waiting for.

280
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That's what I needed. I called Debra. I got her back.

281
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
We're a happy family again.

282
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Got my kids back from The Rock.

283
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I was watching them, and that was so chill of them.

284
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I really appreciated that.

285
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You know, honey, I've been thinking, I think actually The Rock should be the dad of our children

286
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
because he's stronger than you are and smarter and funnier and cooler.

287
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I have raised children in all the Disney parks over the years,

288
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and it all happened in my mind.

289
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Hey, honey, you know how we met and fell in love on that jungle cruise that The Rock led?

290
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Maybe we should ask him to officiate.

291
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
No, we should ask him to be your best man.

292
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Well, maybe we should ask him to be the groom.

293
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yeah, that sounds great.

294
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's great. I'll see you later.

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Bye.

296
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Let's be in a throuple with The Rock.

297
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I've been in a bunch of marriages in all the parks over the years.

298
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah, over the years. In my mind.

299
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
In my mind?

300
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I just love The Rock so much.

301
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Let's do some questions.

302
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We should have a, there should be a name and a specific numeric distinction for like-

303
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The event horizon?

304
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah, right. The goof horizon where it's like, well, if we've talked about it for 20 minutes,

305
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
at some point it has to be the entire episode.

306
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah, it's the war with grandpa.

307
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's the war with grandpa continuum.

308
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Right.

309
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This is an advice show, not of The Rock fan cast.

310
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Unless the advice you need is, who's great?

311
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah, it seems like that would be a fun show to do.

312
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Although I bet it probably exists, doesn't it?

313
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The Rock fan cast.

314
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Probably. Rocking out.

315
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I've recently started a new job in accounting where I have my own office.

316
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
How do I decorate to make my peers think I'm a badass big business boy?

317
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's from corporate capitalist in Kentucky.

318
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Congratulations on your new level of responsibility.

319
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Great job.

320
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And opportunities for failure.

321
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah.

322
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So that's fun.

323
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's the other side of that coin.

324
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What about the balls?

325
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What?

326
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh, the swinging ones.

327
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Oh, the clicky clackies.

328
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah.

329
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The big clicky clacky balls, except here's the twist.

330
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
They're really big and there's only three of them.

331
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That's cool.

332
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Oh.

333
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's cool, right?

334
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah, so like somebody could be having a meeting in the other room and it's like,

335
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I think we're going to have to let go like six or seven people.

336
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Clack, clack, clack, clack.

337
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Jeremy.

338
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Sorry, is that too loud?

339
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That would be a power play, though, like I'm going to start these balls a-clacking.

340
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Mm-hmm.

341
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
If they lose inertia.

342
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah.

343
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
By that time.

344
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Like you have until then to impression with business.

345
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Justin, can I take it and turn it a little bit?

346
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Okay.

347
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The balls are very tiny.

348
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Hold on.

349
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I didn't give you.

350
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Hold on.

351
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Let me think.

352
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Because this is something that I've been at.

353
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
This idea is a big one for me.

354
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's something I've been working on for a long time.

355
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah, absolutely.

356
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The big three balls is like kind of a-

357
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's huge.

358
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Go ahead, Travis.

359
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Okay.

360
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's a lot of balls and they're very small.

361
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So you have like let's say 35 very small like marble-sized balls spread out in a line across

362
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
the desk.

363
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But you set it up so that of that 35, 17 starts swinging, hits one in the middle, and then

364
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
the other 17 swing from the other way.

365
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh, yeah.

366
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's physics, baby.

367
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
That's how it works.

368
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Sure.

369
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I love that.

370
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Let's do...

371
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But can I...

372
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't even want to take it and turn it.

373
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I want to just add some spice on it, which is sort of what I do here, I think.

374
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,480
Why just stop at the ball swinging desk object?

375
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,640
Why not go to Spencer's Gifts and like finally cash in that $100 gift card that you've been

376
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:58,260
sitting on since your high school graduation and get the plasma ball and get a lava lamp?

377
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:03,840
Get that thermometer that's like a tube of water with the different balls inside of it

378
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,840
that float up and down.

379
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

380
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,840
It's like density or something.

381
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Yeah.

382
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,040
Get the bird that like dips in and get the dips into the water and the dips back up.

383
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
Get a little...

384
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,720
Oh, you could get like a small little water feature fountain on your desk.

385
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,000
Like really turn your desk into a little amusement park.

386
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I love that.

387
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That's so fun.

388
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I love that a lot.

389
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That's pretty great.

390
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That's fine.

391
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Because then like it disarms people, right?

392
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,560
First of all, people want to come in your office because they want to see all your cool

393
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
stuff.

394
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
They want to touch the plasma ball.

395
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
And they want to touch the plasma ball.

396
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
That's the only thing, right?

397
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,040
That's the only reason people go into Spencer's Gifts is like, hey, I wonder how it feels to

398
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
touch the plasma ball.

399
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,880
And you touch it and then you're like, that was cool.

400
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Does that towel have...

401
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
Breasts like a ball.

402
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,200
Does that towel have breasts on it?

403
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
I'll buy that.

404
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
And that's how they get you.

405
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Yep.

406
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,120
So they're going to come in your office and be like, cool stuff, cool toys.

407
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,960
And you're like, they're not toys, they're business objects.

408
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,400
And then they are disarmed.

409
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,080
And now you're the bad ass big business boy.

410
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,360
It would be like if you had a Nerf hoop on the door and then you just left a prominent

411
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Nerf basketball.

412
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,680
And then the first time someone picked it up and you're like, what are you doing in

413
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,680
this office?

414
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
Whoa.

415
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
This is a place of business.

416
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,720
How dare you?

417
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,360
You could also, if you just wanted to like, you know, the virtue posters, right?

418
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,720
Do that, but make them a little whimsical to go with the same thing.

419
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
You know what I mean?

420
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,120
So it's just like you put fun on there and they're like fun and like business fun.

421
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,200
And you're just like, what?

422
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
What did you say?

423
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
I said business fun.

424
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
This is an office.

425
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Yeah.

426
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,840
You could also get those posters, but instead of it being things like dedication and diligence,

427
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,000
working hard means, you know what I mean?

428
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,960
Instead of that, have it say like abstinence and people are like, what is that?

429
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Religious chastity.

430
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
What does your poster say?

431
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Cowardice.

432
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
Does that say cowardice?

433
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Yeah.

434
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

435
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
Disrespect.

436
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
That's me.

437
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,960
Melancholy.

438
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Oppression.

439
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
What?

440
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,320
Hygiene.

441
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,320
Wash those pits, Carl.

442
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,120
You can put out all the toys all across your desk, and then instead of shaming, when someone

443
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,320
picks one of them up and starts fiddling with it, you pull out a clipboard from a drawer

444
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:14,480
and make a small note, then put the clipboard away silently and go, huh.

445
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Interesting.

446
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,280
No one's ever done that before.

447
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Interesting.

448
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,280
That one.

449
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Okay.

450
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
50 mugs.

451
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
What?

452
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,720
50 mugs.

453
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,800
Each one more fun and whimsical than the one before.

454
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:36,040
So you have one that just has the minions on it, then the Garfield one, and then one

455
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:41,920
that says, do not meddle in the affairs of dragons for you are crunchy and taste good

456
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
with ketchup.

457
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
You know what I'm saying?

458
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
That's awesome.

459
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
I love that.

460
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Love that.

461
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
Can I tell you something?

462
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:55,560
This is actually, I saw that on someone's mug one time when I was in college, and it's

463
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,640
actually kind of, it was kind of traumatizing for me because it was the uncoolest thing

464
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,640
I've ever seen.

465
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
Right.

466
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,440
And it was actually hard for me to vocalize just then.

467
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,040
I was like feeling bad saying it because I found the experience of seeing it the first

468
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
time so painful.

469
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Yeah.

470
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,360
Well, let's dive into that, Justin, because maybe it's just that you're unwilling to open

471
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,360
yourself up.

472
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,360
I don't want to unpack it.

473
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
Okay.

474
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,840
So you get one mug for every person that works in the office, and you write their name on

475
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,560
the bottom of it, but you keep them all in your office.

476
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,120
Oh, so they have to come to you to get their mugs?

477
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,280
Well, so they have the option, right?

478
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,400
Because you go to the, oh, you go to the sink, ah, Derek, here's my mugs, my mugs there.

479
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,800
Well, I know Tom has an extra mug with my name on it.

480
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
For me?

481
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Yeah.

482
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
I could go buy-

483
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
My backup mug.

484
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,800
I could go get my backup mug from Tom.

485
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Yeah.

486
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,400
I don't have to worry if none of our stuff is helpful.

487
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
You don't think that's helpful?

488
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:53,720
I just feel like if you did any of this, it would just make you a bad coworker.

489
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,480
Take the door off your office.

490
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
Yeah.

491
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,840
Yeah, do that yourself.

492
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:04,360
Like in office space, if you just do all the stuff like the office space man, everybody

493
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,360
liked that guy at the end.

494
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
They did.

495
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,360
I loved office space man.

496
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
He thought it was funny.

497
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,440
Everybody else did too.

498
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,160
And they just kept giving him more money.

499
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Yeah.

500
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,760
I don't know if you remember that part, but everybody really loved that guy.

501
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,040
They really did.

502
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,120
And the people who were working hard, they were getting fired.

503
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
Yeah.

504
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,840
And he was hardly working and he kept climbing up the wall.

505
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,360
So anyway, here's the plot of office space.

506
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

507
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,360
A man gets hit in time.

508
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
Uh-huh.

509
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,360
And in the middle, a man dies.

510
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,320
So I got a call from the wizard yesterday.

511
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,120
He said he got some good stuff for me.

512
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
And he-

513
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
Oh, like drugs?

514
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,200
He actually drove by my house and he dropped off this WikiHow article.

515
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,920
And he said, he said, he said, don't tell.

516
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,400
And then he, yeah.

517
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
And then he drove-

518
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
He said it like that?

519
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,720
And then guys, I swear to God, his car drove up.

520
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Okay.

521
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,800
Wait, did he make you walk outside and meet him at his car?

522
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
Yeah.

523
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,720
So he drove over to your house.

524
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
Well my-

525
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,800
Made you come outside and get it.

526
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,580
Our infant is home.

527
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,400
And so like, I didn't want him to come in, to come inside.

528
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Do you know what I mean?

529
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
He already knows where you live.

530
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
You're done.

531
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
Yeah.

532
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
I guess so.

533
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
But anyway, his car-

534
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
He drove him in.

535
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
That's very important.

536
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
That's all that matters.

537
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
He drove up into the clouds.

538
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
And here's a WikiHow that was sent by-

539
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Like at the end of Grease?

540
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Yep.

541
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
By Graham Roebuck.

542
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
Thanks, Graham.

543
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,280
It's a great, it's a really good one.

544
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,960
And this one's fresh off the press.

545
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,060
This one's from June 2nd.

546
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:30,200
So it's a hot one because the title of this one is How to Become a Civil War Corpse.

547
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Whoa.

548
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
What?

549
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
And it's not like-

550
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
No, wait, hold on.

551
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Just give me a second.

552
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Yeah.

553
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Okay.

554
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,360
Getting a time machine and do a bad job at Gettysburg is one of them, for sure, one of

555
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
the big ones.

556
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
Yeah.

557
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,040
Charging up a hill, defending a post, maneuvering a flank, everyone wants to be the hero of

558
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,520
Civil War reenactments.

559
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Nope.

560
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
Yeah.

561
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,680
But one thing is always in short supply, corpses.

562
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,320
Clutching your chest and falling down doesn't exactly cut it in terms of historical accuracy.

563
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
This article will help you get started.

564
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
Okay.

565
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
They didn't even have chests back then.

566
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
A lot of people didn't.

567
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
No.

568
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Here's what I would like.

569
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm just going to continue, this is giving me the idea that I would like to be a corpse

570
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
at a Civil War reenactment, but I would like to be there when everyone else gets there

571
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and my corpse is part of a different thing.

572
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I mean, it's still part-

573
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Okay.

574
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,080
I'm still playing the game, right?

575
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,320
But I just happened to be a corpse on the battlefield when they showed up to fight and

576
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,320
then-

577
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
Which had to happen at least one time.

578
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
Right?

579
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,840
So often, way more than one time, if somebody trips over a corpse in the middle of a fresh

580
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,440
new battle and they're like, guys, stop the battle, stop the battle.

581
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Who-

582
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,440
Do you think they ever-

583
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
Guys.

584
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Can we do this mystery?

585
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Please?

586
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,440
Please?

587
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,440
Just this one time?

588
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,440
Someone's been murdered?

589
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Is this one of yours?

590
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,440
It's not one of ours.

591
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
It's one of-

592
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
This cat's wearing orange.

593
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,440
He's not one of us.

594
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
I don't see who works here.

595
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,640
I don't think he works here, guys.

596
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
We have-

597
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,480
Hey, hey, other team, stop war for a second.

598
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,680
We have to come together to get all the clues to solve this one.

599
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:02,720
Then we can go back to us saying slavery is obviously bad and you guys supporting it,

600
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
but first, we got to-

601
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
Travis.

602
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
Yeah?

603
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
Travis, it was about heritage.

604
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
A lot of t-shirts.

605
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
Well.

606
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,920
Listen, I used to be confused too, but I saw a lot of t-shirts around here before me as

607
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
about heritage.

608
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
Not hate.

609
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
So that was-

610
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
I see.

611
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
I see.

612
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
I see.

613
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
I see.

614
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,920
Okay.

615
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:27,760
You don't actually believe that, do you, Justin?

616
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
No.

617
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,720
It's especially irritating in West Virginia.

618
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Yes.

619
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:38,720
It's like, okay, even if I take you at face value, you know that we literally like, we're

620
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,680
like, well, we're just going to scooch over here so far that we become our own state so

621
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,640
we don't have to be on your team.

622
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,520
It's definitely not a good fit for West Virginians.

623
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,380
So for you, we can rule that out, right?

624
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,720
So it's definitely about just the racism, right?

625
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
It's just the other thing.

626
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,680
I don't know how to tell you guys this.

627
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
You're all Yankees.

628
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:02,800
Yeah, you are definitely Yankees and you just don't like black people like that year.

629
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,080
So it's just racism.

630
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,080
Cool.

631
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,080
Cool.

632
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,080
Okay.

633
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
Cool.

634
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
Cool.

635
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,080
Cool.

636
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,320
What would be a- like, it's hard to be a fun Corpse, isn't it?

637
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,880
Well, here's my suggestion.

638
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,880
Okay.

639
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Gangrene.

640
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
Okay.

641
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,880
You get shot.

642
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,600
You pretend to get shot in the leg and then you just spend the rest of the battle just

643
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,200
going like, oh, God.

644
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Slowly expiring.

645
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
This is never going to get better.

646
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Oh, man.

647
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
Who's got lead medicine?

648
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Anyone?

649
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Oh, shoot.

650
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Oh, God.

651
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,720
I'm up shit creek over here.

652
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,720
I wish we had invented penicillin.

653
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Oh, damn it.

654
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
All right.

655
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,880
So the first two steps, find your unit, do a Google search, find out where battles are

656
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,480
taking place, find out when.

657
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
It's a lot of work.

658
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
It's a lot of work.

659
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,320
Make sure you have a period accurate uniform.

660
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,160
It says, remember this American Civil War was fought between the Union and Confederate

661
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
armies.

662
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:04,080
Knights and stormtroopers were not at the Battle of the Shiloh, lo lo lo lo.

663
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,320
And then march into battle.

664
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,760
Some reenactors march in columns with their units, other run onto the battlefield waving

665
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,880
their arms and screaming, it's your call.

666
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
The next step is-

667
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
I'm doing that second one.

668
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
Are you kidding me?

669
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
Yeah.

670
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,680
I'm going to make myself look big to intimidate you.

671
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,480
The next step seems like the most important one.

672
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,680
Step five, get shot.

673
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,560
Make sure you're falling over just as your enemy shoots.

674
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,680
Nothing's more embarrassing than falling over to silence.

675
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,040
You'll look like the world's stupidest soldier.

676
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,080
Also, take care not to fall over after the sound of your own side's guns, lest you look

677
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,880
like you got fragged.

678
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
Okay.

679
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,720
Now, Griffin, do they give instructions on how to, you hear the shot, you fall down,

680
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,000
but then you're like, I was just faking it to get your guard down.

681
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,560
Now I'm shooting you.

682
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,920
And then what to do if the other side is like, I fell down, but I was faking it too, and

683
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,720
I've got an invisible grenade.

684
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,720
Boom.

685
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Yes.

686
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
Boom.

687
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,920
And then you're like, okay, well, I have a chainsaw and it's like, well, I have an invisible

688
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
force field.

689
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,480
Like, well, my chainsaw is magic and cut through force fields.

690
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,160
Well, my force field is scientific, so it's not affected by magic.

691
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,160
That kind of thing?

692
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
Is that in there?

693
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,160
Yeah.

694
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,680
That's step six through 19 is all that stuff you just said.

695
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,760
Clutch your wound.

696
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,320
Spectators need to know where you've been shot and that it hurts, hence the clutching.

697
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
It doesn't say-

698
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
Oh, my balls.

699
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
Yeah.

700
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
It shows a person clutching the chest, but the copy doesn't say the chest.

701
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,320
So like-

702
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,320
No.

703
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,320
You could have gotten shot right in your beampus and say like, oh.

704
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
Well, that's the thing.

705
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,360
In 1860, rifles were very inaccurate.

706
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,820
They didn't have a very good tooling on that.

707
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,440
So chances are you're not getting shot in the chest.

708
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,440
And as Travis has said, Dan Green, a very, very genuine, you, you, you know, doing some

709
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:57,160
home reno accidentally, you know, get a nail in your hand, you're fucking dead, dude.

710
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,060
Like you're not gonna, you're donzo.

711
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,060
They don't have a thing.

712
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,580
They don't have medicine for that yet.

713
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,580
So clutch anywhere.

714
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,080
That's not saying you could get shot in the toe and go down and you're fucked.

715
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,080
And you're dead.

716
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,080
You know what I mean?

717
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,080
This one's wild.

718
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,080
Prepare your death cry.

719
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,080
This area is open to the most artistic interpretation.

720
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,120
Most people go with, ah, but the more elaborate death cries could build backstory into your

721
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
character.

722
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
Yeah.

723
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:27,160
For example, try this one's for you and, ah, or no, you're not dying for your aunt.

724
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,720
Or this one's wild.

725
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,600
I'm coming for you, Mr. Lincoln.

726
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Sorry.

727
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
What?

728
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,840
I'm coming for you, Mr. Lincoln.

729
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,840
I'm what?

730
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,640
I'm coming to heaven to kill you.

731
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
What?

732
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,600
I also am pretty sure that during the civil war, Lincoln was still alive.

733
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
That would be a weird.

734
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,320
How about, not again.

735
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,920
This is what the prophecy warned me about.

736
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,920
Not again.

737
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,800
Oh, no.

738
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:03,960
And on my day of retirement, and on my birthday would be a good one.

739
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,320
It's my birthday and all I wanted was to kill Mr. Lincoln.

740
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:15,260
And also I had a coupon for a free scuba basket rabbit.

741
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,320
The most important thing with the death cries, you must interrupt whatever you're saying

742
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,160
with.

743
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
Fall down.

744
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,120
Except it takes a long time to die.

745
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Yeah.

746
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
Fall down.

747
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,520
If you're in the front rank, fall forward so you don't knock over the guy behind you.

748
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,640
And if you're in the rear range, fall backward.

749
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,640
Very thoughtful.

750
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,640
What if you're in the middle?

751
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
Thunk.

752
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
Ow.

753
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
Fucking asshole.

754
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
You bumped into me.

755
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
Oh, I'm sorry.

756
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,680
All I wanted was to kill Lincoln on my birthday.

757
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:47,920
And also your bayonet is now for real in my shoulder, so that's a problem for sure, for

758
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,920
sure, for sure.

759
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:53,160
You scuffed my fucking 18th century Pumas.

760
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

761
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
But I'm dead.

762
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Fall down.

763
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,200
I'm coming for you.

764
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
What was his name?

765
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,560
Guys, guys, what's the guy with the hat?

766
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
He's got the hat and the beard.

767
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,560
What was his name?

768
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
Lincoln?

769
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
Professor Cool Hat?

770
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
I'm coming for you, Professor Cool Hat.

771
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,560
I'll be straight with you guys.

772
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:19,240
It would be a lot easier to think about this if I didn't have a bullet in my toes.

773
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,240
Lay there.

774
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,600
You must remain still until the battle is over.

775
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,520
An exception to the rule is if the reenactment allows zombies.

776
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,680
See tips section.

777
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,160
I believe I will.

778
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,480
Zip, zip, zip, zip, zip.

779
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
Just quick question.

780
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,000
Do you think that it would get you in trouble if you fall down and then you just kind of

781
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,040
slowly pop your AirPods in and you're just like, whoop, and then you just go back to

782
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,000
laying there while you listen to like This American Life or something?

783
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,400
If I could get in a time machine and I was doing my death cry, you know what I'm saying?

784
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,800
And I get killed in a civil war, and I'd rather not get killed in a civil war than a way to

785
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
fake it.

786
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,880
But like, I would just shout, I'm inventing Spider-Man.

787
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,880
Oh, that's cool.

788
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,000
And so every, and at the first, people wouldn't get it.

789
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,880
Like there would be like probably 20 people who are like, no, the craziest thing I ever

790
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:14,760
saw in a war, this dude was like, after he got shot, this, this, this dude fell over

791
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,440
and he was like, I'm inventing Spider-Man, right?

792
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,440
Yeah.

793
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,080
And it was, it was a while since I ever saw it.

794
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,080
Their kids would hear it.

795
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,080
And eventually they'd hear about Spider-Man, right?

796
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,440
And they'd be like, hold on a second.

797
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,360
I don't think you actually came up with this, Stan Lee and Steve.

798
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,640
I don't think it's your baby.

799
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:37,800
I think actually what happened is, I think actually Justin McElroy, an old civil war

800
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,800
soldier, invented him as he died.

801
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
And then who was that?

802
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Your battle with Justin?

803
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,880
Well, it's Robert E. Lee.

804
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,400
And a century later, his grandson, his great grandson, excuse me, Stan Lee was like, my

805
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:56,720
papa's papa told me once about a man, a brave man who invented Spider-Man.

806
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,440
So I'm going to steal that from that dead fool because he didn't copyright that shit.

807
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,000
But I'm going to add a hyphen so it's legally different.

808
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,740
It could be, I have no interest in LARPing as a Confederate general.

809
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:16,160
That's not something that appeals to me in the least.

810
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:23,200
But in the same vein, it could be fun to cosplay as say Stonewall Jackson and just be out there

811
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,040
and get shot instantly and fall down and be like, oh, I landed on my little beeper and

812
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,200
I shit my pants and I have shit, like if there's a high school there, like, oh, no, my always

813
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,960
diarrhea that I have and I'm going to pass down to all my ancestors, oh, no.

814
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,480
The only good thing about being on the Confederate side in a Civil War reenactment is that you

815
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,120
know the exact picture that will be used of you when you get canceled.

816
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,120
Oh, yeah.

817
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,120
Sure, sure.

818
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,160
It's nice to have that kind of image control, I think, because like, that's the one they're

819
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
running, right?

820
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,960
Like, that's the one.

821
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,800
You know, that's the shot, is you charging forward, saber aloft, defending the-

822
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
For racism!

823
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Yeah, right?

824
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,800
That's the image.

825
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,800
Oh, no, no, no.

826
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Sure, for sure.

827
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,080
But then you look closer at the picture and does he have his hand down the front of his

828
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:18,240
pants and he's wincing like his balls always hurt and he shit his pants like he's making

829
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,240
fun of Stonewall Jackson?

830
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,240
That's funny.

831
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,800
That's funny, actually.

832
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,440
Look here with a magnifying glass.

833
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,240
That in his pocket, is that a note that says, I'm inventing Spider-Man?

834
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,240
That's wild.

835
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,160
This is a picture of Griffin dressed up as Stonewall Jackson.

836
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,080
Wait a minute, but look, his pants fell down and he's wearing a diaper that says, I'm an

837
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,080
idiot on it.

838
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Oh, man.

839
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,080
I guess he fucking got it.

840
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,080
Oh, shit.

841
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,080
Is this a- Griffin did a protest!

842
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,080
Griffin did a protest, everybody!

843
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,080
What's he protesting?

844
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,080
Stonewall Jackson, I guess?

845
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,080
Wait, but he was in the reenact- Yeah.

846
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
Yeah, I know.

847
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
That's the weird thing.

848
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:56,080
He was wearing a shitty diaper that he had drawn the words, I'm an idiot on it, with

849
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,080
Sharpie.

850
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,080
Wow.

851
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
That's a beautiful statement, huh?

852
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,640
It really makes you think about family.

853
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:08,560
The place where you people fuck up in Civil War reenactments is that they get out of their

854
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,000
Yaris and they walk to where the fight is.

855
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Yeah.

856
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,080
If it's me, kind of the bad boy of reenactments.

857
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,080
As you are now.

858
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,240
I drive the Yaris right up to it.

859
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,240
Yeah.

860
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,120
I'm like, hey, guys, I fucking invented cars.

861
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
Let's go.

862
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,120
Yeah.

863
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,120
Let's go.

864
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,600
Let's plow through the Confederates in my Toyota Yaris.

865
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,800
Hey, everybody, get in.

866
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,320
I'm sick of this bloody battle.

867
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,560
We're going to go have an eating competition.

868
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Yes.

869
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,440
Let's settle this with food eating.

870
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,280
With food eating, as they say.

871
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
Come on.

872
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,600
And that's how my great-great-great-grandfather, Joey Chestnut Sr. Sr. Sr. was invented.

873
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,760
Excuse me, Joseph?

874
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Yes?

875
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,760
People don't get invented.

876
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
Yes.

877
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
That's a good point.

878
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
Oh, excellent.

879
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,760
I guess I'm fucking high on hot dogs right now, dog, I don't know what to tell you.

880
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,040
I tripped out of my mind on sliders, ate too many.

881
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,040
I got too many sulfates.

882
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
I don't know what's happening.

883
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,040
I had too many sulfates, bro.

884
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
I don't know what to tell you.

885
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
I'm in a hard head space right now.

886
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:10,160
I don't know if you saw, but I ate four pounds of flaming hot Cheetos, so I'm having a pretty

887
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
bad day.

888
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
I just lied about my family.

889
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,160
I'm sorry.

890
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:18,760
And now I'm going to give you some Oracle of Delphi-style prophecies as I huff these

891
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
wiener for you.

892
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,200
I want to be sure with you, I don't know where the food goes.

893
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,720
My brain creates these elaborate lies to try to justify it, but I mean, to be straight

894
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,080
with you, I haven't pooped in five years.

895
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,520
I don't know where it goes.

896
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,080
But I got lumpy arms.

897
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,080
Help me.

898
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:44,440
The ripples of Joey Chestnut's bonkers actions every July 4th in this country radiates out

899
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:52,120
away from the impact event, so much so that I feel like we spend the run up to July 4th

900
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:58,200
and also the rest of the summer after it talking about Joey Chestnut a lot.

901
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,080
Around Christmas time, that dude's as good as dead, but if it's hot outside, my-

902
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,640
Yeah, the thermometer goes up as does our awareness of Joey Chestnut.

903
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,640
Exactly.

904
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,080
I will be sweating outside, and I'll be like, man, I sure am sweaty.

905
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
It's hot.

906
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,560
It's hot like the summer months.

907
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,000
July is a summer month.

908
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,520
The 4th of July is a day in this month of July.

909
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,800
Hey, Joey Chestnut sure eats a fucking lot of hot dogs, huh?

910
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:31,000
The poor man, every year it seems like he's breaking the record, and that's got to be,

911
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,960
I bet there's some July 4th where Joey wakes up and says, I don't actually feel like eating

912
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,960
a lot of hot dogs today.

913
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,960
You know what?

914
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,400
I'm not actually in the mood for hot dogs.

915
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:45,320
I want to post up a respectable number, but I bet he wishes the first time he won, he

916
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,560
had won by one hot dog.

917
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,080
He shouldn't have pushed it so hard.

918
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,920
Just eat one more than the other person, because then you could break your record consistently

919
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,920
by a hot dog every year, not by several.

920
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,320
He could just stop, wait for the other person to be done and be like, what did you get up

921
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
to?

922
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,320
Okay, boop, I'm done.

923
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
Yeah, I'm done.

924
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,920
I eat one more than you.

925
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:15,680
We need to take a break and serve the corporate overlords.

926
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:22,360
I want to tell you about stamps.com.

927
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
Do it.

928
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,360
So here's what happens, right?

929
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,560
You got a letter.

930
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,000
You wrote a letter to your pal, right?

931
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,080
This is your pal.

932
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,600
They live in a different state and you got to give this letter to them.

933
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,600
You go to put it in the mail.

934
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
What?

935
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Oh no.

936
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,560
I don't got a stamp.

937
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,560
What are you going to do?

938
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,880
Drive to the post office?

939
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

940
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,440
You're going to use your digital scale and you're going to print off postage right from

941
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,440
your computer.

942
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,920
Yes, my friends, this is the future we're living in.

943
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:58,640
The future is now with stamps.com, a website on the worldwide web that can give you postage

944
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,120
for your letter to your pal.

945
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:06,000
You can print official US postage and shipping labels 24 seven without having to leave your

946
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,680
desk ever or by any fancy equipment.

947
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,120
All you need is your computer and standard printer and it's not just US postage.

948
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,120
You could do UPS shipping services from your computer as well.

949
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:22,600
They offer deals you can't get anywhere else, like up to 40% off USPS and up to 66% off

950
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:29,020
UPS shipping rates and you never leave your desk ever because you're going to ship it.

951
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:33,560
The post office person is going to come to your desk, leave the door open a little bit

952
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,500
and a note on the door that says, please come to my desk and get this letter and I'll give

953
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,640
you a Dove chocolate.

954
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,920
Stop wasting time going to the post office and go to stamps.com instead.

955
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:52,040

963
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,460
It's totally safe.

964
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:26,000
Food waste is a massive problem in this nation and there's a lot of different ways you could

965
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
address the problem.

966
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,200
Well, here's one great way.

967
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,200
It's imperfect foods.

968
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,720
Every day, delicious groceries, just they don't, they don't look so good.

969
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
You know what I mean?

970
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,720
Like they don't look like in the test book.

971
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,040
Oh, like the weird ones where you look at it and you're like, what is that?

972
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,640
I prefer to use the term imperfect, Travis.

973
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,760
Yeah, but I mean like a durian or like a star fruit.

974
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,320
No, no, no, no, no.

975
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,000
Not the intrinsically weird ones, like the sort of like off brand ones.

976
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,560
You know, the imperfect foods is turning this around by sourcing quirky, but delicious foods

977
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,000
and delivering them in a way proven to reduce emissions.

978
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,020
And did you know in 2019, this is shocking, 35% of the food supply went unsold or uneaten.

979
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,020
That's wild.

980
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,080
That's a wild amount of waste.

981
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:14,560
So you could get these delivered to you and cut down on this waste.

982
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:21,560
It delivers by neighborhood, which is a unique model that produces 25 to 75% fewer emissions

983
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,220
than individual trips to the grocery store.

984
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:29,320
Right now, imperfect foods is offering our listeners 20% off your first four orders when

Tell me about it.

994
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,160
Video games.

995
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
Video games.

996
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,160
Video games.

997
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,720
You like them?

998
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,340
Maybe you wish you had more time for them.

999
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,960
Maybe you want to know the best ones to play.

1000
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,600
Maybe you want to know what happens to Mario when he dies.

1001
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,960
In that case, you should check out TripleClick.

1002
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,200
It's a podcast about video games.

1003
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,680
A podcast about video games?

1004
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,480
But I don't have time for that.

1005
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,480
Sure you do.

1006
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,600
Once a week, Kickback is three video game experts give you everything from critical

1007
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,120
takes on the hottest new releases, to scoops, interviews, and explanations about how video

1008
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,800
games work, to fascinating and sometimes weird stories about the games we love.

1009
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,700
TripleClick is hosted by me, Kirk Hamilton, me, Jason Schreier, and me, Maddie Myers.

You can find TripleClick wherever you get your podcasts and listen at MaximumFun.org.

1011
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,640
Bye!

1012
00:43:42,640 --> 00:44:11,280
Welcome to Munch Squad is a very brief podcast

1013
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,640
within a podcast which we spend a lot of time talking about Jungle Cruise, which in hindsight

1014
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,640
was the right move.

1015
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,240
If we don't talk about it now, when are we going to talk about it?

1016
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,720
If not now, when?

1017
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,720
Last week when it was released?

1018
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,720
Now!

1019
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,720
Don't be crazy.

1020
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,720
We can't go back in time.

1021
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,720
Don't be silly.

1022
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,360
We were busy talking about Halloween.

1023
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,880
We were talking about Halloween.

1024
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,640
Very very briefly, Marble Slab Creamery has Hot Cheetos milkshakes, but that, I don't

1025
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,640
have a story.

1026
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,400
I just want to let you know that that's happening.

1027
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,840
Okay, thank you.

1028
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:45,920
You could, if you have one of those around you, you can go get some hot ice cream.

1029
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,560
So there you go.

1030
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,560
Bojangles.

1031
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,720
Now you guys know the sad tale of Bojangles as it pertains to me personally, Justin Mapel.

1032
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,360
The one near you closed.

1033
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,840
No, sir.

1034
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,540
The one near me got extremely popular.

1035
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:04,040
So popular, in fact, that they had to redirect traffic, as I detailed in an episode of My

1036
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,480
Brother My Brother and Me, they had to redirect traffic because there was such a massive line

1037
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,280
to go to Bojangles.

1038
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,120
And then they opened another one and everybody's like, well, fuck this, there's two of them.

1039
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:20,560
And somehow they cannibalize each other's businesses to an extent that they both shut

1040
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,560
down.

1041
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:27,300
And now if I want to go to Bojangles, I got to drive two hours to Lexington, hard pass.

1042
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:35,760
So they, this is why I'm angry about it because Bojangles has unleashed a new hand breaded

1043
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,720
chicken sandwich.

1044
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,120
And it's just like Popeye's chicken sandwich.

1045
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:47,040
Just last week said, we're sorry to start the war, but we're ending it now.

1046
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,240
Let there be peace.

1047
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:55,200
And Bojangles just stumbles drunkenly with no appreciation for what ballot, the delicate

1048
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,200
ceasefire that they are unsettling.

1049
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,920
They're just like charging in here like, we got a new one too.

1050
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,520
Now it's big like the others.

1051
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,000
To be fair to Bojangles, I would say-

1052
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
There's no need for that.

1053
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
They closed, they broke.

1054
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,520
But here's what I'm saying, is if I was in the war, right?

1055
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,880
And I really wanted to kill somebody, there was someone I really wanted to kill.

1056
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,080
And the other side was like, hey, how about a ceasefire?

1057
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,320
I'd be like, give me one second.

1058
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:25,760
I need one quick thing that can't be counted as a murder and then the war can be over

1059
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,240
because I hate my friend Doug so much.

1060
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,120
I'll definitely sign that paper in just a second.

1061
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,120
I'll sign it.

1062
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:36,960
But hey, they probably did that like, hey, we're about to quit and give up the war.

1063
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,440
Does anybody have anybody they really, really, really wanted to kill before it will be a

1064
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,240
murder in a second?

1065
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,880
Yeah, I'd like to.

1066
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,960
Okay, you have 10 minutes, okay, but that's it.

1067
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:54,280
How many months after it do you think people would kill people they didn't like and just

1068
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,280
be like, oh, the war's over?

1069
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,280
Oh, I didn't know.

1070
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,280
Over?

1071
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,280
Oh, sorry.

1072
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,280
Oh, man.

1073
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,280
We don't have TV or internet or anything yet.

1074
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,280
I just hadn't-

1075
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,360
I just, I hate my cousin Doug from Georgia so much.

1076
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,320
And I swear I heard him saying some stuff.

1077
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,640
He said he wanted to start.

1078
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,200
He said actually the words, I'm starting it back up again and I was like, no, and I'm

1079
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,200
a hero.

1080
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,320
And I'm confused then and I felt like I was doing a good thing.

1081
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,320
Shoot.

1082
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,320
Yeah.

1083
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:27,400
Do you think when like the people were having this terrible civil war that was pitting American

1084
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,040
against American, brother versus brother, do you think-

1085
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,040
Dad versus dad.

1086
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,040
Dad versus dad.

1087
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,560
Do you think one of the things they thought was like, well, this is so sad.

1088
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,400
No one will make jokes about it at least, you know?

1089
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,400
Yeah.

1090
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,400
Okay.

1091
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,400
So Bojangles-

1092
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,400
Okay.

1093
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,400
I've just been reading the press release verbatim to this point.

1094
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,520
It's several pages long.

1095
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,520
Let me skip.

1096
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,520
Let me see.

1097
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,080
Civil war, civil war, civil war, brother versus brother, dad versus dad.

1098
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:59,920
Bojangles knows a thing or two about delicious, perfectly flavored chicken served right.

1099
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,640
So who better to give fans a chicken sandwich that is sure to please?

1100
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,960
It's from Chef Marshall Scarborough, Vice President of Menu and Culinary Innovation

1101
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,640
for Bojangles.

1102
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:17,680
And we could say with confidence that Bo's chicken sandwich is so clucking good, you

1103
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,640
know it could only be Bojangles.

1104
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:24,760
I have one of my pet peeves is when people do that and they like take an obvious curse

1105
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:29,280
word and change it a little bit because like it's clearly there so that everyone knows

1106
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,520
that he meant fucking good, right?

1107
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:37,040
So all you're doing is just muddying the waters of, just say, hey, in this press release for

1108
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,960
a Bojangles chicken sandwich, it's fucking good.

1109
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,720
You're gonna, you're not gonna like the rest of this press release.

1110
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,400
Listen to this extra description of the same chicken sandwich everyone has been releasing

1111
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,440
since Popeye's.

1112
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:58,680
Pillowed between a toasted and buttered, I don't think that counts.

1113
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,360
I don't think you can pillow it.

1114
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,360
Nope.

1115
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:07,880
Pillowed between a toasted and buttered bakery bun, so the bakery, okay, so it was baked

1116
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,880
in a bakery.

1117
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,920
Well, that's a hell of a thing.

1118
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,560
What a bun.

1119
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:19,880
Pillowed between a toasted and buttered bakery bun is a juicy marinated chicken breast, juicy

1120
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:25,360
marinated chicken breast, hand breaded with crispy buttermilk coating and dusted with

1121
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,120
a secret mix of bold spices.

1122
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,960
It's a fucking chicken sandwich.

1123
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,960
We get it.

1124
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,960
Accompanying the chicken.

1125
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:41,000
Is a layer of creamy, zesty mayonnaise, affixed, affixed, I say, with thick cut dill pickles.

1126
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,160
It's a chicken sandwich.

1127
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,360
Our team had a blast perfecting this.

1128
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,360
Wee!

1129
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,360
Woohoo!

1130
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,600
Hand me another pickle, buddy.

1131
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,600
You got it.

1132
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,600
Woo!

1133
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,600
Oh, man.

1134
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,600
I've eaten 12 of these things.

1135
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,600
I don't have the time of my fucking life.

1136
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,600
Wee!

1137
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,960
They had a blast perfecting this sandwich.

1138
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,960
We can't wait.

1139
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,960
I don't miss my kids at all.

1140
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,120
I'm not going home.

1141
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,120
I sleep here.

1142
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,120
I love these things.

1143
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,120
I'm going to pillow myself on this bun for a pillow.

1144
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,520
I'm pillowing myself on this pillow.

1145
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:17,920
One flavor packed bite will have even the most well mannered person saying, that's so

1146
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,920
clucking good.

1147
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:19,920
Jesus Christ.

1148
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,280
What did you just, what the fuck did you just say?

1149
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,480
You're usually so well mannered.

1150
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,480
I'm sorry.

1151
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,480
I'm sorry.

1152
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,960
I was just so clucking good.

1153
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,800
I'm kicking you out of seminary.

1154
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,980
Get out of here.

1155
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:38,880
This is actually, this next one may be one of the most sort of soul crunching things

1156
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:47,040
I've read on Munch Squad, and it's a pretty high bar at this point, but I think I can't

1157
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:52,480
believe I had to say the thing about meddling in the affairs of dragons, staying one step

1158
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:59,440
ahead of the quote, so good you could put it on a t-shirt end quote reaction.

1159
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,480
This sandwich is bound to elicit.

1160
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:07,680
Bojangles did put it on a t-shirt, anitope bag and a bucket hat.

1161
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:12,800
Fans of the brand can snag theirs here, and it is a non-functioning link.

1162
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,440
It's not linked to anything.

1163
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:24,360
So I guess I had to go to their actual website, and they have a bag, and it says so clucking

1164
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:30,640
good on it, and then there's a Bojangles retractable pen for 95 cents.

1165
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:37,160
So I can't, I do have to credit them for their reasonable prices on this stuff.

1166
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,520
They got an airbrushed koozie that says biscuit beach on it.

1167
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,520
Well, I do like that.

1168
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,520
Wait, hold on.

1169
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,520
Huh?

1170
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,520
That's pretty good.

1171
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,800
They got t-shirt that says we're the real deal.

1172
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,200
And then there's like a lot of biscuit beach merch that I actually need.

1173
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,000
Greetings from biscuit beach.

1174
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,560
It's a yellow type, man, I'm getting this.

1175
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,880
I can't try these.

1176
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:05,900
So let me know, you know, if you want to fuel the chicken sandwich wars, stir them back

1177
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:10,080
up again, head on over to Bojangles and, or get it at the app.

1178
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,120
You know, they don't have, everybody's going to have an app now.

1179
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,120
Just real quick, before we move on to the rest of the show, I'm workshopping a new game

1180
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,400
in my head called Would You Rather?

1181
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,520
It's where Justin and Griffin get into the mindset of Dan Rather, and then I ask them

1182
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:28,000
if Dan Rather would do something, and then they answer me as to whether or not Dan Rather,

1183
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,460
they think as Dan Rather, if they would do it.

1184
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:34,920
So I just need people to tweet at me things that they would want to know if Dan Rather

1185
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,920
would do or not.

1186
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,920
Yeah, I think our audience definitely knows who Dan Rather is.

1187
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,840
Yeah, so if you want to send me those, you can just tweet at me and just add the hashtag

1188
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:49,660
Would You Rather.

1189
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,440
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1190
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,440
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1191
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:57,880
Man, we helped less people than normal, and that's saying a fuck lot.

1192
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:03,520
You know what, actually, real quick, let's just do one more because I feel so guilty.

1193
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,560
Last year, my wife and I moved upstate and bought some chickens, embracing that gay farm

1194
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,560
life.

1195
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,880
My family and hers have been watching and cheering on our chicken-raising journey all

1196
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,080
along, which has been great, but the other day, I got a text saying my cousin just got

1197
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:20,600
chickens too, and they're the really fancy kind, you know, with fluffy legs and heads.

1198
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,040
Now my family always brings up her chickens when I try to talk about mine.

1199
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:29,060
Brothers, how can I get my family to see that mine are the superior birds that's from high-class

1200
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,060
hens in the Hudson Valley?

1201
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:34,120
Man, I was about to make like a Pokemon joke, right, where it's like, you got to make them

1202
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,280
battle, and I realized, like, that's cockfighting, and then I was like, wait a minute, that's

1203
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,280
Pokemon.

1204
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,280
Wait a minute.

1205
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,280
Yeah.

1206
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,280
Oh, come on.

1207
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,280
Wait a minute.

1208
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,280
Wait a minute.

1209
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,280
Uh-oh.

1210
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,280
Geodude, I'm sorry.

1211
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,280
Hold up, guys.

1212
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,280
Let me get on my...

1213
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,280
I got to get on my game point.

1214
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,280
Geodude, I'm so sorry, dude.

1215
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,280
I didn't know.

1216
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,280
I got to let go a lot of...

1217
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,280
Well, I can't let go of my Geodude.

1218
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,280
He's my strongest one.

1219
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,280
Okay, Pidgey, you're free.

1220
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,280
Buy two dozen eggs from the store.

1221
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,280
Put two dozen eggs underneath your chicken.

1222
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,280
Send a video of your family.

1223
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,280
Anyway, I'm doing my regular stuff today.

1224
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,280
I'm going to get the eggs from the store.

1225
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,280
I'm going to get the eggs from the store.

1226
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,280
I'm going to get the eggs from the store.

1227
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:07,800
Anyway, I'm doing my regular stuff today.

1228
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,800
Going to get the eggs from the chickens.

1229
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,400
And then you هicle the chicken, there's a two dozen fucking eggs in position.

1230
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,480
But you don't feel free to just be like...

1231
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,680
Ah, the normal number.

1232
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,140
A regular hole today.

1233
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,640
Good average work, Joan the chicken.

1234
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,940
Could you shave the other chickens?

1235
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:26,200
Not pluck, that sounds terrible, but just like trim the feathers back on these fluffy

1236
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,200
birds?

1237
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,260
So they look a little dumb when a dog gets wet and all their hair goes to the fox and

1238
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,540
Are you talking about sabotage?

1239
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,380
Ooh.

1240
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,220
Are you talking about sabotage?

1241
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,580
A little bit of sabotage.

1242
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,860
Are you talking about indulging

1243
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:44,220
in the nefarious art of sabotage?

1244
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,540
Perhaps I am, Justin.

1245
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,380
What's going on?

1246
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,700
Well, that's just a pick-up line.

1247
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:53,700
Just a wee whiff of the old sabotage.

1248
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,740
A little under-the-table leisure mane

1249
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,060
that goes by the name of sabotage.

1250
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,860
Perhaps I am, if you are rapscallion enough.

1251
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:07,740
Some ill-intentioned leisure mane

1252
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:11,380
which I like to think of as a whole sabotage.

1253
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,660
Perhaps I am, Justin.

1254
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,820
Griffin! Yeah.

1255
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,340
Did you hear the news?

1256
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,660
Yeah, I did.

1257
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:23,660
Travis, your brother has suggested sabotage.

1258
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,940
Do you have any thoughts about this

1259
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,740
most intriguing development?

1260
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,020
I was just thinking it'd be pretty cool

1261
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,620
if former Reds third baseman-

1262
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,740
Yeah, go on, yes, continue, please.

1263
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,500
Wait, we're on Tinder hooks.

1264
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,780
I can't wait to hear how you employ sabotage.

1265
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:45,980
So far, we have two gentlemen chicken saboteurs.

1266
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:46,820
Yeah.

1267
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,460
How will our third brother

1268
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:52,820
figure into our machinations of sabotage?

1269
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,820
I was just wondering if it would be badass

1270
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,700
if former Cincinnati Reds third baseman,

1271
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,180
Chris Sabo, released a hip-hop album called Sabotage?

1272
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,500
That would be cool.

1273
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,380
I'm telling all of y'all it's Sabotage!

1274
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,340
Jung Jung! Jung Jung!

1275
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,820
Chris, do you have to do all the guitar sounds

1276
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:13,660
with your mouth?

1277
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,540
I don't know how to play the instruments.

1278
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,660
Do you need a ball thrown?

1279
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,420
I'm also writing another song called Saboname.

1280
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,700
It's the best I've got.

1281
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,660
Saboname? Saboname, Saboname.

1282
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,940
Hey, Chris, we're gonna have to let you go.

1283
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,460
I get it. Sorry, Chris.

1284
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,900
Yeah, no, it makes sense.

1285
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,700
I thought this was my thing after baseball,

1286
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:33,540
but it's not.

1287
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:34,380
You know, whatever.

1288
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:35,580
Do you think that's the first joke

1289
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:38,340
we've ever done on the show that Jesse Thorn liked?

1290
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:44,300
Blending, finally blending his passions

1291
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,660
for hip-hop and baseball.

1292
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,060
Hey, thanks so much for listening to our program.

1293
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,660
Now, this is the end.

1294
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,380
And we helped that person with the chicken,

1295
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,720
so now we've earned our rest.

1296
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,360
But we really appreciate you being here with us.

1297
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:02,840
It's always such a joy and a treat, which is a joy.

1298
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,840
Yeah, that is a joy.

1299
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,240
We've got some new merch over at McElroyMerch.com.

1300
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,000
Our pin of the month is Work of Fart.

1301
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
It is wonderful.

1302
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,400
And it benefits One Tree Planet,

1303
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,920
which is dedicated to making it easier

1304
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,320

1305
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,880
to give back to the environment.

1306
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,240
They asked us to keep,

1307
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,760
when we told them what the pin was,

1308
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,960
they were like, huh, well, huh.

1309
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,520
We'll think on it. Thank you.

1310
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,600
Thank you, I guess.

1311
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,960
It helps create a healthier climate,

1312
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,000
protect biodiversity,

1313
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,800
and help reforestation efforts around the world.

1314
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,320
There's also some pixel art stickers

1315
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,160
of their brothers and everything else.

1316
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,200

1322
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,560
Of course.

1323
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,380
For the use of all these things.

1324
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,880
Of course.

1325
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,600
Hey, y'all want the final Yahoo?

1326
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,440
Yes, please.

1327
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,260
Yeah. Absolutely.

1328
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,100
Awesome.

1329
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,880
This one was sent in by Randy.

1330
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,720
Ooh, what a gift.

1331
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,800
Quaid.

1332
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,200
Oh.

1333
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,160
Sorry, did you say Quaid or Quaid?

1334
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,000
Randy Quaid.

1335
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,560
That's what it says.

1336
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,600
A different person.

1337
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,920
This is from Randy Quaid at gmail.business.

1338
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,720
And it's-

1339
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,160
Dude, why did you talk so fast?

1340
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,000
Why did you do it?

1341
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,840
That's for sure.

1342
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,400
We don't usually do that.

1343
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,640
Fuck, I shouldn't have said that.

1344
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,480
And he lives in a-

1345
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,680
All right, it's also asked by Randy Quaid.

1346
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,200
Why does it say, why did he-

1347
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,840
He sent his own question?

1348
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,800
He sent his own question, man.

1349
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,200
That's embarrassing.

1350
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:39,200
Yeah, and it looks like Randy Quaid asks,

1351
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,280
looks like Randy Quaid asks, hold on, it's loading.

1352
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,120
Yeah, what time does Ponderosa Steakhouse close?

1353
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:50,960
Dang.

1354
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,000
My name is Justin-

1355
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,640
I'm Griffin McElroy.

It's better with you.
