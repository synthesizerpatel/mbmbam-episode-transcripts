1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,280
Welcome, my brother, my brother, and me to the advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,840
We are celebrating this Labor Day by marking our official entry into the podcasting union,

7
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,560
and I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. And I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,600
And I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. We built this city!

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,320
That's the theme song. If you remember Griffin,

10
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,560
you had to change your name legally to get into the podcast union because there was already a

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,040
Griffin McElroy. I'm Hollywood Griffin McElroy. It's a fucking crazy thing they make you do.

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,160
They make you append to your name. And the podcasting union, I'm sure you're

13
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:33,440
all familiar with some of the bylaws, but we're still going over them here. What are they?

14
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,960
Well, I mean, I already touched on the one where you have to sing like a bar from

15
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,120
from We Built This City on rock and roll, because it's sort of like,

16
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,160
you know, like a togetherness thing. Like we all the podcasters together,

17
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,440
we built the city of audio of audio broadcasting on online.

18
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,040
Also, there's mandatory bathroom breaks every 10 minutes in the recording,

19
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,800
whether you need to or not. Yeah.

20
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,400
And you have to force something out. Someone accompanies you to the bathroom.

21
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:08,000
I've got these like horrible gorilla grip marks on my I don't want to get blue,

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,480
but on the shaft of my penis that it comes from like trying to wring it out like

23
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,640
some sort of Mandarin orange. It's like trying to milk a thirsty cow.

24
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,560
Why would the cow do it?

25
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,320
I don't think the cow has to be thirsty. No, that's actually a podcast regulation

26
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,840
that you have to make a weird metaphor about once a show.

27
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,680
Well, we're already fucking set on that front. I don't think we need to do anything extra to

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,120
say you did talk about like gorilla on your penis or something.

29
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,520
So like talking about like we have to squeeze our dicks and sing copyrighted songs on our

30
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,280
podcast now, like we're not really getting anything out of this fucking union that we

31
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,200
just joined. I should have spoken up before we signed up like you guys were all about it.

32
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,280
And I should have voiced these reservations before I squeezed my dick off.

33
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,000
It has been much worse since Marc Maron became the president.

34
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,120
He has instituted a lot of the more pressing, I think, inconvenient rules to the union.

35
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,360
Guy's a big dick squeezer. I had no idea from way back.

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,960
The main purpose of the podcast union is not for the here and now, it's for the future.

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,400
And the agreement is basically when the revolution comes and the sheer just

38
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:24,560
just utter uselessness of each of our skill sets becomes revealed to the light of day,

39
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,840
we promise not to turn on each other.

40
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,480
Right. That's important. And it's also like an exclusivity thing because one of these fucking

41
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,720
days everyone listening to this podcast is going to realize that we're just three dickheads that

42
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,960
bought microphones and that this is the easiest thing to do in the universe. And we're going to

43
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,640
get we're going to get replaced. And this exclusivity is going to be the only thing.

44
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,960
They're going to do it. They're going to do it better and they're going to do it cheaper.

45
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,600
But, you know, they're not going to do it legally scabs.

46
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,440
Right. Can't have machines doing podcasting with these laws.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,640
Not, you know, you know, Jordan Morris is a scab.

48
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,600
Yeah. And a machine and a machine.

49
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,800
He's a machine bar and squeezes his dick. Like, get out of here, Tandy.

50
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,360
Get out of your Tandy 200.

51
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,400
While we're trying to sort some of these the nuances of these laws out

52
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,840
and how we can exploit them, let's answer some questions just to kill time till the

53
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,840
next bathroom break. And then we'll we'll we'll repeat. Ever since I was little,

54
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,680
my parents have maintained a multi. I just want to mark this occasion.

55
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,600
I think that was the least funny intro.

56
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,480
Sixty five episodes, not a single goddamn solid joke in the entire.

57
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,640
What you don't know is that we have to reset every hundred and sixty six episodes

58
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,160
because we were getting too funny at the beginning and expectations were getting too high.

59
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,120
And next week and we can really phone it in. Not a single well composed gag in the entire one.

60
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,720
We really it was really I just wanted to mark the occasion.

61
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,080
Ever since I was little, my parents have maintained a multi pet household.

62
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,120
Almost all the animals live long, healthy lives. The only animals my parents apparently

63
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,480
aren't adept at caring for are parakeets, since these tend to pass away relatively early

64
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,760
within a few years. If that the problem is, my parents keep getting parakeets.

65
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,520
Brothers, how do I politely inform my parents that they should stop trying to care

66
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,480
for these tiny birds and instead focus their attention on animals they can actually care for?

67
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,960
Is there a graceful way to go about doing this? Sincerely, Flummoxed in Philly.

68
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,520
So the problem is your your parents are bird murderers.

69
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,480
They're bird-murderers.

70
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't think there's a graceful way to handle it,

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,440
but there are like a hundred really super forceful ways to do it.

72
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,280
Yeah, I think number one is liberate them every time they buy them.

73
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:46,640
Let me throw this out. What about like an Oscar-style video of all the parakeets that they've lost

74
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,120
in that previous season? It's just like a video of all the parakeets with

75
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,880
really sad music underneath and then like captions of their name and like 2005 to 2006.

76
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,640
Maybe you lack the, you know, the iMovie skills to throw something like that together.

77
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,120
Maybe you just pile up all the bird corpses on the table

78
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,680
and say look and then you you say this is more than all the other pets that you've had combined.

79
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,520
Why did this is your 215th bird like clearly didn't work out the other 214 times.

80
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,600
Are your parents cats?

81
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,680
Key information that should have been included.

82
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,160
If they don't care, if they don't take the parakeets from the pet store,

83
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,640
they'll just get eaten there. I mean somebody will eat them.

84
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,480
You gotta look at, you gotta have a talk with your parents about the relative bone density

85
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,560
of these pets that they're buying because you get a dog, you get a mastiff,

86
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,080
that's a fucking sturdy animal. You can't, it is very hard.

87
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,520
Good luck killing that.

88
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,440
Good luck crushing that mastiff, you can't do it.

89
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,240
A parakeet, a fucking a stiff wind, you turn the ceiling fan on high

90
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,560
and it's it is compressed into the loam.

91
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,840
Are both your parents Lenny from Vice and Men?

92
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,600
We should have clarified that before.

93
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,600
We should just define what your parents are. Are they regular human beings?

94
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,800
Apparently not because regular human beings can take care of like birds.

95
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,840
You just give them seeds and then they're pretty much good to go.

96
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,720
They need heartier stock birds. Maybe give them some like crows.

97
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah, but then they definitely can't get fucking don't.

98
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,040
You can't have parakeets and crows because crows will just eat the parakeets.

99
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,360
Unless it's like one of those adorable videos where like,

100
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,920
you know, a dog becomes friends with a deer or something.

101
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,440
Yeah, crows are generally known for that kind of cross-species friendship behavior.

102
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,960
You know, people never talk about the look at these adorable friends videos that they,

103
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,400
the inception of every single one of those has to be an act of almost unimaginable neglect.

104
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,320
How did you let the gorilla get close enough to the kitten that they became best friends?

105
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,920
How did you mess up so bad?

106
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,240
There's a dog in that tiger cage, you guys. Is no one else seeing this?

107
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
You know, it's better taking care of that tiger or that dog.

108
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,880
A trained animal professional, I bet.

109
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,920
I bet that dog is not like giving it its shots and shit.

110
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,960
I'm just saying I'm a way better friend to tigers and dogs

111
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,840
than either of those species could ever possibly be.

112
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,760
Not some weird animal matchmaker.

113
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,600
It's like, let's see if these hate each other.

114
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,920
Oh, well, another failed experiment.

115
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,560
Sorry, YouTube.

116
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,000
Not gonna make my YouTube partner money check this this month

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,520
because I couldn't find a good pairing.

118
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,160
Is that what's going on?

119
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,640
You're trying to get your parents are trying to YouTube matchmake.

120
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,800
They're putting parakeets together with every...

121
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,200
There's not an animal that won't just instinctively fucking kill a parakeet.

122
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,480
There's got to be an animal.

123
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,920
Dorsey, we've tried them all.

124
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,560
Iguana and parakeet, no.

125
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,040
Damn it.

126
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,800
Gorilla and parakeet, no.

127
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,280
They are the Cheetos of the aviary world.

128
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,680
You just...

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,640
It was good.

130
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,600
I'll have 15 more.

131
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,400
It's got to be grim for them because they're looking down towards the end of the alphabet.

132
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,960
The only things they're seeing are Wolverine and zebra

133
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,960
and they don't feel great about their chances.

134
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,240
Even a zebra.

135
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,560
It's like, my stripes are weird.

136
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,720
Do you think that when her parents roll up

137
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,800
or his parents roll up to the pet store,

138
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,360
like the other parakeets see him like, oh, shit, they're back.

139
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh, fuck.

140
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,480
Here we go.

141
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,040
Oh, no.

142
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
It's like the third time this month.

143
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,920
Little girl in Finding Nemo like, I will have six parakeets.

144
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,400
Like, nope.

145
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,920
Nope, you won't.

146
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,280
No, no, no.

147
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,760
I definitely sold you parakeets on Tuesday.

148
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,240
So are you a magician?

149
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,760
Are you a shitty wizard?

150
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,480
What's going on?

151
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,360
What's going on?

152
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,840
Are you transforming them into humans to live out human lives?

153
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,400
Probably not.

154
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,000
Matchmaking, huh?

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,280
We're all part of that game.

156
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,040
We got a ring in the back room.

157
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,640
It's kind of like an animal fighting ring, except it's not supposed to be.

158
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,040
It's supposed to be an animal hugging ring.

159
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,400
Do you ever see that movie Fight Club?

160
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,680
Yeah.

161
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,520
What do you think about it?

162
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,480
It really made me think.

163
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,800
Also, we have an animal fight club.

164
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,840
Also, you've been a parakeet the entire time.

165
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,400
Are your parents parakeets?

166
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,120
Wait a minute.

167
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,880
That doesn't make sense.

168
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,400
Of all of nature's creatures, you'd think parakeets would be a depth of care.

169
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,920
Although not in the human world.

170
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,560
They don't have access to some of the twigs or berries that they would have in a parakeet

171
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,840
native environment.

172
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,200
I would say that, Justin, the problem is that you're assuming that her parents started off

173
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,160
as parakeets.

174
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,320
I was inferring that they had once been human and were now parakeets.

175
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,360
And we're looking for the parakeet wizard that had turned them into parakeets for

176
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,000
mistreating them.

177
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,280
I clearly should have inferred that dumb shitty thing that you were thinking.

178
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,720
I don't know why I was thinking like a grown man.

179
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,920
Read a damn book.

180
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,240
What book has that plot?

181
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,960
James Bond novels?

182
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,440
I guess.

183
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,600
I don't think so.

184
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,640
I've read them all.

185
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,840
I think you're illiterate.

186
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,240
I've read them all and they're all about parakeet wizards.

187
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,640
Griffin, can you read us a Yahoo answer?

188
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
Yeah, I'll read you a few if you want.

189
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,080
Or we can just do one at a time like we usually do.

190
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,280
Okay, this Yahoo was sent in by David Byrne.

191
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,920
Assumedly not the David Byrne, but this one is still pretty good, I think.

192
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,400
Thanks, David.

193
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
It's by Yahoo interviewer Sage, who asks,

194
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,240
Why am I so hungry?

195
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,360
Am I not growing?

196
00:10:59,360 --> 00:10:59,680
Male.

197
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,040
Okay, wait.

198
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,240
M-A-L-E?

199
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,040
M-A-I-L?

200
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,680
M-A-L-E.

201
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,800
They're just giving us a little bit of extra info up in the headline.

202
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,280
Which, frankly, your gender does inform a lot of things.

203
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,160
Not in a sexist way, but it's helpful information when we provide you information.

204
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,760
Flomex in Philly couldn't even specify the species of his parent in these questions.

205
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,560
That's what I'm saying.

206
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,640
I would prefer if in the future, whenever you do provide a question, it's just like,

207
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,000
My parents are parakeets.

208
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,720
Female.

209
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,280
You know what I mean?

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,640
Anyway, Sage asks,

211
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,600
Okay, I had a decent lunch today at school and it did fill me up.

212
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,760
I come home and I'm really hungry.

213
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,760
I ate two PBJ sandwiches and almost a whole big bag of Doritos.

214
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,920
Holy three minutes later, I'm still hungry.

215
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,920
So I eat vegetables and some rice after and I'm still a little hungry, but not starving.

216
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,160
Why?

217
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,240
I'm not so hungry like this.

218
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,840
Only one night I was starving and after dinner, two hours later, I'm so hungry I can eat horse.

219
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,680
I am five foot five and almost five foot six and think I'm 14 years old.

220
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:01,920
Whoa.

221
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,960
Five foot six, I think, and I'm 14 years old and six months old.

222
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,200
And half Caucasian and Filipino.

223
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,240
My dad is five and nine.

224
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,760
Okay, wait, I cracked it.

225
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,080
I, my dad is five, nine grand on his side.

226
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,480
Oh God, this fucking question.

227
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,960
Five, nine and mom's side is short.

228
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,000
Frown face.

229
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,800
All caps.

230
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,840
I did experience growing pains in both of my legs two weeks ago from today.

231
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,760
And sadly no growing that night.

232
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,480
Frown.

233
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,280
Only when I was 11, I had them and I grew two inches.

234
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,000
Please.

235
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,040
How tall will I be?

236
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,920
Is it possible to grow like one inch in three to four months?

237
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,240
So that's three inches in a year?

238
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,480
When am I going to go through my adolescence growth spurt?

239
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:42,800
Help.

240
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,040
Wait a minute.

241
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,320
This guy just decided halfway through this question that he didn't like his old question

242
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,520
and he was going to ask a new question and hope none of us noticed.

243
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,880
He took a hard right.

244
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,400
Yeah, he's trying for a twofer.

245
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,720
I ate some burritos and they did not fill me up.

246
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,600
So I switched to veggies and rice and that got me pretty close.

247
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,400
What the fuck?

248
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,240
Also, what's up with my dick hair?

249
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,680
When am I getting that stuff?

250
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:05,920
Help.

251
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,420
Help.

252
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,400
Mail.

253
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:08,720
Mail.

254
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,320
When he says he experienced growing pains but didn't actually grow.

255
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,000
Did he just mean his legs hurt?

256
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,360
Yeah, I think did someone maybe punch you in both of the legs over like a bully?

257
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,240
Are you being bullied?

258
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,040
Maybe you ate too many goddamn Doritos and you got diabetes.

259
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,600
Sage mail.

260
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,120
Do you have arterial blockage in your legs because of all the Doritos?

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,240
There's got to be a problem when you say you are not hungry.

262
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,840
You're like not getting full.

263
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,440
Cool, but then he clearly said that he ate almost a whole bag of Doritos.

264
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,560
So that's really some pretty impressive self-restraint.

265
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,080
But he doesn't say what size bag.

266
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,800
I don't care the size of the bag.

267
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,920
It could be a snack pack.

268
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,760
It could be like a lunch snack pack bag.

269
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,640
Okay, but when he did know what you're not understanding.

270
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,240
He didn't finish the bag and yet he was still hungry.

271
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,440
So why this solution?

272
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,480
There's an easy solution.

273
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,800
Well, maybe he knew his fucking if I had a roommate.

274
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,680
A full first of all, if I had a 14 year old 14.5 year old roommate.

275
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,720
I would be probably arrested.

276
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,640
But second of all, if he finished the whole bag of Doritos that I bought.

277
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,480
I would be fucking furious.

278
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,320
He probably knew that his moms would come home.

279
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,200
And if there was no Doritos bag, she would be pissed off.

280
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,000
She's probably still pretty upset that most of the bag is gone.

281
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,560
But at least there's a little bit of crumbles left over for.

282
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,200
I'm actually impressed with the level of thought process that went through this kid's head.

283
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,760
Because usually we get some real boners.

284
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,040
But this kid at least sat there and said, why had two PBJ sandwiches?

285
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
And I'm almost done with this bag of Doritos.

286
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,960
Maybe I should switch to like vegetables.

287
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,160
Maybe like something that won't, you know, give me diabetes will help.

288
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,040
Yeah, that's pretty clever for a Yahoo answers.

289
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
And even also the bar is real low.

290
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,960
The bar is so low.

291
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:58,080
I like the idea of eating food and there being an instantaneous mechanical response within your

292
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,400
body beyond just like boy in this blob.

293
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,000
I like, yeah, like if this kid ate a licorice jelly bean and turned into a ladder,

294
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
what are you talking about?

295
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,800
Kind of like that, I guess, a little mechanical response.

296
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,480
It's everything that you called for.

297
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,520
I want I want I like the idea of like, you know, you're growing.

298
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:23,040
So you eat like 15 sandwiches and you go to bed and there's a full blown big miracle.

299
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,920
And you wake up the next morning and Tom Hanks and you are like,

300
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,680
I got to write down what I ate.

301
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,720
And then you post on the Internet.

302
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,600
If you want to turn into Tom Hanks is all it takes is 15 sandwiches.

303
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,640
It's got that was actually my favorite episode of man versus food.

304
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,480
I ate 15 pizzas and I turned into a ladder.

305
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,520
What the fuck happened?

306
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,880
This round goes to man.

307
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,400
Does it does this next episode on ladder versus food?

308
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,200
Just stack all the French fries on my rungs.

309
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,560
Here, we got a T-shirt for you for completing this challenge in Europe.

310
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,760
Is it extra ladder?

311
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,320
Can you stretch it?

312
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,640
Can you stretch it over my rung to girth?

313
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,720
Producers, we just got to play this one by ear.

314
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,440
I guess I guess have a pretty lady climb on top of me and just pour all the milkshakes down me.

315
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,440
And we'll see what happens.

316
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,200
Maybe I'll transform into like a I don't know, a horse or something.

317
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,000
And then we can just sort of that's moving, I think, in the right direction.

318
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,120
Maybe the next leap will finally be the leap that takes me home.

319
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,720
I would I would celebrate all the pizzas.

320
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,080
Why haven't I left it to a horse?

321
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,480
Organic entity that could consume would be great for getting a noose.

322
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,600
Another season.

323
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,480
I don't think I'm going to get the season two as a ladder.

324
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,360
How about another question?

325
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,280
My wife and I were listening to Islands in the Stream by country legends,

326
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,800
Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton.

327
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,120
It's a fantastic song, but we're really bothered by the line.

328
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,840
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb.

329
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Help us think of some better lyrics that don't sound like someone has lice.

330
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,960
And that's from Lyrically Challenged Ladies of DC.

331
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,760
There are I don't know this song.

332
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,080
There are you first of all, you are.

333
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,640
Yes, you do.

334
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,040
Second of all, there are children dying in the streets.

335
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,880
There are children.

336
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,360
I could open my window right now and see two or three children just dying.

337
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,800
And this is how you want us to spend.

338
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,040
This is how you want to drain this think tank.

339
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,000
I got a pretty good lyric for you.

340
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,400
Lyrically Challenged Ladies of DC.

341
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,360
You want to hear my lyric?

342
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,640
Syria.

343
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,080
Think about it.

344
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:46,080
think about it see I don't know Justin I think it doesn't rhyme I don't think it

345
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,120
rhymes also it's you're not allowed to just I can install like 14 syllables

346
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,640
into one word Travis you do know this okay Travis have you heard the song

347
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,760
ghetto superstar yes okay have you ever heard Kenny Rogers sing a song like and

348
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,360
you were confused like I didn't know that Kenny Rogers covered this one

349
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:15,680
interesting I said up to get you with what could that possibly look at that I

350
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,720
mean I guess I don't even know what they're maybe they really had that they

351
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,240
really had to sort through the riffraff really had to sort through the

352
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,560
Hammond anchors yeah or maybe they one person one of them died in a car accident

353
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,280
when they went over a cliff and the other one dragged the lake for them and

354
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,520
that's how they found them and then they were brought back to life like in

355
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,640
Corpse Bride or maybe it was like the person shrunk down and was trapped in

356
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,480
Rick Moranis his hair yeah and they were trying to like comb through Rick

357
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,840
Moranis his hair but they had to use really fine tooth combs yet very what's

358
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:56,920
that smell Rick Rick pal we need to talk about your habits I'm saying Rick

359
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,120
Moranis probably has a stinky ass scalp if you if that's if you want to dissect

360
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,960
that goof and I don't I I'm saying to a diet rich in poutine has probably

361
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,200
engraved his scalp with with a substance that's not good to be you know close to

362
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,380
I've never been close to the man but that's just a theory from an olfactory

363
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:22,880
personal factory nose-bound perspective I think the problem with islands in the

364
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,640
stream is that if you're writing a song in 2013 and this is what it lacks this

365
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,400
is why it's not timely you have to have product placement that and and that's

366
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,160
the only way you're gonna be able to pay for Rick Rubin to come in and help you

367
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:43,520
build your sort of rough sketch of an album into the you know a chart topper

368
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:50,960
so maybe something like you should try x-body spray grizzly scent like that's

369
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,360
gonna be that that's gonna be I totally dig this idea but it's gonna be hard to

370
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:02,920
replace every word so like so like maybe we can be like I set out to Pringles

371
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:09,640
with an Xbox one and then you guys are better at this than me cuz all I could

372
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,760
come up with was I said how to get you with a fine-toothed flome and I don't

373
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,120
even think I don't think it's a product that you can buy I mean sure you can

374
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,800
probably buy it on like some weird alternative eBay but you know I read in

375
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,880
Malcolm Gladwell's the tipping point that that kind of thing is all it takes

376
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,720
to really launch a product back into the American consciousness what what product

377
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:39,920
has fallen out of favors like flow I sell that to get you with you you who

378
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:45,880
that's quick strawberry flavor now we're talking okay but now we're not talking

379
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,040
about like profiting in the commercial since now we're pushing our own social

380
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,680
agendas like if it was me it would be more of it was like I set out to get

381
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:59,040
you with some Frank and Barry okay that's that you want it that is the one

382
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,520
product you want to defibrillate if now if you want to push social agendas in

383
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:12,040
the song I'm into that too you get I set out to get you with my gay marriage

384
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:17,960
license that I can get in any state now come on and then the harmony sounds like

385
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,120
a Macklemore song now the harmony could be just to Kenny Rogers's he could just

386
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,200
harmonize with himself and that would be very beautiful I'm into that yeah I'm

387
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:33,080
really into can we do both okay where it's like appeal Doma and eat some

388
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:39,280
tastations now you could be more subversive me and Frank and Barry headed

389
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:47,560
to the chapel this is good this is good cuz I'm gonna marry Frank and Barry who

390
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,320
I'm assuming has male parts down there I don't think you can gender Frank and

391
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:57,760
Barry when I think about Frank and Barry's genitals and God do I his Frank

392
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,880
and Barry that's like 90 minutes out of every day for me don't even try to call

393
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:10,640
Griffin from 1245 to 115 once or is it spread out throughout the day I mean I

394
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:19,760
once I get in the flow once I once I get my noodle going but in both senses of

395
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,480
the phrase I whittled that down too because you have you used to have to

396
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,240
spend six hours a day thinking about Frank various genitals just to consent

397
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,760
like get yourself in the headspace yeah which was tough I wasn't not getting a

398
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,440
lot of sleep back then anyway it's a just fleshy patch just fleshy blank

399
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,880
patch and that's what gets you going you know people never talk about that part

400
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,040
of the creation of Frankenstein's monster because there had to be a night

401
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,760
when someone looked at Victor Frankenstein and he just came back with

402
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,040
a giant bag of dicks I'm going to find the one that fits him perfectly like why

403
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,000
you're really agonized you just grab you grab the set of hands at random they're

404
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,080
both laughs you put like days of R&D into this I like to think that Igor was

405
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,320
actually like super like self homophobic and so he just like went out and like

406
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,120
ah I guess just ah you just like took the first one he saw and like put it in

407
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,000
the back me an abnormal dick Frankenstein was like what the fuck I

408
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,440
just can you just do it like no one's ever gonna no one's gonna want to fuck

409
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,560
this creep can you just take it I will listen I'll do anything else but pick

410
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:37,640
any part I will go harvest it but come on it's a dead dick doc just use this

411
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:43,920

412
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:49,320
decomposition rigor mortis will get you to 24 hours that's it that ship done

413
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:55,600
sailed yeah that's cuz bugs are nasty bugs you nasty so nasty all of them

414
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,840
anyway oh man I grossed myself out let's do a Yahoo hit me also I just want to

415
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,320
say right now before we get the emails I know they talk about Frankenstein's dick

416
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,840
in young Frankenstein you guys you don't have to tell us about it so I've never

417
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,520
seen it that's why I don't watch movies or TV oh you don't spoil the goofs I

418
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,560
well yeah I just want everybody to know that everything comes from my heart this

419
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,840
this Yahoo was sent in by Nicole Harris thank you Nicole it's by Yahoo answers

420
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:27,240
user Riker who asks werewolf question werewolves only my friend says that I

421
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,920
might have been born a werewolf I've always thought of myself to have an

422
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,400
inner wolf I'm just starting to physically shift but I have no memory of

423
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,520
when I shift and how to control it someone please help werewolves only this

424
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,080
question would be way better if they said werewolves only who was that guy

425
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:51,680
that played mr. Feeney on boys werewolves only looking for a werewolf

426
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:57,560
perspective please wasn't the same guy in 1776 hey get the fuck out of here

427
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:02,760
regular old human you me you know the I could help this guy but because he's

428
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,280
being so fucking specious I'm not even going to I mean I can't help him I can

429
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:14,600
weigh in cuz I my so my grandfather was a quarter werewolf so that makes me 116

430
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:23,040
you and fucking Megan Fox man killing me if for me and again my cycle only comes

431
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:32,280
once every 16 full moons my where are you predict it is it is tricky if you

432
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,640
wear it really tight-fitting clothing sometimes it'll just cancel it out also

433
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,680
for some reason a cloud in front of the moon so if you get like a haze machine

434
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,640
recovered yeah so Griffin found the one reminder that Siri refuses to create for

435
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,160
him Siri in 16 months remind me I'm gonna change into a werewolf I'm not

436
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,400
going to do now that's I'm not gonna waste time I'm not gonna waste your time

437
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,160
or mine how does this person know that they're going through the change if they

438
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,920
can't remember the change does it is like they wake up and they're like I

439
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,800
think I was a werewolf well that no they were probably they were watching

440
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:12,240
America's Next Top Model 2.0 boys in the house and fucking like they start

441
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,160
watching it and they get to like the beginning of the first challenge and

442
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,200
then all of a sudden fucking Tyree just kick someone off and they're like what

443
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,320
the fuck there was like 45 minutes there well I don't know what happened and then

444
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,520
they look around and all their pets are dead that part was actually her keys

445
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,360
that would probably be the first I don't even think a werewolf will waste his

446
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,080
fucking time in a parakeet but that would probably be the more telling

447
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:41,320
evidence I gotta know what happened in the fucking photo in the fucking photo

448
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:47,520
shoot also my dog is dead my dog has been eviscerated all right I think the

449
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:57,320
most important thing from this show that so far is that I learned that the new

450
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,360
cycle of America's Next Top Model started which I was not aware yeah

451
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:06,980
started fucking Justin 2.0 they changed the goddamn game boys in the house so

452
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,520
they're boys in the house there are girls in the house too but there's also

453
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:17,640
boys in the house and let's just say things get a little sexy did you sorry

454
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,800
did you hear that I put a little too much smoke in that I've missed a month

455
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,000
that was a little smoky yeah I can describe everything that's happened in

456
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,120
every season so we're in every episode first episode first episode they line

457
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,360
them all up at the top of staircase and they say guys go pick a girl from the

458
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,400
other side walk down the staircase do a pose and that's how they introduce all

459
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,480
the guys and girls to each other this one super fucking fresh dude walks to

460
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,720
the stairs looks at the women shakes his head no this will not do turns around to

461
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,040
the dudes picks a dude walks down the stairs kisses him on the mouth turns to

462
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:56,240
everyone like what's up fucking crowd like just burns the fucking building

463
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,920
down around them just like starts tearing downstairs like the dopest thing

464
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:06,000
I've ever seen fuck it's the fucking dopest moment in reality show history

465
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,040
the other dude the other dude was like straight as an arrow like I don't even

466
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:16,200
fucking care that was the freshest and dopest thing I'll ever be a part of it

467
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,280
is required watching also they've changed the theme song so it does the

468
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,680
wannabe on top a guy's voice comes in and goes boys in the house and it's my

469
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,920
favorite it's it beats out growing pains it beats out full house it beats out

470
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,320
family matters for greatest theme song for greatest TV song I have a wonderful

471
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:45,840
transition into the money

472
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,120
so I'm really from the discovery that I am late on America's next top model but

473
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:58,760
I am not panicking and do you know why why because America's next top model is

474
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:06,480
on Hulu plus don't even worry about it you can watch guys vs. girls America's

maximum fun was that too much no I think it was perfect

531
00:33:51,440 --> 00:34:12,040
I thought you were building to a drop wisdom boys versus girls versus cows

532
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:20,760
cows in the house I just don't think Monica has what it takes that is a

533
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:27,920
fucking seat though that cow just tooched fucking 1.2 tons of booty I have

534
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,640
never seen anything like it the game has changed her udders found the fucking

535
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:37,600
light farm was to see those two cows kissing it was insane farm wisdom is

536
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,960
our regular segment where we bring you real applicable wisdom straight from

537
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,200
farmers and the people that love them or know them here's one from see Dan can I

538
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,880
read can I read it can I read it can I read it I thought you didn't have this

539
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:54,240
in front of you I pulled it up now okay yes Travis go ahead from see Daniels

540
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,840
when some farmers have a branding they not the calves okay sometimes they they

541
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:06,400
will save the testicles and eat them after I've seen this firsthand they

542
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,440
treat them like it's Halloween candy or something that's not like to imagine

543
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:17,560
they do it right in the cab space that is not like not only does that suck it

544
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:22,720
sucks that there's someone out there that calls removing the testicles of a

545
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,760
living thing nut they nut they nutted that calf did they cook that do they

546
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,960
cook is there any preparation because this guy just makes it sound like shink

547
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,560
and then pop like a couple rolos or something no it's like no it's like that

548
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,960
scene in Game of Thrones where the Khaleesi eats the horse's heart it's

549
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,520
very similar back in June I heard a bit of farm wisdom from my dear friend Rita

550
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,240
Mangoli who creates the fantastic comic series today in three panels in fact she

551
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:56,960
memorialized said wisdom in comic form I've attached it here for you the the

552
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,280
wisdom and we're enjoying this delightful comic I guess you guys can't

553
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:06,760
see it but we'll put it where Griffin where we put it a flicker we'll put it

554
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,280
on the forums or we'll tweet it one of those two at MB and BAM by ways us

555
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:18,400
here's the wisdom you can grow a plant that has potatoes as its roots and

556
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:25,280
tomatoes as its fruits that's bullshit that feels to me like something that's

557
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,400
not true that's like the part of that feels to me like an abomination against

558
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,920
God I think it's the plot of the Tamako episode of the Simpsons I can't believe

559
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,160
that this food exists and that this plant fucking exists and that it's not

560
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,720
like the only thing that farmers are planting to double to double their you

561
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,240
know their gains do you think sometimes the plants get it backwards and they

562
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,920
just grow potatoes of their fruits and they get like a bunch of dirty smushed

563
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,080
tomatoes under the ground like yeah you fucking like they cut into their

564
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,840
potatoes and it's just full of like tomato guts or they find like a whole

565
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,280
chicken inside you're like oh god my farm is my farm is starting to

566
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:08,000
desynchronize so that's an amazing fact if true which is almost certainly not

567
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,520
true thank you for the farm wisdom if you want to send us from wisdom or

568
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,720
literally anything else in B and B a.m. at maximum fun if you could combine

569
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,920
address combine two plants what would be and I know you're asking Griffin you're

570
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,640
asking this question because you obviously have an answer and the answer

571
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,840
is yes I do weed and oranges because then you get that juicy orange and

572
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:35,080
that's gonna taste tremendous it's gonna taste a little balmy like it's gonna get

573
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:40,280
a little a little bit of residue on it but otherwise it's a perfectly fine

574
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,760
orange that's it that's perfect for me because the Floridian stoners it

575
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,240
attracts will eat the mosquitoes so it's really great for your garden too yeah

576
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,440
okay bros you've settled the peeing in the shower question but what's your

577
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,400
stance on brushing your teeth in the shower no one does it next question

578
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,320
that's the easy one we don't have to solve it cuz nobody fucking does it in

579
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:02,480
the universe people do it I'm married to someone who has done it oh god like I'm

580
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:09,680
a dare I guess in a hurry it bothers me enough to brush my teeth in the kitchen

581
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,160
sink yeah that's because so out of goddamn place that's where you dump your

582
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,440
fucking french fry oil Travis I know but it feels wrong but like if someone is

583
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,200
using my bathroom like I need to brush my teeth and I want to schedule by the

584
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,080
way don't it's like I should mention don't dump your french fry oil down the

585
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:32,120
sink you're supposed to like take it to Best Buy or something in the front

586
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:36,760
there's laptop battery cell phone batteries French French fry I have a

587
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,160
rule I I would never brush my teeth in the shower because that's where I pee

588
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,960
that's disgusting yeah ah I'm not gonna brush my teeth where I pee I'll see you

589
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,740
might spit like toothpaste on your balls like what are you talking about you're

590
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,880
gonna spit down and the water pressure is gonna push your spit back in your

591
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,040
body and then you're gonna have toothpaste balls and you're gonna know

592
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,960
that you did that you did that and here's the thing you drop your toothbrush

593
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,200
in the sink accidentally oh that's fine you just pick it back up you keep going

594
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,600
you drop your toothbrush in the shower you gotta get a new toothbrush it's a

595
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,760
game changer you think that changes the game what I don't understand the game

596
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,240
because suddenly your toothbrush is touched like the drain where all your

597
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,400
hair goes and like all the water of your filthy life it is the most dangerous game

598
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,000
that it's more dangerous than hunting men on a shipwreck aisle it is a game

599
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,920
where if the drop of a single toothbrush is can mean total and complete calamity

600
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,200
you gotta drive to target after that shit and it's labor if you're into that

601
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:43,960
maybe you like the thrill of the threat yeah maybe you get your hands super

602
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:51,160
super soapy and then what are you doing Jimbo you're on the

603
00:39:51,160 --> 00:40:00,600
edge step back man you're wearing a blindfold what are you doing your balls

604
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:07,320
are covered in toothpaste you're not even in the shower just standing in the

605
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:14,440

00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,120
imagine can you imagine no fuck that a little your little ring bear you put

628
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:04,280
your little ring bear in a box as he walks down the aisle and throws rings

629
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,240
well if it's Metal Gear Solid he'll have to throw like a hundred flying roses

630
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,200
that are sparkling yeah throw those at the holes in the cardboard box he drops

631
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,040
a chaff grenade and your dad who's filming is like hey dude we gotta wait

634
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,880
like a non-lethal approach to his wedding basically if he doesn't want a

635
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:39,560
bunch of guns he wants like the the the more emotional side of Metal Gear yeah

636
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:50,200
Travis have you yourself played a Metal Gear game I've played of it I've been

637
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:57,880
around others whilst they played can you imagine can you imagine how surprised

638
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,120
your bride is gonna be when the doors opens and it turns out she's marrying

639
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:06,200
Raiden that's gonna be such a switch I think only the only thing I have in the

640
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:11,600
chamber for this is a joke about like on the first night of the honeymoon giving

641
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,360
her the old solid snake well that's just like the name of the guy in the thing

642
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,280
but I know but his leg also like a penis that's pretty that's pretty general

643
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,120
try it'd be like if we said they were doing a Jurassic Park theme wedding and

644
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:26,560
you're like what if it was a dinosaur but my joke was like his penis is like a

645
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,640
solid snake well then okay well what if after they had sex 30 times he'd look

646
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:39,640
down at his penis and said boy my dinosaur that's solid goof what is this

647
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,520
series known for I think we can I think the I think we gotta get the ceremony to

648
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,360
last like 12 hours I think it's gonna include a few super esoteric

649
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:54,920
geopolitical messages about you know the nuclear proliferation I think I believe

650
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,160
there are also things about like long-lost brothers that's a given well

651
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,480
genetic cloning I think that there's probably a few fun ways if you could get

652
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:06,240
like twins is your flower girls and then Mario shows up well travel okay well

653
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,840
hold on now you're doing a Smash Brothers theme holy fucking shit it's

654
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,520
crash bandicoot knees objective is it too late to crash when kids never been

655
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:21,440
especially is it too late to alter the theme the super super special no to I

656
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:30,400
mean like to a normal wedding is it too late it's are you so invested in this

657
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,680
you can't jump out now someone's fucking neck is gonna get broken and it's gonna

658
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:42,720
be immersive I guess it's also gonna be pretty felonious and that fans are gonna

659
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,240
be so disappointed when it turns out Kiefer Sutherland is officiating the

660
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:51,320
wedding do you want to say that sentence out loud again and like hear it hear

661
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,800
yourself saying it no you're right that doesn't make any sense no one's ever

662
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,960
walked out of anything going ah fuck turned out it was just keepers that was

663
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,080
just Kiefer Sutherland except for I guess that hotel manager it was cut

664
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:06,440
super drunk and ran and tackled the Christmas tree YouTube it fucking the

665
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:12,580
best the best the best thing second only to the male model picking the guy up off

666
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:16,360
the stairs on the NTN the order is male model picks the other male model number

667
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:20,720
one obviously everyone burned the building down people died because of

668
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,160
that amazing moment number two but they understood why Kiefer Sutherland being

669
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,920
interviewed on camera and the guy was like what's the secret Kiefer he's like

670
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:34,480
you just gonna enjoy life run tackle tree falls Christmas over Christmas

671
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,600
ruined if you if the camera panned like 30 degrees to the right you would see

672
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:46,200
like that male model as a child I'm gonna fucking I'm gonna beat this beat

673
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:51,840
this moment you have raised the game to an unimaginable level so that's gonna do

674
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,280
