1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:44,400
It's a new craze, and good girls do you want it? Just say, hey, I wanna. Just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,200
Hello, everybody. Welcome, my brother, my brother, and me on the advice show for the

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,560
Modron era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,480
I am your middlest brother, and I have been and will always be Travis McElroy.

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,080
I'm your sweet baby brother, and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

10
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:11,280
And folks, we beefed it, didn't we? I will be the first to admit that we beefed it.

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,520
And you mean regarding Laughter and Love? Regarding Laughter and Love, thank you, Travis.

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:24,080
Yes, we've gotten some criticism, I think, over our selection of the motto of the tagline,

13
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,000
whatever you want to call it. And I have actually gathered everybody here today for this press

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:44,080
conference to announce my, I can't, I fucking can't believe I'm saying this, my support for

15
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,880
20 Honey Down to Beastness. And this has never happened before in this year, and this is the

16
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,160
run of the show, that we have endorsed a switcheroonie in the middle of the year. Folks,

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,400
it's fucking June. We're like halfway through this shit. And I'm suggesting a switcheroonie.

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,520
I'm leaning hard into a switcheroonie. Here's the thing about Laughter and Love. It's a good

19
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,720
principle. You should fill it. Fill it right up. Love, especially. Get that in there. It's so

20
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,080
important. Beatles, yes, all about it. But it's a little self-serving, isn't it?

21
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,080
Yep. There's something about Down to Beastness that's like a trumpet declaring like,

22
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,480
let's fucking roll. First, I have two complicating factors. Okay, yes, please. The first is that

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,320
I hate to rename the tour this late into the year. Well, good news.

24
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,800
Yeah, I mean, we've got all the tickets printed, got all the fucking shirts with all the stops on

25
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,400
it. Yeah, man. We hired all the Skyriders. And we have the one-act play about Laughter and Love

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,000
that we wrote to perform at all of our tour stops. I just hate to rename it at this point.

27
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:01,200
For sure. That's huge. Number two is, do you remember when all the businesses

28
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,040
had to shut down and a lot of them are still shut down? That's totally for me bumping.

29
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,680
Well, then you can- Go ahead, Trapp.

30
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,000
If I may, as the- You won't.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,920
Okay. The businesses, right? No, no, I'm sorry. I will draw a line in the sand here. Those are

32
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,680
businesses, Justin. Yeah, that's a different thing.

33
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,040
Those are businesses. Businesses are over there. They're making money or not making money,

34
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,680
whatever the case may be. And we love that or we don't.

35
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,320
Or we don't or whatever. I'm talking about Beezness. And Beezness has to do with both

36
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:40,800
the individual and the hive. So right now, we are all individuals doing our own Beezness,

37
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,840
but also working towards a greater goal as the hive.

38
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,080
A bigger Beezness. A bigger Beezness. A bigger, better Beezness.

39
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,760
And that's important. I think it's also just about, you know how Beez, they go around,

40
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,120
they pick up the pollen and they get it all over themselves and that makes them horny or

41
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,640
something like that. And then they take it back to the hive and they vibrate so violently and

42
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,240
it makes all the pollen go off and then the queen eats it to make honey out of her butt.

43
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,240
I think that down to Beezness recommends like a sort of like shedding, like a vibrating and

44
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,280
getting off complacency. Yeah.

45
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,440
This is fair. This is fair. You know what Beez don't do? They don't rest on their laurels.

46
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,360
They can't. They can't. They're too little. You've complicated this because Beez,

47
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,640
I think at some point it would be beneficial for them to rest on laurels just so the various

48
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,960
pollination things that need to happen. Do you know what I mean? Like resting on laurels

49
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,040
occasionally for them is probably essential. So they probably do rest on laurels.

50
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,960
Let me put it another way then about the Beez. Here's the thing. The Beez,

51
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,800
they're minding their own, if I may, Beezness, right? And if you fuck with them,

52
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,080
you're going to get that sting. You're going to get stung.

53
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,760
That's absolutely wild, Travis. The thing you said to me that they're minding their own business

54
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,640
is absolutely wild. These monstrous things are flying around fucking plants and stinging toddlers

55
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,920
every single day. It is what they are known for. They're making movies about it. They crave it.

56
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,520
They crave interaction with us. They love interfacing with humans so much they made

57
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,480
their jizz taste good. Come on now. It's a trap.

58
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,760
It is, to Justin's point, a literal honeypot. Thank you. Well, perhaps then there was a time,

59
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,240
do you think there was a time where Beez were like, listen, if we poke people with our butts,

60
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,440
we die. We all know that. That is scientific fact. And so we have been reluctant to sting

61
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,480
people with our butts. But the time has come. We need to start stinging people with our butts.

62
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,560
And listen, we were going to leave them alone if they left us alone, but they did not leave us

63
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,800
alone. And we don't want to sting people with our butts. We don't want to. Okay. You did not address

64
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,240
any of my salient points. And this is classic, classic oratory style from you, Travis, to think

65
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,840
that you can get away with this because you have not addressed my chief complaints. They're totally

66
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:16,720
in our business now. Okay. But I'm saying you're the one who said we take their butt jizz and we

67
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,120
eat it on our toast. We're so far from it, aren't we? What if somebody did that? What if I was making

68
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,800
a sandwich and a giant said, okay, great. And peeled up my roof and scraped that sandwich out

69
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,120
of my house to eat it on his bigger sandwich. And this is a sandwich that you have made from

70
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,600
your own jizz. Well, listen, we don't need to carry it that far. You nasty, nasty boy. I don't

71
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,720
understand why we need to go that far with the metaphor. I'm just saying I work hard to make

72
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,160
a sandwich. You have to work hard if you're going to make a jizz sandwich. Listen, we don't have to

73
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,280
carry the metaphor that far. The metaphor has poisoned this episode so far. This is all I'm

74
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:07,200
saying. The shit is changing right now. Shit is revolutionary. And it's important to get in there.

75
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,560
It's important to march, support Black Lives Matter, do whatever you can. And I don't want to

76
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,960
be out here with, I'm sorry, my dick in my hand screaming, but also fill your life with laughter

77
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,280
and love. There's just no way. There's just no way. Fight against police brutality, defund the police,

78
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,400
and also while you're at it, here's a cross dish that says fill your life with laughter and love.

79
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,480
No fucking thank you. Doesn't feel right. I just want to, I don't understand the way this works,

80
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:42,480
where if we have settled on a theme for the year. Yeah. And we, and two of you say let's change it.

81
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,960
Is that just it? Is it a majority vote or is this like? Fuck man, I mean. Because it does raise the

82
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,800
question, if we have the ability to do this, it does raise the question of 2016. We had a cherry

83
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,120
seven weeks there at the tail end where we could have been like, listen, these bridges ain't getting

84
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,000
built. No 2016. We're changing it to 2016. Yeah. Well, I think it is important to note we haven't

85
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,920
finished the second quarter of the year yet, right? So I think we're still, like if you're,

86
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:18,960
just mathematically, there are still more year left than isn't. So I think we can change it.

87
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,400
I think that after we pass the end of June, we would have missed the window. Yeah. And it's

88
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,080
going to be too tough for us to come up with a third, even more appropriate slogan. Like I think

89
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,720
all three of us can get on the same page there. That's fucking unthinkable. The emotional toll

90
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,680
that goes into slogan generation is like not repeatable. We almost didn't survive the first

91
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,800
time. And maybe, maybe man, God willing, we'll get to a point where maybe we can get back to

92
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,160
focusing on laughter and love, right? Maybe that will be a fourth quarter slogan. 2021. Let's try

93
00:08:52,160 --> 00:09:02,640
again. 2021-y funny. I will grant you this. The speed at which things seem to be moving

94
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:10,480
currently does make the idea that we could sort of encapsulate 12 months of existence on this

95
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:21,600
particular plane unthinkable. The height of hubris, honestly. Yeah. I was going to suggest monthly,

96
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:33,440
but even weekly, let's just say this week. Do you know how wild it is that there have been

97
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,920
several times in the past week to 10 days where I've been talking to someone and been like,

98
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,960
oh, right, there's a global pandemic that's shutting shit. Like that I have to remember

99
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:53,760
about how the planet is sick. Yeah. Wild, wild times. Are we doing this? I mean, are we doing

100
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,440
this? I'm into it if you guys are, but like, I want to make sure that this is, you can't walk

101
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,280
it back because of what I don't want is like, I've always felt pretty good about punks a tiny

102
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,440
Phil style. We make the call. That's the call. Right. And no one else gets to weigh in on it.

103
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,560
I don't want people to think that this is a sort of, you know, submit ticket and we'll review it to

104
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,240
see if we change the year. No, I think that this is perhaps the most special of circumstances

105
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,520
one could possibly imagine. Special is a fucking word for it. Yeah. We're not going to make a habit

106
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:37,840
out of this, but we shit our pants. Yeah. We shit our pants. And I don't want to sit in these shitty

107
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:47,600
pants for 12 months. There's no way. We are now so consistent at getting it wrong. Yeah. That I'm

108
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,680
starting to think next year we should title it, watch your house burn down as your infant daughter

109
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,920
cries. And that way that won't happen to anybody. Like that will guaranteed not happen. Yeah.

110
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,560
Right. I think if we did, we could even make it like 2021. I'm not going to win a brand new

111
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,880
Kia Sorento over a radio contest. And then I, and then it will happen and I will have one,

112
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,640
but I think it is 2020, 20 honey down to business. So yes. Okay. Well, I'm,

113
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:27,520
I think it's official. Let's call it 2020. Okay. I do have a question. We'll call the press.

114
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,560
You were going to say president. No, let's do that. Let's dial him up.

115
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,960
Um, I, I do want, can we, you can actually call the white house.

116
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,400
You can? I think you could just call the white house.

117
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,480
Well, let's do, I have a few complaints. I'd love to register. Um, I thought it's been pretty

118
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,320
smooth sailing. I disagree. It's been quite bad. Okay. You can write a letter to the president

119
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,160
that takes forever. No, thanks. No sending gifts. Why would I do that? I don't even like the fella.

120
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:04,800
Oh, come on. Uh, okay. Comments. The, okay. I have the number to call the white house with comments.

121
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,160
Oh boy. I guess the white house. Can you dial them in on Skype and we'll just let them know

122
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,680
we're changing the year. Um, I'll just, I'll just do, uh, speakerphone. Will that work?

123
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,800
Yes. That's good. Will you hear all of us or? Well, Justin, you could speak for, as the eldest,

124
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,320
I'll let you speak for us. I'll speak for you guys. Yeah. You can hear, you'll be able to hear

125
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,000
them and we can do it like a, like a funny Ellen show thing where like we tell you what you have

126
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,400
to say. No, I don't think I'll probably do that. That'd be really cool. Okay. Uh, everybody shut

127
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,680
up. Call the president right now. Okay. Tell him to eat shit. Also say that if it comes up.

128
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,400
Thank you for calling the white house comment line. The office is temporarily closed.

129
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,720

for the Trump administration when they realized they could just close the comment office? Oh wait,

135
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,440
we don't want to listen to what anybody says. Nobody seems to dig it. We could just close it.

136

Oh yeah. Do that. Hey, should I just tweet at him? No, no, that's not it. Listen, I'm on the

138
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:57,280
Hey, we're changing the slogan to the business one. Also suck the farts right out of the bottom

00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:09,040
of my shorts. You fucking dipshit. And I'm going to send that right now. Okay. Oh, it needs a valid

140
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,760
phone number. Uh, juice, can I put yours? Oh, do we start the Google number? Do we start the,

141
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,000
my brother, it's fine. I submit it. I just typed in eight a bunch of times. So if that is your phone

142
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,400
number, I apologize. So should we do the show now? This is the show. Look around you. This is show.

143
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,280
It's strange to be doing this show in the midst of these, of these challenging times,

144
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:37,680
but we hope you all are, uh, are doing well and keeping safe and staying involved and getting it

145
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:44,160
down to fucking business. Doesn't that feel right? Okay. But here's one question. Is it retroactive

146
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,200
or was this year themed failure, fling after in love, and then changed on June? We have to

147
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,320
acknowledge the change. Like there's no way we can sweep that. We're not trying to gas.

148
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,320
Unless we're going to go back and edit a bunch of podcasts, which we're too lazy to do.

149
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,920
Yeah. There's no way. Okay. Now we have started, let me just say for future,

150
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,720
we have started doing dynamic ads on the adventure zone. What if we started doing dynamic

151
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,720
year themes? That could be fun. That's smart. Very smart. Sadly, I had to move out of my apartment

152
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,040
last month. While moving out, I was carrying a blender to my car when I passed my landlord who

153
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,520
said, wow, you really liked that blender, huh? I was confused and just replied, yep. Now a month

154
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,440
later, it's only just occurred to me, this is not my blender and is actually my landlord said he

155
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,360
lent to us. Should I give it back? It's been so long and I actually do really like this blender.

156
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:40,960
That's from Blender Burglar in BC. Hachi Machi. Hachi. That's it is, wow. Wow. That's rough.

157
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:47,200
Many thoughts. Oh, good. Let's enumerate them for us middle brother. First broad thought,

158
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:53,040
just to address one thing right there in the middle. It's been so long. I do not know if you

159
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,360
take something from someone that there's a length of time. I think we might have discussed this

160
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,560
before. There's not a length of time that you own it before it is not stolen anymore.

161
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:10,480
No, it's always stolen, yes. It's always stolen. That said, there does seem to be an implied,

162
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,800
like the landlord said, you must really like that blender and not, hey, give me my fucking blender

163
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:27,760
back. Well, I mean, I feel like, wow, you really like that blender, huh? Got the job done for 99%

164
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,880
of people who heard it. Most people who hear that would have the fucking neuron fire in their brain

165
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,160
that would go like, oh fuck, I stole this. This is a very special edge case where they're like,

166
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,560
wow, what a great blender compliment, which does not exist. Can you imagine what went through that

167
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:51,920
landlord's head when you just replied, yep. What's your relationship with your landlord like where

168
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,400
you're like, damn, we got a lot of frozen strawberries and some yogurt and some almond

169
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:02,160
milk. Let's make some fucking strawberry smoothies up in this shit. Uh oh, we don't have a blender.

170
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,960
It's cool. I know a guy. It's my landlord. I'll just go hit them up for a blender really quick.

171
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,840
What? It is, yeah, okay. I want to go back. I need to flash back to the inception of this.

172
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:22,320
Did you think that you would go to your landlord and say, do you have a spare blender? And anyone

173
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:28,000
would say, yes, I do have a spare blender. That's wild already. How did that even come up in

174
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,480
conversation? Because everybody's got the one blender that they use. Did it come with the

175
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,560
apartment? Because if so, there are many things that come with the apartment that you can't take

176
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:43,760
with you. So your insane landlord was like, hey, look, better yet, this place is furnished and it's

177
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,440
just one blender on the counter. It is possible that maybe the landlord just got married and so

178
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,040
they do have a lot of blenders. Oh. Or it could just be that they- Fucking inverse though,

179
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:00,160
inverse though. Your landlord comes down, knocks on your door. Hey, random shot in the dark,

180
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,920
y'all don't need a blender, do you? Because I got a spare. And I'm just going door to door asking

181
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:12,480
if anyone needs a blender. You say that, my man, but I've had a lot of landlords and at least two

182
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,200
of them would have done that. Yeah. I had a landlord that would come by often and just knock

183
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,120
and be like, do you guys need anything? Because they managed a bunch of properties and people

184
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,840
would leave stuff places. And then they'd be like, somebody left a microwave, do you guys,

185
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,600
what's your microwave situation like? And it's like, I don't know. They were weirdly involved

186
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,560
in our whole deal. They came and were like, do you want me to plant tomatoes for you?

187
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,400
And I was like, no, they'll die. I'm not going to care for those things.

188
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,280
If anyone, if this person needed a blender, if they were kind of a blender person,

189
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,440
and everybody knows, they would, they have to have replaced it by this point. And at that,

190
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,320
then what you're doing, if you try to return it, what you're doing is like,

191
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,440
you have two blenders now. This is your problem. It's a victimless crime. Now, let me say real

192
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,240
quick, the person- That it's not a victimless crime.

193
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,760
The person, well, the person- No, by definition, we know,

194
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,600
Griffin, we in fact know who the victim is that is described in the question.

195
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,160
Let me just say this though. Let me get this out there. Knowing landlords,

196
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,600
and every landlord I've ever had, and every landlord that exists on the planet, I bet if

197
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:27,360
you close your eyes and think real hard, you could think of some way, some thing they have done that

198
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,520
you can now frame this act as one of justice and frame yourself like the Scarlet Pimpernel

199
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,360
liberating blenders from crooked landlords all across this great nation of ours.

200
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:46,320
Mm. Whether it's a disagreement about security deposit or they yelled at you because you're

201
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,160
playing rock band too loud, whatever the fuck it is, I think you probably could come up with

202
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,640
some justification for this. Yes? Now, I do have a solution. If you are just

203
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,920
ed up with guilt and you need to return this blender, but you don't want to do it face to

204
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:11,280
face or anything that acknowledges that you mindfully took this blender, I'm going to give

205
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:21,440
you three words. Brave little toaster. You need to do a job to make it seem like the blender has

206
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:28,320
escaped your house and made it back to the landlord's house, the landlord that they love so

207
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:36,000
much that maybe it's a blender and like a little radio and maybe an electric blanket and a desk

208
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,960
lamp and they have all made it back to see the landlord master, which by the way, in that show,

209
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,400
they called the guy master. It's very weird. It's not great.

210
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:55,680
But now the brave little blender has returned and hey, so there's a second brave little toaster

211
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:01,680
movie. Is this going somewhere? It is. But there's another sequel to brave little toaster where the

212
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:08,400
brave little toaster and friends are able to communicate with animals. And now this crosses

213
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,040
into a lot of questionable kind of science where I can accept that the toaster and the radio and

214
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,360
the lamp and the vacuum and the electric blanket can all talk to each other, but now they can also

215
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:27,040
talk to monkeys and dogs and cats and like mice and rats. This fucking unhinged screed that you

216
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,880
have deviated. It was like you just did a magic trick to me, Travis, because I don't know where

217
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,120
it fucking flipped. It's hard enough to wrap my mind around the fact that cats and dogs and rats

218
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:44,000
and stuff can communicate. Don't get me wrong. Your protests against this movie franchise are

219
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,480
well understood. And there's a lot of meat there for us to dig our teeth into. They went to fucking

220
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,960
Mars at one point. They flew there on a ceiling fan. Get fucking real, brave little toaster. We're

221
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,400
out here trying to do stuff. But also, Travis, ostensibly, this is an advice show. And we were

222
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,480
talking about a thing and you turned it into a- Yeah, but we finished that. And I want to talk

223
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,720
about brave little toaster. Okay, interesting. How does a brave little toaster talk to a dog?

224
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,480
Please. With fucking magic. Why is it alive? It shouldn't be alive. All toasters are dead.

225
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,520
If the master sees the brave little toaster move, does the brave little toaster die?

226
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,400
All toasters, ceiling fans, electric blankets are dead. Next question.

227
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,920
I have an additional question. If the brave little toaster dies, is it then just a toaster?

228
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,880
Good question. Well, you would think that if it dies, it ceases to make toast, right?

229
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,320
Okay. Because if my body dies, I don't keep making things with my body, right?

230
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,720
Well, then again, some people do evacuate their bowels after death, so maybe.

231
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,920
Let's stop it. Stop it.

232
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,440
If he dies, you get one last good toast out of his face.

233
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,960
Okay. If he dies from toast, he goes and finishes up.

234
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,120
He does get one more toast. From radiant heat.

235
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,560
Let's put a button on it. Here's what to do to get out of this situation.

236
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,840
Nothing. Fucking chill on the smooth tip. You're good. Free toaster. Enjoy.

237
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,760
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Graham Roebuck. It was a blender. The toaster was the whole-

238
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,640
Fuck. You fucking ruined me, Travis.

239
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:16,320
It's from anonymous Yahoo Answers user, who I am going to call the brave little toaster,

240
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,960
who asks how to make iPod.

241
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,160
I've been getting into crafts, and I think we're all into crafts these days,

242
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,200
just sort of to keep ourselves busy during this quarantine.

243
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,960
I've been doing hard candy, juice. I know you built a wood bench,

244
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,880
which is so fucking off brand.

245
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,320
My brand has gotten pretty fucked up lately.

246
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,000
I think all of our brands are fucked up. I did sourdough.

247
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,560
Travis is doing sourdough. The brands are toast.

248
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,520
I was eyeing different kinds of jigsaw blades last night.

249
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,160
Fantasizing about owning a lighter array.

250
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,120
You got a Sawzall? Sawzall will make you feel powerful.

251
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,120
Okay, we can't. We can't. We fucking can't.

252
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,600
But how do you make an iPod? Because that would be pretty cool if you could just do that.

253
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,120
Like people are going to Apple stores, I guess, and spending a bunch of money on things.

254
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,720
And it would be cool, like a nice cost-saving measure,

255
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,880
if you could just make an iPod at home.

256
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,920
So I'm wondering if we could have, we're all pretty crafty.

257
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,360
I don't know how making hard candy is going to be helpful.

258
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,960
Well, you can make a candy iPod.

259
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,880
I guess you could, huh?

260
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:25,840
Yeah.

261
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,720
Justin, are you Googling how to make a-

262
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,800
Not a functional one. I mean, by the definition.

263
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,400
Well, what's functional? You know, like place music. Oh.

264
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,120
That's a good, actually, that's a great metric for iPod.

265
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,000
That's a great metric. When I'm judging iPod,

266
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,720
I like to look at it and see if it can play some of my favorite tunes.

267
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,360
That's fair. Okay, that is a good point.

268
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,560
Now what about like an iPod Touch? iPod Touch will do a bunch of different things,

269
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,080
not just music at that point.

270
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,160
What if you got an iPhone and then removed the SIM card?

271
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,200
Now you've got an iPod.

272
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,480
That's one way of going about it. I will give you that one, Travis.

273
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,080
It would have to be a pretty old iPhone.

274
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,080
Nope, you can still connect it to Wi-Fi. That's nothing.

275
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,760
I want to make a fucking iPod, Travis.

276
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,560
Okay.

277
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,320
I want to make an iPod that I can listen to-

278
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,880
I want to listen to Twenty One Pilots, my very favorite band on it.

279
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,240
So it's got to be an iPod.

280
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,480
Here's the loophole. I've just figured out the loophole.

281
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:16,800
Okay.

282
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,320
Does it have to be iPod-sized?

283
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,080
Where the fuck are you going with this?

284
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,800
Well, if I could build like a big box,

285
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,000
you could probably go around your house and find like a Walkman

286
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,160
that you've got and like an old camera and a bunch of stuff.

287
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,880
And if I can make it like two foot by four foot,

288
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,120
I could probably like attach all those things in there.

289
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,880
This is Travis's iPod.

290
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,160
This is my iPod.

291
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,160
A lot of people are talking about form factor, the smooth bevel.

292
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,080
Fuck that. This is Travis's iPod.

293
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,080
It's got all kinds of technology in there.

294
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,800
It weighs 130 pounds.

295
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,000
Is it made of cardboard? Yes.

296
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,840
Is there a button on it that I drew on it with marker

297
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,440
that when you press it, you reach your hand inside

298
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,280
and you grab some fruit snacks I hid in there?

299
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,360
Also, yes, but your phone can't fucking do that.

300
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,040
This is Travis's iPod.

301
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,240
I call that Fruit Ninja.

302
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,560
This is a fun bit.

303
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Justin, you've been furiously Googling something.

304
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,480
I would love to know what it was.

305
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,760
I'm not Googling anything.

306
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,920
If we could have made an iPod out of the primitive materials

307
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:27,120
and tools and crafts that we as a species have possessed

308
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,480
for millennia, we would have done it, right?

309
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,920
We would have done it.

310
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,480
We didn't have the things that we needed,

311
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,080
the different things that are in it.

312
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,520
Do you know what I'm saying right now?

313
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,680
There's a hole for the earplugs that does the click.

314
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,480
You're not going to do that on your iPod.

315
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,840
Yeah, but here's the thing, Justin.

316
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,760
You're not even going to do the one whole part.

317
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,160
Steve Jobs made an iPod by himself.

318
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,800
Yes, but I'm not saying he would make the iPod now,

319
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,720
but he made the first iPod with stuff around his house.

320
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,840
It would be so fucking cherry if Steve Jobs was alive

321
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,920
so you could get it and be like,

322
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,640
all right, all right, big man.

323
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,720
You think you're so cool?

324
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,480
Build another one with just the things in my house.

325
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,160
It's a fun new clue.

326
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,920
This week on Junkyard Wars,

327
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,600
we have to take apart my fucking speak and spell

328
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,440
and turn it into a functioning iPod, Steve.

329
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,840
I think I could make an iPod.

330
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,840
I think Travis could make an iPod.

331
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,520
In what sense would it be an iPod?

332
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,960
Well, it would function as an iPod.

333
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,560
Now, here's what I would need.

334
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,640
Here are the parts I would need.

335
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,720
Some other iPods.

336
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,800
This is, no, I won't accept that.

337
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,240
No, no, no, listen, hear me out.

338
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,400
One to take apart to see how it works.

339
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,360
Okay, a burn.

340
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,720
And one to listen to music while I build the other one.

341
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,440
Because I don't want to sit there in silence

342
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,040
while I build a new iPod.

343
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,480
Yeah, and it is the only way to listen to music.

344
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,120
What are you going to do?

345
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,200
Have the band 21 Pilots come to your house

346
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,680
and rock for you while you build it?

347
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,960
What if that's the new iPod?

348
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,880
We just take it into the meat space.

349
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,480
And what it is is you just have a bunch of bands

350
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,320
living in your house, a bunch of musicians.

351
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,240
That's good for the global pandemic.

352
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,920
Go ahead, Trav, and keep saying this.

353
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,760
And then I just yell out loud,

354
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,520
I want to hear 3 a.m.

355
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,600
And Matchbox 20 comes down and plays the songs 3 a.m.

356
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,000
Or I yell like, I want to hear Bent.

357
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,480
And Matchbox 20 comes down and plays Bent.

358
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,560
What?

359
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,120
It sounds like you just kind of want to live with Matchbox 20.

360
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,120
And I'm not even sure Matchbox 20 wants to live with Matchbox 20, Trav.

361
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,120
Well, okay, fine.

362
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,280
Then it's just, oh no, Rob Johnson.

363
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,120
In that millisecond, you cease to be Travis Mako.

364
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,960
In that like second and a half, you were-

365
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,400
I don't even think that's his name.

366
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,040
You were Todd Burnsley or something like that.

367
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,880
You were not Travis Mako in that second and a half.

368
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,360
Rob Thomas.

369
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,040
What did you say?

370
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,560
I said Rob Johnson, which I think was a local news anchor.

371
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,680
Yeah, WSAC's own Rob Johnson, who once helped us get a kite out of a tree.

372
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,240
Thank you, Rob, if you're listening.

373
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,640
Rob Johnson does listen sometimes.

374
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,920
Rob Johnson did come to a show in Indianapolis once.

375
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,240
He is a morning news anchor for WSAC who once helped us get a kite out of a tree.

376
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,760
If you would, please tweet at WSAC Rob Johnson

377
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,280
and thank him for getting the McElroy brothers kite out of the tree that one time.

378
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,720
It was a badass kite.

379
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,640
And then tweet at Rob Thomas and see if he would like to live with me.

380
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,200
Yeah, Trav's been looking for a roommate.

381
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,920
He's been looking to expand the circle a little bit

382
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,400
and he knows Rob Thomas has been locking it the fuck up.

383
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,880
And I will name the room that he lives in the iPod.

384
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,800
I'm just looking at Rob Johnson's Twitter feed

385
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,480
to make sure everything is fine.

386
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,160
How we looking, how we looking, Rob?

387
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,000
In 2020, everything's doing good.

388
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,600
It's all local news stories.

389
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,480
I will say there's a tweet from June 4th where he says,

390
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,400
WSAC and the CW are both having serious technical difficulties right now.

391
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,520
Not sure what's happening.

392
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,120
Our engineers are working on it.

393
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,480
So I guess Rob has been out of the reporting game for a little bit

394
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
since he can't get to the bottom of the case

395
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,200
of what's happening at the radio of the TV station he works at.

396
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,600
Rob, you get back on your grind,

397
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,520
but I do appreciate you getting the kite out of the tree.

398
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,160
Thank you for that.

399
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,560
Fuck.

400
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,320
No, I want him to know I appreciate him.

401
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,280
He'll get a kick out of that.

402
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,680
Okay.

403
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,280
He'll get a big kick out of it.

404
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,840
I went actually, as long as we're just telling stories

405
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,040
of the impact of living here in Huntington, West Virginia.

406
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,260
Were we?

407
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,640
Yeah, because I was talking about Rob Johnson.

408
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,520
And I went into Jolly Pirate Donuts on Saturday

409
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,560
and the owner's son was there at the counter

410
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,080
and he said, my dad loved when you guys talked about his Facebook

411
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,600
posting, but my mom thought maybe you were making fun of him.

412
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,360
I said, I'm not making fun of him.

413
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,080
He put no baby beats the old man on the Facebook page

414
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,760
next to a picture of donuts he made.

415
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,760
And he continues to put up dope shit constantly.

416
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,840
It's a premium follow if you haven't gotten on board

417
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,000
with Jolly Pirate Donuts Facebook page yet.

418
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,920
I said, no, don't change a thing.

419
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,880
Please, I'm begging you.

420
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,320
But his dad is now a big fan, even though he couldn't tell

421
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,360
if we're making fun of him or not.

422
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,000
So I want to clarify, no baby beats the old man

423
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,160
and your donuts are so on point.

424
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,960
They're so, so good.

425
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,520
Thank you.

426
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,760
And if you're in there already, get a Euro.

427
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,800
They're delicious.

428
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,280
Real quick, before we go to the money zone,

429
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,160
we are going to be donating our ad revenue

430
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,240
for the rest of June to various causes

431
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,880
that are supporting Black Lives Matter,

432
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,480
fighting against police brutality, supporting

433
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,320
Black neighborhoods and Black voices.

434
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,360
And we encourage you to do the same.

435
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,760
Things are changing in the light of these protests,

436
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,240
mostly for the better.

437
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,560
And that is extremely encouraging, but stay active.

438
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,600
And so, yeah, this week we are donating our ad revenue

439
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,520
to Black Lives Matter National.

440
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,560
We'll be tweeting out links.

441
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,160
Obviously, they are at the forefront of this cause.

442
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,880
And have been for as long as Black Lives Matter

443
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,320
has been around.

444
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,840
So yeah, we'll have links out for you to support them.

445
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,520
But the ads you're about to hear

446
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,720
are going to go directly to them.

447
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,000
So with that said, let's go to the fricking money zone.

448
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:38,960
I mean, you still got to send letters, don't you?

449
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,440
You still got to send packages.

450
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,480
You still got to send parcels and boxes and envelopes

451
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,760
and all kinds of things, don't you?

452
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,440
What about sacks of stuff?

453
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,040
Sacks of stuff, thank you, Travis.

454
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,200
You need to send all this stuff, but what are you going to do?

455
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,320
Fan mail.

456
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,200
Yeah, what are you going to do?

457
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,120
Go to the post office where there's a bunch of crowds

458
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,440
and expose yourself potentially to COVID-19?

459
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,480
No, thank you.

460
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,760
No, listen, I need to send these fan mails,

461
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,760
but I don't want to get the COVIDs because of the fan mails.

That's stamps.com, enter my brother.

485
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,480
Stay safe, my friends.

486
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,880
When I'm listening to my Rob Thomas beat,

487
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,200
Rob Thomas solo work, Rob Thomas and Carlos Santana,

488
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,160
Rob Thomas and Matchbox 20 or whatever,

489
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,240
I know that not everybody wants to hear

490
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,320
the musical stylings of Rob Thomas.

491
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,160
Some people, their hearts are hardened.

492
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,280
And when that happens, I'm going to put on my headphones.

493
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,720
Now I know what you're wondering.

494
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,480
Big clunky headphones with wires that get caught on?

495
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,120
No.

496
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,880
Well, that's what I wear.

497
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,720
I'm nerd dingus.

498
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,240
You're a nerd dingus.

499
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,520
I'm going to wear cool wireless earbuds

500
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,160
and here's the thing, they're comfortable.

501
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,800
Oh, and now I know what else you're thinking.

502
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,240
Oh, are you going to spend hundreds of dollars on a piece?

503
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:40,720
Wow.

504
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,920
No, grow up.

505
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,560
I'm talking about Raycon earbuds.

506
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,320
They start at about half the price

507
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,200
of any other premium wireless earbuds on the market

508
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,360
and they sound just as amazing as other top audio brands.

509
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,160
Their newest model, the Everyday E25 earbuds,

510
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,440
offer six hours of playtime, seamless Bluetooth pairing,

511
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,360
more bass and a more compact design

512
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,760
that gives you a nice noise isolating fit.

513
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
And like I said, they're very comfortable.

514
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,240
Sometimes with the earbuds, they fall out on my ears.

515
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,440
There it is, I said it.

516
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,920
They fall out on my ears, they're uncomfortable.

517
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,800
I had, I was wearing the earbuds,

518
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,160
I was doing the dishes, fell right out.

519
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,440
Fell right out into the dishwasher.

520
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,440
I'm going to barf, Trav, that sucks, man.

521
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,880
But now with Raycon, it fits comfortably and it's in there.

522
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,080
And they cost less, so if they fall in,

523
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,640
you're like, fuck it, fire up the disposal by another one.

524
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,760
This is what I'm saying.

525
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,440
So now's the time to get the latest and greatest from Raycon.

526
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,440
Get 15% off your order at buyraycon.com slash my brother.

527
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,360

528
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,160
for 15% off Raycon wireless earbuds,

529
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,520
buyraycon.com slash my brother.

530
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,560
Every day, statistics show that at least one new website

531
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,000
enters the internet.

532
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,200
And when you see it and you're like, whoa, another one,

533
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,720
where, who is making these?

534
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,280
And maybe it's a website from a furniture maker

535
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,160
or a sports team or an athlete, spa, nutritionist,

536
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,800
restaurant, artist, architects, whatever.

537
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,760
Whoever the website is from, you're like,

538
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,040
how did they make a website?

539
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,320
Because this isn't a website for a website maker.

540
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,840
That can be very confusing.

541
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
But there's a good chance that they're harnessing

542
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,960
the power of Squarespace to make their dreams into reality.

543
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,160
Squarespace helps you to make a beautiful website

544
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,600
that can showcase your work, sell your products and services,

545
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,440
promote your physical or online business.

546
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,080
And it's all with beautiful customizable templates

547
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,200
created by world-class designers.

548
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,040
And there's free and secure hosting

549
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,880
and nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

550
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,640
So if you want to get going, get your ideas out there,

551
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,040
you don't have to be a web designer

552
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,880
to have a great looking website.

553
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,760
You just need Squarespace.

554
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,640
So go to squarespace.com slash my brother

555
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,240

559
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,480
I'm just real quick, Justin, just checking in.

560
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,840
If I am a web designer, can I still use Squarespace?

561
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,360
Yeah, I honestly felt like that was really hostile

562
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,080
towards web designers.

563
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,480
Yeah, I'm just wondering if I am a web designer,

564
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,920
am I still allowed to use it?

565
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,560
Like you really pulled their pants down

566
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,320
and showed their ass to everybody.

567
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,920
I left when you guys started this to go use Squarespace.

568
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,520
Okay, I guess I'm just wondering,

569
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,000
I guess I'm just wondering because I'd like to,

570
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,400
I'd still like to use it if I could.

571
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,600
And as you know, I went to web designer college

572
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,600
and got really good at web designing.

573
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,720
And are you just saying that he's a dipshit now, I guess?

574
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,960
Yeah, it kind of seemed like you thought

575
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,840
my whole web designer degree was like a fart.

576
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,440
It doesn't make any sense to me.

577
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,360
Do I hear a little puppers barking in the background?

578
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,440
Yeah, it's because she's a web designer too.

579
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,080
Tell me about that puppers toe beads.

580
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,560
Hey, I'm Jared Hill, co-host of the brand new

581
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Maximum Fun podcast, Fantai.

582
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,160
And I'm Travelle Anderson.

583
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,320
I'm the other more fabulous co-host.

584
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,080
And the reason you really should be tuning in.

585
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,440
I feel the nausea rising.

586
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,560
To be Fantai is to be a big fan of something,

587
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,960
but also have some challenging or anti-feelings toward it.

588
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,080
Kind of like Kanye.

589
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,520
We're all fans of Kanye.

590
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
He's a musical genius, but like, you know.

591
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,720
He thinks slavery is a choice.

592
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,480
Or like the real Housewives of Atlanta.

593
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,800
Like I love the drama, but do I want to see Black women?

594
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,160
I love the drama, but do I want to see Black women

595
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,040
fighting each other on screen?

596
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,560
We're tackling all of those complex

597
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,400
and complicated conversations about the people,

598
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,920
places and things that we love.

599
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,560
Even though they may not love us back.

600
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,880
Fantai, Maximum Fun podcast.

601
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Do you have a munch quad or anything like that?

602
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,800
I'd love to do that for you, Griffin.

603
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,200
Uh, Griff, do you have a Yahoo?

604
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,160
Well, now hold on.

605
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,520
This seems, it's not, yeah, this is the worst trap.

606
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,760
It's like if, if, if, if Charlie Brown said to Lucy,

607
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,480
Hey, do you want to play the, are you going to pull the football away?

608
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,400
She was like, yeah, I'm going to pull the football away.

609
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,520
Do you want to come kick this football?

610
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,240
All right, nevermind.

611
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,880
I'll do Yahoo.

612
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,680
All right, coward.

613
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:28,400
I want to munch squad.

614
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,320
Justin has a munch squad to do.

615
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:30,720
Okay.

616
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,880
That went in a sort of Southern rock direction.

617
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,280
I love that fucking Molly Hatch up in here.

618
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Hey, this is a retro munch squad as brands

619
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,120
continue to, for some cowardly reason,

620
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,640
continue to not announce new products.

621
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,400
The one exception is, I do have to point out,

622
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,480
in the last literally two weeks,

623
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,600
the one exception is June 8th.

624
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,480
Today, checkers and rallies like,

625
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,520
like opened the door, a crack to the room of people and said,

626
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,280
Hey, we're introducing a mother cruncher chicken sandwich.

627
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,520
Sorry.

628
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:13,760
Okay.

629
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,200
That's it.

630
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,200
It's stupid.

631
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,520
Nevermind.

632
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,320
It's stupid.

633
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,120
It's stupid.

634
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,600
Nevermind.

635
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,880
It's stupid.

636
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,320
It's just, it's just an indulgent,

637
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,520
craveable menu item.

638
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,720
And we, I'm sorry.

639
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,360
I'm sorry.

640
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,080
It's stupid.

641
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,400
There's obviously more important stuff.

642
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,520
Just fucking forget about it.

643
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,000
We'll take it off.

644
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,800
We got it.

645
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,320
We just, our fries, our fries have been consistently deemed

646
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,920
the most craveable boy in the media.

647
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,600
But it's just stupid.

648
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,080
It's stupid.

649
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,800
It's so stupid.

650
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,760
I don't even know why I'm doing this.

651
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,160
I'll leave.

652
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,200
I'll leave.

653
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,520
I'm sorry.

654
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,240
We did checkerize the menu item though.

655
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,560
Get it.

656
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,360
The TLC needed for the perfect crunch and ideal toppings

657
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,200
and signature squawk sauce.

658
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,800
But the mother cruncher is stupid.

659
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,680
I feel stupid.

660
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,360
You would call it the mother cruncher.

661
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,320
It's like, dumb.

662
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,960
I'm going to leave.

663
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,080
It's got onion rings on it.

664
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,560
I'm going.

665
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:00,880
I'm going.

666
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,240
I'm going to leave.

667
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,920
Red, ripe tomato, pickles.

668
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,640
No, but okay.

669
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,200
So this one is, I enjoyed very much.

670
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,360
But it does require a little bit of setup

671
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,000
because it is from Canada.

672
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,040
Ryan sent us this way.

673
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,960
And booster juice is like a juice chain.

674
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,200
Wow.

675
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,560
Okay.

676
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,240
So I'm telling you that now.

677
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,480
It's like where you can go in and buy juice for a smoothie

678
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:30,880
or whatever.

679
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,280
Got it?

680
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:31,600
Yeah.

681
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:31,840
Okay.

682
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,280
Because the rest of this is so confusing

683
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,800
that I need you to have a point.

684
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,480
This is your constant, okay?

685
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,040
That booster juice is a chain that sells juice.

686
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,560
Do you understand this constant?

687
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:42,880
Yeah.

688
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,080
I'm tying my belt onto that pipe.

689
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,720
Like at the end of Twister.

690
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,840
Tie your belt on that pipe.

691
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,880
Dale Wishawan, president and CEO of booster juice,

692
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,840
announced the launch of booster juice game studios

693
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,440
at the fit and fun zone grand opening in Toronto.

694
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,600
He confirmed the newly formed game studio

695
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,800
will feature several new and highly anticipated games.

696
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,680
Consist now, how are they highly anticipated

697
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,880
at before he announces them?

698
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,760
No one knows.

699
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,920
They're consisting of mind challenges,

700
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,480
2D retro games and an interactive Microsoft kinetic,

701
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,200
not anything, body motion detection games

702
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,480
developed by bat.ca game studio.

703
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,440
These tiles be made available exclusively

704
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,680
at the Toronto Pearson international airport

705
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,520
in the booster juice fit and fun zone.

706
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,080
Wow.

707
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,800
Fuck yeah, dude, I love mind puzzles.

708
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,160
I love mind puzzles.

709
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,000
So you're telling me I can go get some

710
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,640
like powerful fruit juices

711
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,200
and also have a kinetic body experience

712
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,240
while I solve a mind puzzle?

713
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,400
And you have to be in the airport.

714
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,760
I don't know if you got that too.

715
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,680
I mean, I'd buy me a ticket to anywhere, baby.

716
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,320
I gotta get to this fucking booster juice.

717
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,920
Hey, Jimmy, where do you wanna have

718
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
your birthday party this year?

719
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,600
Oh, at the booster juice in the airport.

720
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,000
At the booster juice in the airport.

721
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,480
The grand opening event launched a new store concept

722
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,680
for booster juice,

723
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,840
who transformed a passenger waiting area

724
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,120
into a vibrant and interactive destination for commuters.

725
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,320
The fit and fun zone was designed to embrace

726
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,160
the booster juice lifestyle,

727
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,720
offering nutritious and delicious smoothies,

728
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,440
freshly squeezed juices, grilled food,

729
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,640
grab and go items.

730
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,240
In addition to dynamic concept

731
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,920
that extends beyond the store

732
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,640
to feature interactive large format games.

733
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,040
The games are created to offer travelers

734
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,840
the opportunity to stay active while on the go.

735
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,600
Well, I do have to go to the airport

736
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,560
to wait for a flight,

737
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,160
but the good news is that I can play

738
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,800
some huge interactive games at the juice store.

739
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,680
So let me get this straight.

740
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,200
You're flying from LA to Seattle.

741
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:39,920
Yes, that's correct.

742
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,640
And you want to connect in Toronto.

743
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,000
Yes, absolutely.

744
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,480
It is imperative.

745
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,120
You don't understand.

746
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,400
I've made it to level three.

747
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,400
I really think this is,

748
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,240
I'm making it to level four on this trip.

749
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,480
They've got a new mind challenge.

750
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,760
We're truly, truly excited about the grand opening

751
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,560
of our fourth location at the Pearson airport,

752
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,000
said Dale Wishwan.

753
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,880
Our team is dedicated to pushing the envelope

754
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,480
when it comes to store design.

755
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,760
So working with them,

756
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,560
working with the GTAA on the concept

757
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,840
and Raul Bott on the loose of booster juice game studios

758
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,280
has been fantastic.

759
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,280
These games can be enjoyed by individuals

760
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,040
of all ages and skill levels.

761
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,760
So we hope people enjoy them as much as we do.

762
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,680
Do you think that there's like an employee

763
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,080
at that booster juice that when they came in

764
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,840
and they started like setting up these games

765
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,360
that they probably have poured a lot of money into

766
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,440
to design their own games and install it,

767
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,720
that there was an employee who was like,

768
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,280
I have an old N64 that I could bring in

769
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,400
if you guys just want,

770
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,720
you know that there are like other games,

771
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,560
there are games I could bring in games.

772
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,680
Do you guys want games?

773
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,440
At Toronto Pearson,

774
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,280
we strive to provide our passengers

775
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,920
with excellent food and dining choices

776
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,840
and this all new interactive booster juice location

777
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,120
in terminal three provides a fun and engaging experience

778
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,800
for passengers of all ages,

779
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,000
said Scott Collier,

780
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,080
vice president of customer and terminal services.

781
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:02,960
We're proud to be the home

782
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,600
of the first and only booster juice

783
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,600
fit and fun zone in the world.

784
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,480
The thing that is so fucking wild to me about this,

785
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,120
there is no store at the airport

786
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,960
that needs to like broadcast its marketing message

787
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,520
more than a 30 foot radius around itself, right?

788
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,600
Am I gonna go to that booster juicer?

789
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,200
No, I'll just go get a fucking Coke at the Burger King

790
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,840
because it's actually five steps closer

791
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,800
because I'm at the airport and I don't give a shit.

792
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,640
So here's some game descriptions.

793
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,140
Cool.

794
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,760
The motion game immerses players

795
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,320
in an intense and cinematic world,

796
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,080
enabling players to use their body

797
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,080
for the hyper realistic dynamic

798
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,000
and interactive environment.

799
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,760
Booster Juice Surf places the cool you in board shorts

800
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,080
riding, this is fucking like meme guard,

801
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,920
hold on, nonsense.

802
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,960
Someone is shit posting in the middle of this press release.

803
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,000
Booster Juice Surf places the cool you,

804
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,040
that's in quotes, cool you in board shorts,

805
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,240
riding a branded surfboard in the center of a giant wave.

806
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,480
Points accumulate as you avoid dolphins and buoys

807
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,280
while trying to keep your balance.

808
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,160
What, hold on, I'm still back on the meme board shorts

809
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,040
and you just introduce there's dolphins trying to get me.

810
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,800
How are you putting the board shorts on me?

811
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,600
That's not how like virtual anything works.

812
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,240
Juice Bar Jumper is a 2D running style game

813
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,840
and closely resembles the recognizable booster juice stores.

814
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,560
What the fuck?

815
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,920
So I'm running inside the, wait.

816
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,680
Okay, now see, I'm still back on the dolphins.

817
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,720
It says on the rules on the door of every booster juice

818
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,480
that you're not allowed to run in there.

819
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,160
So this is setting a bad example.

820
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,480
This gets so wild, y'all.

821
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,480
With incredibly cute illustrations

822
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,240
and a suspenseful storyline,

823
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,120
a strawberry speedily whiffs across the countertops,

824
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,320
earning extra points upon collecting yummy blueberries.

825
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,960
As time passes, the difficulty increases.

826
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,000
I fucking heard that.

827
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,040
Oh boy.

828
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,120
In another 2D game, that same superstar character,

829
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,800
a strawberry with a dashing smile,

830
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,640
rides a booster juice cup like a rocket

831
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,840
with fruits firing out instead of flames.

832
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,800
He flies through the skies, avoiding evil candy,

833
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,440
collecting tasty fruit and racking up the points.

834
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,240
I'm not making this next part up.

835
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,920
The third game unravels a darker,

836
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,040
more riveting plot involving the destiny of the strawberry.

837
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,480
Get the fuck out.

838
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,440
This is a uniquely styled intense game

839
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,440
with challenges above and below.

840
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,480
Above and below means?

841
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,080
Below like in heaven and hell, I guess it means.

842
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,800
With challenges above and below

843
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,640
where the player has to double tap

844
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,760
to slip in between terrifying blenders.

845
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,640
In these vibrantly drawn worlds,

846
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,480
players must use a variety of skills to survive and gain points.

847
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:06,980
Oh Jesus.

848
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,920
This reads like the person writing it

849
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,040
was being told about the existence of video games

850
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,760
via telegraph through time travel.

851
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,440
Like they were just getting bleeps and bloops

852
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,520
of a portal opening and closing.

853
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,640
Additional games were also designed to challenge your mind.

854
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,080
These puzzles are formulated to make you think

855
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,760
as you match fruit and test your reflexes.

856
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,200
Certainly, the gameplay experience is enhanced

857
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,240
while sipping one of booster juice's delicious smoothies.

858
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,560
I like how that certainly is like an afterthought.

859
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,800
Like, you should get the juice too.

860
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,760
And the juice helps.

861
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,800
I gotta get these games.

862
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,960
I know E3 is fucking canceled this year

863
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,560
and that's the right call,

864
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,320
but I've been hurting for games.

865
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,040
So I do need to get up to the Toronto airport.

866
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:56,880
Yeah, so anyway.

867
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,240
Wait, when is this article from?

868
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,560
2016, it may still be there.

869
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,600
It's probably still there.

870
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,520
I hope it's still there.

871
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,120
Can I do another Yahoo?

872
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,640
Yeah, I'd love that.

873
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,000
This one was sent out by Emma Kant

874
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,360
and it's a real noodle scratcher.

875
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,000
It's from Renan's Mama's Yahoo Answers user

876
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,360
who I'm gonna call Davey asks,

877
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,560
why do people like snails but discriminate slugs

878
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,240
when it's the same person?

879
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,800
A snail is just a slug wearing a shell.

880
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,920
Without Googling, do the three of us

881
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,600
agree with that statement or disagree?

882
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,160
Is this snail a slug?

883
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,720
With a shell.

884
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,840
Now, do you mean literally?

885
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,800
Do you mean literally?

886
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,680
Like if I pull the shell off of a snail,

887
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,880
does it become a slug?

888
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,240
Or do you mean like are they closely related?

889
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,280
Why do you wanna pull a shell off a snail,

890
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,240
you fucking weirdo?

891
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,520
I wouldn't, but I'm saying,

892
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,640
is that what you're saying?

893
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,840
You just said you wanted to,

894
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,680
you fucking dirty weirdo.

895
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,600
I said if I did.

896
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,600
I feel like snails have little suction cups

897
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,680
at the bottom of them and slugs don't.

898
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,000
Okay.

899
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
That is my, and I think that

900
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,720
they're probably very closely related.

901
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,640
And I bet if a slug sees a snail,

902
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,400
he's like, oh shit, that looks cool.

903
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,480
That fucking looks nice.

904
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,560
I love that when salt starts pouring out on me.

905
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,880
Oh, you think the slug's jealous of the snail?

906
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,720
Obviously.

907
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,840
I would go the other way

908
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,400
because the snail has to drag that shit on its back.

909
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,280
Yeah, but when the salt starts flying.

910
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,640
You got a little hidey hole.

911
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,680
Yeah, but like a slug is like a top-down convertible

912
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,880
compared to a snail.

913
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,560
Let's ask this question.

914
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,920
And nobody's asking this question.

915
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,320
We may be the first podcast to ever ask this question.

916
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,960
Where are these snails getting these fucking shells?

917
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,000
I live in Texas.

918
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I live in the heart of Texas.

919
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,600
We are not close to the ocean.

920
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,960
So where are they getting these fucking shells from?

921
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,320
I remember learning that like hermit crabs and stuff,

922
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,240
like they will like, if they get too big,

923
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,520
they will get a bigger shell

924
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,680
and then another hermit crab will come along,

925
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,160
like any kind of crab and take the smaller shell,

926
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:56,960
but it's big for it.

927
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,520
You know what I mean?

928
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,960
And keep trading up

929
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,080
and they'll all hang out together

930
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,200
and like trade out shells.

931
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,280
But where'd that fucking biggest shell come from?

932
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:04,480
Yeah.

933
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:04,960
Yeah.

934
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,920
Or more importantly-

935
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,720
What about the first shell?

936
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,840
Where is the first shell?

937
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,360
I live in the middle of Texas,

938
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,400
not close to a beach,

939
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,280
but there's snails all over my fence.

940
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,000
There's gotta be people like going to the store

941
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,680
buying a big bag of empty snail shells.

942
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,160
Of little shells and dumping them all over the place.

943
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,880
I do think snails are cool and cute

944
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,680
and I like them.

945
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,200
And I do think slugs are the worst.

946
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,560
And I'm wondering,

947
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:34,160
I think it might just be because the slug is naked

948
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,080
and it looks like he's trying to be salacious a little bit.

949
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,040
Whereas a snail-

950
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:39,840
Not a great name.

951
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,840
Slug, yeah.

952
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,760
The name slug is bad,

953
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,240
but-

954
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,000
It's got ug right in there.

955
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,120
It's got ug right in there.

956
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,240
And I honestly,

957
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,800
the slug,

958
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,080
I feel like there's just more touchable surface on it

959
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,120
that I don't want.

960
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,160
And a snail is like,

961
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,240
I could pick that up and not,

962
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,680
and have it not ruin my day.

963
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,360
But the slug, fucking no way.

964
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,080
Forget about it.

965
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:00,640
Well, maybe that,

966
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,080
maybe it's the handle then.

967
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:02,880
Because of the snail,

968
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,200
you're like,

969
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,880
I know exactly where to grab.

970
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,480
If I need to pick that up,

971
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,680
nature has given it a grip for me to pick up.

972
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,320
There was like a potholder for the snail.

973
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,480
Hey, where do they get those fucking shells though?

974
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,640
Where do they get the shells?

975
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,160
Do they make it?

976
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,480
That's the wildest,

977
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,320
there's no way that they make that.

978
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,040
I wish there was some way to find this information.

979
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,000
Snail shells.

980
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,960
It's so hard.

981
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,560
It's really frustrating to me.

982
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,960
Hey Jeeves.

983
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,400
No, you're not getting,

984
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,360
don't search this.

985
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,280
I don't want these snail shells come from.

986
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,200
If anyone ever tweets to me

987
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,120
about the reality about snails,

988
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,280
you're sitting at home like,

989
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,560
I'm getting so mad.

990
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,080
I know this.

991
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:44,720
Don't tell me.

992
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,160
I don't want to know.

993
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,560
I want to live in ignorance about this one.

994
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,400
Let me have this little bit of magic.

995
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,280
All right, please.

996
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,680
Is it possible snails are just kind of carrying

997
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,520
the same shells

998
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,640
across the country, right?

999
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,160
And so like a snail carries a shell

1000
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,960
to Lubbock and then beefs it.

1001
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,840
And then a snail is like,

1002
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:06,640
don't worry brother,

1003
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,320
I got it from here.

1004
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,840
I'll get this shell home.

1005
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,480
Do you know what I mean?

1006
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,520
It's sort of a shell shipping line.

1007
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,280
Are they all rentals?

1008
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,240
Maybe.

1009
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,320
What do you mean by that?

1010
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,800
You rent them at the shell store

1011
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,480
and then you keep them as long as you want.

1012
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,280
Okay.

1013
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,320
And then once they're worn out,

1014
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,320
you take them back in and get a brand new shell.

1015
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,120
No, Justin, that's silly.

1016
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:29,840
That's a lease.

1017
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,200
That's what you're talking about.

1018
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:31,840
They're leased.

1019
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,080
They've leased the shells.

1020
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,080
No, that implies that they could own them at a certain point.

1021
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,960
No, they're not leased to own.

1022
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,760
They're just leased.

1023
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,440
They have to return them every three years

1024
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,400
to the shell station.

1025
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,960
What is the difference between renting and leasing?

1026
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,320
I actually don't know this.

1027
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,440
Don't tell me.

1028
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,160
Yep.

1029
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,320
Leave that magic for Justin.

1030
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,040
What's it?

1031
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,360
Leave the magic for me about leasing and renting.

1032
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,960
Can you expand a little bit more on snail store?

1033
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,840
Like the idea, and I'm not even wondering about like

1034
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,200
where they secure a brick and mortar, a little one.

1035
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,720
Cause like I imagine they could do it

1036
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,640
in like a toadstool or some shit that they-

1037
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,200
No, it's a bigger shell that they go into.

1038
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,960
I think it's just the idea of snails having commerce

1039
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,680
that is, I'm struggling with right now, Juicer.

1040
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,640
Do you think it's just snails?

1041
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,400
Cause I would say turtles probably also need to like shop.

1042
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,320
No, the turtle, I saw a fucked up picture

1043
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,680
of an x-ray of a turtle.

1044
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,920
Folks, there's nothing inside there.

1045
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,120
That is the weird part.

1046
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,400
The shell is the turtle.

1047
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,320
It is wild.

1048
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,240
It is disappointing to learn that there's not

1049
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,680
like furniture and stuff in there.

1050
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,480
We hope you've enjoyed yourself listening

1051
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,080
to my brother, my brother, me and advice show

1052
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,280
for the modern era.

1053
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,880
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

1054
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,600
Wait, what?

1055
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,320
This is not what we-

1056
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,040
Oh no, we've started again.

1057
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,720
We don't walk it backwards.

1058
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,000
What are you doing?

1059
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,120
We forgot I knew.

1060
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,320
We've never done that.

1061
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,720
I want to say thank you to John Roderick

1062
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,480
and the Long Winters for these are our theme song.

1063
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,880
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed

1064
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,360
which you should go check out immediately.

1065
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,520
And other things you should check out immediately

1066
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,320
are the great podcasts on MaximumFun.org

1067
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,320
including Minority Corner.

1068
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,440
Again, huge thank you to James for allowing us

1069
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,120
to do a feed drop last week in lieu

1070
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,400
of one of our regular episodes.

1071
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,120
I also want to shout out Fantai, which Jarrett

1072
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,400
and Travelle allowed us on Wonderful, another podcast I do

1073
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,640
to do a feed drop of their most recent episode

1074
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,160
which I highly encourage everyone to go listen to

1075
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,640
because it is illuminating and brilliant

1076
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,560
and all about sort of what the country is going through

1077
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,080
right now and has been going through

1078
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,640
for a very, very long time.

1079
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,240
So go check that out also.

1080
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,360
And along those same lines, reminder,

1081
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,240
we'll be tweeting the links to Black Lives Matter's national

1082
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:55,360
seeing donate there and also go to macroemerch.com.

1083
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,640
We have a couple of new things there

1084
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,640
but the one I'm really excited to tell you about

1085
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,520
is the Phantasmal and Resplendent pin

1086
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,520
as well as the Good Out Here T-shirt.

1087
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,560
Both of those are Adventure Zone references.

1088
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,840
That's another podcast we do

1089
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,360
that hopefully you also know about

1090
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,760
and the proceeds from those are gonna go

1091
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,360
to the Trevor Project, which is another great organization

1092
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,800
that you should consider donating to.

1093
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,800
And let's see, we said we're gonna check out

1094
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,200
Maximum Fun Shows, pre-order The Adventure Zone

1095
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,320

00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,880
Shit, that comes out soon, huh?

1098
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,280
Yeah, like a month, like a month from now.

1099
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,160
We should finish it.

1100
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,440
Oh, yeah.

1101
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,040
We should probably start it.

1102
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,880
I'll start drawing with my crayons.

1103
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:41,940
Okay.

1104
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,600
Thanks for listening.

1105
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,480
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo for us?

1106
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,240
I do have a final Yahoo.

1107
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,120
This one was sent in by a bunch of folks.

1108
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,560
It's from Yahoo Answers user Gaga who asks,

1109
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,920
can I name my band Radiohead 2?

1110
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,920
My name is Justin McElroy.

1111
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,200
I'm Travis McElroy.

1112
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,800
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1113
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,080
It's been my brother, my brother, me.

1114
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:17,680
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.
