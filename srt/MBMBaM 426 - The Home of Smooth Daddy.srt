1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,840
Hello everybody, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,600
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis the McElroy.

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:01,680
I'm your sweet baby, 30 under 30 boy, Griffin McElroy. Disturbing, disturbing brother news.

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,520
Hey y'all, y'all heard about this story? That's uh, yeah, so that's-

9
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,000
Tell me if you heard this one before. Yeah, so you heard this story,

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,240
uh, you heard this one in the news. What voice are you doing?

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,840
Yeah, it's me, it's me, uh, Jeremy Leno. Doesn't sound like Jeremy Leno at all.

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,800
No, it's me, Jeremy Leno. Yeah, you heard this story, yeah.

13
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:25,680
Paul Gosar is a congressman in Arizona and, um, he is running for re-election against,

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,280
uh, a Mr. Brill and- I believe it's a doc- a Dr. Brill.

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,240
Doctor, if you will. Which Dr. Brill sounds like kind of like,

16
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:41,760
um, like a mid-90s Sierra, like, adventure game. Like, the mind puzzle island of Dr. Brill.

17
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,800
Dr. Brill's prison of puzzles. I should also say, uh, after I saw what we

18
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,160
were about to discuss, I did a quick search on Paul Gosar and he seems to fucking suck.

19
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,400
Yeah, he sucks the- sucks the moon right out of the sky, yeah.

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,000
But, he- I think we can all agree on this one, he is the victim.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,360
Well- I think in this one he's the victim,

22
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,160
because what we have in this one is Dr. David Brill gets six of-

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,760
Travis and I knew about this, Justin is coming in hot, he literally just watched this video, so-

24
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,480
I'm coming in hot and it's the most savage thing, if you haven't watched it,

25
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,320
look up- just- just google Paul Gosar is not working for you long.

26
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,680
Uh, and I think it's long version, not like some weird, uh-

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,920
Not like ever long. Yeah, ever long.

28
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,440
Um, but anyway, they get six of this fool's siblings to come in the commercial and say

29
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:38,080
that he's an idiot, and like, we get to dunk on him, six brothers and sisters, six siblings,

30
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,000
to come on and say, hey listen, you know my brother? He's a dipshit.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,800
And you really shouldn't vote for him, he sucks the moon.

32
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,680
Clean out of the sky, take it from me, and they don't-

33
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,160
The good part is, the good good part is, they don't reveal who the people are,

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,720
versus just like, uh, for the first person it's like, a medical worker,

35
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,920
and then somebody's like, uh, a coach or something,

36
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,560
and then somebody's like, a private investigator? What?

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,120
Why? Why is his opinion important? Yeah.

38
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,680
And then it's like, my name is Bill Gosar, and it's like, oh shit, it's dunking time.

39
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,240
So here's what I want you guys to promise me.

40
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,960
Promise that no matter what a fucko I turn into,

41
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,680
let's just all promise that we'll never do this to each other, please.

42
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,440
Do you mean specifically this thing? Like, specifically-

43
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,720
Specifically appear in a campaign ad against our brother.

44
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,080
For Dr. Brill.

45
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,360
For Dr. No.

46
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,840
See, and this is what I'm coming at this from,

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:46,080
is I'm afraid that Dr. Brill has gotten a rush, a high, off of this incredible-

48
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,480
Go back and watch the ad if you just watched it,

49
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,160
and then look at his face and his wife's face there at the very end.

50
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,680
It is fucking decadent, their little look.

51
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,480
I think that this is the biggest rush this dude's ever gotten,

52
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,360
and now all he's gonna wanna do is pit siblings against siblings in public venues.

53
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,880
Do you think he reached out to them, or do you think they reached out to him?

54
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,560
Because either way, I really wanna hear that phone call of just like,

55
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,400
hey, you know how my brother sucks?

56
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,200
Do you want me to do a commercial for you?

57
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,800
Oh, I don't think that's necessary.

58
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,400
No, no, no, we already shot it.

59
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,080
We already shot it, get up in here.

60
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,560
It does raise the question, did this guy call-

61
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,680
One of two things happened to poor Paul Gosar.

62
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,720
Who sucks.

63
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,680
Who sucks shit.

64
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,560
Who sucks shit, but is really the victim here on this one.

65
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,040
Who could have got 360 dunked on so hard?

66
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,920
He got 360 no-scoped by six siblings all at the same time.

67
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
One of two things happened.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,240
Either Dr. David Brill got a phone call as like, hey, it's me, Dan Gosar.

69
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,120
You know my brother?

70
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,480
I fucking hate him.

71
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,800
You wanna-

72
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,600
Let's roll.

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,280
Let's roll, let's do this thing.

74
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,960
You got the camera, I got the words.

75
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,200
Let's do this, baby.

76
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,960
And then Dr. David Brill hung up the phone.

77
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,240
He's like, that was fucking weird.

78
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,680
And then immediately his phone rings again.

79
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,280
Hey, it's Greg Gosar.

80
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,960
Fuck my brother, for real though.

81
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,800
Let's go, let's do it.

82
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,640
I would like to believe that it went like this,

83
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,480
like Dr. David Brill called Dan Gosar and Dan Gosar said,

84
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,360
okay, hold on.

85
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,440
Let me conference in five other-

86
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,760
Let me get off the other Gosars.

87
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,040
Valerie, I just got the strangest call.

88
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,080
You're not gonna believe it, but I got a bing, bing.

89
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,520
No fucking way.

90
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,840
No fucking way is it popping off again.

91
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,640
For real?

92
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,080
Hey, it's Valerie Gosar.

93
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,360
My brother's a dip shit.

94
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,840
Let's go.

95
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,080
Let's melt this fool.

96
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,120
Let's melt my brother.

97
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,320
I just unfa-

98
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,440
The other option is,

99
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,800
the other option is maybe just like,

100
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,680
maybe Wilder is like, bing, bing, bing, bing.

101
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,560
This is Vicky Gosar's office.

102
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,840
Hey, it's Dr. David Brill.

103
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,640
We all know your brother sucks shit.

104
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,280
Does he suck bad enough where you'd get on TV and do it to get fun?

105
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,160
Oh, definitely.

106
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,520
Oh yeah, for sure.

107
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
And actually, it's weird that you call right now,

108
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,480
I'm having lunch with five of my brothers and sisters.

109
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,840
We all hate this idiot.

110
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,480
It's actually our monthly meeting of the ones of us

111
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,880
that hate Wilder Gosar, our brother.

112
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,640
Every Wednesday, we go to Applebee's

113
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,480
and we get their $2 cocktails

114
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,040
and the little pudding shooters that they have there at the end

115
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,280
and we talk about how big a shithead our brother is

116
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,920
and how bad we hate him and want to talk about it on video.

117
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,720
It's a shame mom and dad are out of town right now.

118
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,920
They fucking hate him.

119
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,240
Oh, they're going to be so sad they missed this opportunity.

120
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,760
I wish grandma hadn't passed away

121
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,240
because her dying words were, fuck Paul Gosar.

122
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,280
I hate that idiot.

123
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,360
Oh my God.

124
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,400
I promise you, Justin,

125
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,880
I will specifically never do this thing to you.

126
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,560
Now that's not to say that if you end up being a real fucko,

127
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,000
that I won't like do a web series about it or something,

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,800
but I will not do a campaign ad

129
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,080
in which it is only revealed at the end that I am your brother,

130
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,400
but I've been talking shit about you the whole time.

131
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,920
I will not do that to you.

132
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,480
Unless.

133
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,520
Unless.

134
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,000
Unless.

135
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,960
Travis and I get a call from Dr. David Brill.

136
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,360
I'm just saying it's not outside the realm of possibilities.

137
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,960
I hear he's very convincing.

138
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,080
Actually, when he made the call,

139
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,480
these six siblings loved their brother

140
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,840
and by the end of the call, they were like,

141
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,560
yeah, you know what?

142
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,320
You're right, Dr. David Brill.

143
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,280
Fuck my brother.

144
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,280
Vote David Brill, I guess, just cause he did the raddest thing.

145
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,120
The raddest thing I've ever seen.

146
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,600
That's how we decide this, is the raddest melting.

147
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,920
Folks, this is an advice show by brothers,

148
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,360
but for everyone, if I may be so bold.

149
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,520
And what we do on My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

150
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520
we've been doing the dang thing since 2010.

151
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,720
You know, UID always talks about their history

152
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,080
and I feel like we don't brag enough

153
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,840
about how long we've been in the game.

154
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,400
But this is-

155
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,160
That's because there's so many people

156
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
who have been at it longer than us.

157
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,240
If we were the first, or even in the top thousand,

158
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,720
I think that we could roll on that.

159
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,800
This is the 426th time we've done this

160
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
and I think that that's worth something, anything.

161
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,200
If you like the show, this is the time.

162
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,160
Share it with a friend.

163
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Please, we really appreciate it.

164
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,800
Anyway, wanted to say thank you to you.

165
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,320
We don't say that enough up front.

166
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,600
Thank you to you.

167
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,280
But what do we need from you?

168
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,000
Your questions.

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,280
And then we try to answer them.

170
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,360
MBMBAM at MaximumFun.org

171
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,960
And let's get into the first one.

172
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,240
Right now, it goes a little something like this.

173
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,600
Dear brothers, I am currently in a long-distance relationship

174
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,160
and my boyfriend recently started watching Game of Thrones.

175
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,280
Congratulations.

176
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,000
Congratulations.

177
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,280
We're also very proud.

178
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,040
Since I am not there to watch it with him,

179
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,520
I frequently ask how far he's come along.

180
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,280
Brothers, I recently discovered

181
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,000
that this man started with season four

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,480
and then watched season six, one, three, two, five, and seven.

183
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:54,960
What?

184
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,240
In that order.

185
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,920
Now, he is showing the show to his brother,

186
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,680
but instead of even this convoluted mess,

187
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,320
he is showing the show to his brother by character storyline.

188
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,880
What?

189
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,760
I'm talking all of Ned Stark's scenes

190
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,840
followed by all of Robb Stark's scenes and so on.

191
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,320
What?

192
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,720
Oh, and not all of the characters.

193
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,640
He cuts out the ones he doesn't feel are important like Joffrey.

194
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,560
My question is this.

195
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,320
How can I get my boyfriend to stop living in chaos

196
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,000
and watch the shows in the order they were intended?

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,160
And that's from sincerely watching as God intended in Washington, D.C.

198
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,280
This is unfathomable to me.

199
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,560
This is unbelievable.

200
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,280
Here's the thing.

201
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,160
Okay, yes, the watching the seasons all out of order

202
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,480
just seems unnecessarily chaotic,

203
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,680
but the scene thing seems like so much work.

204
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,640
It seems like a lot of work.

205
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,880
It seems like he probably read something on Reddit

206
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,080
or something like that that was like,

207
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,520
this is the true way to experience it.

208
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,840
This reminds me, our former boss at Polygon, Chris Grant,

209
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,760
close friend, trusted advisor,

210
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,160
eats his dinner one meal component at a time.

211
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,120
Whenever you go to dinner with him,

212
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,480
if he has peas and mashed potatoes and a chicken on his plate,

213
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,760
he will eat all the peas before moving on to the next thing.

214
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,280
The idea of doing this with any sort of entertainment property,

215
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,320
doing this with like the star,

216
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,760
this is how I watched the Star Wars movies.

217
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,960
It's the only correct way.

218
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,640
You start with Anakin, keep going.

219
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,600
Oops, Luke's in this one.

220
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,040
He's in this scene, but don't look at Luke.

221
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,840
Don't look at Luke.

222
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,520
It's fucking, it's unbelievable.

223
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,920
Do you rewatch it with the other character's perspective

224
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,440
at that point where it's like,

225
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,800
now we're gonna watch the scene again

226
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,200
because it does have both Rob and Ned in it,

227
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,440
but imagine from Rob's perspective now,

228
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,720
you have so much more insight.

229
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,280
Now sit in that chair and look at it from this direction

230
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,040
because that's the way Rob's looking.

231
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,440
Don't you know who died?

232
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,920
Don't you know who died in the big fire?

233
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,680
If you start with season four,

234
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,320
you know who died in the big fight on the lake?

235
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,520
And I don't even understand,

236
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,480
you know who won the big duel in the sky castle?

237
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,240
Like why, do you know what I mean?

238
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,440
You know who died?

239
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,280
You know who kicked who down a big?

240
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,920
You know who kicked who down a big space hole?

241
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,200
It doesn't make any sense.

242
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
How do we tell this?

243
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,560
We need to do advice.

244
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,160
This is obviously a wild anecdote.

245
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,520
What can we do to like assert ourselves into the situation?

246
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,280
The problem I have found,

247
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,360
we had this issue when Sydney and I first got together.

248
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
We'd be in her apartment and she'd be like,

249
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,000
hey, this TV show is coming on.

250
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,720
And I was like, well, I've never seen the show before.

251
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,400
And she's like, well, do you just wanna watch it?

252
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,360
And then I would have to leave.

253
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,120
And it would be a couple of weeks

254
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,400
before we'd speak to each other again.

255
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,000
And then eventually we would patch things up.

256
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,400
But this is a persistent problem.

257
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,000
The problem that you get into is

258
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,280
anytime you try to enforce rules

259
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,000
or like even your opinions onto something this trivial,

260
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,080
you come off sounding petty.

261
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,840
Like it seems like a petty thing to argue about with somebody

262
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,440
about how they're watching Game of Thrones,

263
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,120
even though it's obviously the biggest possible deal.

264
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,480
Yeah, this person is the Joker.

265
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,840
They've made up their mind.

266
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,960
Yes, they know what they're doing.

267
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,400
Here's what you can do though.

268
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,560
And it's a little sneaky and technically a lie,

269
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,200
which is a sin, which you're gonna have to ask forgiveness.

270
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,280
But you take the season one discs,

271
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,640
put them in the season four box,

272
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,640
the two discs into the six box,

273
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,080
the three into the one,

274
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,040
the four into the three,

275
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,920
the five into the two,

276
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,320
the six into the five and the seven can stay put.

277
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,840
At least they're watching this seventh season correct.

278
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,680
At least by the time they arrive at seven,

279
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,760
all the pieces are together and not in any kind of order.

280
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,960
They've jammed like a nubbin of the puzzle piece

281
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,120
straight into the flat side of the puzzle piece.

282
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,880
But at least by the time they get to seven,

283
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,680
they know what they're doing.

284
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,000
Unless you do a little switcherooney.

285
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,960
Who's the friend that like, oh no, sorry, brother,

286
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,200
that your boyfriend is watching this and the brother's like,

287
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,880
I'm okay with this system too.

288
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
Hi, my name is Ted Gosar

289
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,360
and my brother showed me Game of Thrones out of order

290
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,840
and you should vote for his opponent in this next election.

291
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,040
Anyone else?

292
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,360
Anyone else vote for literally anybody else

293
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,480
than my monster brother.

294
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,040
I got a Yahoo here.

295
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,280
It was sent in by like everybody ever, thank you.

296
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,760
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

297
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,960
I'm gonna call them football.

298
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,720
Football asks,

299
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,640
why do people keep giving their children names

300
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,240
that are already in use?

301
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,520
Millions of people have the name John.

302
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,760
We do not need anyone else named John.

303
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,120
Oh.

304
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,920
So what this person's suggesting is kind of like MMORPG rules

305
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,320
where it's like, sorry, there's already a John Plymouth.

306
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,360
Sorry.

307
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,400
You can be John underscore underscore 420.

308
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,840
That's still available.

309
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,760
You can be underscore XX underscore Yankees with a Z.

310
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,440
Killa with an A underscore underscore XX, 1999.

311
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,720
No, sorry, that just got taken.

312
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,840
Oh, that one got taken too.

313
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,080
Shit, by family in New York, of course.

314
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,920
Shit, man.

315
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,000
And wow, I didn't even think about that, Travis.

316
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,760
I was thinking like we'd have to get sort of unusual

317
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,720
with our sort of names.

318
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,000
Like, you know, John.

319
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,360
Okay, that one's new.

320
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,840
But what you seem to be suggesting is IRL gamer tags.

321
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,760
Yeah, like John one.

322
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,800
No, John one's taken.

323
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,040
Okay, can we suggest John and it's three Js.

324
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,240
It's a zero for the H.

325
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,560
John is still available.

326
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,280
Like, okay.

327
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,280
What do you think, honey?

328
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,360
Well, my father's name was DeJohn.

329
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,440
Yeah, DeJohn.

330
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,480
Like Martian Manhunter.

331
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,640
I had a moment, this reminded me of a moment

332
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,480
where I had to sign up for the Screen Actors Guild this week

333
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,160
so we could be in the Trolls movie.

334
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,360
And there is this place in there for your legal name

335
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
and a space for your professional name.

336
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,800
And I didn't really understand the differentiation.

337
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,960
But because if you're in SAG, only one member per name, please.

338
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,480
Like, you can't have the same member.

339
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
So that's why a lot of times you'll see people

340
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,280
throw in like initials or like,

341
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,280
I think it's why Michael Keaton changed his name,

342
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,280
which was originally Michael Douglas, I believe.

343
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,040
And there was already Michael Douglas in Screen Actors Guild

344
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,680
so he had to change it.

345
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,440
And they called me on the phone and they said,

346
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,960
you have some inconsistencies here.

347
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,560
There are some times where for your professional name,

348
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,200
you've written Justin Tyler McElroy.

349
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,000
And I did have definitely had a moment where I was like,

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,120
if I'm going to reinvent myself as a three-name man,

351
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,720
this is the moment to do it,

352
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,600
where I'll have to be listed in everything as

353
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,200
and Justin Tyler McElroy.

354
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,880
Not unlike Jonathan Taylor Thomas, if you will,

355
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,000
something like that.

356
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But I passed on the energy.

357
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,840
Can you imagine Home Improvement starring John Thomas?

358
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,760
Can you imagine Man of the House starring John Thomas?

359
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,000
I'll be home for Christmas with Hollywood heartthrob,

360
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,960
John Thomas.

361
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:04,880
Do you think Zachary Ty Bryant initially planned Ty in there?

362
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,760
Or do you think he was like,

363
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,360
he heard Jonathan Taylor Thomas was like,

364
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,720
I'll use my middle name.

365
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,220
What is it?

366
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,500
Ty.

367
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,000
I didn't really think through it.

368
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,320
There's actually already a Zachary Tyler Bryant.

369
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,360
So how do you feel about Zachary B.?

370
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,040
No, we're not Zachary B.

371
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,080
But why are there so many fucking Johns?

372
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,040
Yeah, but why are there so many Johns?

373
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,560
We get it, everybody.

374
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,880
I think it's because every time a kid is born,

375
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,320
the parent looks at and goes,

376
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,160
you'll be the best John.

377
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,640
Yeah.

378
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,120
Up till now, the Johns have only been a prelude to you,

379
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,640
John Almighty.

380
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,040
You, the ultimate John.

381
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,760
Maybe we'll finally get it right with this John.

382
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,520
This John, we pin our hopes on you, John of the future.

383
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,080
Not like John Wilkes Booth.

384
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,520
What a shitty John.

385
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,000
That John ruined everything.

386
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
A few days ago, I was at a stoplight

387
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,480
and I noticed the car in front of me

388
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,760
had a bumper sticker that said,

389
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,080
honk if you love Girl Scout cookies.

390
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,760
I love me some girl-thin mince.

391
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,880
So of course I honked.

392
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,960
The lady driving the car

393
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,800
then proceeded to roll down her window,

394
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,400
flip me off and yell,

395
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,640
fuck you towards me.

396
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,800
She had that bumper sticker.

397
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,680
So I don't know why she got so upset that I honked.

398
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,120
Was I in the wrong?

399
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,840
That's from Mandy in Ann Arbor.

400
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,960
Obviously, Mandy, obviously,

401
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,760
that lady had that bumper sticker

402
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,680
because she hates Girl Scout cookies

403
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,360
and she wants to know who likes them.

404
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:33,600
Yeah.

405
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,920
So she can flip them off and tell them, fuck you.

406
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,240
I mean, there's an accident at the cookie factory

407
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,960
and a big thin mint fell on her husband.

408
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,760
And now she's been widowed by Girl Scout cookies.

409
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,640
And so to know who the enemies are-

410
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,960
landed on her husband, Thin Ben, now.

411
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,960
Now he's Thin Ben.

412
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,560
He's like Flat Stanley.

413
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,760
But now he's Thin Ben.

414
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,320
No, he died, guys.

415
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,680
It's not a funny joke.

416
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,440
But he died because he's very thin.

417
00:17:59,440 --> 00:17:59,840
Do you get it?

418
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,800
Because he got squished.

419
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,080
So now he's thin, like Flat Stanley.

420
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,600
Did Flat Stanley die?

421
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,560
Flat Stanley did die, eventually.

422
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,080
Time still came for him even though he was a very flat boy.

423
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,400
Time still remembered how to find Flat Stanley.

424
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,920
He could mail himself all over the world,

425
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,120
but time would still find him and claim him.

426
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,120
I don't know.

427
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,520
She just forgot she had the bumper sticker, I guess.

428
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,400
She hadn't even heard about it.

429
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,160
No, that can't be it, Justin.

430
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,400
What would you shout at this lady?

431
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,200
But cookies!

432
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,960
Oh, right!

433
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,440
Oh, right.

434
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:33,760
Sorry.

435
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,720
That fucking bumper.

436
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,000
God, this happens every day.

437
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,120
Shit.

438
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,720
Oh, this is my brother's car.

439
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,400
I don't like-

440
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,120
I can't do gluten.

441
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,720
But Doug loves gluten.

442
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,880
Can't get enough of this stuff.

443
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,120
Maybe she was reacting to your kill all old ladies bumper sticker.

444
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,000
That you put on the front of your car.

445
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,880
That you put on the front and back and sides of your car.

446
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,600
Maybe that was the one where you have the bumper sticker that says,

447
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,000
stab all old ladies with their own knitting needles because they deserve it.

448
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,400
Maybe she was frustrated that you didn't see the bumper sticker

449
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,160
right next to the Girl Scout one that says,

450
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,480
honk if you know that I'm afraid of car horns.

451
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,360
That one's there as like a public service as a warning.

452
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,880
And then you have to weigh like,

453
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,360
oh man, I do love me some dosey dose,

454
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,840
but I do not want to freak this person.

455
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,280
They are driving a car right now.

456
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,280
Do you guys even-

457
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,360
I am really, really not the type to ever sort of answer one of these signs

458
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,800
for a signed answer at Little Caesars.

459
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,120
Honk if you love a $5 hot and ready, honk, honk, honk.

460
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,560
I would not honk at that,

461
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,240
even though I do enjoy a $5 hot and ready pizza from time to time.

462
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,680
I don't feel-

463
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,080
That's not what the horn is for.

464
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,400
And we've talked a lot about the horns, famously.

465
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,480
But I don't use mine for any purpose, even like voting like this.

466
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,280
You know what I mean?

467
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,040
So part of it is kind of on you.

468
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,640
Yeah.

469
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,200
I don't know.

470
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,440
I always wonder what people are getting out of that.

471
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,480
Like if I honk for thin mints, what does that mean for you?

472
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,640
I honk at labor unions when they're striking.

473
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,040
I'll honk at that because I love that kind of stuff.

474
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,680
See that?

475
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,560
Supportive.

476
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,120
So I did always wonder with people like that,

477
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,720
if they're getting a lot of support,

478
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,480
do you think there's a moment like midday through

479
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,840
where they kind of regret like,

480
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,520
I wish I could put on my sign like wave peacefully.

481
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,960
Wave in a calm, quiet manner if you support my cause

482
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,560
because I'm tired of getting honked at.

483
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,360
It's frankly extremely loud and upsetting.

484
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,360
Oh, did you maybe have a bumper sticker on your car

485
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,800
that says, flip me off and I'll fuck you

486
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,240
if you support labor unions?

487
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,360
Oh, that was probably it.

488
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
So we could be like bumper sticker that says,

489
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,120
what do you like on your pizza?

490
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,840
And I could say like, honk for just plain cheese, please.

491
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,000
Turn on your windshield wipers

492
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
if you like a little pineapple on there.

493
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,480
Turn your radio up real loud if you don't want sausage.

494
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,200
And flash the brights if there's a murderer in my backseat.

495
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,280
Why, why?

496
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,960
I was doing a fun pizza ordering thing

497
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,560
and you turn it into something scary.

498
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,000
Happy Halloween.

499
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Do you think the person, okay,

500
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,120
so there was a day when cars were invented

501
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,560
and Harry T. Ford probably or something

502
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,280
and everybody was driving them

503
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,720
and getting buck wild in there.

504
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,800
I bet there was like a lot of wrecks

505
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,720
and stuff at the beginning.

506
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,560
I know a lot of people were getting drilled.

507
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,920
Probably back, probably back.

508
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,760
They're basically big rocking chairs

509
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,920
with silly big wheels on them.

510
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,800
Yeah, it was wild.

511
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,120
I think that whoever was in charge

512
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,280
of automobile safety back then,

513
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,720
do you think that on the day

514
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,640
someone invented bumper stickers,

515
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,040
that person who's in charge of automobile safety

516
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,120
was kind of like, well, I wish you hadn't.

517
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,040
Because are you fucking crazy?

518
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,000
What are you doing?

519
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,080
It's kind of like, you should watch.

520
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,800
You don't need reading material.

521
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,880
You're operating a motor vehicle.

522
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,600
Like maybe it's just like the bumper sticker should say,

523
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,440
please address the road.

524
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,720
We're sharing it together.

525
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,880
Please just be a little safer.

526
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,800
My roads down here is an arrow pointing down.

527
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,040
You know?

528
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,360
I just feel like it shouldn't be allowed.

529
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,960
I feel like it shouldn't be legal.

530
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,040
Okay, then let me hit you with this.

531
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,880
Audio bumper stickers.

532
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,000
Hands-free, eyes-free bumper stickers.

533
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,000
And it's gonna be allowed to get through

534
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,480
those thick windows that these cars have these days

535
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,720
to protect you from rain and bugs.

536
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,120
They're Bluetooth, they're Bluetooth, they're Bluetooth.

537
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,840
Oh, okay.

538
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,880
So it jacks into your-

539
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,720
Jacks into your Bluetooth and you drive past the car

540
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,520
and it's like, coexist, coexist, coexist.

541
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,600
I'm pretty sure we have exactly reached the same point

542
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,160
that we did at one point talking about horns,

543
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,040
which is just like you could like CB radio to each other

544
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,880
and be like, hey, fuck you.

545
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,440
And like, listen, I think maybe we just need our cars

546
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,680
to be able to talk to each other like in the film Cars.

547
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,520
Yeah, that's what we want, all the cars to be

548
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,200
in conversation applying against us.

549
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,760
No, thank you.

550
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,560
I'd rather they didn't.

551
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,880
You don't know that they'd plot against, right?

552
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,480
I think my car and I get along fine.

553
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,960
No, I'm saying that, yeah, but they get peer pressured into it.

554
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,520
Oh, that's probably true.

555
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,480
You know how cars are.

556
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,280
Yeah, that's my favorite scene in Cars

557
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,440
where Mater gets forced to try weed and all the cool cars.

558
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,640
Oh, whatever.

559
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,280
I'm not gonna watch Cars just to see that.

560
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,240
It makes it worth it, doesn't it?

561
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,760
That sounds fucking really funny,

562
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,520
but I was thinking about I should watch Cars.

563
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,840
You can find just a super cut of that scene

564
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,720
if you want on YouTube.

565
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,680
Just search Cars smoking weed, Mater, Larry the Cable Guy

566
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,040
tries weed for first time and you'll find it.

567
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,760
And well, make sure to search long after that.

568
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,880
Has Larry the Cable Guy ever done ASMR?

569
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,680
I need to Google it.

570
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,040
Hold on.

571
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,160
I never liked the let's Google this segment,

572
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,640
but for this, I am curious.

573
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,200
Here it is.

574
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,560
Let me, hold on, let me patch it in.

575
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,920
Hand me the aux cable juice.

576
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:10,880
All right.

577
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,000
Hey there, everybody.

578
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,280
It's me, Larry the Cable Man.

579
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,560
And I wanted to say, Lord, I apologize.

580
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,080
Get her done.

581
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,120
This is what it sounds like when I'm doing my good comedy

582
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,640
at the haircut place.

583
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,640
Snip, snip, snip, snip, Lord, I apologize.

584
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,040
Get her done.

585
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,880
This is nothing.

586
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,000
You're pretty sure?

587
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,600
I thought it was something somewhere in there,

588
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,120
but I think that it will be looked back on kindly

589
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,440
and we'll look back on it as we journey to the money zone.

590
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,480
Let's go.

591
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,280
I need to zip some recruits and I need to recruit some zips.

592
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,240
And if you're like me, you need to go to Zip Recruiter.

593
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,200
Job sites that overwhelm you with tons of wrong resumes.

594
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,080
That doesn't help.

595
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,440
That's not zip recruiting.

596
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,840
But there is a zippier way to recruit,

597
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,800
and that's at ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

598
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,680
Zip Recruiter's powerful matching technology

599
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,600
finds the right people for you

600
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,920
and actively invites them to apply.

601
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,960
It's no wonder that Zip Recruiter is rated number one

602
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,720
by employers in the US.

603
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,120
So right now, our listeners can try Zip Recruiter for free

604
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,000
at ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

605
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,600
That's ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

606
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
Juice, do you wanna do Squarespace?

607
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,960
You want me to do it, bud?

608
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,560
Ah, bud, I'd love to.

609
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,200
Here's a quick word from Squarespace.

610
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,760
What is it?

611
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,520
Squarespace or the quick word?

612
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,280
No, it's both.

613
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,080
It's Squarespace.

614
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,840
It's a website, but it's...

615
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,760
Okay, this one's tough.

616
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,360
Think about it for a second.

617
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,960
It's a website where you make other websites.

618
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,000
Excuse me?

619
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,400
Whoa.

620
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,920
Yeah, you can make a beautiful one.

621
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,280
Damn, that's fucking crazy, though.

622
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,880
Can you imagine a sandwich that makes other sandwiches?

623
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,920
I just watched Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.

624
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,440
This is like that machine that makes water into food,

625
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,320
but for real.

626
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,160
And you need to be careful with that Squarespace

627
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,000
because it almost ended bad for them.

628
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,520
It's a good fucking flick, though.

629
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,320
Great fucking flick.

630
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,360
It's real good.

631
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,040
I like the scene where they convince the little monkey

632
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,960
to smoke weed through peer pressure.

633
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,040
How cool would it be if that shit was real, though?

634
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,920
If you could have a burger party that was so big.

635
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,000
At the park, you're just playing around,

636
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,200
and then there's a huge burger.

637
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,960
How fucking tight would that be?

638
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,240
Do you ever imagine a boardroom of tuxedoed executives

639
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,280
listening to our advertisements for their company?

640
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,120
Like, this is what we spent how much money on?

641
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,800
Squarespace, you knew what you were paying for,

642
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,600
or maybe you didn't,

643
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,040
but someone will tell you about it.

644
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,280
But what if your principal was being a real ding-dong

645
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,000
and a huge flapjack came and squooshed them?

646
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,500
Yes.

647
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,240
Squarespace, this happens when you buy in bulk.

648
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,160
You're not gonna get...

649
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,120
Not every podcast you choose is gonna be a winner.

650
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,840
No, they used to be good, but this ad's gone spoiled.

651
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,040
Just like the food, the big food that falls down in coffee.

652
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,880
I pictured the executives sitting around the boardroom

653
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,200
listening like, we've done it again!

654
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,680
And enjoying their big bags of money.

655
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
Please go enjoy Squarespace.

656
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,280
They're not gonna like this ad,

657
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,880
but if a lot of people go and buy the product because of...

658
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,400
Maybe when you go...

659
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,360
So you can go get the website technology that's awesome.

660
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,440
Free and secure hosting is so tight.

661
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
If you head to squarespace.com slash my brother,

662
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,240
you get a free trial.

663
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,160
When you're ready to launch, you use the offer code my brother,

664
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,960
and you'll save 10% off the first purchase of a website or domain.

665
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,560
The squarespace.com slash my brother,

666
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,600
enter code my brother.

667
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,520
That's awesome, because it'll let them know

668
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,800
that you did it because of us.

669
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,480
But if you can somehow make your website

670
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,000
about how this specific Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs

671
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,640
sort of centered ad is the one that got you there,

672
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,400
it's gonna open a lot of doors for us in the future.

673
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,600
A website about one of the best ads anybody's ever made.

674
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,920
You can just call it bigburgerparty.com.

675
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,280
Have the part of us talk about the big burger

676
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,960
falling into the park, or you can call it-

677
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,800
Or the flapjack, the flapjack crushing the principal.

678
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,400
Yeah, flapjackskloosh.com.

679
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,880
Gotta stop the show to see if burgerparty.com is available.

680
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,080
Sorry, kids.

681
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,840
Keep podcasting around me.

682
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,480
Sure, here's a Jumbotron.

683
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,320
This one's for Will, and it's from Kat, Nick, and Bug,

684
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,000
who say, happy birthday to our favorite rebel just for kicks.

685
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,080
We couldn't think of a better way to celebrate it

686
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,280
than sending you this message

687
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,800
from the host of our favorite podcast.

688
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,680
So here's your sweet, sweet POTG.

689
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,920
Regardless of when you hear this,

690
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,280
we hope you're having a good day

691
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,200
and getting plenty of protein.

692
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,000
Love you always.

693
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,240
Podcast of the-

694
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,280
Is that play the game?

695
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,120
Play the game?

696
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,000
Maybe.

697
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,600
Podcast of the Griffin.

698
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,680
Podcast of the Griffin is a fun one.

699
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,360
Juice, just checking on our burger party?

700
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,040
Burgerparty is a miss.

701
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,160
Bigburgerparty.com is ours.

702
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,280
That's way better.

703
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,160
It's way better.

704
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,240
So you know a good way of getting plenty of-

705
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,560
Will, you know a good way to get lots of protein.

706
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,640
Come and eat this big burger, bud.

707
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,880
Bigburgerparty.com.

708
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,960
Oh shit, what about bigburger.party?

709
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,480
Nah, bud.

710
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,080
Nah, bud.

711
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,760
Nah, bud.

712
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,480
I don't believe in sites that aren't dot coms.

713
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,120
Oh, okay.

714
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,080
I feel like those are going to be the first ones

715
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,000
that get shut down.

716
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,240
Damn, burger.party is already taken.

717
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,040
Fuck this website.

718
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,000
Somebody please read this next jumbo, Sean.

719
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,440
Internet is over, y'all.

720
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,400
Let me read it.

721
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,280
I got it.

722
00:29:59,280 --> 00:29:59,780
Okay.

723
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,160
This is a message for Jamie from Ariel.

724
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,040
It says, to my BFF, how's your stomach today?

725
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,920
I'm nervous about making these few words worth it.

726
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,400
I hope I don't waste them talking about being nervous.

727
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,600
That would be stupid.

728
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,280
Thank you for being a queen.

729
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,800
Thank you for never letting me watch The Fault in Our Stars

730
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,480
twice in one day again.

731
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,080
Thank you for my intro to Bim Bam.

732
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,280
Happy birthday.

733
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,040
I really like that.

734
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,560
How's your stomach today?

735
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,760
Because that is such a-

736
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,880
It's an applicable question every day.

737
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,400
Day to day, I would give you a different answer to that question.

738
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,280
I got to tell you, y'all, I don't know if you've ever tried

739
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,160
watching Fault in Our Stars a few times in a row.

740
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,880
You pick up on a lot of shit the second or third time.

741
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,840
I watched it, and then I watched it a second time,

742
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,320
but in half speed.

743
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,480
You see a lot of stuff that the director didn't really make

744
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,560
so obvious the first time around, and I started to think

745
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,720
that maybe the fault actually was the stars.

746
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,640
Yeah, so there's a whole secret thread there

747
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,920
where you're like, is it the stars?

748
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,040
But then you watch it the third time,

749
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,200
and yeah, I'm pretty convinced it's not up there.

750
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,680
Is that the one with Nicolas Cage in the map

751
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,640
on the back of the declaration or something?

752
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,680
Is that that one?

753
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,200
That's The Fault in Our Map.

754
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
Oh, right, right, right, right, right.

755
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,640
Ah, somebody got lemon juice on this map.

756
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,960
Fuck.

757
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,480
Dang on it.

758
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,360
Ah, fuck.

759
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,200
The way it's stained, it kind of looks like a map.

760
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,480
You've ruined it, Doug.

761
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,040
Ah, shit.

762
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,480
Someone drew a triangle with an eyeball

763
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,760
inside it on the constitution.

764
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,240
Dang it.

765
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,640
You've ruined another good one.

766
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,040
We don't have a lot of paper because it's back in old times,

767
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,920
so we're going to keep using it, but don't do it again.

768
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,640
Don't doodle shit on the constitution there, Jeffrey.

769
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,040
Fuck.

770
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,120
I'm going to show you something.

771
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
Something very instructive.

772
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,840
Let me see your dollar bill, Nicolas Cage.

773
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,280
Oh, okay.

774
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,680
Watch this and understand the truth behind it all.

775
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,280
And then he sets it on fire.

776
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Nicolas Cage is like, I wish you wouldn't do that.

777
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,480
That was my dollar bill.

778
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,320
Nicolas, Nicolas, I have a thing to show you.

779
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,640
It will unveil the secrets of America.

780
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,880
It's a Land O'Lakes butter box.

781
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,440
If you cut the knees out and you move them up here,

782
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,400
Nicolas, are you looking?

783
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,880
Nicolas, Nicolas, look at the Land O'Lakes butter box.

784
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,120
If you cut the knees out and you move them up here,

785
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,040
it makes them look like yabos.

786
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,360
Now, Nicolas, Nicolas, now multiply that by eight.

787
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,040
Now turn it upside down.

788
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,200
It's boobs.

789
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,440
Nicolas, it's in the corner of the bill.

790
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,280
It looks like a tiny spider.

791
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,040
It's not on all of them.

792
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,520
That spider?

793
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,360
Abraham Lincoln.

794
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,640
Think about this.

795
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,160
Every dollar bill, Caesar Augustus used to inhale blow.

796
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,640
That's something I read on Snopes.

797
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,600
Yes.

798
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,760
I've run out of things, but I'm so lonely

799
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,200
and I'm just glad you keep stopping by.

800
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,400
Wait, come back.

801
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,120
What is it?

802
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,360
No, I thought of another one.

803
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,160
Listen to this.

804
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:04,000
When Gene Wilder opened the costume jacket

805
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,680
that he was to wear in his role as Willy Wonka.

806
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,480
Uh-huh, go on.

807
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,760
Are you getting to a point soon?

808
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,280
Yes, I promise.

809
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,840
When he opened the costume jacket inside,

810
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,400
there was a name tag reading Frank L. Baum.

811
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,440
Who's that?

812
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,040
Um, it was the-

813
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,440
Nicolas, do you really not-

814
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,520
No, Frank L. Nicolas, I'm surprised.

815
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,120
No, wait, did I say-

816
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,640
God damn it.

817
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,360
I've conflated Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

818
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,800
in Wizard of Oz.

819
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,760
God damn it.

820
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,680
Okay, I'm really gonna go this time.

821
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,000
What just happened?

822
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,960
What was the last minute and a half of this podcast?

823
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:54,400
What the fuck were you trying to achieve, Juicer?

824
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,080
Okay, so let me take you inside.

825
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,040
Do we have time?

826
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,680
Oh, boy.

827
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,560
Yeah, I think we've got another 15 minutes

828
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,880
for you to explain the last 30 seconds.

829
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,840
I had a care-

830
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,720
Just the last part.

831
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,480
We were all having fun before that, right?

832
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,360
Yeah.

833
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,200
When we were doing the guy-

834
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,520
Yeah.

835
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,400
Okay, this is the guy.

836
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,280
Okay, so-

837
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,640
And he was showing off fun childhood life hacks.

838
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,000
Like the Land O' Lake's Butterbox

839
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,640
and the spider-

840
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,440
Right, and it was fun.

841
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,440
So, guy who played the wizard in Wizard of Oz, okay?

842
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,160
He gets his jacket for his costume

843
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,000
and inside the costume for the wizard,

844
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,800
the actor playing the wizard,

845
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,040
inside there, the jacket has a name tag inside Frank Morgan's jacket.

846
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,600
Inside it?

847
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,720
No way this is in the show.

848
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,440
While we're on the panel,

849
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,600
we have just 30 seconds to prove to Max Fun listeners

850
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,120
that we know what the F we're talking about

851
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,320
when it comes to pop culture.

852
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,600
All right, you guys, let's go.

853
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,640
Famous Chris's.

854
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,200
Walk-in.

855
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:53,920
Christopherson.

856
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,480
Hemsworth.

857
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,880
Karen, what's the most iconic lesbian snack?

858
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,920
The wings at Hooters.

859
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,240
The answer is fried green tomatoes.

860
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,800
Margaret, what is the Marvel Cinematic Universe missing?

861
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,520
My interest.

862
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,160
Winter, name someone who will EGOT in your lifetime.

863
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,200
Ike Barron holds.

864
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,480
That's beautiful.

865
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,680
Top gear or top model?

866
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,320
Sadly, I have to say top gear.

867
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,680
The clear answer is top chef.

868
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,760
But top model taught us about smizing.

869
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:16,960
Pop Rockets.

870
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,240
Smart takes on everything.

871
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,240
Catch us every Friday on Maximum Fun.

872
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,120
Hey, I have a Yahoo for everybody if you'll allow it.

873
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,680
I'll allow it.

874
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,180
Okay.

875
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,080
Adrian Cowell sent this one in.

876
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,880
Thank you, Adrian.

877
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,480
It's anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

878
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,440
I'm gonna call them.

879
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,000
Ty asks, I bought a silver necklace to my friend as a gift.

880
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,840
How do I tell her it's real silver without sounding like bragging?

881
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,220
Nancy.

882
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,240
Yeah, it's a good necklace, Nancy.

883
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,040
Do you notice the way it catches the light, Nancy, in a special way?

884
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,400
And the heft?

885
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,680
The heft of it, Nancy.

886
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:58,480
It doesn't seem to have the sort of atomic weight of iron or steel or brushed copper

887
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,760
or anything like that, Nancy.

888
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,600
And how would you describe the color of the necklace?

889
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,200
Ah, interesting.

890
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,760
Do you think it's...

891
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,120
Oh, you said silver.

892
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:10,640
Do you think it's maybe possible that that is actually what it's made up out of, Nancy?

893
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,960
And then you say, Nancy, look behind you.

894
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,840
It's a werewolf.

895
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,320
Please provide me your necklace.

896
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,360
Oh, I like that.

897
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,080
And you turn around.

898
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,760
It's like, oh, my eyes deceived me, Nancy.

899
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,160
But it would have been interesting that I asked for your necklace in that instance.

900
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,660
Hmm.

901
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,840
One moment, Nancy.

902
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,240
I have to call the silver necklace store.

903
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,740
Ring ring.

904
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,040
Oh, you have one less necklace than you did this morning.

905
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,240
I wonder where it ended up.

906
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,000
A customer came in and purchased it.

907
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,720
Oh, who matches my exact physical description.

908
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,920
Nancy, are you hearing this?

909
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,400
Maybe you need a confederate.

910
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,080
Someone who's going to show up and say, like, I just need to borrow.

911
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,880
Does anyone have a real silver necklace?

912
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,240
I just need it for two minutes to save this man's life.

913
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,280
Oh, you need a third.

914
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,560
Okay, you need another confederate who's staging a heart attack.

915
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,400
And maybe a confederate pretending to be a doctor.

916
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,800
So you're going to need three confederates.

917
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,440
Yeah, yeah.

918
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,240
And then maybe like a crowd of confederates that are all like, he's really dying.

919
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,360
So you're going to need 26 people.

920
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,600
You're going to need a flash mob, essentially, yeah.

921
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,100
Yes.

922
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,960
What if you go to Nancy and you say, Nancy, I should have asked yesterday,

923
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,120
do you have an allergy to silver?

924
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,160
Oh, that's it.

925
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,360
Then Nancy's like, yes, I do.

926
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,560
And you're like, that shouldn't be a problem.

927
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,120
Normally, when people have those sorts of reactions,

928
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,200
they're because nickel has been blended in.

929
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,120
Interesting.

930
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,760
Must be pure silver you've got there.

931
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,120
Oh, boy, someone must have really rolled out the proverbial red carpet for you.

932
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,000
Oh, actually, I'm allergic to real silver, too.

933
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,840
Nobody is, Nancy.

934
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,720
That's ridiculous.

935
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,400
It's hypoallergenic metals.

936
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,280
Okay, well, then why is my neck burning?

937
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,160
Oh, God.

938
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,160
Oh, no, I've been swindled.

939
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,440
Now, I've hoisted on my own petard.

940
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,280
Now, I am the real fool.

941
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,280
You can always, like the day after you give the necklace, walk up and say like,

942
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,160
oh, Nancy, what a nice pure silver necklace you're wearing.

943
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,200
Who got you that?

944
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,440
Oh, I completely forgot that I'm the one who got you the necklace.

945
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,480
This is embarrassing.

946
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,760
I have memento.

947
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,640
As you know, I have a bad case of memento.

948
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,600
Is my face red, much like your neck?

949
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,760
Also, sorry again about that.

950
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,200
It's time to sing my favorite song from my favorite Christmas movie,

951
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,320
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

952
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:38,880
Here we go.

953
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,160
Nancy's necklace and gold.

954
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,000
Oh, that's weird that I sang it like that.

955
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,500
Golly.

956
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,960
Hi-ho, Nancy's necklace.

957
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,120
You know, just a little goof.

958
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,400
It's silver, Nancy.

959
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,960
I bought you an expensive necklace, Nancy.

960
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,480
I need you to see it, Nancy.

961
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,000
See me, Nancy.

962
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,200
See me here.

963
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,800
See me as a man, Nancy.

964
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,120
A man with means to buy you a better necklace.

965
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,840
To buy you a pure silver necklace, Nancy.

966
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,520
I can provide for you.

967
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,680
I am not the child you knew once, Nancy.

968
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,480
I have been working double shifts at the Taco Bell

969
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,280
to buy you a pure silver necklace, Nancy.

970
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,960
I went away to one semester of college and I've grown, Nancy.

971
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,760
Let me care for you as only I can.

972
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,600
Nancy, I am but a man.

973
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,960
A man who read the cliff notes of Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance

974
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,320
and he stands now before you to say that necklace is silver.

975
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,040
And my heart is gold.

976
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,240
And my heart is gold.

977
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,400
Here is another question.

978
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
It goes a little something like this.

979
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,520
This one maybe we don't need to talk about, but I do want to share it.

980
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,560
I saw something strange while driving home from work earlier this week.

981
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,440
Due to heavy traffic, I took a route I wouldn't normally take.

982
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,080
And while driving through a neighborhood I'm not familiar with,

983
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,400
I noticed a blue figure on someone's front lawn.

984
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,040
As I got closer, I saw that it was a cutout of a Navi for the movie Avatar

985
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,840
holding a sign that read, Home of Smooth Daddy.

986
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,760
Was that real?

987
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,240
If so, who could have made it and why?

988
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,960
I mean, probably Smooth Daddy.

989
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:19,040
Smooth Daddy would be the only one using the Navi to tout his own Smooth Daddy.

990
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,760
Hey guys?

991
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,520
It might be Smooth Son though.

992
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,000
Smooth Son might have made it for his Smooth Daddy.

993
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,040
Hey guys?

994
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,760
Yes, Griffin?

995
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,320
I do not appreciate you giving out my personal home address on our show.

996
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:44,000
We went to the world of Avatar in the animal kingdom of Walt Disney World.

997
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,840
And it was fucking packed.

998
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,040
Packed.

999
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,560
Absolutely packed for a movie that came out fucking 18 years ago.

1000
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,880
And I'm sorry, the sequel will never be released.

1001
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,080
Ever, ever, ever.

1002
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,680
Sorry, it will never be released.

1003
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,680
And the thing you can notice in the crowd is there are a handful of people

1004
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,960
who are like very excited to be in the world of the Navi here on Pandora

1005
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,280
sharing in their culture and their ritual.

1006
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,680
Very, very excited.

1007
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,280
Not like theme park excited, but like over the moon stoked to be in the land of Pandora.

1008
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,000
They were rock hard.

1009
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,640
They were rock hard.

1010
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,600
Rock hard.

1011
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,100
Yeah.

1012
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,720
There's a part of this question that I do not understand the context in which that question

1013
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,000
is being asked, which is you saw like a Navi cut out holding a sign that said

1014
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,200
home of smooth daddy.

1015
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,080
And then you ask, was that real?

1016
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,640
Was it real?

1017
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,440
Do you mean, I certainly don't mean like was that like a thing that exists in the world

1018
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,400
because you saw it.

1019
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,920
So do you mean was that actually the home of smooth daddy?

1020
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,720
That is the only thing you could mean because you know it wasn't a real Navi

1021
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,560
and you know you really saw the thing.

1022
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,840
So the only question marks left here is is indeed that the home of smooth daddy.

1023
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:03,200
And I have to assume, yes, it either is the home of smooth daddy or that sign was placed

1024
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,000
there only moments before you saw it before the person who lived there was able to remove

1025
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,400
it.

1026
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:08,720
All right.

1027
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,600
I just did Google to see if I could find a picture of the sign because if this exists

1028
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,960
in somebody's yard, there's no way that somebody hasn't like taken a pic of it yet.

1029
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,560
I didn't find it.

1030
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,120
I did find a Cafe Press sign that somebody, you know, designed themselves and put up on

1031
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,280
Cafe Press because they needed a copy of their own.

1032
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,040
And it's a sign in as a white sign with big black font that reads never underestimate

1033
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,120
a smooth Fox Terrier daddy.

1034
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,640
Oh, OK.

1035
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:43,040
This is somebody who is perhaps the proud, you know, parent of a smooth Fox Terrier.

1036
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:49,040
And they people have been talking shit about what they can and can't do, I guess, for

1037
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,960
a while, like what their capabilities are.

1038
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,680
People have been underestimating this daddy of a smooth Fox Terrier and they want everybody

1039
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,960
to know I do have this dog breed on hand at any time.

1040
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,200
So don't stop talking shit.

1041
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:08,000
There is a band called the Smooth Daddy Band, smoothdaddyband.com.

1042
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,760
Do you think that maybe this is the like if you're looking for rehearsals of the Smooth

1043
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:20,560
Daddy Band, this is the home where we rehearse to practice our craft?

1044
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,880
I just hope that this theme continues then.

1045
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,080
And it's also like this is the show of smooth daddy.

1046
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,920
This is the car of smooth daddy.

1047
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,440
This is the shirt of smooth daddy.

1048
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,880
You can buy it for twenty five dollars.

1049
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:40,960
Hey, here's a quick Yahoo to, you know, get us get us home.

1050
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,280
The cinema Morgan Daddy.

1051
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah, thank you.

1052
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,200
Is sent in by Morgan Davy.

1053
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:45,760
Keep it wavy.

1054
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,320
Morgan Davy.

1055
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,000
It's Yahoo answers user.

1056
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,960
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

1057
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,080
Can I give it a quick refresh?

1058
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,640
See if the data will be injected into my rig?

1059
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,320
No, absolutely not.

1060
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,960
This was asked by smooth daddy who asks on the Tom Hanks movie Castaway.

1061
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,120
What was in the box?

1062
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:01,840
He never opened.

1063
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,480
And why didn't he open the stinking box?

1064
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,960
It ruined the whole movie for me.

1065
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,240
My husband claims it has something to do with the symbolism that he was a company man and

1066
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,280
trying to do what was right.

1067
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,680
Well, if he opened up the other stupid boxes, why bother to save that one?

1068
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:21,200
Tell me something that will make it all better inside.

1069
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,000
Oh, tell me something.

1070
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,960
Make it better inside the boxes.

1071
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,800
Marcellus Wallace's soul.

1072
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,920
OK, OK.

1073
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,000
I mean, that's one, too, that one, too, sucks.

1074
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,880
Open it up.

1075
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,080
Oh, the gold light.

1076
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,280
Pretty cool, right?

1077
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,440
What was it, though?

1078
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,320
Come on, tell me something that makes it feel better.

1079
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,240
It hurts so bad not knowing the box.

1080
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,840
The box had angel wings on it.

1081
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,520
That's what that's the only thing we know.

1082
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:57,120
And so maybe you didn't open it because it's like, what if there's an angel inside here

1083
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,640
or like weird old wings or dusty angel robes?

1084
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,440
There's nothing angel related that's going to be helpful.

1085
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,960
It's not going to be like, here's my angel brand coconut peeler.

1086
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,000
Sure.

1087
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,040
And honestly, I've let this thing stay closed for so long.

1088
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,560
That angel is definitely dead in that box.

1089
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,400
I did not poke holes in it or feed it the food that angels love to eat, which I guess

1090
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,680
is just angel food cake.

1091
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,360
So this angel is dead as hell, and I do not want to open this box because I'm going to

1092
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,120
see it and feel bad and the stink, the stink, the rotting stink.

1093
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,080
The cherubic rotting stink of this little angel.

1094
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,440
I don't know why I didn't open the box right away.

1095
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,240
I thought maybe it might be cool to have one box that wasn't open and then I put two and

1096
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:40,800
two together.

1097
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,640
There's definitely a dead old angel here.

1098
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,480
I don't want that on my conscience.

1099
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,840
So I'm going to deliver this.

1100
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:46,960
Hey, ma'am.

1101
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,640
Listen, I was on an island for a long time.

1102
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,360
Here's a box.

1103
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,320
Gotta go.

1104
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,240
Why didn't you feed my angel?

1105
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,440
What the hell, dude?

1106
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,720
It's possible.

1107
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,480
Maybe he knew it was a bomb.

1108
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,280
And he's not trying to fuck around with that.

1109
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,120
This is the one bomb.

1110
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,240
I know this.

1111
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,680
Maybe the box was empty.

1112
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,640
It's been a while since I've seen Kezdaway, so there's probably a concrete answer to this.

1113
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:20,960
But how long do you think that Tom Hanks' character, whose name escapes me, how long

1114
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,480
do you think that he stood there on the porch like, huh?

1115
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,280
Huh?

1116
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,240
What do you think?

1117
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,920
Oh, exactly a tip?

1118
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,680
Did you, uh, hello?

1119
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,120
Pretty good, right?

1120
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,480
I bet you thought, uh, nope, but I did.

1121
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,360
I did do it.

1122
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,320
But wait, don't congratulate me too hard because I did open all the other boxes.

1123
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,440
I opened all the other ones.

1124
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,640
I bet you didn't even see this coming.

1125
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,680
Can I tell you something?

1126
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,000
Uh, I was on an island.

1127
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,500
Ow.

1128
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,560
Okay, I was on an island.

1129
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,040
I was on, um, so, what do you think?

1130
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:53,760
Pretty cool, right?

1131
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,200
Yeah.

1132
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:55,760
Pretty cool.

1133
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,280
Anyway.

1134
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,080
What are you doing?

1135
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:58,960
Do you want to chill?

1136
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,040
Like, I haven't, I don't have any plans.

1137
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,040
I was on an island up until like yesterday.

1138
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,880
Everyone I ever knew is dead.

1139
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,720
So do you want to-

1140
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,760
I'm free if you just want to like, I don't know, like play some Sonic.

1141
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,280
Do people still play Sonic?

1142
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:11,520
Yeah.

1143
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,480
Is there a new Sonic game?

1144
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,400
Because I've been on an island for 26 years.

1145
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,840
Sonic's so radical.

1146
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,480
I was on an island.

1147
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,520
Hey, do you have a, oh, do you have a Clearly Canadian?

1148
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,800
I'm parched over here.

1149
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,200
We can drink some Clearly Canadian and watch the Arsenio Hall Show.

1150
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,360
Does that sound good to you?

1151
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,000
A cool hang?

1152
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,920
Hey, did you ever meet my dad?

1153
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,440
Or my children?

1154
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:34,880
My grandchildren?

1155
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,040
Hey, I'm looking for my, um, my grandchildren, I guess.

1156
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,560
They're probably adults by now.

1157
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,120
I've been on this island for like forever.

1158
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:47,520
So I'm looking for my adult grandchildren and their children.

1159
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,080
Because everybody else I've ever known is dead.

1160
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:50,320
Yeah.

1161
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,320
And are you hiring?

1162
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,800
And maybe do you have a room I could live in?

1163
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,920
Because like, I've lost my job and my mortgage for sure.

1164
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,920
I don't know sort of what future times are like.

1165
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,160
I only have two arms and two legs.

1166
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,280
I don't know sort of in your time like how what people have evolved to at this point.

1167
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,760
But I am kind of a throwback human with just the two arms and two legs.

1168
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,840
Hey, could you help me get a bank loan?

1169
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,160
Because I was definitely declared dead.

1170
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,000
And it's gonna be really hard for me.

1171
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,320
No?

1172
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,120
Okay, that's fine.

1173
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,520
I did just deliver your box.

1174
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,160
What do you have now?

1175
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:22,960
You're welcome.

1176
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,760
Hover banks?

1177
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,720
Can you take me to your cyber dentist?

1178
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,520
Because my teeth got really, really goofed up on the island.

1179
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,520
I have human bone teeth.

1180
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,040
I don't know if you guys have like metal teeth or what.

1181
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,880
But I just have human bone teeth.

1182
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,960
Could you program me some food because I am a real hater.

1183
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,440
Can I have a food pill or something because I'm fucking starving.

1184
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,040
Is there still water?

1185
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,840
I was worried about y'all using it all before I got back.

1186
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,040
Do you have any water left?

1187
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,000
We have water back at the island, but it tasted so yucky when you drank it.

1188
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,200
I figured that's just the way all water was these days.

1189
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,520
This yucky, it was like yucky flavor water.

1190
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,040
I hated it so much.

1191
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,440
Oh, God, my teeth stink so bad.

1192
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,240
What's in that box?

1193
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,160
Oh, it's toothbrush and toothpaste.

1194
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,680
Well, shit, that would've been cool.

1195
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,200
I'll wait while you open it.

1196
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,360
Oh, it's a change of socks.

1197
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:17,860
Fuck.

1198
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,840
Oh, that would've been nice.

1199
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,880
Listen, Robert Zemeckis, this is money in the bank.

1200
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,360
Make a $100 special edition castaway where you open up the box.

1201
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,240
There's a deleted scene where she opens up the box and she's like,

1202
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,400
hmm, my hand cream finally got here.

1203
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,600
Thanks, Tom.

1204
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,800
And then Tom walks away.

1205
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,000
That could be the end of the movie.

1206
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,440
Make a special edition of Pulp Fiction where they reach in the briefcase and like,

1207
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,880
oh, yeah, gold bars.

1208
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,760
It's gold bars, everyone.

1209
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:52,320
What if you made it like castaway two, and it was just a static shot of the box.

1210
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,360
And then at the very end, she rips it open after waiting an hour and a half,

1211
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,520
and you see her look inside fade to black.

1212
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,880
And then you do castaway three, where she dumps it into her hand,

1213
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,200
and it's another sealed box.

1214
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,080
And then castaway four-

1215
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,680
Oh, fuck, this is good.

1216
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,400
Yeah, right?

1217
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,280
And I have to be clear, these are all feature film.

1218
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,280
And then maybe Tom Hanks shows up in the bloopers of the credits

1219
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,360
so you can still list him as being in it and he can win another award or whatever.

1220
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,320
Hey guys, it's me, Tom.

1221
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,280
Hope you enjoyed the movie.

1222
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,680
I know it's mostly a woman very slowly opening up a box, but that's art these days.

1223
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,440
Anyway, I'm going to show you some bloopers now.

1224
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,880
Hope you come back for castaway four.

1225
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,720
This time, she is going to go to the kitchen.

1226
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,280
She's going to get the box cutter out, but it's going to take her an hour and a half

1227
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,640
to find replacement blades for it.

1228
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,160
So it's going to be really exciting.

1229
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,760
Robert's got some big plans for this one.

1230
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,120
Anyway, here's some bloopers.

1231
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:37,440
Rip.

1232
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,800
Oh, I opened it too fast.

1233
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,360
Start over.

1234
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,360
I hope this bots open-

1235
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:41,760
Bots?

1236
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:42,960
Fuck me.

1237
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,520
We hope you've enjoyed yourself here at My Brother, My Brother, and Me farms.

1238
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,760
We know that we've enjoyed having you here at the ranch.

1239
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:59,120
We always enjoy your visits and everyone feels more special than the last.

1240
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,720
I want to say thanks to the Maximum Fun Network for having us as a part of their

1241
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,560
extended podcasting family.

1242
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,840
We care about you deeply.

1243
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,000
I want to say briefly that my wife and I wrote a book about medical history

1244
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,880
called Sawbones.

1245
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,040
The book, the Sawbones book.

1246
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,600
Shit.

1247
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,240
Oh, okay.

1248
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,720
Bit.ly forward slash the Sawbones book.

1249
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,680
Please pre-order it.

1250
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,800
It's really important.

1251
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,680
It's fantastic.

1252
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,280
And Griffin read it.

1253
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,880
It's fantastic.

1254
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,520
Sounds good.

1255
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:24,800
Good book.

1256
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,480
I also real quick.

1257
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,480
So I've got a show coming up October 6th during New York Comic Con.

1258
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,680
