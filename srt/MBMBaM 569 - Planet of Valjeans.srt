1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,980
Hello everybody welcome to my brother my brother me and advice show for

9
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,980
the future era

10
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,320
What an honor and a thrill it is to be presenting this show. I'm the oldest brother of the program. My name is Justin

11
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,020
McElroy, my name is

12
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:36,280
Travis McElroy. I am your middle-est big dog wolf wolf brother out here. It is absolutely beautiful

13
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:45,840
Hey there, come on back now. This is your baby brother Griffin McElroy space cowboy. Yeah

14
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,780
We are doing the first this is the first my brother and brother and me from our

15
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,780
Limited

16
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,280
Interstellar tourism business that we just started space boys with a Z and

17
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,280
We're not where you think by the way, the Z is where the C should be

18
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,660
space boys boys

19
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,440
Now there's just one s it's space

20
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,800
Boys boys. Yeah. Yeah, so we're up here

21
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:25,100
Hey, listen pretend I didn't start it the usual way because if you guys space for the first time you just say some like cool

22
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,100
Shit, so can I can we all take it?

23
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:33,820
Let's let me adjust that let me adjust our audio calibrator. Yeah, we can get that smoothed out. Okay. Is that any better?

24
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:43,060
So I was well, you know like that's one small step for man one giant leap for me that whole thing

25
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,100
It doesn't make any sense by that doesn't make any sense. Don't get it

26
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,660
What if we are I was wondering if for this inaugural launch we're up here in this beautiful

27
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
You know obsidian

28
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,000
Sky we call space. Yeah, right a big sky above the sky. We call space the sky

29
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,400
Sky, yeah skies dad. Yeah

30
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,060
No, this is skies dad skies dad space the dad of the skies. Uh-huh

31
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,020
I was wondering if we could all take it take a chance and take a turn at like

32
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:23,020
Dropping our like space. Oh, like what's the thing? They're gonna like put on our like tombstone. What's the thing?

33
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,960
It's not our tombstone. I wasn't going in that direction at all more thinking like when people watch video of this

34
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,100
You got a pole one clip if you're making the movie

35
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,820
Where the aliens are looking at all the cool shit a humanity did and decide not to wipe us out

36
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,460
You know what? I mean? Yeah, it's like a Nelson Mandela quote

37
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,540
There's probably Malala and then there's us listen. I'm a space thing

38
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,700
I don't know if Neil Armstrong is dead or not

39
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,060
But you don't think they'll put like one small step on his tombstone

40
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,720
We have to go we have to one up that is what we're saying. Yeah, we're gonna be better. Okay, I got one

41
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,060
I got one. I got one. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's 2012. Okay, some peace deal Armstrong

42
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,960
I'm gonna make stuff for sure. That's two small steps for man

43
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,940
two giant leaves for mankind

44
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,280
Okay, you doubled it essentially

45
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:19,080
Because yeah, no, it's awesome. I mean you could say any number there you could have been like that's like a hundred steps

46
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:26,280
Yeah, and then like way bigger big jumps and then we hopped in like a cool space car and drove for a while

47
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Okay, how about this one?

48
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:36,620
When you not it does push you back. Yeah, we can confirm that that is built on both of these are

49
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:45,040
Lacking sort of a ring of like timelessness because they are based on references to things of so far

50
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,320
Decreasing relevance. Okay. Can I try one? Yeah, please and mine's more of just sort of like an acknowledgment of like our space accomplishments

51
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
so I was thinking like I

52
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,060
Am the first man to have eaten an entire watermelon

53
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:09,020
Watermelon aboard my rocket ship, but it made a big mess and they made me come land it back on earth early

54
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,140
Say it again. So this is the thing you have to be it has to have a ring of timeless

55
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,420
I'm the first man to have ever eaten a whole

56
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,820
Watermelon up in a space rocket ship, but ding damn it made a big fricking fucking mess

57
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,660
And they made me land it early cuz all the juice and seats that got everywhere in the apartment

58
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,300
Justin that's a good point because the one in the main problem if I could get some notes on

59
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,560
Step for man a lot of words a lot of what if we just shorten it to space?

60
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,340
It's fucking cool out here. Well, now what if we shortened?

61
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:52,520
What if we shorten one small set that a whole bit? Okay, like what we need is it's you know Twitter

62
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:59,560
Didn't even have time for the eat. You know, we have to shorten this how what would you guys think about this like big steppin?

63
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:08,320
Just like that's you get the idea big steppin up here in space step for me. No a jump

64
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,720
Boom be good. That's good. See my short arm punch here. Oh watermelon mess coming home

65
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:22,160
I see that is yeah, that's not bad. What I'll tell you what's even easier to remember Houston

66
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,960
We have a problem. Yeah, right very short very memorable. Maybe it's like oopsie. I ate some melon

67
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,680
Do you think do you think that when Tom Hanks when he when that really happened the real Tom Hanks?

68
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,560
Yeah, when they did Apollo 13, do you think when he was like you soon?

69
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,600
We have a problem. Do you think a brain Houston's like looks at each other like I know I know we're all worried about this

70
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
But that was like pretty cool

71
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,480
I love him and I'm we're gonna get these these fighting boys home safely. No problemo, but wasn't it cool

72
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,560
Can we take like five seconds? Hey Johnson write that down Houston right? We have a problem. Oh, wait, sorry

73
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,800
Hey, Tom Hanks was there a comma in that between Houston and we or was it a period do you think just if you had to?

74
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,840
Specify hey, we're just trying to get what's that? You can't breathe. Right, right, right, right

75
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,460
You need to find an egg crate or something. I don't remember that movie

76
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,260
I was just looking at Richard Branson's Wikipedia Sir Richard Branson's Wikipedia page and in his like

77
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,680
His I guess resume that they have here they have listed, you know

78
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:38,200
He has five billion dollars and did he's a knight and apparently a virgin but anyway, it says

79
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,160
Space career virgin galactic commercial astronaut time in space one minute 12 seconds

80
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:53,000
That's a cool career sir. Richard Brandt the trajectory of your shit was awesome, man. Awesome, man. Good job

81
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,540
You did it rich. I'm an astronaut for a minute for 72 seconds dick

82
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,460
Branson

83
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,460
I'm an astronaut like all the big boys

84
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,500
You're a one-minute astronaut partner, hey

85
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:15,020
Sir, Richard Branson, could you possibly pay off? I don't know like a thousand people's hospital bills

86
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,900
No, I'm going to space for 72 seconds

87
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,540
and by and by a thousand people's hospital bills Travis means all

88
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:29,920
Hospital bills ever for everyone on the earth who has ever gotten sick or hurt

89
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,960
But it's space, but it's 72 seconds. I could be closer to the moon

90
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,800
You can't even eat a little bit. You can't even pierce the hide of a watermelon

91
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,540
Using the tools available to you on a spaceship in 70

92
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,200
They don't they don't let you bring a knife to space

93
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,960
They simply don't tune in to this season of taskmaster featuring five

94
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:03,360
Rich assholes and we say hey, you have 72 seconds of space. How much watermelon can you eat over and over?

95
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,760
That's the only challenge. We just repeat it over and over real quick. I do have this is connected

96
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:16,160
Virgin Galactic we're gonna be following this story pretty closely because it's just well, they're competing with us, you know

97
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,160
What there's only enough room in space, you know, yeah for space boys and the virgin galactic

98
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,840
I want to bring this breaking news story from Ashton Kutcher if I can stand by

99
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,680
When I got married to have kids my wife basically encouraged that it was not a

100
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,560
smart family decision

101
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,600
To be heading into space when we have young children

102
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,080
and so I ended up selling my ticket back to Virgin Galactic

103
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,640
And I was supposed to be on the next flight

104
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
But I will not be on the next flight

105
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,080
But at some point I'm going to space

106
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,400
So, okay. Here's the story. Here's the scoop

107
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,600
Okay, wait, I got live here. You guys were listening there

108
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,000
Obviously a plus K was gonna go to space and that is what I said

109
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,640
He was a lot of good space and now he's pretty dejected about that as you could imagine

110
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,320
He really wanted to go to space. It looks so cool up there

111
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,440
But but Kelso from that Sony show will not be in space everyone right now

112
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,160
like Kelso

113
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,120
Does ticketmaster have a

114
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
refund option for space I

115
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,160
Mean Virgin Galactic is is wanting like some other luminary can get yeah

116
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,240
He put it up on stub hub Griffin. So like it's a resale thing now at this

117
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,320
So a plus K is a space ticket scalper. Yeah, what you're saying. I'm kind of right. All right

118
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Yeah, another question

119
00:10:53,400 --> 00:11:00,080
They're gonna go to space again. Yeah, you learn their lesson the first time for 73 seconds this time. Yeah, they're gonna go big again

120
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,920
There's gonna be a conversation where Richard Branson's like employees are like

121
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,400
So do you want to go to space again? And he's gonna have to be like, nah, I think I got it

122
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,160
Like you just go up there and yeah, I get it

123
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,200
I thought you're gonna say the opposite Justin which is like, yeah

124
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,120
I can't wait to go to space again and they're like, well Richard you've already been shouldn't someone else get to go and he's like

125
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,120
What but?

126
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,640
It's my rock in it, but I've got more money than anyone I

127
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,060
Think I left my keys up there at Richard Branson. Is that true? I'm not

128
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,920
Where Richard Branson is from maybe it's space. Maybe he's just trying to get home

129
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:55,320
Are you sure you left your keys up there Richard Branson? Well, you haven't seen me drive recently. Have you? Well, no, that's true

130
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,520
Richard Branson. Oh, yeah, I left me car up there too. What?

131
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,580
Yeah, like, you know, Elon put his car on the rocket there. I did that

132
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,840
Bye. Ah, his rocket took off. He's gone. Damn it. He distracted us

133
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:19,040
Well space boys, I can't wait for our next big we should say our rocket our whole program was entirely free

134
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,040
We we built it out of stuff. We found a dad's garage free and guess what?

135
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,240
Guess how many times this exploded none times none

136
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,960
Every time I turn on the news, it's like you want to blow it up another one up for the ocean

137
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,800
And I'm like you fucking dummy. It's not that hard

138
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,440
Not space boys. We got 100% success rate. Yes, it's definitely found in our daddy's garage

139
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,720
Can we land real quick? Yeah. Okay, bring her in. Oh

140
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,200
That's smooth. Yeah, it's real good juice. Thank you. Yeah, no big deal

141
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,120
No big deal

142
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,400
So this is an advice show also, which it seems weird. It seems kind of antiquated at this point

143
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,560
Well, we can't keep getting the money

144
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,880
They're not gonna let us keep going to space and abandoning the many many solvable problems of Earth unless we keep getting the money

145
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,920
So right. I'm not ready to give up on fixing all of Earth's problems. I just also want to fix the moon's problems

146
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,120
So good to you. Thank you. I'm a big man with a big heart and a big hunger

147
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,840
Not anymore cuz you know the watermelon. I'm saying I was the one who ate that you guys

148
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,800
You know, hold on. This is revisionist history you too

149
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,920
And I don't want to tear space boys apart right when it starts

150
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,720
But the two of you if we could actually play the tape back because you know, they're recording that shit non-stop

151
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,760
Because the surveillance state in space it it was a lot like hmm

152
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,880
That's the sound of me pulling the watermelon on my bag and then you two were like Griffin. What the fuck?

153
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,640
We told you not to bring that and I was like, come on. Come on. Come on guys. It's my birthday

154
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,680
It's like Griffin. We had weighed everything very specifically like yeah

155
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,540
Yeah, and we did not account for one whole watermelon and then it was a lot of

156
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,180
And then Justin was like Griffin your teeth aren't strong enough to gnaw through the outside and I was like, well

157
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,040
They don't let you bring a knife to space and then Travis like Griffin

158
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,080
What are you doing Griffin stop stop stop because you saw me lift it up over my head and smash it on the ground and then

159
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,440
Start just sort of scooping it

160
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,920
Well, you know catching it out of the air with a small net that I did manage to bring on board

161
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,880
But there was a lot of you two can't claim credit for eating the watermelon. You're right. You're right

162
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,000
It was just you and can I move on please? That'd be all right. Yeah. Thank you

163
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,980
I'm staying at my family friend's house for a bit while I start a new job

164
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,080
I brought some avocado with me for a healthy lunch. Cool. The problem cool

165
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:47,000
I promise my avocados aren't ripe yet. My friends have an avocado that is ripe, but they're out of town right now

166
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,960
So should I just eat their avocado replace it with one of my avocados without asking would it be even weirder if I asked?

167
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,360
Would they notice that's from potential avocado bandit in SC South Carolina

168
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:07,520
Anybody who would notice that is not is no friend of yours

169
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,180
anyone who has is

170
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,900
Keeping such close tabs on their avocado that they can tell when it's a bit

171
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:23,420
Indiana Jones switched out with another avocado is not someone anyone should be associating with not only that

172
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,420
but when my avocados go right the chance that

173
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,780
The Venn diagram overlaps of like they're ready to eat and I'm ready to eat them

174
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:39,620
It's not always perfect. And so the idea of someone be like, hey you weren't home when your avocado was ripe

175
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,900
So I bought you some time

176
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:49,380
By consuming that already ready avocado and giving you like that's that you've done them a favor

177
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,320
Yeah, you know, I said what I said

178
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,700
But it was wrong because Travis brings up a good point if they if they have been sitting on these these emerald beauties

179
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,940
until they stop being

180
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,780
Hard and disgusting but before they get soft and brown and gross

181
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,720
But then you switch it out with one that is not in that sweet window

182
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,540
They I would actually the the game would be afoot at that point

183
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,660
I think it just it depends on how long they're gonna be gone

184
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,300
You know if they're back the next day

185
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,720
No, but if they're gone for a couple days that window short, you know

186
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,340
I think it's a great business to cut like right

187
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,940
okay, so I placed a grocery store order and the grocery store just like

188
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,540
Brought a bunch of avocados for free. Well, yeah

189
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,060
Sample and it says in the bag like sample over hot bonus boys. We know about

190
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:50,180
Before you need to stop accidentally spreading these kinds of feelings about West Virginia because that makes it sound like

191
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:55,260
Like the grocery stores in West Virginia like how do we get people to buy these avocados?

192
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:00,660
They're so scared of them. We must give them samples. It's part. Well, it is kind of a weird like I

193
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:06,060
Don't feel I feel like even if the anyway avocados should have been my house

194
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:12,760
Okay, a bunch of free avocados except I had not structured any sort of avocado dish

195
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,260
Avocado opportunity. Yeah, you know

196
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:20,140
Yeah, yeah in my head. So there's just they're just sitting on the counter and getting riper and riper

197
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,380
And I don't have a plan for it and don't tweet at me. No, I know I can make ice cream

198
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:34,660
I know about this. I know about avocado toast not allowed to eat it cuz I'm 40, but I'm gonna know about it

199
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,020
Don't know what to do with these bad boys. They're just sitting there. I would love a service

200
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,260
Where someone's like comes to your house you like do you produce you feel guilty about I'm like, yeah

201
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:50,900
Actually, this asparagus looks like thick spaghetti because it's caused a limp and bad and and I would you eat it?

202
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,900
And they're like, yeah, absolutely. No problem

203
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:59,060
So no guilt for you for the for the stuff where you're making your grocery order and you're like, I'm an adult

204
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,860
I should buy vegetables and yeah, you get some zucchini

205
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,060
Yeah, right zucchini comes and you put it in the crisper drawer where things go to die

206
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,580
Yeah, then it's like two weeks later. Like oh, yeah, I need to do something with that zucchini

207
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,060
Yeah, I'm gonna do it that's a key. I like I like the scam

208
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,340
Where you put a bunch of fresh produce in there and then you start to feel guilty about it

209
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:24,740
And then you're like wait, I left an onion in here a month ago. This rotten onion has ruined everything

210
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:32,100
Just start again. No more guilt for me. One thing is sticky in here. You all got here, man

211
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:38,540
Every crisper drawers the fucking gross, you know, I ever get in there and it's like time to clean this fucking stinky box out

212
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:45,420
The worst is when you when you pull the drawer out and underneath there's just this reddish brown film. Yes

213
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,140
What is it nothing's leaking nothing's leaking everything

214
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,140
Yeah, it's the tears of the fruit and vegetables that know that they'll never be

215
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,220
They'll never live up to their purpose. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know what to do with these avocados. I think in this case though, like

216
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:08,100
It's a it's it's wonderful because they're gonna go over right but go bad. Yeah, perfect. It's perfect

217
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,380
It's a wonderful thing you're doing. Yeah, this is great

218
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,020
What a sign help

219
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,640
What a sign help? Well, I but we don't know the owners feelings about the avocados

220
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:25,840
Well, but if you're worried about getting caught or whatever just leave a little sign that says I switched out my unripe avocado for your ripe

221
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,740
avocado

222
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,740
You're welcome

223
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,020
This is it. No, this is a victimless crime. Okay, this is this is wild

224
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:39,140
It you you could eat all their avocados when they get home. They're not gonna say shit to you. Do not even sweat it

225
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,500
Hey, can we can we approach the Wizards throne?

226
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,260
Yeah with deference

227
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,180
Hang my head. Yes

228
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,220
Okay

229
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,060
No, he actually hates that you have to keep a constant eye contact with the wizard of the cloud

230
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:57,020
Yeah, hang my head and make eye contact and bend the knee at the same time. Oh damn it

231
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,660
Trap, he turned you into a fucking pig. Ah, that's what I wanted. Oh

233
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500

Les Mis is a fantastic musical beloved by millions around the world if you're a theater geek and want to proclaim your

Enthusiastic admiration of Les Mis this guide will help you plan a fun party based on it. Yes

Yes. Well, not let's not limit it because fans of French history will probably enjoy it as well

245
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:02,440
Do fans of French history actually like Les Mis or does Les Mis take too many? Are there like people who are like, yeah

Yeah, anyway prepare invitations your invitation should look old-fashioned

Maybe written on old aged parchment paper in a fancy font and should quote some of the songs. Here's an example

248
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,420
Do you hear the people sing the birthday song?

249

00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:41,380
And everybody was just like ripping it up and a loaf of bread come and a loaf of bread smiley face. Don't steal it. Oh

265
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,940
Let's get some lyrics going

266
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,380
If we could just I'm sure everybody's been sort of cooking some of the back of their head

267
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,580
Here's the best that one that I've got right now at the end of the year. You're another you're older

268
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:02,240
That's all you can say for the life of the poor and then you just keep going exactly the same way. Yeah

269
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,400
That's pretty good. How about this?

270
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,280
drink with me a

271
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,760
Kool-aid zero sugar jammer

272
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:34,920
My kids love those. Yeah. How about this? Who am I? I'm Derek's dad here in my bounty castle in the yard

273
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:40,200
Oh, it's not bad. Yeah

274
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,340
Damn, you know, I was about to say we're narrow casting right now, but I think we're pretty pretty well in the wheelhouse

275
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,240
Okay decorate obviously you got to build a barricade hey wait, wait, nobody did your very suicide

276
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,040
I'm trying to think man. I got stars. It's right there

277
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,160
What about confrontation? Come on?

278
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:06,720
Celebration. Yeah, that's easy. Oh, yeah. Perfect. Obviously you've got to build a barricade, hon

279
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,320
Yeah, did you smash up all of our dining room chairs?

280
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,720
I did do that because it's my fucking birthday dad

281
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,040
Get the get the net or you go all the way out and build a ginormous one in your backyard with old junk

282
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,080
You can even ask your guests to build old junk that they have and you could assemble it to build the building of the barricade

283
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,160
At the party or pile up bits of furniture in the corners at home. So let me get this straight

284
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:33,900
You want me to bring some of my old wooden furniture to your house? What are you planning to do with it? You'll see

285
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,440
Are we gonna get to like eat pizza or something at some point no keep building the barricade

286
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:47,720
But it's the army middle of your yard. What are you barricading against the French proletariat or something?

287
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,880
I don't know. I don't know. I haven't seen the show you haven't seen the show

288
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
Now I just love the posters

289
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,880
Try to avoid balloon streamers or typical party stuff

290
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,640
But if you absolutely need a birthday banner, then try having it be a neutral color with the Les Mis font on it

291
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
No, you know the classic Les Mis font

292
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,760
How about why can't we do just like big if you're gonna do streamers and shit just do red white and blue?

293
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,280
No, it's red and black

294
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,280
Red and black is even better

295
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,160
Red, the color of the cake

296
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,600
Black

297
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:26,680
The color of the cake the both colors are on the cake the cake is mostly red

298
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,160
Okay, it's a spider-man cake

299
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,680
My am I the man the spider that they say I am

300
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,120
My the Peter Parker how to throw a spider-man turn off the dark birthday party

301
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,000
All right, everybody you see the barricade we built last year for the Les Mis party

302
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,680
We're all gonna take turns jumping off of the top of it. Are you sure?

303
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:00,040
And I'm sorry, I'm sorry Vicky. I guess I should say now at this boy a year out. You're right

304
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:06,320
I did not clean it up. You were you are never got an after plan for the barricades

305
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,320
Assumed it would wash away

306
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:17,780
We got themed food get miniature sausages or hot dogs and stick toothpicks in them put papers on the toothpicks labeling them

307
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,140
Kidney of a horse and liver of a cat

308
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,260
Okay

309
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,540
Fun fun loaves of freshly baked bread. You stole a loaf of bread and various fresh

310
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,060
Well, it's second straight for the Jimmy Dean company showed up and they're like, how did you know?

311
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,380
Red Kool-Aid and call it the blood of angry men

312
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,020
And then there's a cake and you can make you a cake look like

313
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:45,620
You could either have cakes look like they did in that era frost some kind of Les Mis design on it

314
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:53,320
barricade etc or use some other kind of French dessert instead of a cake the clues are starting to point to this person genuinely not

315
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
having

316
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,000
Any idea what it is what the show at the very least?

317
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,680
You should have to make your guests decide whether they want to have their cake or eat it, right?

318
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,960
They shouldn't get to have they cannot get to do both. That's an excellent point Travis welcome the guests

319
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,640
Okay, you're all ready for your party decked up in your best eponine costume and the guests begin to arrive

320
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,040
Make sure the guests know that they must come dressed up to the party

321
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:23,000
There'll be no talking only singing and some yelling when the battles come if they break that rule send them to Javert

322
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,920
Oh, boy, dress up as Javert and tie them to a tree for five minutes or so. What?

323
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,840
Excuse em wall

324
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:39,860
Can you imagine anyone that like just popping their head over the fence and seeing this and there's like a 13 year old kid

325
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:46,600
I love I love this party. I love everything that we've done. I love all the plans

326
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,760
What I am thinking about is the moment when I've got it all set and then I realized that it's the child's birthday

327
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,640
And I do have to invite grandpa Dan. Yes, because grandpa Dan is gonna have to come and see all this happen

328
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,640
He's gonna try to talk around to be like

329
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,880
No, you gotta go to Javert

330
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,160
You gotta go to Javert. He's gonna tie you to the tree. Remember next time sing or scream

331
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,340
Those are the two options Dan. What I love too is just listening to this you get such a great

332
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,600
Like there's this scale of like age

333
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,360
plus this party

334
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:29,160
Equals fun question mark and like there's a track because at like 19 right in theater school you throw this party

335
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,180
It's a rager, right? This is amazing, right?

336
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:36,420
12 years old you throw this party. No one comes, right?

337
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:43,900
Now here's my question. Is there an age past let's say 30 where this really hits?

338
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,300
No, I mean

339
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:54,400
40 is what I am and I would be very into somebody putting this kind of work into a party

340
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,940
Yeah, but it doesn't even really matter. I would just love a theme, you know. Yeah, right. I miss it

341
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,580
This is this is still part of welcome the guests a play lame is soundtrack throughout the party

342
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:10,240
But don't watch the movie adaptation from 2011. Some guests may not consider it appropriate. Even if you fast-forward through lovely ladies

343
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,660
Which I guess is this a very sexual song from the movie the 10th anniversary concert from

344
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:24,040
The 10th anniversary concert from 1998 is less visually explicit. So oh if we could talk about that fucking show

345
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,800
Call Wilkinson. Call Wilkinson. Are you kidding me? Oh my god, huh?

346
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
He'll my prayer. Who am I?

347
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Who am I? Can I take him this mountain to slavery slavery?

348
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,000
Fucking call William Wilkinson and then what is the best is at the end?

349
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,960
They have all the Jean Valjeans ever from all costs of planet and they all come in and sing their own lay misses

350
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:52,840
They come in and sing their own. Who am I? Are you kidding me with that credible? It's incredible this version of it

351
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,360
I want this party now. I've just sent travel away. Just be quiet everybody shut up

352
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
I

353
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,160
Come

354
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,040
Fuck yeah

355
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:54,660
The best yeah, it's the best. Can you imagine? That's what you play open and close with the planet of Valjeans. Yeah

356
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:02,660
I just sent Justin and Travis some key art from this wikiHow article that I know this visual humor doesn't play at home

357
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:07,600
but it's just two boys with their arms around each other standing in front of a door with a small welcome banner on it and

358
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,680
Then for a what appears to be my god 15 foot tall man dressed up as Javert

359
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,840
I believe they're either three feet tall or he is ten feet. Yeah, that's pretty excellent

360
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,280
Oh god, we got to put that I'll put that up

361
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,680
So the final tip is just to play games but tweak the names and rules

362
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,380
So that they're lame is theme pin the tail on the donkey could be pin the bread on Valjean

363
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,760
What no in the crime on someone else?

364
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,480
That's a crime is amorphous. They've done that

365
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,600
This is what I'm saying. That's what who am I is. It's pinning the crime on another man

366
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,120
I know but a crime you can't fucking pick you start to play it. Yeah

367
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:54,040
So now you could pin that pin this silver candle sick on Valjean and he's got the one in your you take on the role

368
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:59,680
Okay in this in this pin the tail game. I'll be in having the role of the priest the kindly priest. It looks after Valjean

369
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
mon senior bienvenue

370
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:08,580
This is name. I only know isn't it weird out with some things like lame is I

371
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:13,020
Can't think of a time in my life where if you'd asked me like are you fucking deep in the pain?

372
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,220
Yeah, absolutely. I'm very deep in the pain of lame is and just like at some point

373
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,700
It's like apparently I've absorbed all this. Yeah, and I'm extremely deep in the pain. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What do you want to know?

374
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,780
What do you want to know? Yeah. Yeah anything all the songs all the lyrics apparently I did like I did this intentionally with rent

375
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,260
But with lame is I just sort of I don't know. Yeah, I can't

376
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,900
The botany class I took in college, but do you want to hear all the lyrics to master the house?

377
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,540
Let's set it to the tune of fucking stars, and we'll talk yeah

378
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,300

Since the dawn of time screenwriters have taken months to craft their stories

418
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:51,660
But now three Hollywood professionals shall attempt the impossible

419
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:56,340
Break a story in one hour. That's right here on story break

420
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,580
I Freddie Wong Matt Arnold and Will Campos the creators behind

421
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:06,200
Award-winning shows like video game high school have one hour to turn a humble idea into an awesome movie now an awesome movie starts with an

422
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:12,100
Awesome title. I chose the billionaires marriage Valley. Mine was Christmas pregnant paradise

423
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:17,440
Okay, next we need a protagonist. So I've heard Wario best described as libertarian

424
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:24,180
And of course every great movie needs a stellar pitch in order to get to heaven. Sometimes you got to raise a little hell

Yeah, hey Dave this party sounds great, where's it at

428
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,380
That's the last one that's that's all I got that's the last one

429
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,540
But you did run a real risk of pivoting us right back in time

430
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:55,500
I know if I could say it's reckless I was right now, but you know what? That's me

431
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:02,100
I'm kind of the bad boy of the layman's scene, you know, it's sad. I was just looking for like when you mentioned layman's fansite

432
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:07,780
I thought oh, that would be fun. I'm gonna find one of those. You can't find fucking fansites anymore. It's all been commoditized

433
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,900
Wiki, yes, you know what I mean? You can't just like get into like a dirty

434
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,500
Geocities web rang and just surf for a little

435
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:24,860
It's not a mumble there and it's kind of like just it is it was very obvious cities. Hold on one second just cities calm everyone be patient

436
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,300
Hey, everybody you are else on this show

437
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:33,620
He didn't even say URL this time. I just kind of thought wait just cities calm find your domain

438
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:39,700
Okay, let's let me check this register. Okay, honey, please be taken. It's not taken

439
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:46,920
I can get it. Wait, I type. Okay, wait little brain for here. I didn't type jizzdomain.com

440
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:54,540
That is also available. I might have to get both jizz cities and jizz domain

441
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,940
Available I'm leaving jizz domain. You can have it friends whoever gets to it first

442
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:08,860
It's it's right there for you. If you just can someone please make juice domain redirect to jizz cities

443
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,860
That would be

444
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,140
But I'm gonna make just just domain so

445
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,780
Well, that'll teach them to search for something so naughty

446
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:26,220
How I dang it done melted my damn computer down. Why did I search for jizz cities?

447
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:33,360
What were you doing better it imploded it sucked in on itself like a black hole. No nothing. What were you doing on it?

448
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,940
Well, I was searching for jizz domain

449
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,700
Okay, look like you were trying to go to a website when the computer

450
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,220
Sort of dissolved. Yeah, it's club penguin club penguins been closed for many years

451
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,860
There's a guy

452
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,020
This is on so there's a Canadian version of Dragon's Den

453
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:02,340
And there is a guy out there who came on a couple seasons ago. Whose name is currently

454
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,340
Escaping me. I'll find it just a second

455
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,860
But he is the dude behind Club Penguin and no matter who's Lane

456
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:15,300
Merrifield is the same and no matter who comes out there every time this man opens his mouth practically

457
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,660
He's like, you know what I created Club

458
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:26,860
Like incredibly rich because everything that you think is uncool it has made a billion dollars, okay

459
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:33,180
I'm gonna bring it in because I feel like things are getting a little out of hand a bit a little odd hand

460
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:38,180
I walk quietly and as a result, I always startle people when I just appear out of nowhere

461
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,460
I'm about to move in with five new roommates

462
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:47,020
I mentioned this to them and they all said it would freak them out for sure

463
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:51,500
So how do I stop jump-scared people slash seeming like a magician?

464
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,620
That's from Christopher walking

465
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,940
They've also added PS no tap shoes on for chart hardwood flooring, which is

466
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,300
That's an excuse

467
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,140
Yeah, that is an excuse. You could you could do it good

468
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:11,620
Traction becomes now this is this is where I really think if I may a sign might help

469
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:16,980
Because much like you are driving down the road, right and there's like watch out for deer signs

470
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:23,560
And I might not see a deer, but I'm ready to see a deer. Maybe you just have like watch out for Dave

471
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:31,080
or or don't here's here's my thinking on this one this this is

472
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:40,200
This is a them problem, it's not even a them problem it's a them opportunity because you are giving them a

473
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,680
an

474
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,680
intensive training protocol

475
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:52,160
For situational awareness you want to stop being afraid by me when I appear when you weren't expecting me

476
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,160
Then know where I am at all times

477
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,060
Train your train your mind to have complete

478
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,840
Perception of the world around you that's an incredible skill that you're giving them

479
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:10,480
And then you're gonna scare them so bad a few times and they're gonna spill a big bowl of soup on

480
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:16,000
Their body and it's gonna hurt a lot. But pain is weakness leaving the body

481
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,760
I think that the problem is you run the risk of

482
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,680
Surprising them and them hurting you

483
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,920
Yeah, sometimes that's you're gonna get a little soup on you, but your pain is their weakness

484
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,360
Entering your body. Yeah, that's what they say. Maybe you could announce yourself

485
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:41,280
Or oh even better. You're gonna need a Herald my friend a

486
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,080
Herald yeah someone who announces you

487
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:51,280
Someone who goes before you. Oh, not an HR. Okay. No, no, no, they blow a little trumpet and say presenting

488
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,320
Steve what if you're just going to the shitter doesn't matter

489
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,760
Steve's going to shit

490
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:04,480
What if you're just passing through the veranda a virtual eyes Steve approaches?

491
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,920
I don't need to be announced every time I'm going back to get more bagel chips

492
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,920
You know

493
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,600
Did we already say a bill I mean no cuz it's a person

494
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,260
If it is a person, but it's not cool that we do it to anybody, you know cows are like

495
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,800
Sucks this fucking bill

496
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,880
Get all of your roommates heat vision goggles

497
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:37,640
Mmm. Oh turn off all the lights now. Everybody's mysterious level the playing fields

498
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:43,880
That's cool. That's cool. Hey, guess what? If you live with five other people

499
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,360
You you do not it is wild to ever be surprised

500
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,560
By seeing someone. Yeah, not I mean like I don't know

501
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,200
I don't know how big the space is that you're you're living in but when you cohabitate with that many people

502
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
Just assume

503
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:08,280
Around every corner. There is a there is a human soul and I I don't know why you would do any differently

504
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,560
What the fuck's a person doing here? There's five of us. What about how else?

505
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,720
What do you know?

506
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,720
Hot wheels all over the floor. Oh

507
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,760
Can't help. Yeah. Ouch

508
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,680
Legos, I guess would serve the same purpose if you're constantly walking, but down the hall going yeah

509
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,840
Well, you could just do that with ruffled potato chips to less painful

510
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:35,040
But very loud scatter some dried leaves around a lot of twigs

511
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,760
Tried leaves and twigs would be good

512
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,200
Yeah

513
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:44,800
And it's good for the environment because that's gonna naturally compost and you're gonna get a lovely forest floor in your apartment

514
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,880
Yeah

515
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,880
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun. Yeah

516
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,160
dumb

517
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,800
But I want a munch

518
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,960
I want much

519
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,040
bob

520
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,640
bub bub who put the Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob in much squad

521
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:15,560
This I have a munch quad mini and then a full munch quad investigation, okay, so we're gonna begin with this

522
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,640
Because what this is kind of a special episode for us

523
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,640
I don't know if you guys realize,

524
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,840
but this is our Shark Week episode.

525
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,560
We're recording, you know,

526
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,160
not releasing during Shark Week, obviously,

527
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,000
but like recording during Shark Week.

528
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,600
So if we seem a little observed.

529
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,720
Yes, if we seem a little, you know, sharked up.

530
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,560
Yeah.

531
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,000
And we're not the only ones taking advantage

532
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,580
because Sonic Drive-In is also,

533
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,420
did you know, by the way,

534
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,680
that they're putting a Sonic in next to the Walmart

535
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,720
where the Bojangles used to be?

536
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,760
Yeah. No.

537
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,680
What a coup.

538
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,080
Yeah, it's a big, it's a big glow up.

539
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,920
So Sonic Drive-In introduced the new Shark Week slush.

540
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,840
Now, there's many different ways that this could have gone,

541
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,320
but it ended up going the weirdest possible way.

542
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,760
The limited time slush is,

543
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,960
if I told you guys that this is not a cheap cash-in,

544
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,560
but rather an opportunity, an attempt rather,

545
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,240
to capture the grace and beauty of sharks

546
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,480
with a slushie drink, you would not believe me,

547
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,340
but that is exactly what has transpired here.

548
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,600
The limited time only slush is a diorama

549
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,400
of refreshing tropical flavor to delight the senses

550
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,000
while diving into one of the Discovery's

551
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,120
most anticipated programs of the summer, Shark Week.

552
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,340
How is it a diorama?

553
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,920
Well, bud, the eye-catching Shark Week slush

554
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,600
has layers of fun with real strawberries

555
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:40,600
and two shark gummies atop an ice cold blue coconut slush,

556
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:46,480
creating a feeding frenzy for shark aficionados for $2.99,

557
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,040
which I think we'll all agree is a steal.

558
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,840
I've linked you a picture so you can see.

559
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,160
Basically, you got a blue slush,

560
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,440
you got a big, big mound of cherry,

561
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,040
and then the two gummy sharks on top.

562
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:02,880
Awesome.

563
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,320
Yeah, no, it definitely looks like just sort of stagnant gore

564
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,600
nestled atop some antifreeze.

565
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,440
Yeah.

566
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,260
Yeah.

567
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,160
We're excited to capture the beauty of Shark Week.

568
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,560
It looks like a lot of work

569
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,720
for an underpaid employee.

570
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,120
Yeah, they're never gonna look like this, though.

571
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,340
Enjoy this picture.

572
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,240
You'll never see one like this in the wild.

573
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,560
We're excited to capture the beauty of Shark Week

574
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,040
and the awe-inspiring ocean life the program showcases

575
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,540
in an exhilarating treat with a trifecta of flavors.

576
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,280
It's worth noting those trifecta of flavors

577
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,120
are blood, coconut, and shark gummy,

578
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,800
so we've really captured the spirit of the thing,

579
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,640
says Scott, the vice president of product innovation

580
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,960
and development for Sonic.

581
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,320
The beachy cool blue coconut slush lays

582
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,920
a bright aquatic blue base down for shark gummy candies

583
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,200
and juicy strawberries, creating a vivid ocean scene

584
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,440
within a slush for guests to celebrate

585
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,560
both the magnificent creatures

586
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,960
and the delicious fun of summer.

587
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,700
So you really celebrate sharks, their very existence,

588
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,740
with this slushing.

589
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:12,600
So it's just yet another way to honor sharks,

590
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,600
and that's wonderful.

591
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,880
But for one sea lion, but the thing about this slush

592
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,600
that I wanna be really clear about

593
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,840
is it contains no shark.

594
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,080
That is important.

595
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,520
Not even a bit of shark.

596
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,720
Right.

597
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,600
No shark DNA is present in this shirt.

598
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,800
No, I mean, we're all stardust, aren't we?

599
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,600
We're all stardust, man.

600
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,540
Yeah, but you could say that this is a place

601
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:38,560
where you wouldn't expect to find fish.

602
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,580
One place you might expect to find fish

603
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,880
is in a Subway Toonison.

604
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,560
Oh, no, this is ongoing? Oh, yeah, for sure.

605
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,400
This is ongoing, folks.

606
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,700
This story will not die to catch you up.

607
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:59,040
The New York Times did a test on Subway Tuna

608
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,340
and said there is no tuna at all,

609
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,640
not even the trace amounts of tuna

610
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,240
that you'd expect to find in any one of us.

611
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,120
There's no tuna in it at all.

612
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,400
This happened, and everyone kinda looked at each other like,

613
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,920
so what do we do now?

614
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,600
What do you want me to do with this information, New York Times?

615
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,440
What do we do with this information?

616
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,000
And if I remember correctly,

617
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,400
the head of Subway or someone stood by their guns

618
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,280
and said, no, it's tuna, and they're like, it's not.

619
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,640
Subway, yeah, Subway says it's 100,

620
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,440
it's absolutely tuna, no question.

621
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,600
This story is ongoing.

622
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,660
This lawsuit started in January.

623
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:40,660
Subway CEO said, and this is a direct quote,

624
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:49,820
he absolutely eats Subway's tuna sandwiches.

625
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,260
Oh, he doesn't, then.

626
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,620
No, he's never had any of them.

627
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:57,780
No, no, no, he absolutely, definitely

628
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,220
eats Subway sandwiches.

629
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,540
He says, it's one of my two favorite sandwiches.

630
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,300
Not, what's the other one?

631
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,940
Just say it's your second favorite sandwich.

632
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,620
He said it's definitely tuna.

633
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,020
He said he absolutely eats them.

634
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,060
This is just, hey, listen, this is just one on one.

635
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,620
If you're ever trying to get away with a crime

636
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,080
and you're brought in for questioning,

637
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,920
don't start off with, I definitely didn't kill him,

638
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,920
and I am absolutely not a murderer.

639
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,980
So they're saying it's tuna.

640
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,700
How far are they are willing to go?

641
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,340
They've launched a website called,

642
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,100
and the website is, let me get the URL for you.

643
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,860
Jizzdomain.com.

644
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:43,860
It's Jizzdomain, no, SubwayTunaFacts.com.

645
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,900
So if you go to Subway Tuna Facts,

646
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,100
you're gonna see a huge banner,

647
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,580
and it says, I'll just read it to you,

648
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:53,000
even though I'm probably, this is probably propaganda,

649
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,500
arguably, Subway Tuna is real tuna.

650
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,600
That's right.

651
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:03,100
The truth is Subway uses wild-caught skipjack tuna

652
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,900
regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

653
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,060
A favorite among sub lovers, our tuna is,

654
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:14,060
and always has been, high quality, premium, and 100% real.

655
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,900
Now, we know there's been a lot of talk on this topic,

656
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,820
including misinformation generated in the media,

657
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:23,020
so we created this page to set forth the facts

658
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,340
and help clarify any misunderstandings.

659
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,540
Myth, the New York Times reported

660
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:32,340
the Subway's premium fan favorite tuna wasn't actually tuna.

661
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:36,500
The New York Times said our kick-ass tuna isn't tuna.

662
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,100
And I would actually argue, what you stated is a truth.

663
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,060
That did happen, that's not a myth.

664
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,700
Myth, the New York Times reported

665
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,220
Subway's premium fan favorite tuna wasn't actually tuna.

666
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,020
Truth, not true.

667
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,340
What actually happened is that the New York Times

668
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:56,900
commissioned a test that couldn't detect tuna DNA

669
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,140
in their sample.

670
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,100
Okay.

671
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,540
But according to scientific experts,

672
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:04,580
this is not unusual when testing cooked tuna,

673
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:08,260
and it absolutely doesn't mean the sample that was tested

674
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,300
contained zero tuna.

675
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,140
Do you understand?

676
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,820
Oh boy, I'm getting kind of swayed.

677
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,620
USA Today did an independent fact check

678
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,020
of the New York Times conclusion,

679
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,940
which found it lacked important context

680
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:24,420
about the limitations of DNA testing in denatured proteins,

681
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:28,740
which you would expect in a cooked down tuna product.

682
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:29,860
I see.

683
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:34,380
So by cooking the tuna, all that important tuna DNA.

684
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,100
They cook the DNA right out of it.

685
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:41,020
You reduce it to create that strong tuna flavor.

686
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,980
Now they've got a chart here

687
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,460
that shows sort of the flow of it.

688
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,260
And it says at the top of the chart,

689
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,060
Subway tuna is real tuna.

690
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:53,900
Okay.

691
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,580
And they're just really banging that drum extremely hard.

692
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,020
One thing that would be,

693
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:02,100
I feel like the problem is,

694
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,740
is that we're getting into this,

695
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:06,300
like we've always been at war with Eurasia territory,

696
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,900
where the New York Times,

697
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,500
our most respected publication says,

698
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,900
this is not tuna.

699
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,460
And then Subway says, I believe you're mistaken.

700
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,500
This is tuna.

701
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,900
In fact, it's all tuna, baby.

702
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,980
Like there's no middle ground in this.

703
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,740
One person just says, this is absolutely not tuna.

704
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:27,220
And Subway says, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, it's tuna.

705
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,140
What they lack in this entire webpage

706
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:34,700
is one picture of a man or woman catching a tuna

707
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,380
and saying, this is going straight to Subway.

708
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,860
I'm shipping this to Subway.

709
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,060
You can watch.

710
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:45,780
I need to at this point fucking GoPro a tuna

711
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:49,420
throughout the processing until it's in someone's mouth.

712
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:50,540
That's what I need.

713
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,220
I need that level.

714
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:57,220
Does anybody read this on the planet Earth?

715
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,900
Does any sapient being on the planet Earth

716
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,540
read this website and go,

717
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,980
you know what I could fucking go for right now?

718
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,140
You know what I would crush right about now?

719
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:11,060
I tell you, it's kind of convincing.

720
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,660
You're Travis.

721
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,180
Now listen, now listen, now listen, now listen.

722
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,180
Am I saying I believe it's 100% tuna?

723
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,460
No, of course not.

724
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,420
Am I saying I believe it's 100% digestible?

725
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:24,940
Yeah, sure.

726
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,540
And now listen guys,

727
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,980
here's where the plot fucking gets really rippled.

728
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,700
Here's where the plot gets really thick.

729
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:38,100
The day, and I'm looking at the timestamps here.

730
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,580
This story from Grace Dean in Business Insider

731
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,940
about Subway launching the tuna website is from July 14th.

732
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:48,940
The day before July 13th in the QSR magazine,

733
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,900
which is my sort of go-to for quick service restaurant.

734
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,020
I would trust them over anybody.

735
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:53,860
More than the New York Times.

736
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:54,780
They are the paper of record.

737
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,500
Yeah, the New York Times of burger boys.

738
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,380
Subway launches unprecedented campaign

739
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,740
to support menu updates.

740
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,820
Okay.

741
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,260
It's called the Eat Fresh Refresh,

742
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:12,140
which features more than 20 changes to core items.

743
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,540
It will be supported with multi-platform content

744
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:17,260
from Steph Curry, Serena Williams,

745
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,740
Tom Brady.

746
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:22,180
Wait, are they all making sandwiches?

747
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,140
It's an extraordinary group of athletes

748
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,660
that reinforce the scope of these tremendous changes

749
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,140
and embody the idea that to be fresh,

750
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,580
you need to refresh.

751
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,740
Hey, I'm Tom Brady and this is my sandwich.

752
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,860
It's two pieces of bread

753
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:39,300
and then there's a sealy sort of mattress between them

754
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,460
and I just eat it.

755
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,300
I eat all of it.

756
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,140
Just so you guys don't think I'm making this up,

757
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,980
I have one of these ads for you right here.

758
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,100
It's six seconds long.

759
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,380
Here we go.

760
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,860
There's so much new at Subway, it won't fit in one ad.

761
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,340
So they're sandwiching the sandwich ads

762
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,020
between other ads.

763
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,260
That's a real one.

764
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,540
That's a real ad, a real six second ad

765
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,100
that Subway's doing with Charles Barkley

766
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,180
as the new voice of Subway.

767
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,060
I love that. He's made it.

768
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:07,140
It says here, I will lend his humor and familiar tone

769
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,260
as the new voice of Subway.

770
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,260
I love that dude.

771
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,820
Yeah, I like his familiar tone.

772
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,580
So it's a huge, I mean, there's all kinds of big changes.

773
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:17,500
They improved their turkey, ham, steak, and bacon.

774
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,100
Pretty low bar.

775
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,820
Well, and the rotisserie chicken.

776
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,540
And they elevate, that's a lot of proteins.

777
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,260
That's all of it, guys.

778
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,980
Hey, well, no Griffin, it's not all of it.

779
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:30,580
Cause that, is there one protein

780
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:32,340
continuously absent from that list?

781
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,100
Oh, the tuna?

782
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,740
It's perfect.

783
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:37,580
Can't be improved.

784
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,780
It's perfect and real and we can't evolve it.

785
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:43,140
Cause it's so real that it's a hundred percent tuna.

786
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,420
You know what, in fact, now that we think about it,

787
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,780
it's great that you brought out how much

788
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,820
we fucking love our tuna.

789
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,900
Cause we need to fix our chicken and bacon

790
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,620
and everything else but tuna.

791
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:55,820
So we'll live up to the standards

792
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:59,340
that our 100% actual tuna is sitting.

793
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,580
We asked Branson, we said, hey, while you're up there,

794
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,340
keep your eyes out for space tuna.

795
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,980
Cause that's the only way it's getting better, my man.

796
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,860
Something has got to help top this.

797
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,740
Our other meats are, if they'd come, you know what,

798
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,820
honestly, now that I think about it, folks,

799
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:15,980
if they'd come for any of our other meats,

800
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:20,180
the bacon, that's old belts, 100% it's old belts.

801
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,020
You got us.

802
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:24,260
We've been doing plant-based chicken for 30 years, okay?

803
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:28,940
It's all fake bullshit, but the tuna, it's perfect and real

804
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,220
and it's real tuna.

805
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,220
What's a shame is that Branson could have found space tuna

806
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:36,540
and come back and be like, good news, Subway, space tuna.

807
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,340
It tastes a hundred percent better and fresher.

808
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,460
So go ahead and toss that on the menu.

809
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:46,220
And then Dr. Subway was like, we fucking, we fuck, we can't

810
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:47,580
because everybody will think it's a New York Times

811
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,460
switcheroo, swap-a-rooney, damn it.

812
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,300
Fuck, why did the New York Times have to write that article

813
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,020
so we can't put kick-ass space tuna in our sandwiches?

814
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,860
The optics, Branson, were so bad.

815
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:56,900
You blew it again.

816
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,140
You blew it.

817
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,860
Oh my God, this is a quote from the CEO of Subway.

818
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,220
We've been working on this refresh for 15 to 16 months.

819
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,580
And if you notice, the one thing we did not touch

820
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:07,420
is our tuna.

821
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,500
People love our tuna.

822
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,340
We're very proud of our tuna.

823
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,860
So I think that's really the end of the story.

824
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,020
Guys, that's his quote.

825
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,300
They're like quintupling down.

826
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,380
And that comes, by the way, at the end of the story

827
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,900
in Business Insider.

828
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:22,740
I love it.

829
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:26,180
It's the CEO like, oh, so the last thing I wanted to say

830
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:29,460
is that the tuna is real and we're all agreed on that.

831
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,660
You could just put a period right there

832
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,540
and that's the end of it.

833
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:35,100
And I feel like the one thing we could all agree on

834
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,700
is that our bacon has always been bad

835
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:39,940
and hopefully now it's better and that our tuna is real.

836
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,100
And that's it.

837
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,660
That's the whole review by.

838
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,340
Oh, we're sorry about Jared, by the way.

839
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,980
I'm sure we should say still sorry about Jared.

840
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:48,980
Still bugged up on that one.

841
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,700
But the tuna, perfect.

842
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,700
Tuna, oh baby.

843
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:57,700
And I would say at this point with absolute certainty

844
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:01,060
that the New York Times' two biggest whoopsies

845
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,340
was in this order, number two,

846
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:06,220
their full-throated endorsement of the war in Iraq.

847
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,060
And then number one, when they fucking lied

848
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,220
about Subway's tuna for some reason.

849
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,060
Yeah.

850
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:11,900
I don't get it.

851
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,740
I don't get it.

852
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,140
Thanks to you so much for listening to our podcast,

853
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,780
which is this one.

854
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,740
My brother, my brother and me.

855
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:22,300
It's a delight to have you with us as always.

856
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,140
Thank you.

857
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:25,380
If you pre-ordered the Adventure Zone Crystal Kingdom,

858
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,940
which is a graphic novel we wrote with our daddy

859
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,220
based on our Adventure Zone podcast.

860
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,060
If you haven't gotten it yet,

861
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:35,060
you can go to theadventurezonecomic.com and buy a copy.

862
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,580
And that would just be the best.

863
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,740
We've also got a lot of new merch

864
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,860
over at mcrorymerch.com.

865
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,020
We got a pin of the month Gooshie Wolves

866
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,980
from the Ethersea setup episodes.

867
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,460
Proceeds from that benefit The Innocence Project,

868
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:51,180
which exonerates the wrongly convicted through DNA testing

869
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:53,340
and reforms the criminal justice system

870
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,100
to prevent future injustice.

871
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:58,060
We've got a really cute, I'm just gonna say,

872
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:00,900
It's Trash sticker from the My Brother, My Brother and Me

873
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:01,980
TV show.

874
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,980
A really cool green stoneware mug with the Taz logo on it

875
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,500
and a besties video game club shirt,

876
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,140
which I will be getting as a big fan.

877
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,020
I brought a bunch of,

878
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:15,660
I bought like 30 of those Justin McElroy's trash stickers

879
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:18,140
to put on my daughter's homework

880
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:21,420
when it doesn't cut the mustard.

881
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,260
It's weird that you did that.

882
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,100
I wouldn't.

883
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:23,920
I'm not a good person.

884
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:24,760
I don't know what to tell you.

885
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,060
Griffin, tell us about the game.

886
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,500
Oh, you're talking about the Adventure Zone Bureau

887
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,040
balance game that you can play with friends?

888
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:30,960
Yeah, that one.

889
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,800
That's the one.

890
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,940
Well, 2Gether Studios is the creator on that one,

891
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,660
and they are celebrating a safe return

892
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:38,620
to the game table this summer

893
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:41,300
with local retailer events, giveaways, and live streams

894
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,860
of the Bureau of Balance game,

895
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:46,260
which if you haven't played it is a hoot and a half.

896
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,220
They're gonna have gameplay streams every Tuesday evening

897
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:54,080
at 8 p.m. Eastern time at twitch.tv slash 2Gether Studios,

898
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:58,060
and that's T-W-O-Gether Studios.

899
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:01,460
And you can follow 2Gether Studio on Twitter

900
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,740
for weekly giveaways of swag from them,

901
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:04,860
and for a second, the publisher

902
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,940
of our recently released graphic novel,

903
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:09,140
which please, please get it.

904
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,820
Along those same lines, I stream on Twitch.

905
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,380
If you ever wanna check that out,

906
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:14,700
twitch.tv slash the Travis McElroy.

907
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:18,280
I've been getting good at Overwatch.

908
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,940
I'd love to see that.

909
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,940
I'm almost ready to do competition level.

910
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:23,780
Yeah.

911
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:24,600
Oh, yeah.

912
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,440
I've almost hit 25.

913
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,880
God help us when Travis puts that laser-like focus

914
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:31,260
onto a game that has competitive layers to it.

915
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,100
Well, this is what I'm saying.

916
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,660
At this point, boys, I'm getting paid

917
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,540
to play video games in front of people.

918
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,240
I'm a pro gamer.

919
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,080
Yep.

920
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,380
I mean, you're basically a pro gamer.

921
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,580
Put it on your card.

922
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,360

924
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,260
I mean, we can't, we're behind the scenes

925
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,200
on this one, folks.

926
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,040
Oh, yeah.

927
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:49,880
We have the scoop.

928
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:50,700
Yeah, we can't.

929
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,380
It's so rare that we're the one,

930
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:55,660
that you put up at the curtain and we're also there.

931
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:56,620
But it's coming.

932
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,200
Hey, do you want the final Yahoo?

933
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,260
Yes, please.

934
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:04,260
This one was sent in by, this one was sent by Nermal

935
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,940
from the Garfield comics.

936
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:07,780
Nermal?

937
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,100
Yeah, and thank you, Nermal.

938
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,700
It's not asked by Nermal, though.

939
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,700
It's asked by James.

940
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,540
Not Nermal?

941
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:19,540
Yeah, it's asked by James, who asks,

942
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:24,740
how many times have you gone to the movie store?

943
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,860
How many times have you been to the movie store

944
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:32,460
and they didn't have a copy of your favorite movie,

945
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:37,580
which was A Walk to Remember with Mandy Moore.

946
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:38,800
It's your favorite movie.

947
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:39,940
Thanks.

948
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:40,780
Love, James.
