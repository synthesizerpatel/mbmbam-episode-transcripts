1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,920
No prep, just go. This is that ice cold Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold.

6
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,120
This one's for them. Why did we practice? Why did we practice, Justin?

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,000
Griffin, your part's down. No, I'm just doing the dance.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,960
No, do it. Do the song. I gotta do the dance.

9
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,880
Okay, let's take it from the top. Griffin, you just edit all this out, yep.

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,040
Yeah, you'll clean it up. Just go, just go, just go, just go.

11
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,520
I'm fucking feeling it, I'm fucking hot. This is the- oh no, let me try again.

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, please don't start in that key. Yeah, I don't think we can-

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,160
This here, that ice cold Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold.

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,320
This one's for them hood girls, them good girls, straight masterpieces.

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,760
Smiling- Boop, boop.

16
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,560
What? Oh fuck.

17
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,120
I said that way. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,600
Griffin, you swore you weren't gonna do auto- Hot time, summer in the city.

19
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,880
Mash up, like Gungli. With your head down over your pieces, brother.

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,320
All right, listen. It's a track, it's a bore,

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,760
it's really, it's a pity I'm locked to a name I call the police and a fireman.

22
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,600
All right. Wait, hold on.

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,400
Are you just doing a secret world of Richard Scarry or whatever,

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,320
the busy world where you're just describing different professions someone could have?

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,840
The secret world.

26
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,880
Don't believe me, just one night in Bangkok with-

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,080
Oh, that's fucking good.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,960
That's good, right?

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,360
Don't believe me, just one night in Bangkok- You listening, Rocky Horror?

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
Hi, welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me.

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,320
If Justin's not gonna say it, I guess I fucking will.

32
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,080
It's an advice show for the modern era. I'm your young-

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,480
And a musical mashup, and a musical mashup.

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,320
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,800
This is Stop Podcasting Yourself. Thank you for listening to Stop Podcasting Yourself.

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,520
I'm Graham.

37
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,760
And I'm Jordan Morris, boy detective.

38
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,640
And I'm Marc Maron. Welcome to What If.

39
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,440
Is that not how you pronounce it?

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,320
I've always been curious how you pronounce it, because there's no vowels.

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,120
Is it just what if?

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,840
Hey, as long as it's not gonna be any kind of cohesion in this introduction at all,

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,360
I wanna abandon this Yahoo!

44
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,160
Because I'm just looking at it right now, and I think it's too mean for us to do,

45
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,960
and it's by Level 9000 Yajur Jujur Davenport.

46
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,520
And then the question, which is from Yahoo Answers user Dan,

47
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,560
is what is Lou Bega's net worth?

48
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,240
And I thought that would be like a front closer.

49
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,520
I thought it'd be a front closer, but then I decided it'd be too mean.

50
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,760
Until there's that cough button.

51
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,240
Justin, why did you buy a fucking cough button if you're not gonna use it?

52
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,200
All right, let me just cough again.

53
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,080
I can still hear it a little bit.

54
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,720
It sounded like he just got blasted through a wall behind a mattress.

55
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,280
Anyway, I did look it up on CelebrityNetWorth.com,

56
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,440
and it says he's worth a milli still.

57
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,520
So that's pretty good, I think.

58
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,760
I would think that to be on Celebrity Net Worth,

59
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,560
that's like probably the de facto setting.

60
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,120
Yeah, what if you clicked on him and it was just like 10 bucks?

61
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,440
When they launched that site, that's probably what they put in for everybody.

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,240
And then they're just like,

63
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,800
"'Cause I don't know, probably like a million dollars."

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,640
This is their Y2K, you know?

65
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,480
If anyone drops below a million dollars,

66
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
the computer wasn't designed to handle that.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,400
Gang, it goes a way lower than a milli.

68
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,920
Significantly lower than a milli, yeah.

69
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,520
Who's the famous person with the lowest net worth?

70
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,120
That should be tracked on there, right?

71
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,240
Like the poorest-

72
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,320
You should be able to search lowest to highest.

73
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,040
I just wanna see who we could get on the show for like a C note.

74
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,080
This is an advice here for the modern era.

75
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,680
I'm Errol's brother, Justin McElroy.

76
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,440
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

77
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,200
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

78
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,600
Francis McDormand is worth $10 million.

79
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,960
Way to go, Francis.

80
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,800
Keep up the great acting.

81
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,760
What about French Stewart?

82
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,440
Good question.

83
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,640
Griffin, search my name.

84
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,640
Yeah, I'll search Travis McElroy.

85
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,480
Says you're worth half of a pack of Starburst.

86
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,680
That seems low.

87
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,840
I've got three quarters of a pack sitting right here.

88
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,040
Somebody needs to update this.

89
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,400
Well, you also have to factor in the debt.

90
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,920
Oh no, I ate three of them.

91
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,880
They were right.

92
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,160
They were right all along.

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
This is an advice show for the modern era.

94
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,960
Don't believe me?

95
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,840
Just watch.

96
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,680
Brothers, I broke up with someone last year

97
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,960
that I was with for two years.

98
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,920
It's been great.

99
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,160
Because they were kind of a creepo.

100
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,920
For example, when I broke up with him,

101
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,640
they told me about a fetish I unknowingly fulfilled

102
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,000
for them during our relationship.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,280
Cool, cool, cool.

104
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,360
How the fuck can you not tell us what it is?

105
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,800
Yeah, I'm holding you personally responsible

106
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,840
for not telling us what it is.

107
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,280
I'm gonna say dollhouse play.

108
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,960
And I don't even know what the fuck that is.

109
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,120
Yeah, Griffin made that thing up that doesn't exist.

110
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,320
It's where you pretend to be characters from dollhouse.

111
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,200
Oh, good.

112
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,720
Yeah, with all the great character names I remember.

113
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,200
The only problem is there are a few things of mine

114
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,920
I'd like back and I have some of their things too.

115
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,440
It was a long distance relationship

116
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,720
so I can't go to their house to demand my things back.

117
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,320
They blocked me on Twitter and Facebook

118
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,000
so I can't contact them there.

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,520
I also deleted them from my phone

120
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,800
because I'm a giant dingus.

121
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,720
Should I make a new account

122
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,800
on either the sites to contact them

123
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,920
or would that be creepy?

124
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,160
That's from Ify in Indiana.

125
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,520
What is this stuff?

126
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,080
What is this stuff?

127
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,240
How good could this stuff be?

128
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,000
How good is this stuff?

129
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,520
I included this question

130
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,080
because it gave me a brilliant business idea.

131
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,880
How good?

132
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,720
That there should be like kind of like repo men

133
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
or like movers, a company,

134
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,560
like a third party company

135
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,800
that you could hire to handle the exchange of goods

136
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,200
left over at someone's house after you've broken up.

137
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,280
Homie, you're talking about a divorce lawyer.

138
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,840
No, no, no.

139
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,400
I mean like this is like somebody who just,

140
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,080
almost like who's the person who delivers the summons,

141
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,880
who delivers court documents

142
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,440
and they are always-

143
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,280
I think it's the high magistrate.

144
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,160
Yes, but just somebody whose job it is to like roll up

145
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,800
and be like, hey, Debra sent me

146
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,320
to get like her angel DVD box set

147
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,840
and like her favorite hooded sweatshirt.

148
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,240
Please don't make this more difficult than it has to be.

149
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,720
Okay, I don't think it's a bad idea conceptually.

150
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,480
Problems with it though include

151
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
if the person denies that they have it,

152
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,520
then what is like,

153
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,360
does that have to be arbitrated before

154
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,280
or is this person gonna have the full lethal force?

155
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,760
A full blown dog, the bounty hunter,

156
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,280
cavity surge like you got those DVDs at angel up you.

157
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,400
I know it.

158
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,040
I can see them right there fucking out of your butt.

159
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,680
You can't hide any Joss Whedon DVDs from dog.

160
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,240
You'll sniff them out no matter where they are inside you.

161
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,760
I just think that like, if you think about all this,

162
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,720
this happens all the time where people are like,

163
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,920
I don't care about the breakup,

164
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,680
but I miss like my favorite whatever.

165
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,160
Yeah.

166
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,760
I feel like this could be an even exchange

167
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,480
because they say I have some of their stuff too.

168
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
So this is like a same time, you know,

169
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,520
like you give me that, I'll give you this.

170
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,800
It's a one in one out exchange with the third party

171
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,440
like kind of handling so you don't have to see anybody.

172
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,120
There's some English on this ball

173
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
that I'm trying to come to terms with.

174
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,440
And it is if the, so the other person's a creeper

175
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,320
and if the question asker had ended up with their stuff,

176
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,400
I would have been like, that is your,

177
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
that's just their fee, you know what I mean?

178
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,960
Like you get that stuff for putting up with

179
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,600
what sounds like just sort of their whole

180
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,200
weird garbage demeanor.

181
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,520
And then congratulations, you've,

182
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,280
you earned that series DVDs of Angel

183
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,400
and then that's on them.

184
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,240
But for them to take the shit

185
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,960
and be a garbage demeanor creeper,

186
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,240
then that's doubly bad.

187
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,160
And I think it's time to stick the dog on them.

188
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,400
I think so too.

189
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,440
We can definitely agree that you should not see

190
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,120
this person in person, right?

191
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,080
Ever again.

192
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,200
Yeah, yeah.

193
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,040
Yeah, listen, and I don't have a problem

194
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,400
with the fact that someone has a fetish.

195
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,960
I want to make that clear before I make this next sentence,

196
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,280
which is the type of person that during a breakup

197
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,640
will be like, hey, by the way,

198
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,320
hey, I just want you to know

199
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,160
that like during that whole relationship,

200
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,000
you were doing this.

201
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,520
It's like, hey, time and place.

202
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,400
Like, yeah.

203
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,640
Well, yeah, the time is the zero death,

204
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,840
heat death of the universe

205
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,920
and the place is the garbage can where you live.

206
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,400
There's another, there's another danger though.

207
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
What if you know right now,

208
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,440
because of the space of time and distance,

209
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,760
like literal space, that this person is a creep.

210
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,880
But what if when you see them in person,

211
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,680
uh oh, here you come again.

212
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,240
No.

213
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,960
Just when I began to get myself together,

214
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,360
you hear birds and you're just like back.

215
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,880
Justin's not far off.

216
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,760
Thank you, Travis.

217
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,240
Whenever someone's like, I deleted them off my phone,

218
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,680
I deleted all this stuff,

219
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,920
that always to me sounds like someone going,

220
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
I was afraid like I would have won too many beers

221
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,120
and start texting them.

222
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,520
Or alternatively, the shit was so toxic

223
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,360
that you don't even want to see their fucking name anymore.

224
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,760
That's also possible.

225
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
Which is the other alternate like possibility.

226
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,800
Like, which makes,

227
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,680
which makes my service all the better, Griffin.

228
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,400
I think make a new,

229
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,880
I think make a new email account or whatever,

230
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,520
a new Twitter or whatever, a new Facebook or whatever,

231
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,080
and just call it like Dog the Bounty Hunter 2,

232
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,320
give me my fucking stuff back, Mark.

233
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,240
Like, I don't think there's any problem with that message.

234
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,080
I'm like, hey, don't block this account.

235
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,200
Give me my shit back.

236
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,080
I'm gonna call the dog,

237
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,120
I'm gonna stick the dogs on you.

238
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,640
This is your only warning.

239
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,140
Yeah.

240
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Maybe, or maybe you just like cut out the middleman

241
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,040
and you go to their house

242
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,160
and you nail a single like board to their front door.

243
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,280
And when they open up their front door,

244
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,040
they see this board and what's on that board,

245
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,480
it's a bloody paw print.

246
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,520
That's right, motherfucker.

247
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,400
Here come the dog.

248
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,000
The dogs are sniffing at you.

249
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,200
Dog, he's sniffing.

250
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
He's sniffing around the dog.

251
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,960
How about Yahoo?

252
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,080
Yeah, this one was,

253
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,160
can I just say Zoe Kinski sent in a million this week

254
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,880
and they were all fucking stellar

255
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,480
and we need to come up with a new name for her.

256
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,000
Somebody suggested Zoe Kinski, top of that ladder.

257
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,440
That's not, it's bad.

258
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,560
Top of the food chain?

259
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,360
What about this?

260
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,800
Zoe Kinski, top of the world.

261
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,040
Riding high.

262
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,480
Riding high, Zoe Kinski.

263
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,920
Riding high is very good.

264
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,200
Let's do it.

265
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,560
Zoe Kinski, riding high.

266
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,040
Thank you, Zoe.

267
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user,

268
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,280
a stranger.

269
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,480
Oh, no.

270
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,880
Who asks?

271
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,640
At least it's uh and not the.

272
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,840
Yeah, my girlfriend lives in Tokyo.

273
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,680
Is a body, no, she doesn't exist.

274
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,160
She doesn't.

275
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,280
Is a body pillow with my picture on it

276
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,280
as a Christmas gift weird or cute?

277
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,880
Okay, so we've been dating a year now.

278
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,560
She was a foreign exchange student to America.

279
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,320
She doesn't exist.

280
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,400
And she left back to Japan.

281
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,440
She didn't need to book a ticket

282
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,000
because non-existent people don't need to

283
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,120
for at least nine months a couple months ago.

284
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,960
Uh, I was thinking I would get her a body pillow

285
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
and a custom print pillow case.

286
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,080
The pillow case would be,

287
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,920
the pillow case would be,

288
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,640
what, sorry, go ahead.

289
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,520
Do your thing.

290
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,040
I just, no, I want,

291
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,720
it's important that I say this now.

292
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,000
As much as I always love further details

293
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,360
in Yahoo questions,

294
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,600
if this person does not think

295
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,440
that after the initial question,

296
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,120
we had a perfect fucking crystal clear

297
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,080
technicolor image of every moment of their entire,

298
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,120
I feel like I've watched Ken Burns' This Dude

299
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,560
like over the past eight hours.

300
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,200
It's like a sci-fi episode of a show

301
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,600
where like you see the entire like lifetime play out

302
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
and then the person wakes up

303
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,640
and it's all been like an implanted memory

304
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,320
and they're still like 23.

305
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,680
That's how I feel about this person.

306
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,760
I've lived this person's life

307
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,840
through the headline of this question.

308
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,160
It is the for sale baby shoes.

309
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,320
I was gonna say that literal exact thing.

310
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,120
Weird.

311
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,560
Of Yahoo answers.

312
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,920
I get all of it.

313
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,400
Okay, the pillow case would be a picture of me

314
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,080
with a white background on one side,

315
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,840
completely non-sexual by the way,

316
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,080
no nude or suggestive images

317
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,520
and probably a pic of Mammoth Mountain

318
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,760
with us in the distant background on the other side

319
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,080
since it might be tacky to have a life-size pic of me

320
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,360
on display at all times.

321
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
Additional details.

322
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,560
She is also a pillow.

323
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,600
That's weird, right?

324
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,320
The idea of like,

325
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,720
and now a scenic tableau of that trip we took once

326
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,560
to go up with that.

327
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,680
Anyway, and the last thing-

328
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,520
Because I couldn't decide between a pillow

329
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,280
and one of those digital photo frames.

330
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Yeah, the last thing I'll do

331
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,040
is put in a cheapo voice recorder.

332
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,200
You really don't wanna splurge on this.

333
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,040
With my voice recorded saying good night or I love you.

334
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,240
Something along those lines.

335
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,200
It's supposed to be a little thing

336
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,040
to help her feel less sad when she goes to bed

337
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,160
since I know we both miss being under one roof.

338
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,880
Anyway, I just wanna get some people's opinion on this gift.

339
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,680
Let's hate the sin, not the center

340
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,120
in this particular question.

341
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,680
I think like-

342
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,480
I got it, Griffin.

343
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,440
I've got the best,

344
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,680
like the first thing that clicked into my head was this.

345
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,640
And this, I wanna be 100% explicitly clear,

346
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,600
this is sin.

347
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,800
I haven't figured out which one yet,

348
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,240
but it's definitely in-

349
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,960
Idolatry.

350
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,720
Probably, yeah.

351
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,400
But the problem here is that

352
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,160
this is the type of president that if-

353
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,160
This is the type of president-

354
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,880
Wait, what?

355
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,000
Now just keep signing Ted Cruz.

356
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,280
This is the type of president

357
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,840
that if you are uncertain enough to turn to Yahoo,

358
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,280
the answer is no.

359
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,600
Especially when you include a cheapo voice recorder in it.

360
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,760
I gotta ask something that I've had to ask you

361
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
like a disappointing number of times lately.

362
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,600
And is that funny?

363
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,680
Is that gonna be a funny thing to go down?

364
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,880
The answer, if the answer is no,

365
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,200
then we can't talk about how we could tweak this

366
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,520
and twerk it and take it to the fucking body shop

367
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,480
and get it going so right.

368
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,920
We can't take it to West Coast Customs-

369
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,880
Well, let's reshape it.

370
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,560
If pillow isn't the answer,

371
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,800
what other thing could you put your face on

372
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,760
that now becomes like a slam dunk 100% most definite swish?

373
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,200
Let me hit you with this.

374
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,640
What do you think about this?

375
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,600
A dinner plate.

376
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,240
Then they finish up their meal

377
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,440
and it's just your face like,

378
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,880
how is that lasagna?

379
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,240
Good job.

380
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,800
Was that lasagna?

381
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,080
Good job, sweetie.

382
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,360
My clean plate girl.

383
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,720
Good job, spaghetti.

384
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,080
Good job, spaghetti girl.

385
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,200
It's our baby.

386
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,520
Babe, it's our favorite meal.

387
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,720
Good job, spaghetti.

388
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,200
We would eat it together under the same roof together

389
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,480
and I would watch it just,

390
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,120
by which I mean,

391
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,240
I would just sort of hold it up

392
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,920
and drop it right on the floor

393
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,280
because you're a specter of my imagination.

394
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,560
You can't put it on her car

395
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,680
because then everybody's gonna think

396
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,080
she works for a Dylan delivery service.

397
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,200
That's no good.

398
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,280
That's my favorite Studio Ghibli movie.

399
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,680
It was next to my neighbor Dylan

400
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,560
and Dylan dillined away.

401
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,880
Did you hear about Deborah?

402
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,520
Yeah, she got dillined away.

403
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,160
Her fucking parents ate Dylan's snacks,

404
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,200
turned into pigs,

405
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,120
which made her work in a bath shop.

406
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,920
It sucked.

407
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,200
It dillined away.

408
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,280
Beautiful, beautiful film though.

409
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,320
It was beautiful.

410
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,120
Beautifully shot.

411
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,880
And also Dylan in Madagascar.

412
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,920
Was that one of his joints?

413
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,320
They did Madagascar.

414
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,680
I did Kung Fu Panda 3.

415
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,360
Is it, maybe it's something where you cut out-

416
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,400
Dylan spickable me?

417
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,640
Okay, sorry.

418
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,520
Maybe you just get one of those big head cutout things.

419
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,000
You put it over her bed on the ceiling.

420
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,560
Yes.

421
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,840
So as she goes to sleep,

422
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,640
you're just looking,

423
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,080
you're looking over her,

424
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,760
protecting her in the night times.

425
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,640
And she'll just think about how it looks

426
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,680
like some sort of demon has lifted you up to the skies.

427
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,320
Oh yeah, the look on your face

428
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,160
will need to be one of horror.

429
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,840
Yeah, if you could make it so that

430
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,000
just like a single drop of blood

431
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,040
comes out of that weird ceiling body

432
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,760
that you put up there like every 20 minutes or so.

433
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,240
I would say every four hours

434
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,080
because that's enough where you're gonna forget.

435
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,920
That's gonna be really upsetting.

436
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,800
Like, here's that, there's that cough button.

437
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,560
Can I say if you draw attention to it?

438
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,480
But Justin, before you hit the cough button,

439
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:38,960
you're going,

440
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,760
okay, so I should hold it in for all that.

441
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,440
It's a fucking dubstep drop.

442
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,720
Like, I'm proud of you.

443
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,000
I think the audience is happy.

444
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,680
Well, I edit those fuckers out.

445
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,440
So like, I'm the happiest,

446
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,280
like about the situation that is possible.

447
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,040
But I think it's like an inner,

448
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,600
it's an important new cast member on the show.

449
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,000
It's Griffin, Justin, Travis, and Coffee.

450
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,840
They're not, Coffee's a thing, but.

451
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,880
Yeah, Coffee's been a part of this show for a long time.

452
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,080
Wheeze, Wheezebo.

453
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,280
He gets all the wheezing out.

454
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,880
What if, can I suggest this?

455
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,720
What if you put your face on a coffee mug?

456
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,040
What if you put it inside the coffee mug

457
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,560
at the bottom of the drink?

458
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,520
So you finish it and there's just like a speech bubble

459
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,720
like, you're ready to go.

460
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,720
I got a better idea.

461
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,320
How's your day?

462
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,520
Here's to pick me up.

463
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,200
What if you made it so that you get

464
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,040
like a ceramic recreation of the top of your head

465
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,040
and you sort of put it parallel

466
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,680
with the drink hole on top of the cup

467
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,920
so that it looks like the cup opening

468
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,360
and hole of the coffee cup

469
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,360
is a gaping, giant, grotesque mouth of yours.

470
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,960
And then it's like you're barfing

471
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,720
that good brown energy liquid

472
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,920
just right into her mouth like a baby bird would do.

473
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,680
I've said all that and it was a bad idea.

474
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,080
Yeah, that's all right though.

475
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,480
There's no bad ideas in brainstorming, Griffin.

476
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,280
You're right.

477
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,920
But that was.

478
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,040
Sometimes you don't know what's gonna be good or bad

479
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,560
until you get it out there.

480
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,160
You gotta throw the coffee mug at the wall

481
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,120
and see what sticks.

482
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,280
Did I say that I maybe described it wrong?

483
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,440
Could you visualize it good like I was saying?

484
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,240
It was like a person's mouth was the opening.

485
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,560
Yeah, like it would be like a clown at a mini golf.

486
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,080
No, yeah, that was clear.

487
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,400
And then every time, but I want you to envision

488
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,080
every time you take a drink of that cup

489
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,520
you're like confronting getting very close face to face

490
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,080
with your boyfriend almost like he's challenging you

491
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,560
with every sip as you lift his face to greet your own.

492
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,960
That was actually, that was the fetish

493
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,160
from the first question.

494
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,480
Shit.

495
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,160
Baby birding.

496
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,920
Can I read a question?

497
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,680
Yeah.

498
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,760
Okay, because I really like this one.

499
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,880
Welcome to the big show.

500
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,720
I hope I don't blow it.

501
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,160
I recently went to a liquor store

502
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,040
and bought a magnum of wine to last me the week.

503
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,200
On the walk home, I stopped in the grocery store

504
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,840
and proceeded to drop the full magnum of wine

505
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,640
which proceeded to shatter and spill out on the floor.

506
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
I quickly got someone who works at the store

507
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,760
to let them know and then walked out feeling embarrassed.

508
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,320
As I walked home though, I started to feel guilty

509
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,560
that I seemingly walked into a store,

510
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,120
smashed the bottle and then walked out.

511
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,520
Brothers, should I have waited while they cleaned up

512
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,280
or offered to help in some way?

513
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,680
And that's from No More Wine in New York.

514
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,120
Um, oh man, what a fun situation.

515
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,160
The worst.

516
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,480
Why did you, it's weird, the weird thing to me,

517
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,040
I guess New York, like, they don't have grocery stores

518
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,560
in New York, so you have to go to like Jim's Ham Depot

519
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,720
and get your ham and then you have to go to the,

520
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,000
to the root vegetable depot and a lot of depots.

521
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,080
Um, so you do have to like stop in like 16 different

522
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,560
discreet places just to like get the components

523
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,440
of a single meal.

524
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,000
Um, because to me, it's, it's weird to think like,

525
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,120
oh, I bought a big bottle of wine.

526
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,480
Now it's time to go to the grocery store.

527
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,320
Big bottle of wine, now it's time to go take this

528
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,920
and me and my, my grapey buddy to a second location.

529
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,360
Um, that part is weird.

530
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,400
That part's weird to me.

531
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,120
Should you feel bad?

532
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,880
No, that's like their, that's their job.

533
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,000
But you should feel bad.

534
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,920
I, I, I hate this situation for you so much

535
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,640
because you bought what was supposed to last you a week

536
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,040
and you lost it in moments.

537
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,920
And like, that's so painful to me.

538
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,360
I, like, I-

539
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,320
You're sad, wait, you're sad because the wine died.

540
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
The wine died, Griffin.

541
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,360
That was gonna be their wine compatriot that was like,

542
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,880
hey, you and me for the week.

543
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,800
This is like my ration of wine and you lost it.

544
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,000
And like, you're not gonna get, you walked home in shame

545
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,400
and you're gonna punish yourself for the week

546
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,400
because you made like the stock boy clean up your magnum mess.

547
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,320
And I, ah.

548
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,680
Is there a similar situation?

549
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,160
Is there anything worse than breaking a glass

550
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,800
while you're at a bar or a restaurant and being like,

551
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,040
I made a, I made a uh oh.

552
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,320
Yeah, there is something worse.

553
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,880
Bringing a glass from another restaurant,

554
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,240
smashing it on the floor

555
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,200
because that's what this person did.

556
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,560
Yeah, but that's not, that's not theirs.

557
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,800
Like, if I, I would rather somebody came in my house

558
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,200
and like shattered some dishes that they brought from home

559
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,400
and do it to my own shit.

560
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,320
I, I, I went on a bunk, a bunk trike,

561
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,840
by which I mean a drunk bike.

562
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,880
They should call it that

563
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,400
because once you reach a certain point,

564
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,520
that's how you called it.

565
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,600
Um, I want a drunk, what's it called?

566
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,560
Like you get on a petty-

567
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,360
The Pedal Wagon.

568
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,240
Pedal Wagon, yeah.

569
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,080
And I got, went on a bar crawl

570
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,120
and we stopped at one place

571
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,360
that had a little arcade in the back.

572
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,400
And so me and a buddy were,

573
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,760
I put in some quarters to play some

574
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,920
Super Street Fighter II Turbo Championship Edition.

575
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,120
I was like, fuck yeah, here we go.

576
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,480
Almost as soon as I put the quarters in

577
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,560
and began my campaign as E-Honda,

578
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,320
I put my drink down on the NBA jam machine.

579
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,400
Not realizing that the console I put that on-

580
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,440
It's a sloped console.

581
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,080
It was at about maybe like a 60 degree angle.

582
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,000
It's not sloped, oh great.

583
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,160
And so my glass broke and I was torn

584
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,760
because there was broken glass on the floor.

585
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,400
It was a hazard.

586
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,360
But I'd just begun my game of Street Fighter II Turbo Edition.

587
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,280
What did you do?

588
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,160
I just-

589
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,440
Don't leave me in suspense.

590
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,080
I stood there.

591
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,040
Somebody came and cleaned it up.

592
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,840
It wasn't a big deal.

593
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,440
While you continued playing,

594
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,960
like you just like lifted your feet up

595
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,920
without looking at them

596
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,000
so they could sleep around your toes.

597
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,120
It was 50 cents.

598
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,400
It was two quarters.

599
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,600
Listen, I get it.

600
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,080
Uh, question after the next time this happens

601
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,240
and you drop it and it shouldn't happen again

602
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,280
and it shatters on the ground,

603
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,800
I want you to loudly announce

604
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,440
the Piggly Wiggly sends their regards

605
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,480
and then storm out.

606
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,640
I, uh, here, if this,

607
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,920
this is not necessarily a funny thing to say,

608
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,880
but it is the truth.

609
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,680
You couldn't have helped cleaned up

610
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,840
because they, I'm sure, have, uh-

611
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,160
Yeah.

612
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,440
Like insurance policies that do not protect them

613
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,840
if like customers get hurt in their store.

614
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,560
If you were cleaning up your own shit in the store

615
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,280
and then you got cut,

616
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,640
then that could be a lawsuit for them.

617
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,160
So they wouldn't let you help anyway.

618
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,360
And it would have been way worse

619
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,000
if you had just stood there watching them clean up.

620
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,280
That was the right thing.

621
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,880
That was literally the worst thing you could,

622
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,040
like that would be worse than kicking their teeth in.

623
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,840
Mop up my, mop up my, uh-oh.

624
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,320
Scrub my whoopsie.

625
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,040
Because if you take that a step further,

626
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,240
you're concerned if you're someone

627
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,880
who just seemed to walk in, smash a thing and leave.

628
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,120
It's way worse to be a person who walked in,

629
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,800
smashed a thing so they could watch others clean it up.

630
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,720
Like that's a way worse person to be.

631
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,600
Uh, okay. Um, I have a fucking great solution.

632
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,600
And this is a new thing that everybody can do.

633
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,120
Uh, anytime you want, okay?

634
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,600
You ready?

635
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,720
I'm gonna change this person's life and everybody's life.

636
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,600
Next time you do something that's like so embarrassing

637
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,720
that you think you're never,

638
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,800
like you make a huge mess in a place

639
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,080
or you like, you, you're like, like happen to this person,

640
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,200
you smash a bottle or whatever,

641
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,440
just run for the door.

642
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,600
And right as you hit the door, as you're about to leave,

643
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,120
shout, jackass four, coming to theaters next year.

644
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,160
Run out the door.

645
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,520
So anytime you bust your ass.

646
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,920
Bust your ass, you fall, you knock something over, whatever.

647
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,600
Point at a bush and say, did you get that?

648
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,080
Did you get it?

649
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,520
Point at a bush, say, did you get it?

650
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,920
Or like get your, uh, camera phone out

651
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,400
and act like you're like talking into it.

652
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,960
Like you're getting some like gorilla footage.

653
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,600
And then just shout, jackass four, come to theaters next year.

654
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Yeah, you crash your car into another car.

655
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,320
You'd be like, ah, got you punked, season three.

656
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,680
I'm Johnny Canoxville.

657
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,480
And then you run away.

658
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,320
What's up, wild boys?

659
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,000
Fuck you and your Jeep, later.

660
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,080
I got you season four.

661
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,840
Bam's here, the whole team.

662
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,720
It's Bam town.

663
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,680
And then you run away.

664
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,600
Justin, I thought you were going to go a different way.

665
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,400
I thought we were on another like psychic link thing

666
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,640
where my idea was for situations like this,

667
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,000
where there is no good solution.

668
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,240
What if everybody just carried a bag of treats around with them

669
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,360
and then it's like their last resort, whoopsie bag.

670
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,120
And it's like, if you drop a bottle of wine

671
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,960
and somebody else has to clean it up

672
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,680
and there's no good, there's no good solution for this problem.

673
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,560
So maybe you just like reach in and you'd be like, fuck.

674
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,400
All right, well, listen, obviously I goofed up

675
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,680
and you're having to deal with it.

676
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,800
So what do you like?

677
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,080
Like a fun size Snickers.

678
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,840
I've got like little puzzles in here.

679
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,600
I've got super high bouncy balls.

680
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,920
I've got some home.

681
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,200
I got one of those, you know,

682
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,960
those little plastic homies that you could get

683
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,960
from the little gosh upon machines.

684
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,040
I got a couple of those if that's what you're into.

685
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,880
And I have one slimy hand left.

686
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,240
So which is it gonna be?

687
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,040
Which is it gonna be?

688
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,200
I would take the slimy hand if I were you

689
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,960
because that's like, you can get a lot of fun out of it.

690
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,760
You always gotta dig to the bottom to find the foam plane.

691
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,160
And it's never gonna be good.

692
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,600
Like, yeah.

693
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,200
But you love the idea of it

694
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,320
because it's like, oh, it's like a World War II fighter plane.

695
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,120
But it's gonna last you like 30 seconds in the real world.

696
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,760
It basically turns your life into one of those

697
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,440
hair redemption machines at Fantastic Sam's.

698
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,520
Yeah, boy, that's gonna be an extremely local joke.

699
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,080
Now there's Fantastic Sam's all over the fucking place.

700
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,440
But do they do the hair machine there?

701
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,960
They don't even do it at the Fantastic Sam's in Huntington.

702
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,760
They realized they were losing a ton of money on toys

703
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,240
and the hair was not covering the cost.

704
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,800
I still wish I could figure out how the fuck they did this though.

705
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,760
Just to explain it.

706
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,880
And no, don't, don't explain it.

707
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,080
Because if you don't know what I'm talking about,

708
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,760
it's gonna sound fucking wild.

709
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,400
It's gonna sound wild.

710
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,360
There was a little, okay, it was a box.

711
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,000
You can't pretend like you know how this shit works either.

712
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,640
There was a box where the TV was.

713
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,920
Right, and underneath that box, there was a flap, right?

714
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,720
Some sort of, almost like a cat door into this machine.

715
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,680
And then you open the machine and you throw your hair into it.

716
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,840
You like scoop up some of your hair off the floor

717
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,440
and you throw it into the machine.

718
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,760
And then something happens.

719
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,360
I don't, a wizard turns your hair into toys.

720
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,040
And then all of a sudden, there's a toy there and no more hair.

721
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,120
So don't piss that wizard off

722
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,400
when he's just like walking down the street,

723
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,680
like you bump shoulders and you're like,

724
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,880
watch it, loser.

725
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,000
And he's like, oh yeah?

726
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,720
Your fucking hair is Starbursts now, asshole.

727
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,200
Oh god damn it, not again.

728
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,440
Oh no, hey bro, your hair is homies.

729
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,800
Deal with it, idiot.

730
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,720
Maybe think about that next time

731
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,160
before you fuck with a hair lock.

732
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,000
I don't know if that was,

733
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,840
we'll probably get some good emails and tweets about that

734
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,840
to let us know if that was just a,

735
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,360
because they don't even do it there anymore.

736
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,920
Also, Fantastic Sam's,

737
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,160
this is something the women at Fantastic Sam's told me

738
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,640
that I was not aware of,

739
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,520
that all of the men and women

740
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,480
that worked at Fantastic Sam's had to use,

741
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,920
they couldn't use their own names.

742
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,880
So we're saying, you're telling me that Sonny at Fantastic Sam's

743
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,080
is not named Sonny?

744
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,960
Wait a minute.

745
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,080
Sonny works at Master Cuts.

746
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,360
And also too, they don't do this anymore.

747
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,840
But they used to not let people use their names.

748
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,160
Why?

749
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,680
Government.

750
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,760
Because they wanted it to be like a chain,

751
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,760
like a uniformity of experience.

752
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,280
So like they wanted you to not,

753
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,360
I mean that's like Dr. Fucking Who?

754
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,240
It's like a mantle pass from person to person?

755
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,720
Exactly.

756
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,320
I'm Batman.

757
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,200
Like what?

758
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,040
What are you talking, how could that,

759
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,240
what business, why would they do that?

760
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,360
Nobody else does that.

761
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,680
It's like you can't go to Taco Bell and be like,

762
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,400
yo David, where's David at?

763
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,840
Which one of you is David?

764
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,440
Because there's one in every Taco Bell.

765
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,360
Where's my Taco Bell Dave?

766
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,880
Is there a Dave here?

767
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,320
I also think though that it's like,

768
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,040
it's the, like they didn't want you to go open up your own,

769
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,760
like if you left Fantastic Sam's,

770
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,120
you could not take your customers with you

771
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,400
because they could never find you again.

772
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,560
So like if you leaned in and you're like,

773
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,320
my real name is Tom,

774
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,920
like all the other people would turn around,

775
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,360
sirens would drop from the ceiling,

776
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,640
he'd be dragged away.

777
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,280
Yes, right.

778
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,000
And a different David would come out

779
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,520
to finish cutting your hair.

780
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,560
I've always been David,

781
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,840
I don't know what you're talking about.

782
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,800
The sphere from the island would just like float over

783
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,920
and just consume them?

784
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,520
Nope, not crime.

785
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,600
Well, it's sort of like on Flavor of Love,

786
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,800
when the women would get evicted

787
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,920
from the Flavor of Love house,

788
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,440
they would lose their nicknames

789
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,280
and they would get their real names back.

790
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,560
Like they had to earn them.

791
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,640
Like as soon as they were eliminated by Flav,

792
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,680
they would no longer be like Stinkweave or whatever

793
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,720
their fake name was.

794
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,000
And they could be like Jillian again.

795
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,440
Oh man, you've just pitched a wonderful dating reality show

796
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:11,680
where it's all about them.

797
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,200
Yeah, it's called Flavor of Love, Travis.

798
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
No, no, no, imagine this where it's like

799
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
the 20 women and they're all trying to compete

800
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,040
to get kicked off so they can be free

801
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,640
and earn their names back and like return to their lives.

802
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,400
That is actually not too far.

803
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,000
That's actually pretty close.

804
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,760
Later seasons, especially.

805
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,720
Let's go to the Money Zone

806
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,520
so we don't have to kickstart this brave new

807
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,960
vision for reality television.

808
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,040
You need to know how to cook.

809
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,160
It's really important and it's really fun.

810
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,680
And I used to think that I had some vague idea

811
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,960
and that was before Blue Apron.

812
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,480
I've been using Blue Apron for almost,

813
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,520
I would guess a year and a half, maybe two years almost.

814
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,200
And it has taught me so much.

815
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,200
I know it sounds like I'm getting choked up

816
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,320
like it's the most moving thing,

817
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,400
but really it's just my throat hurts.

818
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,840
But for less than $10 a meal,

819
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,600
Blue Apron delivers all the fresh ingredients

820
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,680
you need to create home cooked meals.

821
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,920
You just follow the easy step-by-step instructions.

822
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,680
So even if you don't know how to cook,

823
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,680
it's so easy with pictures and everything.

824
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,560
What Justin said, no kidding.

825
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,240
I love cooking Blue Apron.

826
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,880
The meals are great.

827
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,680
And no matter what your dietary preferences,

828
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,760
they make it really easy to cook stuff.

829
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,920
What's in it this week?

830
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,720
Let me check.

831
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,520
I got it right here.

832
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,240
I got it right here.

833
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,280
What are we cooking?

834
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,920
Salmon with roasted Brussels sprouts and potato hash.

835
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,960
Fuck yes.

836
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,360
Now this is triple pork.

837
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,280
It's probably like Mazabon or something,

838
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,720
but it looks like Mazeman.

839
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,520
So I'm going to go with triple pork Mazeman

840
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,480
with garlic chives.

841
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,120
I think that's actually just Guy Fieri's like medicine name.

842
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,200
I'm triple pork Mazeman.

843
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,560
Last week they had curry chicken over coconut grits.

844
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,200
It was so awesome.

845
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,480
But like Justin said,

846
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,680
like the cooking that stuff is great

847
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,880
and the meals are great and they're really,

848
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,560
they're good for you.

849
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,640
And they also have vegetarian and vegan options.

850
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,240
But what Justin said is true.

851
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,080
Like I, even when I cook stuff,

852
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,600
not using the ingredients they send,

853
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,120
like I am better at cooking.

854
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,520
Like I understand the fundamentals of cooking

855
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,800
way, way, way, way better

856
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,480
because they teach you how to do it.

857
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,120
It's awesome.

858
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,680
It's so great.

859
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,200
Yeah.

860
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,760
So right now you can get your first two meals for free

861
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,920
at blueapron.com slash my brother.

862
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,200
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

863
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,920
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

864
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,760
I want to talk for a second about Squarespace.

865
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,720
They're sponsoring the show this week

866
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,520
and they are also the site at which I built mcroyshows.com.

867
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,000
And I cannot stress enough that going into it,

868
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,280
I knew basically nothing about website building.

869
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,840
I don't know anything about coding.

870
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,760
I don't know anything about the internet.

871
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,360
I don't know how computers work.

872
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,080
Travis thought that-

873
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,200
I don't know what eyeballs do.

874
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,320
Travis thought that your monitor was like digital paper

875
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,400
and every time you went to a website,

876
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,000
it printed it out somehow onto the monitor.

877
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,480
Just bit by bit, piece by piece.

878
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,480
But Squarespace is so user-friendly and intuitive

879
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,000
that after about 45 seconds, I was like,

880
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,040
oh, I get this.

881
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,800
And I was able to create a website

882
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,040
that people have just keep telling me

883
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,320
looks very professional and is really easy to navigate.

884
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,840
And it was so simple to do.

885
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,320
It took me about an hour to make a website

886
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,400
that I'm super proud of and does everything I needed to do.

887
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,760
And I'm able to continually update as we add new stuff.

888
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,680
And I think of new things to put on it.

889
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,000
And it's so easy, you guys.

890
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,200
I highly recommend it.

Roslyn Ricketts, the moment has come

896
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,920
for us to pass a long message from Justin Sunset.

897
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,360
You didn't want to read their nickname?

898
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,840
You didn't want to give her a damn nickname?

899
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,400
Roslyn, quote, monster Ricketts.

900
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,240
Why would you read that?

901
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,360
That's so good.

902
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,560
It sounds like something that you get

903
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,600
if you don't eat vitamin D for like a super duper long time.

904
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,400
It's like after you get regular Ricketts,

905
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,000
you get monster Ricketts.

906
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,560
Roslyn Monster Ricketts, Justin Sunset has this to say.

907
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,520
I hope you get this in time to say happy 29th birthday

908
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,240
to the most amazing set of getaway sticks I've ever seen.

909
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,760
And I really hope you're up to date on your podcast backlog.

910
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,480
Otherwise, I'm at a heap of shit for not getting you a gift.

911
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,800
Thanks for putting that pressure on us, Shesto.

912
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,120
Well, don't worry because we didn't even come close to the date.

913
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,320
This one's on us.

914
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,960
Hey, Roslyn, I can't stress enough how great Justin thinks you are.

915
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,800
And this is our fault.

916
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:56,160
Well, this is on us, but I think we could actually put this on nobody

917
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,360
because it says if she's behind her back, her catalog,

918
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,600
she may not get to this until like fucking 2018.

919
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,040
And then it doesn't matter.

920
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Right. The timeliness aspect has been lost entirely.

921
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,000
And you know what?

922
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,720
The thing is, is like well wishes and happy birthday.

923
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,840
It's good for the whole year.

924
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,160
Great point, Travis.

925
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,560
Except not, it's extremely timely.

926
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,040
Except not.

927
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,080
We really, we blew it.

928
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,280
We fucking blew it.

929
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,000
Got another message here and this one's for Julia Boolya.

930
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,280
And it's from Dad.

931
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,360
Dad's, my, is this planned?

932
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,120
No, this is just the universal like platonic idea of dad.

933
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,680
Oh, God. Okay. Dad says to Julia Boolya,

934
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,640
don't get me wrong.

935
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,840
I love my new job with Alcatraz Cell house tours,

936
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,080
but I'm so bummed that I had to cancel my trip to the LA podcast fest.

937
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,280
I'm glad you were able to use your ticket and see the brothers McElroy.

938
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,720
Thanks for texting the photo.

939
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,480
Why was Justin laughing so hard?

940
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,600
Love, Dad.

941
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,640
We'll never know.

942
00:34:52,640 --> 00:35:00,720
Well, probably because Justin had him some crevasse and he drank it down smooth.

943
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,600
There was a little bit of mixology happening there,

944
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,440
but not as much as you maybe would have liked.

945
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,760
And yeah.

946
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,520
Depending on when you caught me at the LA podcast festival,

947
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,600
like I don't think I did a lot, did I?

948
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,480
Did I drink a lot?

949
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,560
It was just-

950
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,280
Would you say?

951
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,040
You, no, you were just stiff Bevin.

952
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,160
Okay.

953
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,320
I don't think you drink a lot,

954
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,800
but if I were to give you like a nickname for the day,

955
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,400
it would be Stiff Bevins.

956
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,680
Stiff Bevins.

957
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,560
I do want to say Julia taking pictures during the show was illegal,

958
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,760
so someone should be along shortly to confiscate that

959
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,720
and maybe take you in for some time.

960
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,600
Don't worry about it.

961
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,720
Thank you for your support.

962
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,240
Hi, my name is Stiff Bevins.

963
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,240
If you need a phone confiscated,

964
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,160
there's only one name to turn to.

965
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,720
Look it up in the yellow pages.

966
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,400
Or you can find me at Bob Evans.

967
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,040
Stiff Bevins Bob Evans.

968
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,160
It's a franchise spin-off.

969
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,760
Not that those exist.

970
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,560
You like steak?

971
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,160
Don't have it.

972
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,880
Got mashed potatoes.

973
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,520
I'll shape them into anything.

974
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,600
I'll make them into the shape of Robert Evans.

975
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,200
Come have the Robert Evans mashed potatoes

976
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,520
at Stiff Bevins' Bob Evans.

977
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,760
Oh, Justin's broken.

978
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,400
Let's be honest.

979
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,600
We live in a world with too much media.

980
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,040
You need a podcast on the front lines figuring out what's great.

981
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,080
We're here for you.

982
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,040
We're Pop Rocket.

983
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,160
I am Guy Branum.

984
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,360
I'm a comedian.

985
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,160
I'm Wynton Mitchell.

986
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,000
I call myself a digital strategist.

987
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,960
I'm Oliver Wang, academic and disc junkie.

988
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,200
Margaret Wappler, je suis as journalist.

989
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,000

992
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,560
Find us in iTunes or wherever you download podcasts.

993
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,040
Pop Rocket, every Wednesday from MaximumFun.org.

994
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,080
I got another Yahoo here from Zoe Kinski.

995
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,800
Yahoo.

996
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,760
It's by Yahoo Answers.

997
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,040
Yahoo's going out of business, isn't it?

998
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,840
Are you worried this is going to be a nonrenewable resource?

999
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,880
Do we need to do a GoFundMe to buy Yahoo Answers?

1000
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,960
I don't think, I think we could probably save Yahoo

1001
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,680
if we just give them that sound clip of you saying Yahoo

1002
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,480
at the beginning of the answer and then they can use it like the new,

1003
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,840
you know how they used to do Yahoo, everyone hated that.

1004
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,560
But if we do it, can you just break it off again for me?

1005
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,340
Yahoo.

1006
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,280
No, it wasn't as good the second time.

1007
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,480
It's from Yahoo Answers user, something's gone wrong.

1008
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,400
We will call them, Stiff Bevans asks,

1009
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,280
can you cook and eat the beans from a beanbag chair?

1010
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,560
From a beanbag chair?

1011
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,320
Let me hit you guys with this idea.

1012
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,240
I pause it.

1013
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,400
When you cook a meat, you're not supposed to eat that meat raw.

1014
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,680
Don't do that, you'll get very sick.

1015
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,960
There's toxins in there.

1016
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,760
If you cook it enough though, you can make anything,

1017
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
you can cook the toxins right out of anything.

1018
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,920
They used to eat their shoes in the Civil War.

1019
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,040
Revolutionary War?

1020
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,160
Probably both.

1021
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,440
Probably, I think most wars,

1022
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,760
probably somebody's gotten down on some shoe eating.

1023
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,040
Times are tight in the trenches.

1024
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,240
Can you cook and eat the beans from a beanbag chair?

1025
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,360
I think if you blast them for long enough.

1026
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,600
You know, the problem is, Kevin,

1027
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,960
they're so worried about if they could,

1028
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,560
they didn't stop to think about if they should.

1029
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,320
I mean, they shouldn't.

1030
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:22,800
No, Travis.

1031
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,760
Because then what do you know?

1032
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,320
But then when you sit on, you've cost yourself a chair.

1033
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,360
Well, I don't think you need to take all of the-

1034
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,520
Yeah, how many servings are in a beanbag chair?

1035
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,320
Yeah, that's how they measure beanbag chairs is by servings.

1036
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,880
I think that would be a big robust meal

1037
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,000
if you tried to party down on a whole bag chair.

1038
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,360
A sumo could feed a family for like a year.

1039
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,760
I mean, it's all polystyrene.

1040
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,280
I don't think you should eat that.

1041
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,360
Is that like a saying?

1042
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,480
It's all polystyrene to me, or what are you saying?

1043
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,120
No, I mean, it's like, they're filled with polystyrene.

1044
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,320
You probably shouldn't eat that.

1045
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,360
Are you a scientist?

1046
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,120
No, I'm not like a scientist.

1047
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,560
Are you a nutritionist?

1048
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,120
No, I'm not.

1049
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,480
Are you a beanbagologist?

1050
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,040
Yeah, really.

1051
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,400
Okay.

1052
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,760
Are you a fucking professional chef?

1053
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,840
I want to, you guys want to hear a hilarious joke?

1054
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,360
Kind of observational humor?

1055
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,680
Yeah.

1056
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,560
I was looking into, recently I had reason to look into

1057
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,960
what beanbag filling is made out of.

1058
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,840
And I found a listing for beanbag filling

1059
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,520
that you could use to refill a beanbag chair.

1060
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,000
But the thing about this beanbag filling is,

1061
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,560
it comes in a bag.

1062
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,200
So it's kind of like, let's cut out the middleman.

1063
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,240
That's a really good little witty.

1064
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,840
Kind of like a witty.

1065
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,600
It's kind of like a little fucking slice of life.

1066
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,160
Who's doing this?

1067
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,480
Who's doing fucking beanbag rehab?

1068
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,280
This episode of This Old Bag.

1069
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,320
Next on Antiques Roadshow,

1070
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,040
this beanbag is from the 18th century.

1071
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,320
This is my pop pops bag.

1072
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,920
A lot of stink memories in here.

1073
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,520
This would have been worth upwards of $15,000

1074
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,960
if you hadn't refilled it.

1075
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,200
I don't think you guys got it.

1076
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,240
So I'm going to try again.

1077
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,800
Could you do it in more of a stand up voice, please?

1078
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,680
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1079
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,040
Do it more presentationally.

1080
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,880
I think your energy was too low key.

1081
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,760
Okay, can one of you guys intro me in?

1082
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,120
Yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it.

1083
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,600
Oh, sorry, you do it, Travis, you volunteer.

1084
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,100
Okay.

1085
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,600
Coming up next on our stage, Justin McElroy.

1086
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1087
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,200
Give it up.

1088
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,400
Give it up for our man.

1089
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,520
Give it up.

1090
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,600
God, guys, wow.

1091
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,960
Tell some fucking jokes.

1092
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,800
This guy, hey, get this guy another drink.

1093
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,880
Okay, listen.

1094
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,640
Wow.

1095
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,760
God, you know, as everybody.

1096
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,520
Come on, do it.

1097
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,800
Holidays are coming up.

1098
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,680
We're warmed up.

1099
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,560
Just go for it.

1100
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,960
Holidays are coming up soon.

1101
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,960
And man, how you guys doing out there?

1102
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,680
We're doing good.

1103
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,760
Who invited young Philip Seymour Hoffman to this, right guys?

1104
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,360
Hey, be nice.

1105
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,040
He's doing his best.

1106
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,400
He's trying his hardest up there.

1107
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,280
Be nice.

1108
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,880
Yeah, so, bro.

1109
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,000
We believe in you.

1110
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,600
Don't listen to that guy.

1111
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,480
Look at this guy over here in the front row.

1112
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,880
He's like, can't wait for the jokes to start, right?

1113
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,720
Yeah, good observation.

1114
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,600
I'm just trying to have a nice night out with my wife.

1115
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,840
Yeah, what's your name, sir?

1116
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,760
Gregory.

1117
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,240
Hey, Gregory, you ever get into bean bags?

1118
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,040
No, I'm not.

1119
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:52,320
I'm a 41-year-old orthodontist, so I just have regular chairs.

1120
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,520
Who's this hot piece of ass you got with you?

1121
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,880
My name's Charlene.

1122
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,240
Hey, Charlene, what's up?

1123
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,200
She's my stepmom.

1124
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,640
Can we go?

1125
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,240
Can we get up and leave?

1126
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,240
Stepmom's so choice, dude.

1127
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:04,740
Thank you.

1128
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,560
Thank you so much.

1129
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,360
I'm flattered.

1130
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,120
What were you saying about bean bags?

1131
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,240
I love bean bags.

1132
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,240
Yeah, Charlene, I'd like to take you to a bean bag.

1133
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,360
Dude, you're so-

1134
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,720
Oh, that's so nice of you.

1135
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,440
Gregory, your stepmom's fucking juicy, dude.

1136
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,320
I love it.

1137
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,040
Thank you.

1138
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,080
Thank you so much.

1139
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,400
You know, it's nice.

1140
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:24,960
It's nice.

1141
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,880
I don't want to be told that all the time,

1142
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,200
but by a nice young man like this, I appreciate it.

1143
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,320
Yeah, let's kill you.

1144
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,800
No, you fucking got me with that, man, man.

1145
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,840
You really got me with that one.

1146
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,560
You really impressed me.

1147
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,960
Let's get another G&T over here for Charlene.

1148
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,600
Charlene, what's up?

1149
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,160
Thank you.

1150
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,960
You into bean bags?

1151
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,760
I am.

1152
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,480
Thank you for asking.

1153
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,440
Cool, cool, cool.

1154
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,120
Listen, I was shopping for like a bean bag.

1155
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,560
I do a podcast with my brothers,

1156
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,000
and we had a question about bean bag, the stuff in bean bags.

1157
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,920
So I was looking up bean bag refills.

1158
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,040
We've all been there.

1159
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,560
Yeah, I figured out what's in them.

1160
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,720
And I'm sorry, you're just fucking so hot.

1161
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,600
I'm like, thank you.

1162
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,600
I am feeling this.

1163
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,520
We are vibing.

1164
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,160
This is real.

1165
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,160
Yeah, so like, they had a bean bag filling refill on there.

1166
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,720
And but the thing is, it came in a bag.

1167
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,080
And I'm like, can we just cut out the middle man?

1168
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,440
Hey, this guy's choking over here.

1169
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,920
No, that's just my laugh.

1170
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,920
Oh, I've pissed myself.

1171
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,400
Hey, this guy pissed himself, everybody.

1172
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,360
That's hilarious.

1173
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,680
That's my fetish.

1174
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,400
Thank you.

1175
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,040
Look at this guy.

1176
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,040
He looks like Vanilla Ice's uncle.

1177
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,600
Yes.

1178
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,040
Yeah, embarrass me.

1179
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,880
It's all this is a fetish meeting for the public embarrassment.

1180
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,840
I think I think I'm just gonna go.

1181
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,920
I don't care for bean bag based humor.

1182
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,720
You're my ride.

1183
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,520
So here's my here's my hotel key.

1184
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,280
I'm staying at Dave's house.

1185
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,120
Well, that's weird.

1186
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:57,680
That's Dave.

1187
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,040
Install hotel locks like on his personal residence or

1188
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,920
now he's just cool.

1189
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,680
Wait, which Dave?

1190
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,960
I don't know where Dave.

1191
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,440
You know what?

1192
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,240
It doesn't matter.

1193
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,280
I'm just gonna go home.

1194
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,920
I got a long day at the office tomorrow.

1195
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,880
I'm the president.

1196
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,240
Oh, congratulations.

1197
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,600
Thank you so much.

1198
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,480
Thank you.

1199
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,320
What if I'm the fourth woman president?

1200
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,680
Okay, well, I'm going to have a Terry.

1201
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:23,920
Yeah.

1202
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,040
Guys, guys.

1203
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,920
Great skit.

1204
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,440
Thanks.

1205
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,960
And scene.

1206
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:38,400
This has been our summer camp skit bug for you're the best.

1207
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,760
Thank you for everything.

1208
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,080
Here's another question.

1209
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,240
I live in a two unit apartment building.

1210
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,160
My neighbor recently knocked on my door because he had been locked out of his apartment.

1211
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,480
I thought he wanted a place to hang, but he said my set of keys work on his door.

1212
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,840
But not to worry because his keys don't work on my door.

1213
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,960
Does that mean he's been trying to get into my apartment?

1214
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,800
Does this give me the right to casually check out his place?

1215
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,760
I was able to let him into his place as his apartment key is the same building

1216
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,600
as the building, same as the building's front door.

1217
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,280
What?

1218
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,480
Hold on.

1219
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:15,440
Okay.

1220
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,400
So you're in an apartment building.

1221
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,840
Your neighbor knocked on the door because he had been locked out of his apartment.

1222
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,480
I thought he wanted a place to hang, but he said my set of keys work on his door.

1223
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,400
Not to worry because his keys don't work on my door.

1224
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,040
Does that mean he's been trying to get into my apartment?

1225
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,680
Yes.

1226
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,920
Does that mean he can just casually check out his place?

1227
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,680
I was able to let him into his place as his apartment.

1228
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,920
No, no, you can't go into somebody's house.

1229
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,840
You can't go into someone's home.

1230
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,920
That's not even the colonel that I locked.

1231
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:42,000
This gentleman knowingly like lives in an apartment that apparently anyone in this

1232
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,320
building can go into and he's just accepted that as fact.

1233
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,480
No, it's a prisoner's dilemma thing going on here, okay?

1234
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,800
There's only two of them in the building.

1235
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:59,520
There is a key that works on the front door of the building and that key is the same lock

1236
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,280
configuration as this dude's apartment, right?

1237
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,880
So, but he says that his key doesn't work on your door.

1238
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,840
I would like to see that in action.

1239
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,400
No, that can happen.

1240
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,920
I would like to see him.

1241
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,560
No, okay.

1242
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,000
No, I hear what you're saying, Justin.

1243
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,520
You want to watch him try his keys.

1244
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,480
Yeah, I want to try your key in my door, dude.

1245
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:25,280
Because like I'm just going to take your word for it of a dirty like a dirty boy that loves

1246
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,040
people that just like catch him in the act 24-7 because that's the only reason I can

1247
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,800
think that he hasn't like made a huge mistake.

1248
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,640
Because he knows about this like this has clearly happened before that he's like,

1249
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:40,000
hey, this is a fact that I know and haven't complained to like the owners about.

1250
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,240
But like you could go into my apartment anytime if you want whenever you want.

1251
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:44,720
If you wanted to.

1252
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,720
Sometime around 530 on Wednesday.

1253
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,120
Or maybe I'll get a light installed in your place and I'll have a switch for that light

1254
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,840
in my place and I'll flip it and that just means come on by if you want to see some dirty stuff.

1255
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,920
Hey, if you want to see some grown folks activities, maybe wait for that light to come on

1256
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,560
and then you'll know that things are off and pop.

1257
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,400
Do you like grown folks stuff?

1258
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,480
Hey, do you like grown folks activities?

1259
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,120
Do you like do you like scoping them on the free and on the sly?

1260
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,440
Well, I got a deal for you.

1261
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,440
Have I got a life for you?

1262
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,080
Look at it.

1263
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:16,800
Come please.

1264
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,240
I'm journey you get to please.

1265
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,040
I OK, this is very OK.

1266
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,160
Here's the weirdest part about this.

1267
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:34,000
OK, this guy knows in his heart that you could like completely devastate his whole scene

1268
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,160
whenever you wanted to, because you have the key to his place, right?

1269
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:36,880
What is this?

1270
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,400
OK, hold on.

1271
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,840
What is this fucking world that you are living in where life is just like a fucking online

1272
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:49,760
survival combat video game where you just like when somebody logs off you go grief their shit?

1273
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,480
Do you not pay any fucking attention to the news where people just like kill each other

1274
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,160
off hand all the time?

1275
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,600
Like this is your downstairs neighbor plays music too loud.

1276
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,840
You could walk in and smother him with a pillow.

1277
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,200
And it's like legal now.

1278
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,400
Like that's the worst part.

1279
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,840
It's not even breaking and entering.

1280
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,440
It's just entering at this point.

1281
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,000
Just as I suggested murder, he's suggesting you're outside.

1282
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,800
You're mowing the lawn.

1283
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,800
You see them walk out with a suitcase like, yeah, I'm going to visit my float, my Florida

1284
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,960
and parents are like, oh, cool.

1285
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,840
Well, have a good trip.

1286
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:27,120
No, but like if you don't assume that that's a thing, then why do we have locks in the

1287
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,240
door in the first place?

1288
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,480
Like if you if you're like if you want to work on the honor system, that's fine.

1289
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,640
Like I'm going to go ahead and keep the lock on the door.

1290
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,800
That seems the base level.

1291
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,520
It doesn't matter.

1292
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,200
Why does OK.

1293
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,120
Why is this guy so cavalier about revealing this information to you, right?

1294
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,880
Doesn't that strike you as odd?

1295
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,520
Like why do you want to let somebody like without any knowledge of you really to let

1296
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,720
you know that you could just walk into their place whenever you wanted to?

1297
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,040
How did very suspicious to me.

1298
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,240
How did downstairs Pete figure this out in the first place?

1299
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,480
Like the first time he locked himself out of his apartment, his solution was, I know

1300
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,400
I'll try the other guy's keys.

1301
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,360
Oh, it works.

1302
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,400
Like that's never a thing I would think of doing.

1303
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,200
Yeah, seeing if the other person in the building can unlock my door at this point.

1304
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,360
But he doesn't just.

1305
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,400
He knows it.

1306
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,120
How does he know?

1307
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:28,480
Well, fucking he's got peer reviewed, hands on proof.

1308
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,400
Tried to scope your place out.

1309
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,080
And I think if the if we're going to tear down the walls this much, you may as well

1310
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:40,720
like install a window in the dividing wall of your duplex that you could just like check

1311
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,080
in on Jerry every morning.

1312
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,440
It's not good and it's not right.

1313
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,800
Are you guys moving?

1314
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,480
You guys are basically moving in together.

1315
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,040
Why don't we get rid of the pretense, right?

1316
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,160
Why don't we take that wall?

1317
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,840
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.

1318
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,640
I want to let's get the property bros in here.

1319
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,400
Take that wall out.

1320
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,760
Put a nice I beam up there.

1321
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,120
Oh, that's I love that.

1322
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,440
Maybe some like exposed timbers.

1323
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,240
Rustic.

1324
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,600
Oh, I love that.

1325
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,480
Oh, you know what you do?

1326
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,440
You knock down that wall.

1327
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,200
You put in a two sided fireplace.

1328
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,600
Oh, I love it.

1329
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,160
Yeah, right?

1330
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:12,640
That's great.

1331
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,480
It's going to increase the value of your home.

1332
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,560
Open the whole thing up a lot more to increase the sidelines when you're jerking it.

1333
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,240
Yeah, it really turns the whole like jerking it thing around.

1334
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:23,520
Yeah.

1335
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,800
Maybe just put in a special jerking room.

1336
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,520
Yeah, why not?

1337
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,000
Why not?

1338
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,720
If we're going crazy, why not?

1339
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,480
That's that bumps up that Zillow.

1340
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,920
Well, but then you run into it's like, hey, we we ran into a problem.

1341
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,840
There ended up being a pipe in this wall.

1342
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,800
We had to cut that.

1343
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,440
We had to turn the jerking room into a jerking closet.

1344
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:41,840
Don't worry.

1345
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,120
We put a porthole in the door.

1346
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,600
It's a three bed, two bath, half bait.

1347
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,640
Hey, that's not what we were looking for, but all right.

1348
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,520
We'll make do.

1349
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,200
I want to read a Yahoo, can I?

1350
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:55,840
Please.

1351
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,280
How about this one from Morgan Davey?

1352
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:57,840
Thank you, Morgan.

1353
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,440
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

1354
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:07,040
Lag seeing who says, what did teens do in medieval times or back in ancient times?

1355
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,800
Were they having fun like nowadays or had more responsibilities?

1356
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,240
Were they having fun?

1357
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,880
Just some some hip cool dudes.

1358
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,760
Snapchat me on the children's crusade, bro.

1359
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,160
Come on.

1360
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,600
Took my dad's horse going hog wild tonight.

1361
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,280
Yeah, my sister fell into the thresher.

1362
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,720
Hashtag realness.

1363
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,640
Oh man, hurt my arm real bad while casting some silver.

1364
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,080
Hashtag type that with my silver arm.

1365
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,920
My woman crushed Wednesday's Queen Victoria.

1366
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,800
What's up, boo?

1367
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,600
WCW.

1368
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,440
Well, here's the thing.

1369
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,040
Back in medieval times, life expectancy was like 25.

1370
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:54,000
So the translation of this was that what is now teens for us was like seven year olds back then.

1371
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,440
It all scaled back.

1372
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,080
Yeah, true.

1373
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,920
Seven year old teens.

1374
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,280
How were they getting wild?

1375
00:51:59,280 --> 00:51:59,920
What were they?

1376
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,000
I guess they called them sevens or whatever.

1377
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,200
Yeah, the sevens.

1378
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,960
Yeah, like he's just going through those awkward halfway through

1379
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,600
to three quarters of the way through his eighth year of life.

1380
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,440
It's just that awkward transition period.

1381
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,880
But the thing is, how did you rebel?

1382
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:17,760
Drinking beer?

1383
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,640
Everyone did that.

1384
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,680
Smoking tobacco?

1385
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,080
Everybody did that.

1386
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,920
Everyone was wheezing.

1387
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,000
Everyone was getting wacky on backy.

1388
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,760
That's a good point, Travis.

1389
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,440
Like it was not a thing back then.

1390
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,280
Kids could get fucked up.

1391
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:29,760
And they were about all the-

1392
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,960
What, you rebelled by not going to school along with everyone else?

1393
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,840
Along with everyone else.

1394
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,400
I can't read.

1395
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,280
I can't read either.

1396
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,320
Cool, let's get fucked up.

1397
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,120
I'm the king.

1398
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:37,920
I can't read.

1399
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,480
Okay.

1400
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,200
Okay, cool.

1401
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:39,920
I'm a peasant.

1402
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,640
I can't read.

1403
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,200
Great.

1404
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:41,700
Yeah.

1405
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,440
But what we can do is party.

1406
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,920
Probably the only way you could rebel is becoming a jester.

1407
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,720
Oh, you hate to see that.

1408
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,800
What could bring more shame to your family?

1409
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,520
First off, you learned to juggle heartbreaking to any parents.

1410
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,080
Yeah.

1411
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:02,800
Then you're locked in as a professional silly person at the castle,

1412
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,040
and the king only needs you when he's in a bad mood.

1413
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,320
That's a fucking bummer.

1414
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,600
How's your work environment?

1415
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,400
Pretty high stakes.

1416
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:08,880
Yeah, pretty much high stakes all the time.

1417
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,400
I only have one coworker, and it's really more of an audience member,

1418
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,280
and I only see him when he's completely been out of shape.

1419
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,760
And if I do a bad job, I die.

1420
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,760
Yeah, but think about it this way though.

1421
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,360
When that jester's off the clock, and he goes and he's chilling with his other sevens,

1422
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,080
and that party gets lit.

1423
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:26,720
Are you kidding me?

1424
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,120
That is true.

1425
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,480
There ain't no party like a jester party.

1426
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,200
Oh, fuck yeah.

1427
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,280
It's the only entertaining person.

1428
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:31,920
He's here.

1429
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,040
Fuck yes.

1430
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:33,680
We're drunk.

1431
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,240
We're ready.

1432
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,680
We're fucking ready to roll, dude.

1433
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,080
I know I don't want you to have to work when you're off the clock,

1434
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,520
but if you could turn this shit up because you're literally the only funny person.

1435
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,000
Juggle, juggle, juggle.

1436
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,040
Well, I don't know.

1437
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,480
If everybody, I wasn't gonna, but if everybody wants you to.

1438
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,360
This is crazy.

1439
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,120
Both me and Mike, both our sisters fell in the thresher today,

1440
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,480
and we could use a laugh.

1441
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,520
Can you turn this shit up, please?

1442
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,400
All right.

1443
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,320
Jingle, jangle, jangle, jangle, jangle.

1444
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,640
Yeah, I've never seen either like this in my life.

1445
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,680
Jingle, jangle, jangle, jangle.

1446
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,640
Jingle, jangle, jangle, jangle.

1447
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,040
Man, Melissa would love this.

1448
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,480
This fucking crazy motherfucker is talking to a face on a stick.

1449
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,640
I love this shit.

1450
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,080
I'm losing my, I'm fucking losing my mind.

1451
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,600
I'm losing it with this guy.

1452
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,000
Is that rouge on your cheeks?

1453
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:32,480
Fuck that.

1454
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:40,640
Jingle, jangle, jangle, jangle, jangle, jangle, jangle, jangle, jangle, jangle.

1455
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,120
I'm gonna die literally months before my time.

1456
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,480
I'm 14.

1457
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:46,720
Fuck.

1458
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,560
Who invited old man Steven here?

1459
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,560
I miss Rebecca so much.

1460
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,840
And then they would just shit on the floor right there because nobody gave a fuck.

1461
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,040
Well, that was a joke.

1462
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,000
That was the first time anyone had ever shat right there on the floor.

1463
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,400
Somebody shit right there on the floor and be like, that's pretty funny too.

1464
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,240
Can you imagine how fucking easy it would be to tell a joke back then?

1465
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,080
Like, nobody fucking heard jokes.

1466
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,160
You could just be like, what's the deal with pigs?

1467
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:08,800
They smell.

1468
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,600
Ah, ha, ha.

1469
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,920
You guys ever notice how like the beanbag filling comes in a bag, cut out the middleman.

1470
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,640
Ah, ha, ha, ha.

1471
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,600
You could just shit on the floor and be like, jackass won.

1472
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,680
I invented it coming in 2000 years.

1473
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,200
Catch the fever.

1474
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:29,920
Man, I wish, man, I was just, I was born in the wrong time.

1475
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,640
I know people only live until like 30 and like everyone was getting ate up by witches

1476
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,680
in the forest.

1477
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,440
But man, that would have been good times.

1478
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,520
It's so fucking easy to be an entertainer.

1479
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,320
Oh, I know.

1480
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,760
This podcast, we got to churn out hours of content every week.

1481
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,320
Back then, like one joke and it would spread throughout the land.

1482
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:55,280
You could just walk to a different town and be like, hey, in my last town, I was the fucking

1483
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,200
funniest fool there and everyone loved me.

1484
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,880
And everybody would be like, I believe it.

1485
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,000
We don't have the internet.

1486
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,320
I can't check TMZ to see how much everyone hated you in your last town.

1487
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,120
Yeah, I don't know if you stole these jokes off Instagram or not.

1488
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,280
Yeah, because I can't check it.

1489
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,480
We don't have electricity.

1490
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,880
But if we did, we could check Instagram for sure.

1491
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,320
And bust your ass.

1492
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,560
Be careful though, because if you get up there and you're like, hey guys, beanbag refill

1493
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,560
comes in a bag anyway, it's cut out the middleman.

1494
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,680
They might be like, witch!

1495
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,680
You!

1496
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,040
He's tickled my innards with his devilry.

1497
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,280
It's a perfectly observed joke.

1498
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,880
No human man could be this funny.

1499
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,920
But I have had this thought many times in my daily slice of life day.

1500
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,160
Me too.

1501
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,400
Goody McElroy consorts with the devil.

1502
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,680
He's done his consorting and he's read our thoughts.

1503
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:54,240
I saw him change into a wolf at midnight, run through the beanbags, observing their humor.

1504
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,760
Did you hear his pacing?

1505
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,080
It was, I thought he was going to say one thing and he said a completely different one.

1506
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,600
Did thou witness his crowd work with Goody Charlene?

1507
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,960
This has been our podcast, my brother, my brother, me.

1508
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,920
It's very dumb.

1509
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,040
We got a Bunker Buddies live show coming up April 2nd.

1510
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,280
Make sure you catch that.

1511
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,840
Go to bit.ly forward slash bb live show.

1512
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,640
And Scotty Travis and Andy talk about has survived the apocalypse.

1513
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,640
And we're doing that alongside spilled milk.

1514
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,720
It's a great podcast.

1515
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,680
It's going to be a great night.

1516
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,720
It's going to be super fun.

1517
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,240
We also want to say thanks again to Blue Apron who makes cooking at home easy.

00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,240
It's where you go to find all this stuff.

1523
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,120
Just just a heads up.

1524
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,640
Max Fun Drive is just around the corner.

1525
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,320
It kicks off March 14th.

1526
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,280
It's going to run for two weeks.

1527
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,840
So we'll have two episodes of my brother, my brother and me,

1528
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,800
where we will be telling you all about the Max Fun Drive.

1529
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,920
It is amazing.

1530
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,360
We are a donor supported network.

1531
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,440
We've been able to do like so many podcasts this past year.

1532
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,360
Like we have expanded our output.

1533
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,480
Well, Travis mostly, but we're all getting real bored.

1534
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,040
Yeah, we're all doing like more and more podcasts more than ever.

1535
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,160
And it's because of the support that we get from listeners during the Max Fun Drive.

1536
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,840
So we'll have lots of bonus episodes.

1537
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,280
We'll have new stuff this year.

1538
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:28,000
But by donating, you also get access to all of the episodes throughout the fullness of time.

1539
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,360
And we're going to be doing some extra bonus length episodes.

1540
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,040
You've got some ideas for stuff we're going to do during the drive.

1541
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,240
It's all going to be really exciting.

1542
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,160
Kicks off March 14th, runs for two weeks.

1543
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,960
We're going to have gifts for new donors and upgrading members.

1544
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,880
Lots, lots, lots of stuff going on there.

1545
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,640
So March 14th runs for two weeks.

Thanks to John Roderick of the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

1558
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,520
It's a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed. It's a wonderful, wonderful album.

1559
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,920
And it's good for this build up to summer.

1560
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,000
To get pumped.

1561
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,240
To get pumped for the summer months.

1562
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,360
You guys want to find on Yahoo?

1563
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,560
Hell yeah, I do.

1564
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:30,560
Oh wait, one more thing before, because I just did this and I'm very excited about it.

1565
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,800
If you go to maxfunstore.com, there's a ton of really awesome Max Fun merch there.

1566
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,800
And we got a lot of My Brother, My Brother, Me, and Adventure Zone and all the other shows stuff

1567
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:45,760
there, but I just purchased a really sweet Flophouse t-shirt.

1568
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,760
Oh shit, really?

1569
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,720
Yeah, and a really sweet Sawbones t-shirt.

1570
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,800
The one with the really cool skull design.

1571
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,000
That's what Taylor did.

1572
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,520
Yeah, they're coming soon.

00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,640
You get to see me in these choice shirts and my wife in these choice shirts.

1574
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,800
But I always forget how awesome this stuff is there till I go look again.

1575
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,960

1579
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:07,680
Yes.

1580
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,160
Yep.

1581
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,440
Sitting by Yahoo answers.

01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,960
No, it wasn't, I mean Zoe Kinski, I guess, is technically a Yahoo answers user.

Glowy Aaron.

1588
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:28,800
Glowy Aaron asks, are there any movies where Paul Giamatti is just happy chipper dude?

1589
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,560
But he's just McElroy.

Hi, I'm Sydney McElroy.

And I'm Riley Smyrl.

1599
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:13,280
And we co-host a podcast called Still Buffering, a sister's guide to teens through the ages.

1600
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,720
On our show, we tackle all of the hot teen topics that kids have on their minds today.

1601
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,480
Hot teen topics?

1602
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:27,200
Well, you know, the questions that are plaguing teenagers through their tumultuous growing years.

1603
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,680
Questions like, how do I party?

1604
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,560
Or what do I do with all this hair everywhere?

1605
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:37,200
The same questions that people like Sydney had during their years as teenagers.

1606
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,520
Many, many, many.

1607
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,480
Okay, not that many.

1608
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,320
So, so long ago.

1609
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,920
Yeah, okay, I think they get the idea.

1610
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:50,240
So search for Still Buffering on iTunes or Maximumfun.org for new episodes every Tuesday.

1611
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,280
Still Buffering.

1612
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,320
I am a teenager.

1613
01:01:52,320 --> 01:02:02,880
And I was too.
