1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

11
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,800
listening me higher and all blank side makes something what does all links not even mean

12
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,240
and like the actual phrase or the song the the phrase it means like days days gone by

13
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,040
or something like that no that's stupid well i mean it is what it doesn't sound right it

14
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,600
might be stupid but it is what it it is like when you know when you have like really old langs

15
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,760
yeah and you and you put up a sign because you want to sell all of your old langs before the

16
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,320
end of the year what's your guys favorite new year's eve tradition i like the the tradition

17
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,680
where we all talk like old-timey prospectors every 20th i like the tradition where we all eat them

18
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,200
little wieners wrapped in bacon yeah that's a good one that's a good one is that a trick

19
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,080
are there new year's traditions i don't know of any that's a thing my mother-in-law tries to get

20
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,120
us to eat cabbage every year but i don't know if that's a tradition can you talk to her about that

21
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,280
tradition what if we start what if we started the tradition where like in the last minute

22
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,040
like in the countdown of seconds you blurted out to one of your loved ones a terrible thing you

23
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,000
did to them that they didn't know about in 2012 but as soon as it turns over to 2013 they're not

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,720
allowed to get mad at you i love that double jeopardy like get it in right at the end of the

25
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:20,400
year yeah a little like 10 nine eight i kissed your sister six five what three two one clear

26
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,400
how about how about we take it one step further and any crimes you do in the last minute of the

27
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,840
year you cannot be you cannot be punished that sounds like something the joker could exploit

28
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:41,280
um that's worrying to me like that fucking ruins all our everything there's no trust there it's

29
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,600
the thing uh this is my brother my brother meets an advice show for the margin era uh we are saying

30
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:55,040
i mean we're saying goodbye to 20 does i oh god i'm not ready i know did you guys done get it did

32
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,960
it in 20 does i've been seeing a lot of reports of getting it please tell us in like an overwhelming

33
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,720
uh uh uh it's a wonderful lifestyle display of the effect we found in your lives just start

34
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,520
just start tweeting at us all the ways that you got it in 20 does i've seen so many twitter status

35
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,920
updates telling me how how much people have gotten it and we're not talking small potatoes or small

36
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:34,080
fries or little fish in a big pond we are talking about big fit big fish in a big in a big pond i

37
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,880
don't want to talk about anymore it's it's got so you're saying they reached in use the bait of

38
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,080
positivity hope optimism and they put those fish into that barrel right and then they shot it

39
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,760
they shot the fish no they shot the barrel no you i think you open the barrel and put the

40
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:00,000
pickles in it first and then you put the fish in to eat the pickles and then you shoot the

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,280
barrel to release the fish it back in a little while the horse swallows the barrel uh-huh i

42
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,320
don't know why she swallowed the barrel perhaps she'll die listen we're better at advice than

43
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,480
idioms but here's the weird thing only barely so here we go my girlfriend and i recently

44
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,960
purchased a delicious chocolate bars during a trip abroad to give it to gives us friends

45
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,120
unfortunately while i'm packing our dog found the bag with the chocolate and started chewing on it

46
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,520
we were lucky enough to stop before marmaduke he thinks these people he thinks these people he

47
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,880
could tear open any of the wrappers but many of them now have visible bite marks since then my

48
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,480
girlfriend and i have been arguing about whether or not it's appropriate to still give these as

49
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,200
gifts i opened one to see if they're okay and it had a pattern of a dent that very clearly showed

50
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,480
that some small animal had been chewing on it since the wrappers are mostly intact she thinks

51
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,080
it's okay to give and pretend to be surprised or something so the bite marks i feel guilty and

52
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,520
think we should throw them away and buy some new last minute gifts who is right how would you feel

53
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:10,480
if you got one as a gift that's from confectionery conundrum man a lot a nice easy one no joke i

54
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,320
would fucking cut all ties with you if you gave me some food some food stuff that looked like you've

55
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,400
been gnawed on by a raccoon what are you talking about when your friend goes are these bite marks

56
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,440
and you go what no just that's how french people do it no it's that fancy bite mark candy have you

57
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,160
not read about that have you not heard about this they have been gnawed on by small animals but

58
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,000
they're parisian raccoons the parisian raccoons eat nothing but mint leaves for a month and it

59
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,120
infuses the flavor into the chocolate you wouldn't get it you wouldn't get it in mainland you know

60
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,480
what just give it back to me i'll pretend to eat it your only option is like to just be straight

61
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,120
up honest and be like hey there's gonna be some bite marks on this don't worry my dog didn't get

62
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,520
through the wrapper but like then you need to follow that up with and i also got you some other

63
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,600
stuff too is that very whack is that good enough travis would you eat if somebody gave you that

64
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:12,480
guarantee if somebody gave you that 100 no dog spit on this guarantee but yes those are what his

65
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,400
teeth look like listen would you still party down i'm not gonna answer one way or the other yet

66
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,320
because i want to throw out another factor these aren't just like snickers that they picked up at

67
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:27,040
cvs like this is some interesting foreign candy i presume i don't give a fuck if it's caviar made

68
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,800
out of faberge eggs that i could sell on ebay this has got dog mouth marks on it griffin can

69
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,200
you stop what i'm saying is there's a level above it can you please stop interrupting travis so he

70
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:43,280
could admit to us that he would eat dog candy no no what i'm saying is when you get part of

71
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,040
it is like you know if it's in a fourth the wrapper is in a foreign language you display

72
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,440
it somewhere for a while until it becomes gross and you throw it away travis say the words hey

73
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:59,040
did you see this chocolate i look at this chocolate i have come into my den it's not american that's

74
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,720
why i'm showing it off is because it's not american i have i have chewed on foreign candy to show you

75
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,720
you i'm never going to your house again really hateful what no i just want you to say that you

76
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,880
would eat the dog candy i would not eat the dog can i have some standards you would just display

77
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:23,200
it prominently in my house like uh hot dogs that have spaghetti in them no i don't know that's

78
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:31,200
super gross the two things i will not eat skyline hot dogs and chewed on dog candy can i say i know

79
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,760
that this is perhaps like the wrong time to express this this like christmas just having

80
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,800
passed us by and all but pretty much with every thing time someone gives me something they're

81
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,320
basically telling me they're telling me i have to find someplace to put it like the best gift you

82
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,720
can give me is not to have the pressure of eating something or storing something so this is a good

83
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,280
then this is a great gift by your metric because they know exactly where to put it which is to say

84
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,800
the garbage put it right in the put it right in the garbage can i wanted to bring this to buy to

85
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,320
prove that i got you something but i'm not going to let you eat it because it has it's clearly been

86
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,120
chewed on but i want you to share this funny anecdote uh even though i'm not going to let

87
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,080
you eat this dog candy i got you a gift that almost killed my dog so that's like the ultimate

88
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,040
sacrifice that's basically what gift of the magi was all about oh what if you said that like their

89
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:35,520
dog tested a mother approved my dog seemed to really like these maybe yours will too

90
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,400
take this and kill your dog merry christmas it's dog chocolate i think how did you not see this

91
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:52,400
coming how could you leave foreign the two things dogs love to eat more than anything else are

92
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,560
chocolate and irreplaceable things right there's their two favorite snacks and you somehow combine

93
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:05,120
the two into a chocolate bar that you cannot easily obtain here in america and you knew your

94
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,800
dog was a gastronomical risk taker you knew that you knew he likes to dance on the racer's edge

95
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,800
is this is this sea salt i'll give it a whirl it's a little unconventional is there any dog that's

96
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:25,520
not i think if you eat poop more than once you are a gastronomical risk taker how about a how

97
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,560
about a yahoo answer oh long story short you need to go get some new presents you go get some new

98
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:42,320
anything this is my dog andrew zimmern um this yahoo answer was sent in by ira ray thanks ira

99
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:50,880
it's by yahoo answer user crystal s crystal s who asks what are some simple ideas for family circus

100
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:57,440
act i am looking for billy and jeffy together well i am looking for ideas for my family there

101
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:04,480
are my parents me 21 and three sisters 16 11 and 8 we have our family reunion party next weekend

102
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:11,200
and it's circus themed so we need a simple circus act that we can do it can be funny or something

103
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,440
really cool but simple and cheap is what we want if you have any ideas please let me know

104
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,840
now you can make a family circus joke now you're allowed but let it percolate for a bit you don't

105
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,720
just have to fire it off prematurely give it time to ruminate why don't why don't you here here's

106
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,840
what i'm going to suggest why don't you save the family circus joke put it in like the back third

107
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:37,920
of your brain while we're doing this bit and then at the end of the bit just like drop it on us but

108
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,920
don't just say the names of people in family circus oh there was going to be a whole thing

109
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:51,120
about following footprints and like who did it not me like some really specific deep cuts the

110
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,680
problem with comedy is that it and dubstep versus dubstep is that it doesn't have a drop is this

111
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:06,000
from your this from your thesis comedy this doesn't have a drop now what travis has provided

112
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,360
us is the opportunity for a drop like people are going to feel the comedy drop of the family

113
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,560
circus gag coming and then he's and then when they least or most expect it he's going to drop it on

114
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:26,960
them oh god i can't i can't fucking wait for out of nowhere just bill keene bill keene is the

115
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:35,040
creator so i i think if you're choosing between funny or really cool i think we're definitely

116
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,920
going in the first camp this is a family circus idea of a nice ever okay has anyone ever watched

117
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,640
their friends or family perform any kind of act and thought man that's so cool like you're not

118
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,440
going to be able to pull that one off if you've been working on something for years outliers

119
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,480
then i think that you that maybe if you have like a hidden skill you've been practicing but like

120
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,960
don't just try to pick up the fushigi out of nowhere yeah are you already like a professional

121
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:11,200
magician i okay so i was curious as to why the the sweet christ's name the pert the pattern

122
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,320
familias of this organization are like oh it's got it's got to be circus themed but i think maybe

123
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,040
they made a few unwise amazon purchases like justin and do have these fushigi balls maybe

124
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,440
they have been fushiging for six months and they have absolutely no venue in which to show it off

125
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,640
they're tired of getting shut down when at every family function they say hey does anybody want to

126
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:38,560
see some contact juggling and everyone says no i don't i don't want to see that now you are making

127
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,600
you are dragooning the entire family everyone you're related to into watching you contact juggle

128
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,840
the good news is probably no one's gonna come no one wants to be here for this

129
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,480
this is a family gathering is it a reunion it sounds like it yeah because they use the word

130
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:03,200
reunion i you gotta go erotic it's gotta be it's gotta be strange and erotic like a cirque du soleil

131
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:10,400
level of eroticism i'm not saying i'm not saying like hump your hump your sisters or whatever i'm

132
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:17,760
saying you know hang hang a hoop from your butthole and then they jump through it what i've

133
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,280
never seen sir i've never seen cirque du soleil but i think what if you humped your sisters and

134
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:33,760
made it like an aristocrat's joke oh oh oh oh oh oh is this a whole fan is this a whole family of

135
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,600
circus people i think if it was a whole family circus i think if it was that justin they'd know

136
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,800
what the fuck to do they wouldn't be asking yahoo answers maybe some people are some people are

137
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,480
what if they like to keep their family and professional life separate did you see did you

138
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:58,240
see dick gracing came isn't that sad who is that man with him that's so upset why is he are they

139
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,240
relate are they friends what is the nature of their relation why did he even come you're saying

140
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,960
50 of the family maybe the mom's side of the family the grandma's side the flying graces

141
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:16,720
the all flying graces the dad's side mostly dentists mostly dentists and accountants and

142
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,080

159
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,800
to do

160
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:38,800
jeffy

161
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:49,600
blah blah the dad's an alcoholic

162
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,120
get your revisionist family circus history out of here no it's absolutely true the first comic

163
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,960
strip i'm looking at right now is the kids running in from a football game the dad looks

164
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,400
really sad sack with the cigarette hanging out of his mouth and the caption is we each had a

165
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,880
little bottle of soda daddy brought his own in in his pocket that's the first family circus yeah

166
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:23,280
oh it's an early strip it's from 1962 so daddy is in fact an alcoholic so that would be a good

167
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,440
family circus act you could do it's just your dad gets drunk i was like what the fuck are you kids

168
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,120
doing please stop flipping around and shit i'm embarrassed in front of your uncle dave can you

169
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,480
kill your grandma and then have her appear above you in a little circle and she's wearing angel

170
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,040
wings and she's looking down on you and she says it's a great trick but i can only do it once here

171
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:50,240
comes the next question coming at you from me to you my fiance and i have been discussing future

172
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,640
christmas traditions as we face the next candle nights and all others as a married couple i am

173
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,680
adamant that we will not be sending christmas cards as it is an outdated tradition given all

174
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,680
the methods of staying in touch at this wonderful age provides us how do i convince her it is a

175
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:11,520
waste of time that's from no noel notices in north carolina what are you talking about what

176
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,240
a what a cringy thing to say i know it's not an outdated it's like i love it i love getting a good

177
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,080
christmas card in the mail with great typography especially now that my friends all have babies

178
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,200
it's like a great way of keeping up with babies and it is it is one of those like things that

179
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,560
doesn't translate to like email or text message or anything like someone could email me a picture of

180
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,640
their kids and it's like a big fucking deal but you send me a nice card shows you put a little

181
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,760
thought into it that means something yeah when that when that baby pic exists in your tangible

182
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,720
space in your physical surroundings then you treasure it if it's just zeros and ones it's

183
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,600
like who the fuck is this kid if you email it what you're saying is hey you should print this out

184
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,480
cut it down to a normal size and then put it somewhere i guess i don't know i didn't think

185
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,880
that far ahead because you probably stopped on step one i'll tell you where it has been really

186
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,720
good what i have used christmas cards most for is like they're a nice conversation thing like

187
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,960
for instance i have uh our friend slice sent us a picture of his of his uh big baby kevin

188
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,640
and it's a great picture because he has a little car that he's driving and there's a little tree

189
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,920
attached to the roof uh and it's awesome and it's cozy coop it's a great picture but like i would i

190
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,640
might have seen that on facebook and like scroll on by but now that it's like in my house when my

191
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,600
dad comes by i say hey have you seen my skin a while it's great it's in your zone it's in my

192
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,720
zone i've got like four or five babies just like chilling in the kitchen now and whenever i'm

193
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,720
great again i just look over did you get justin russo's you know i did mackey russo's god damn

194
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,240
that's a cute little baby i think you're misunderstanding question asker i think you're

195
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:57,280
misunderstanding the the the utility of christmas cards which is to say not there is none no one

196
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,400
ever got a christmas card even back in like the 60s and felt like oh thank god what a valuable

197
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,040
dispatch thank god you got this across thank god i can now identify their children by sight

198
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:14,400
thank goodness it's a way it's a way of like getting um you know letting that person know

199
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,840
that you care about them it's a it's a homecoming pic that it's a homecoming pic or an engagement

200
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,200
pic that's like saying just like this is what i look like this year and that's handy to know

201
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,680
that's that's good knowledge it really is just like a thought thing you know we got lots of

202
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:36,400
christmas cards in the p.o box this year and man i was fucking touched yeah it was nice people uh

203
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,960
travis was reading them to us we're actually this is how we enjoy we can't go through everybody who

204
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,560
sent us a christmas card um but you know who you are but you know who you are and we actually all

205
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:52,960
sat in one room in front of the fire drinking some eggnog and reading our christmas cards that is

206
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,400
throwing them into the fire tossing them into the fire casually well only the shitty ones

207
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,720
only the shitty ones who you are yeah if it had a white baby on it it was not going in the fire

208
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:11,680
let's just put it that way why what is it why does it always why is it always within you but

209
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:17,520
you always like that with you uh i got another question is that a good tip for question asking

210
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,720
just make sure the card has a white baby on it no matter what include a white baby include a white

211
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,040
baby or a baby in white face oh my god stop i was griffin i have to tell you something i am

212
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:34,560
currently wearing the slippers you got me for christmas and it is like it is like cruising

213
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:42,000
around doing my morning puttering on a cloud on a mobile cloud that was all rachel well thank her

214
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,840
for me these look exactly like justin's feet on the inside and so we caught him i finally understand

215
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,880
that song you know that one conny song don't let me into my zone with also jz also starting jz i've

216
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:02,400
often i think i misunderstood that as some sort of like um mental state that you get into where once

217
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,880
you're in it you're unstoppable no i think these slippers are my zone right the original transcript

218
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,200
of that song was conny saying don't let me into my slippies and they said that doesn't sound very

219
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:22,960
good that's not a good rap song it's it doesn't have a very good meter and also mr west people

220
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,480
are going people are going to make fun of you if you say he's on an album jay-z was like i don't

221
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,120
know i kind of like it i kind of like it this is gonna be a good cd we're making together conny

222
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,720
this is gonna be a good record watch the slippies watch the slippies please don't

223
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,400
and then we're gonna we're gonna watch the slippies tour but we mostly just stay in our

224
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:49,360
sweaty pants just chill let's just watch some catch up on homeland and stay in our slippies

225
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:57,920
all day order some za just bro out bro just bro'd out man that fire is getting a little low conny

226
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:04,400
put another log on that let's see what see what birdie's up to now uh one man should have all

227
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:11,920
these slippers you do you know i said that but you actually are right i i have too many slippers

228
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,040
conny thank you for pointing that out to me do you need me to refresh your cafe au lait

229
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:22,720
now you remember when remember when after katrina conny was like george bush doesn't care about

230
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:31,680
sock shoes and it's like i guess you're probably right hey i was in a 3.5 year relationship my

231
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:37,680
first one ever congratulations and was dumped a little month over a month ago should have read

232
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:43,040
first justin should have finished the sentence read a little bit faster it was far from a perfect

233
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,680
relation a sizable chunk of it was long distance we didn't have much in common and i think when it

234
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:52,720
ended neither of us were really happy i've started seeing a new girl and i'm feeling pretty happy but

235
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,200
i can't shake the feeling that i might just be rebounding i don't want to make such a predictable

236
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,680
mistake but i also don't want to rule out the possibility of finding the right girl how can i

237
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:08,400
separate real feelings from the rebound and that's from love longing in long island i don't believe

238
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,960
in the rebound like i don't yeah i think that rebounding is either you either make the decision

239
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,480
before you get in the relationship like i want to rebound or after the relationship is over you look

240
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,080
back on it and say yeah that was just a rebound relationship well yeah that's that's the only way

241
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,600
it works that's the only way that that what you've just described is the only two ways that situation

242
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,440
can shake out no what what i'm saying is like you're never in the middle of a relationship

243
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,400
that you're really happy in and it's going really well and go you know i think this is a rebound

244
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,560
right it's not a classification that the relationship falls under like no hold on if

245
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:53,440
i put together this element and this element oh it's a rebound relationship i mean like i i i

246
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,280
married my wife on the rebound like she had just split up with her very long-term boyfriend when

247
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:07,600
when the two of us started dating and like if i had um for some reason shun that relationship

248
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:14,240
because she was on the rebound or or she had done the same i i would have missed out on like the

249
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,240
most important relationship in my life so i i'm not i'm i'm loathe to sort of say like dismiss

250
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,120
or try to categorize this relationship too much i i mean she recently has just gotten out of a

251
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,880
two-year relationship three weeks before we started dating and we've been together almost

252
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,880
three years and we're engaged now yeah you're engaged what congratulations i meant to tell

253
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:45,280
you guys yeah thank you um i do i think there's something to it though i think i think when you

254
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,720
get out of a relationship that you're not exactly happy in you do kind of go buckwild you do go a

255
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,360
little out of wild like i don't think that's a myth i'm not saying that the next person you date

256
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,000
i'm not saying the next person you date is the is a mistake but there's a much higher chance

257
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,400
well i mean i i will be honest with this and say that truce and i did then like move in together

258
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,680
like four months later and you know moved a lot faster than maybe we would have if we were both

259
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:18,480
like you know coming off i don't know coming off of long-term singleness but i mean that's not bad

260
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,880
that's not a bad thing i don't regret that i think it just makes you a little bit more

261
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,040
open to the idea of happiness would be a better way to put it you know what i mean where you're

262
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,640
not maybe as trepidatious you're not maybe or you go the other way and you are you know much

263
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:42,400
more afraid of it and that is usually what kills your happiness i i just don't i i think you should

264
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:48,720
be careful about don't overthink it if you're not happy in the relationship by all means get out if

265
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,640
you're happy the relationship who cares how it started who cares how long it's been since your

266
00:27:52,640 --> 00:28:02,240
last relationship you got 3.5 years of experience yeah uh with with relationship there's no uh non

267
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:10,560
compete on this put your skills to use don't don't like get so bonered to like find someone else

268
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,120
that you ignore the lessons of those three and a half years though like those three and a half

269
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,240
years that's a lot that's true that's a long ass time you probably learned some shit about what you

270
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:28,800
want from a from a partner from a partner so don't don't like don't ignore that you know

271
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:37,360
don't just go looking for the first first thing with holes oh god yucky my favorite fair shallow

272
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:44,960
booth like uh i'm i'm talking about i'm not talking about like a mr bucket i'm talking about

273
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,360
like a living human being i if you do fuck a mr bucket though that'd be hard i bet that would be

274
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,520
hard yeah because he's always like he's always like spitting spitting the balls pop out of his

275
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:02,880
mouth so good luck trying to keep him in right um the uh if you if you if it was bad at the end

276
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:09,120
that might feel comfortable for you you have to have keep your head on a swivel and try to see

277
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,520
griffith's right see if you see the same patterns because if you see the same patterns you may have

278
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,440
just gotten back together with somebody who is like the last bad relationship so don't do that

279
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,680
mm-hmm just if you're happy don't think about it too much don't try to overanalyze happiness just

280
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:31,840
be happy and you know what you may get sucker punched in a month you may think like oh man

281
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,840
ah crap i this was a rebound relationship i messed up but you could also sabotage yourself

282
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,400
now by being really happy and then being a good relationship but now trying to determine whether

283
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,200
it's a rebound relationship or any nonsense like that you're going to end up screwing yourself

284
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,280
over by overthinking yeah just just always think of the fact that in the mba you get points for

285
00:29:53,280 --> 00:30:00,480
rebounds oh that is true so how bad can they really be just improve your stats just get your

286
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,320
stats up you can't get a triple double unless you get three three three rebound two rebounds

287
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,600
it's three rebounds two you get points probably guys when the other guy's bouncing down the court

288
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:19,760
and he throws it and he does he just misses all the hoops and then you get the ball back a guy

it's by yahoo answers user flocks who asks a business question

306
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,000
would it be nice if subway sell three inches sandwich for a dollar

307
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,680
in december they have six inch for two dollars so it would be three inches for one dollar if you eat

308
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:31,680
half it's perfect for when you're not hungry but you do want to experience the subway ambiance

309
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,280
i want an excuse to talk to the sandwich artist i've got my eye on you know this do you know how

310
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:45,520
when you finish your subway sandwich be it six or twelve inches and you are full as fuck but you're

311
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,840
sad because there's no more sandwich to eat this is like a little boost this is like a little booster

312
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:58,400
pack you're saying this is a way to get a nine or 15 inch sub i'm saying yes round up just tie

313
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:04,560
this to my other sub please with substring you're a sandwich artist you should be able to swing this

314
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:11,760
make it a sandwich modern artist what making it an l shape i don't care get as gay as you want to

315
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:19,600
with it get gay with this mixed media sandwich i don't care if you make it look like a duck face

316
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,840
i don't care the guys at the plant make fun of your extra sandwich let me get a six pack of

317
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:33,040
subway nuggets which is what i call three inch sandwiches listen i want to eat a four hour but

318
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:38,080
i'm gonna i'm gonna eat a foot long but instead i'm gonna get four three inch longs because i

319
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,600
want to eat four of something oh god i think i'll feel fuller and there's more paper that way

320
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:55,040
three inch subs at subway maybe that you know what that would be good for a sampler if you

321
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:01,680
want to like try four subs yeah i know but i mean but then you're quadrupling the amount of time

322
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:07,120
that that sandwich when you order a chicken when you order a sloppy sloppy ranch chicken

323
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,080
chicken bacon when you get one of those they have it streamlined in their brain this is how

324
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,640
food service works it is a manufacturing line where they know the fastest way to slop it and

325
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,920
flop it down and get it from the from their table to your mouth they know the quickest way to do

326
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,960
that when you are quadrupling that process i don't think subway's gonna go for this can we just be

327
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,400
honest and say that the worst thing about going to subway is the smell you have to stand there

328
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:38,960
and stand eye to eye with the person making your food as they like contempt with every extra topping

329
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,360
you want you're creating more work for them and you can just stand there and watch them judge you

330
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,840
um i used to work next to a subway used to work at a tcby next to a subway which is like

331
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:54,400
the healthiest job i've ever had and um i was getting my lunch one day and uh a lady that was

332
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:00,960
making my sandwich cut her finger like through the plastic glove with a knife and was like oh

333
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,720
fuck and then put her hand behind her back and tried to make the rest of the sandwich with one

334
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:14,320
hand what like she's like she's on top chef like yes very much like she's on top chef moreover she

335
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,920
got blood on the fucking like i saw you you were holding my sandwich when you cut your finger

336
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:27,360
through it like no there's no way there's no way by introducing a three-inch sandwich you're

337
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:33,360
creating a lot more opportunities for that sort of thing to happen correct that's what that's

338
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:39,600
where i'm at that's what worries me i think you i mean the biggest concern and i wish i wasn't

339
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:45,280
as worried about this as i am but with with the three inch sandwich you also run a good chance

340
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,400
of getting stuck with the little curved knob nubby end that's not really worth a dollar god it's not

341
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,880
worth a fucking penny it's not worth the stomach acid that you would use to digest it oh god you

342
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,160
lose all you lose so much sandwich real estate you lose so many teeth trying to chew that nubby

343
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:10,080
nubby nug oh it's so gross this smell can we all i've brought this up twice now and nobody

344
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,520
addressed like recognized you do you guys not agree that subway is like the fucking stinkiest

345
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,280
place on earth like you walk into that place and you walk out and you smell like you smell like

346
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,000
the shoes of somebody who's been working at olive garden there's a gas station about two blocks away

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,040
them are or have the have the uh the sense to just leave a bottle there and let you judge it on that

386
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,640
one it's like you ever been fucked by a jpeg here's this picture here's a great thing about

387
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,920
extremetrains.com uh first off the girl on the front page is wearing a santa hat which i think

388
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,840
is festive secondly if you use the coupon code middle list you're gonna be able to save 20

389

390
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:28,800
was it went down in history as the year that began a sexual revolution um when you say began

391
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:35,760
you mean you mean like continued and expanded right like what do you mean i i'm saying it's

392
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,680
foolhardy to think that 2013 is the year when people are like first start going like i'm

393
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,520
all right let's try it's time to give up our deeply protestant almost amish like ways um

394
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:55,760
you know lights off you know one one position crying afterwards and we just need to like

395
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:05,040
revolution i think we need to move beyond the classic you know dinner dancing love making

396
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:12,640
murder hide the body i think we need to get good but let's break our cycles this year you know yeah

399
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,200

400
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,640
all your lady boner or your lady boner if that's they have those you can buy one of those too

401
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,600
who cares hey this year i'm invited to three different new year's eve parties and i have

402
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,960
no idea which one i should go to here are the deets on each let's take turns party one is a

403
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,400
fancy dinner party it's in quotes because i don't know if it's ironic fancy or genuine fancy and it's

404
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,480
hosted by my male best friend who i've been in love with for years but he has a girlfriend now

405
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,600
and i drink and get sad party two involves my female best friend and some mutual friends i

406
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:08,080
sort of know trekking into new york city on new year's and singing and drinking our hearts out

407
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:13,200
at a karaoke bar but besides my friend i don't like many of the other people and i really can't

408
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:20,160
enjoy karaoke unless i'm plastered party one is a fancy dinner party no no griffith no i wasn't

409
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,840
paying attention party three involves just i thought we would read them in like a random order

410
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:30,240
okay we did it just happened to be the first one and then the second one party three involves just

411
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:36,640
hanging out a group of people i like a lot and haven't seen in ages we probably cook drink watch

412
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,720
some bbc sherlock and maybe play some clue but this doesn't seem nearly as exciting as the other

413
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:49,760
two options that's from nebulous in new jersey and you're out of your goddamn mind you have among

414
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:56,400
your options the best party yeah you could go i can hang out at a party that will make me sad i

415
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,120
can hang out with some dicks i don't like or i can have the best night of my life watching bbc

416
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:06,080
sherlock and recreating it while playing clue and getting drunk with your friends and cooking with

417
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,720
your friends that you haven't seen in ages that you love what are you what are you fucking like

418
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,920
why are you punishing yourself okay to be fair i'm gonna play devil's advocate here and say i

419
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,920
totally understand okay hit me because new year's has all of this baggage behind it where you have

420
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:30,320
to feel like it was an epic thing on any other night this would be a really clear choice but for

421
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,560
some reason when new year's rolls around i go through this too where if i'm presented with

422
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,360
several different options but one seems more low-key than the others i feel like i'm doing new

423
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:45,440
year's a disservice interesting okay i can see that i can see how you'd want to feel connected

424
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:52,720
to the world at large on and you wouldn't necessarily uh want to hold up i i can't think

425
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:59,440
of any honestly like i i can the the new year's that i proposed to my wife is the only new year's

426
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:06,320
i can think of that wasn't in some fashion a slight disappointment i remember being like 12

427
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:12,800
and enjoying the shrimp plate my mother had put out that was pretty great i remember one time i

428
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,760
was at a church lock-in at midnight and i missed the ball and stuff because i was hiding under a

429
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:26,080
desk because we were playing hide and go seek um i don't know my favorite new year's are always

430
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:31,840
spent in my friend's basement with all my buds playing playing games i made an rpg maker

431
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,720
those are those are really good years i'm telling you man it doesn't matter what you do just don't

432
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:46,000
be old just don't be don't get old like us this is to quote matthew mcconaughey man he said man

433
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,920
at the beginning of it it doesn't matter what you do bud all that matters is who you're with

434
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:58,560
when you're doing it bud he said again i can't stress this enough just don't get old don't ever

435
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,640
get old don't get old like us you gotta stay young if there's younger people at one of these and

436
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:10,160
they'll let you drink their youth then go to one of those also i want to throw this out if you

437
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,880
don't know whether a party is ironic fancy or serious fancy you're gonna pick the wrong one

438
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:24,240
by making the choice you will actually shape the party don't just don't go to those parties

439
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:30,560
go go play clue i'm always friends i always always want to play clue and nobody likes playing it with

440
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,440
me uh you know i've made i've made the mistake in the past of when i was presented with several

441
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,480
different options attempting to do all of them in the same night so like we go to one place from

442
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:46,000
like eight to nine thirty and then we travel to somewhere else for 15 minutes and be there

443
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,600
till like 11 20 and then try to be somewhere else when the ball dropped and spend the rest

444
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:55,600
of the evening there it was awful it was a horrible decision yeah travis travis pulled

445
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:01,040
the travis pulled the goldilocks he didn't do a good job of it you're not i plan on the thing

446
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:08,080
give yourself permission to to not obsess about making the perfect choice just make the one that

447
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,080
sounds like the most fun and it sounds like you've already made that decision yeah you know you know

448
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:17,520
the right thing to do and you know what do me a favor also in 2013 let go of this guy yeah he does

449
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:26,640
not deserve you move on with your life can girl can let can um let go this guy in 2013 is that

450
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:32,800
the motto i think that's a bit wordy i don't think we found it yet how about just let go 2013

451
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,960
let go and then we can play that fru fru song that was on the garden states

452
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,840
that was a good that was a good song could you sing a little bit of that for me drink up man

453
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:49,440
my nothing i'll get it in the year you tell tell yourself goodbye and then you go

454
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,560
but it's but they put it through like a tuning filter this is what it's called and so it sounds

455
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:04,160
like uh like microsoft sam is singing to you get go get go jumping

456
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:16,560
i think that fits every circumstance pretty sure that's the matilda soundtrack

457
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:25,280
no it's actually the georgia the jungle soundtrack justin okay nobody know what what the fuck is he

458
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,720
saying there i don't think that he knows what he's saying at that part i don't either but i think he

459
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:40,800
says frumicera at one point what language and also what does that mean in that language well

460
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:46,080
frumicera is the ghost in fiddler on the roof oh jesus christ do you guys know what he's actually

461
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:54,880
saying there no nobody save nobody on i don't think that's true nobody save nobody on no that's

462
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:07,840

502
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:55,840
how much game does it i don't think a little kid could grow up that many years that that quickly

503
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:00,480
and then like two weeks later be like fucking a grown woman and know like what to do down there

505
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:11,520
issues too if you had a weird tom hanks bush just sprout up like nothing weird about this

506
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:20,400
conversation let's talk more about tom hanks's pews go on what do you think the curtains match

507
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:28,960
the drapes have you guys seen cloud atlas yet he sculpts his bush into eight different characters

508
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:34,640
bushes and depending on if his bush is good or bad he either moves up or down the scale

509
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,680
oh my god he had to wear hammer pants on this set of castaway

510
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,760
he's so method he refused to trim his own bush for the same amount of time the guy in castaway

511
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:53,360
would have mr mr hanks big tommy hair and makeup and downstairs hair is ready for you

00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:15,440
bush i'll cut it with that ice skate no tom you don't have to during the filming of joe versus

515
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:20,800
the volcano he was just constantly terrified he just didn't want to burst into flames out there

516
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,520

519
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:42,240

520
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:51,600
sorry pubic samson pubic samson got it got it his affability comes from the length of his pubes

521
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:57,760
if you try to trim them down you get uh you know you get a you get a angels and demons or a davinci

526
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:35,760
in 1994 and the technology could do everything except individually render tom hanks pubes

527
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:41,120
underneath and then a little company called pixar came along and developed really advanced

528
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:50,000
pube technology they originally were dixar and then they switch in the movie toy story

529
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:56,640
from certain angles in certain lights when the light is cast in a certain way across the woody

00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:01,600
figurine maybe when he's looking at the bottom of his shoe we get a little pink of his jeans

541
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,240
saying is that tom hanks has never gone full frontal in the movie we've been waiting for it

542
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:19,440
god knows when he when he does it looks like he's wearing fur pants that's what i'm saying is that

543
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,760
we have no way of disproving this so he was actually full frontal through most of the burbs

544
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:29,840
you just the camera was such a way okay the camera adds 10 pounds to your bush i'm done okay
