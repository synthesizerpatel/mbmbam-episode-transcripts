1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,020
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,020
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better with you

8
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,900

10
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,020
This is the show this is my brother my brother meets an advice show

11
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,140
Looking up I was I was logging into the app of just of note today

12
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,460
Okay, talk about you were jacking in I was I was hacking in jacking in

13
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,980

I'm huge on tick-tock. Yeah, and yes

15
00:01:53,940 --> 00:02:00,000
I just want to talk about it because is it your character where you talk about cryptocurrency trends now?

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,920
It's not crypto kid damn that hasn't found purchase in the soil crypto kid did not

17
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,400
Catch catch on easy the one where you just kind of posted a video of some guys

18
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,600
That vaguely look like a love child of our dad and Paul's the born singing a song together

19
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,280
What no that was oh?

20
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,120
No, you did it the music from

21
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,240
That's music for the mercenaries. It would take far too long to yeah

22
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:36,240
this is um, I will I will tell you I will play the art of the audio this becoming comes such a big hit and

23
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
This is a touchstone of my childhood

24
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,080
That I've been trying to get going again for years. Yeah

25
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,400
So let me just play this and then we'll like move on from there. Give me one second

26
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,040
When I was a little lad if I wanted berries and cream and mommy made me do the little lad dance

27
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,280
Now mummy's gone, but I still like to do the little lad dance and you might too you just

28
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Run in place

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,880
Nice form. So this is him like telling you how to do it. But here's the actual idea. It looks a little something like this

30
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,000
You look wonderful now sing the berries and cream song

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Sing the berries and cream song

32
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,540
Berries and cream berries and cream. I'm a little lad who loves berries and cream up the octave. Go for it

33
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,140
So I've been trying to get this guy to make a comeback for a very long time by the way

34
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,400
He's now a dance teacher. Yeah, who does not like to talk about the little no

35
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,120
Jack Ferver

36
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:57,040
his genre defying performances which have been called so extreme that they sometimes look and feel like

37
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,720
exorcisms

38
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,680
Explore the tragic comedy of the human psyche, but also he was the berries and cream boy

39
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,940
Also, he fucking loves berries and cream and please don't mention it cuz he don't like it. He don't like to talk

40
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,640
Because I like it so much

41
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,280
So here's the thing I put this sound up and I I wrote

42
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:24,040
I just uploaded the sound as a as a public service right take time. Yeah. Yeah, and I just wrote on there

43
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,000
Please make great art with this sound. It's what we all need and it's at dormant since

44
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,360
January 5th and then at some point in August all of the teens. Yes

45
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,000
All of the teens decided they could do something really special with this sound

46
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,520
And so far it the the video itself, which is not even like a good predictor of

47
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,160
of okay, the this the sound has been used in

48
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,160
12600

49
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,120
a

50
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,360
Normal amount a lot. Oh, it's a lot a lot a lot

51
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,400
That's a lot. That's a lot. I don't know

52
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,800
It's so big and it went viral and here's the thing about it guys

53
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,080
I'm a creative professional, right?

54
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:16,560
If I may be so bold like I'm in an entertainer

55
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,760
I'm a creative professional, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Definitely. It is almost now a

56
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,880
hundred percent assured

57
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,840
that the biggest

58
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,040
cultural impact I will have

59
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:40,560
Speaking in a global sense is the fact that I uploaded a clip of the Berries and Green Boy

60
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,640
Nothing I do after or before

61
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,520
in terms of scope

62
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,880
Will reach as many people as the time I clicked upload on the Berries and Green Boy dance

63
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:01,080
When when we get to the 2024 election cycle and MSNBC brings you on to get your thoughts because I believe by that point

64
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,520
You will be I don't know maybe a lawyer or a political commentator your caption at the bottom will say Justin McElroy

65
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
Berries and cream amplifier

66
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
and flu you are

67
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720
You are living the first line of your obituary

68
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
Right, right. I'm in it

69
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:26,080
Justin McElroy primarily known for putting berries and cream sound on tik-tok died today when he was murdered by jack

70
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,920
Fervor, whoa, Justin was the berries and cream guy. No, no

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,960
He put the sound up on the tik-tok app and all and then he was the biggest thing he's ever

72
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
Subsequently murdered by the berries

73
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:47,840
The truth of this is just a career I thought it would be fun to talk about

74
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,880
The truth of it is crushed. Yeah. No, it's

75
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Crushing me there's

76
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,640
12,600 videos

77
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:06,040
Millions upon millions of views of my greatest work, which is uploading the South for the Paris

78
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:12,520
Great point. Yeah, it's like when Michelangelo unveiled the roof of the the Sistine Chapel

79
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,960
But then while he was doing it he farted and then that's all people would talk about for the rest of his life

80
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,120
Even that Travis, it's not even that trap. It's like it's like if Michelangelo

81
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,080
Told everybody a dirty limerick that he heard when he was a kid and that was the thing

82
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,560
Everybody was like, oh, yeah, Michelangelo. He's the one that always used to recite that dirty limerick for everybody

83
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,180
I love that. Hey check out the ceiling of this beautiful building

84
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:49,120
It was painted by that guy who retold that dirty limerick. Yeah, who recited a dirty limerick from memory

85
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,440
Except it's like it's even worse than that because it's from a Starburst

86
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,680
Yeah, it's not even like a funny clip from a movie or a song

87
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,200
It would be like if Michelangelo's great claim to fame was he recited this McDonald's commercial from memory

88
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,280
And we all loved it so much

89
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,680
It was better than his paintings for sure. That actually would be pretty amazing if it was like Michelangelo saying ba-da-ba-ba-ba

90
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,920
I'm loving it first. But because something had traveled back in time and

91
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,400
Influenced him to do that

92
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,800
Like we love like you guys know like

93
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,600
Sure, we love the nerd shit, you know what I mean?

94
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:35,320
Like Dungeons and Dragons and Munch Squad and all this garbage. But like our dream is always

95
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,360
Like to be able to break free of it, you know what I mean?

96
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,960
And to be our own like to not to just be a mainstream success. We're fake geek boys is what we are. Yeah, yeah, yeah

97
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,560
I'm ready to shed that. Who's somebody who's like

98
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:56,080
Oh, man, I was trying to think of somebody who has done this and has not come crashing back down to earth like fucking problematic

99
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,340
Icarus hold on. Give me a second

100
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
No, I don't have anybody but you

101
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,600
Just sort of like conceptually it might be possible. Yeah

102
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:14,800
It will definitely be us who will make this succeed. We'll be the first ones, but it's like I finally found mainstream success and

103
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,580
The real double whammy is it's not even a way. I'll financially

104
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,840
Stolen content that I don't have the right to reproduce now

105
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,320
Yes, I would go so far as to say juice. Not only will you not financially benefit from it?

106
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,000
You will not brand wise benefit from no

107
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,320
There will be no increase in your SEO because of it you will find

108
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,360
Literally, no benefit for your great work the actual the only actual repercussion

109
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,760
Might be actually that I find myself at the center of a tawdry

110
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,840
legal threat now, but from that verse incorporated that's something you could make into a

111
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,320
You could make a movie out of that yeah

112
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,120
The guy that the guy that got sued by starburst I love that guy what a hero to the people it wouldn't be that

113
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,640
Please you have to you have to come testify. No, I don't like talking about the berries and cream thing anymore Jack

114
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,760
Please please Jack you have to go testify

115
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,080
Me and Jack Ferber have a thing in common now. Yeah, I don't want to talk about the birds

116
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,240
It's a great thing anymore. Now you get other stuff, you know

117
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,200
You understand why he is the way he is about the berries and cream ad because you also don't want to be just that

118
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,640
There is also a possibility here and I don't want to get too meta here

119
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,760
But this is such a specific reference and such a weird thing that was created back in like 2000 whatever

120
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:53,960
that it's possible that this is something Justin puts out right and some youth sees it now who never saw the

121
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,680
Commercial and then eventually time travel is created

122
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,840
They go back in time tell someone about it before the commercial is made and inspires the commercial be made and it is that loop

123
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:11,600
That allows our like universe to continue to interesting. Here is how bad that also doesn't benefit Justin though

124
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:19,240
Badly, I've bungled this. Yeah, even if you were to go through to my tik-tok page. Here's what you would find

125
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,240
My username is hoops McElroy. No, that is not my name. Okay, can't search that

126
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,720
My icon is a picture of four chicken nuggets with their labels on them

127
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,640
That's not helping make me and I have no bio. There's no way I have made the perfect

128
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,840
Perfect dead end for content. There is no way I could benefit from this

129
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,100
Yeah, you fucked it up, but I guarantee you juice

130
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,240
Superbowl

131
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,720
2022 oh

132
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,320
Yeah, he's back. He's back in a big way

133
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,120
It's like how it State Farm was like hey guys, remember Jake from State Farm now, he's back in all the shit

134
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,520
Starburst is gonna be like one more ride Jack. He's like I can't I've talked so much shit

135
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,960
But they're like check out this dope tik-tok. I can at least at least fix the bio. He at least fix the bio

Justin could we?

140
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,960
attempt to parlay this into you

141
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,800
Becoming the next berries and cream spokesperson

142
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,640
Right now you're now there's brand Association. I

143
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,600
Can't overstate the extent to which

144
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,560
This can't this doesn't help me at all. No, not without a little elbow grease

145
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,280
You got might as well be anonymous. I get might as well be anonymous

146
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,840
You you think anonymous can help you?

147
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:01,720
Maybe anonymous could change that sound towards like Justin McElroy does different podcasts. You can listen to it and donate to him

148
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:07,640
Listen, maybe they can all the anonymous can figure out a way to anonymous is listening. First of all, thank you

149
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:14,600
We're flattered second of all any insight any help you can offer here as to how I guess we can

150
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,880
Hack the berries and cream sounds. Yes

151
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,440
Let us know please and the biggest outcome of this would be it is if Starburst brought back berries and cream

152
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,280
Flavor fruit juice because those were pretty fucking good

153
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,640
I think we can all agree and Justin if you could do something with tastations next and see

154
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:38,160
Bring those love that. All right, please bring back tastations. All right, let's let's get let's do our show

155
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,720
Yeah, so I don't know why you would listen to us

156
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,640
No at this point like seeing how badly I've bungled this

157
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,480
Well, they were checking to see if you would do more that berries and cream content that they love and hey, look at that

158
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,400
We did you did it? Yeah, here I am. You've probably found your way

159
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,640
To the podcast because I'm so famous from when I uploaded berries and cream that one time

160
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,560
Yeah, it's so weird to listen back to this now that you're president in 2024

161
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:07,080
Yeah, you know, it's like how do they get started? I will not benefit from this at all

162
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,440
I've wasted it. I wasted my big shot at

163
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,240
Like what this happens to people right like green shirt guy, right?

164
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:21,660
You know green shirt guy who was in that one meme where he was laughing. Oh Ken bone. No, that's red. She

165
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,640
It doesn't matter for my jokes they're both on cameo and like they're

166
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:35,020
a green shirt guy who is laughing in that one meme is on cameo and he'll send the cameo to your friends and family but

167
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,460
Like does he wear a green shirt? He has yes. We're a great shirt. Never video

168
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,080
Um, I hope he's

169
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,100
This week I'll tell you guys as I was putting the other question list, I think it really helps some people this week

170
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,040
Got some real nice change of pay actionable emails

171
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,720
I've been seeing my current partner for about two years. Most of it being long-distance due to kovat

172
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,560
Oh, that's awkward timing. I know that's uncommon. Oh other people

173
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,600
Who've been in that similar scenario? It's gonna be tough

174
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:10,400
All right, a friend of mine told me that my partner is planning a surprise dirty 30 party for me

175
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,760
The problem is I'm turning 29 this year not 30

176
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,360
Why do we even need three of us anyway, I actually have stuff to do I

177
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,360
I

178
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,280
Tried laying down some hints for him, but he seems to think I'm pulling his leg

179
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,520
Do I now need to spend the rest of my life pretending to be one year older than I am?

180
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,920
That's too young in Youngstown, Ohio

181
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,680
Well, this is okay. It's just occurred to me. I

182
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,320
think a little bit of the wrinkle here is I think the pulling his leg is that like

183
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:54,680
Media like inspire joke of like, oh, I'm not turning 30. I'm turning 29 again, right?

184
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,040
Yes, exactly that kind of shit, right? I think that's it. But I cuz I was like, why would they think you're joking?

185
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,520
It's not oh, okay now I get it because I think we can all agree 30 is a disgusting number and well

186
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,200
I know it's like woof, right? I've said it

187
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,040
I've said it before and I'll say it again turning 30 is great because you're the youngest old

188
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,160
person yeah, like that's 30 you can like

189
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,920
Actively complain about feeling old and nobody rolls their eyes anymore, but you're still young enough

190
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,080
Yeah, you can like you could start you could start playing tennis

191
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Shines off that Apple by 40. Yeah

192
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,600
You don't enjoy that shit I think and I think we can all get on board with this

193
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,080
Is that when you're born you're one because you're in the first year

194
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:50,120
Year. Oh, so you're you're talking about centuries versus like 19th century is like the 1800s on right centuries

195
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,280
Exactly. Okay fucked up that we do that that way but not our age that way

196
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,720
It is weird to say like oh that baby's zero this how many how many years old is your baby?

197
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,440
Oh, my baby is five months old. I didn't ask that

198
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,440
They're in their first year. They're one years old. So you are entering your 30th year, but they're not one years old

199
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,000
Are they they're in their first year? But

200
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:20,800
They're what Griffin is arguing is there it you're entering your 30th year. Yes, this begins your 30th. Yeah. No, I can see that

201
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:27,220
That's for sure. That's definite. You don't say I have completed my 30th year. No, and now I

202
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:33,360
Right, like that's weird. Also. I'm beginning my 30th planetary cycle

203
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,880
Maybe the partner could be like, that's right. Oh

204
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,280
Oh, yes, I knew this this this information related to me. I was aware of this. It's a year-long party. Oh

205
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,940
You get it it's like a year-long party what's that mean juice well the party don't stop

206
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,320
It's a celebration for you being 30. That's so monumental. Yeah, it has to start

207
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
It has to start

208
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,640
They at your previous birth. Okay, it's a year-long

209
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,040
multi-tiered

210
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:13,200
Dimensional pitch me a version of this that isn't terrible for us, please for me. Okay. Well not for Griffin specific

211
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,600
Okay, so you anytime if you imagine your partner is having a birthday and it's a okay

212
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,720
Yeah, and it's like a year long, right? Yes, so for one year

213
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,740
Whenever there's conflict or anything approaching conflict in the relationship

214
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:39,700
you don't have to do the mental calculus of should I be supporting my partner's needs or should I be looking after my own needs to

215
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,300
Find that delicate balance that's key to any relationship. Yeah for one year

216
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:50,780
You can just relax and really put yourself in the backseat. You know, I mean, there's no nobody could get me guff about it

217
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,580
Because it's their birth. It's their birth year. Yeah now it's their birthday celebration

218
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,340
It kind of feels a little bit like what you're saying Justin is like a year-long birthday party

219
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:05,220
But in the sense of like birthday party parentheses observed in parentheses where it doesn't sound like there's a lot of

220
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,540
Celebration occurring there are celebrations throughout but there's prizes

221
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,900
What do you mean anything?

222
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,540
well, what's cool is like for the whole year you can do whatever shady things you want to and

223
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,980
What degree Justin if what do you do?

224
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,220
Let me finish the thought and your you your partner is like, what are you even doing?

225
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,700
You can just be like

226
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,060
Coming up on the birthday should be asking some questions. Yeah, it's like why's your trunk smell like that?

227
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,300
It's like birthday boy got a birthday. You got a b-day coming up. Mm-hmm

228
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,500
No, it's promotional for dexter's back

229
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,220
Celebration and also

230
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:55,940
That actually what that one I will answer for you. I'm part of a dexter's back street team

231
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,380
Mm-hmm

232
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:03,020
Promoting dexter's so I'm leaving just you know some slides with blood on them all over town

233
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:09,340
Some bloody knives all over town just whatever bloody stuff. I can find I leave it all over town

234
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,140
Hey, did you fucking kill John let's go on our couch. Yeah, it's a dexter's

235
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,660
laboratory

236
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,300
promotional materials, yeah, I

237
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:25,080
Haven't seen the show, but it's supposed to be really good and back so next year's back. Yeah this stinker he

238
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,760
He doesn't like murder which is fucked up right because it's like it's quite a bit, huh?

239
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,040
He's like Kathy, you know where he loves murder, but when he does it he's like

240
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,520
Yeah

241
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,600
You know, they're bringing dexter's back

242
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,040
When they do it, he's gonna be on CBS. So they've had to tone it down

243
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,840
So really what he does is he punches people?

244
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,240
Yeah, but he can't let anybody know that he isn't because he's his job is that he's not a punch. Oh, yeah

245
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,160
But he does if he finds a serial killer, whatever which that guy by the way, I know he's like technically

246
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:08,160
Works at police but like that guy meets so many more serial killers than I do. Yeah, just per capita

247
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,960
He's looking for them Justin and I know you well enough to say that you are actively trying to stay away from serial killers

248
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,520
It is one of my key concepts for 2020

249
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,120
It's one of your

250
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:27,280
Every year you have the same year's resolution avoid more silly serial killers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, can't beat a hundred percent

251
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,280
That's where I've been. So yeah, I mean I assume right? Yeah, I was about to say I don't want to get too dark

252
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,000
But like I don't know you've probably met a serial. Well, that's probably met a serial killer

253
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,100
Hey, hey listener take a second and rewind your whole life and try to feel like

254
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:48,540
At least one serial killer. That's why I have accepted that. I can't avoid all serial killers

255
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:54,340
So I just try really hard to make myself not their type. You know, I mean, I'm just trying to be like, oh no

256
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,340
I know not Travis though. Let him get through this thing

257
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,100
Okay, so in closing

258
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,860
Just say that you're nervous about turning

259
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:10,140
30 in a year. Oh, man, it actually I just tried to bring it up in conversation and it doesn't work

260
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,940
Yeah, theoretically, it's tough. Yeah. Hey partner. I heard that you're planning a surprise party for me

261
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,660
I just want to make it clear to you. No, no, no, no, you've ruined it. You've ruined it

262
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,680
Fucking terrible. Yeah, no kidding Travis, but we don't get to be the arbiter of that

263
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,900
Just let it just do it. It'll be a fun story

264
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:33,020
Oh look at that my grandmother confused the months and she sent me a birthday card earlier in here

265
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:39,020
Ah, but as she's written here, happy 29th. Thank you. I have a solution to this

266
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:44,380
Your friend ruined the surprise, right? Yeah, your friend needs to fix this

267
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,300
Yes, if they ruin the surprise your friend needs to go back to him be like hey

268
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:54,020
Listen, this didn't occur to me before when I it definitely did occur to me and I was just too scared to mention it

269
00:22:54,060 --> 00:23:01,900
But like they are turning 29 like there is no reality in which this should be a dirty 30-party fix it. Yeah

270
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,900
Make them fix you are right Justin and you should say it. I

271
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:13,060
I mean you did just say I oh, yeah, but I mean that's it. I think it's the thing people say hey thinking speaking of

272
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,820
avoiding

273
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:21,860
Getting murdered. Can we approach the wizard because I have more life-saving. I feel like this segment has stopped being like a humor

274
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,740
column and more like a

275
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:30,580
Slumdog slumdog millionaire like little seeds that I'm planting in the listeners mind

276
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,460
so that when they do face off against the charging ostrich, they like

277
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:41,380
Know what to do weirdly like our best chance to actually help. Yeah in like a game like a really important way

278
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:48,300
Our best chance to have somebody like oh, it's a life that exactly write us into their will or something like right, you know

279
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:53,740
Seven like seven or eight people sent this in. Thank you how to survive an encounter with a ostrich

280
00:23:54,220 --> 00:24:00,580
They can be found in the wild on safaris or on ostrich farms. I feel like if you are

281
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,980
If you get into this scenario

282
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:10,580
It's mostly on you. I don't typically find myself in places where ostriches are

283
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,740
You know what I mean, they're not well

284
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,820
Here's the thing. I agree with you Griffin if you go to an ostrich farm and you get attacked

285
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,640
But what I'm saying is with zoos and transports and such

286
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:31,820
The chances of an ostrich appearing in my backyard are very very very small, but not zero

287
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:39,260
Yeah, that's fair. I guess you know what I mean. We got the Cincinnati zoo right here. Yeah, I'm gonna escape one could escape

288
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:45,740
I'm not saying that it has please don't freak out everyone in the Cincinnati area, but I'm saying oh you know

289
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:51,460
Oh, yeah, so monkeys got away here recently and it was a huge news story. Is that true?

290
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,060
Yeah, there was another wiki how article people sent in about how to survive a monkey attack

291
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,560
Maybe we'll do that one. Maybe we'll do that one next time

292
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:04,880
But I feel like the ostrich is scarier because guess what? I'm gonna just start reading about method one evading and charging ostrich

293
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,400
Look for cover because these motherfuckers can run up to 43 miles an hour

294
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:18,200
It's so fast that's quite fast you guys got those weird legs so how do they do that? Yeah, it's it's I yeah

295
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:24,820
I don't even think about it. The ostrich is like the roadrunner's legs. Yes, exactly. They go they windmill

296
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:30,100
You got to get somewhere that they is gonna just break their break their stride

297
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,180
They're so much faster than you and they'll kick you in the back and then you're pretty much dead hide

298
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:41,360
Yeah, conceal yourself ostrich fast pretty stupid. So you got that going for you?

299
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,000
Another thing ostrich can't do is fly get up a tree. That's if you fly away

300
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:51,660
You're fine. If you fly away is fine ostrich can't stand up to seven and nine feet tall. So make it a big tree

301
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,220
I don't have teeth. That's a bonus

302
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,860
It can jab at you with its beak and upset your balance and once you get into foot town

303
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,900
Once you hit foot range of the ostrich, that's the ball game

304
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,560
Here's a fun one dive into a thorn bush

305
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,420
It sucks. It sucks. You know, what else being is sucks getting disemboweled by a ostrich

306
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:18,620
Jump right in a thorn bush and ostrich will be like and now that's no. Thanks. Just a quick one

307
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,620
I think sometimes we

308
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:26,180
We people who are not around ostriches routinely. Yeah, I think of them as a little bit doofy

309
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,700
but as you've been

310
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:34,740
Describing the ostrich. I'm reminded that birds of all from you know dinosaurs. Oh for sure for sure for sure

311
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:42,100
And the last thing to do if just all else fails you can't get up a tree or hide or whatever just lay on the ground

312
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,460
And you think like oh, it's just gonna leave you alone

313
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:52,260
No, it's gonna still beat the shit out of you, but it's gonna be apparently a little bit better because the force of an ostrich

314
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,700
His kick is dramatically reduced when you lay down, right?

315
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,500
Because they kick forward and then downward so, you know

316
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,900
They the tap they are going to scratch your it says lay in your stomach to protect your organs

317
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,900
I don't really know how to prioritize

318
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:12,540
Them when I'm doing that, but I guess if you're worried about disembowelment, that's gonna be tummy area

319
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:19,020
That's gonna be I guess tummy town and also hey, you're also not safe from the ostrich sitting on you because these bad boys can

320
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,240
Weigh between 200 and 350 pounds who walking fuck Wow

321
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,040
So that's how to evade an ostrich. So

322
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:35,300
How to calm them down, right? Well, no actually before that Travis step two is a section that is

323
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,380
It features some of the wildest illustrations

324
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:45,660
that I've ever seen on I was gonna say on wiki how but really in any sort of

325
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:51,140
Format and it's how to fend off an ostrich how to battle

326
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:58,500
How to battle a ostrich wait in the avoiding damage section. Does it mention that you should stop carrying around?

327
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,740
It's giant egg like an old-timey football guy

328
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,940
That I feel like gets you in trouble a lot of your head like Mario too. Yeah

329
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:11,820
They hate both of those because you seem like you are gonna drop it. I'm just uploading some cool pictures of people

330
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,340
Hitting an ostrich with a big stick. Okay, so you find a long weapon

331
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,100
Boy out of context. This is terrible. You gotta get a lot

332
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,180
No, there's nothing funny about hurting animals unless it's a life-or-death situation

333
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,860
You got to stay to the ostrich's side with your long weapon and these images a person is holding a long stick like a kendo

334
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,860
stick their form is

335
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,860
Impeccable to be honest

336
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:42,340
And then it just has like this is like the scene in signs where he just swings away, right?

337
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:47,960
But it's like if it's like his sister-in-law just kept saying like hey when that ostrich comes around

338
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,880
Billy or whatever swing away. The wiki article here has literally

339
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:00,460
Demonstrated the glowing weak points on the ostrich. There's neck. That's the weakest part of the ostrich clearly

340
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,540
I don't think you need a way if you are in this situation and you're like, okay, I have fuck

341
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,740
I don't know what paths I followed to get me here

342
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,860
But I'm about to fight this ostrich with a big stick

343
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,420
Where am I gonna aim this thing?

344
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:16,780
If you if you don't jump to neck if you don't jump to that long beautiful graceful powerful, but

345
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,780
Somewhat fragile neck like what else what are you gonna do? That could be a trick though

346
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,440
You know where you look at you're like, I bet that's the weak point. It's like ha ha idiot

347
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,840
Yeah, I've evolved to have like an iron neck. Yeah, well should have gone for my butt

348
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,760
There's more tips here. Actually the next thing in the order

349
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,320
It says here if the ostrich refuses to give up despite your attacks to its neck aim for its wings when given the opportunity if the ostrich

350
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,040
Refuses to give up after you struck it in the neck with a big stick several times

351
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,240
Yeah

352
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,640
Give yourself to it. Yeah feed yourself to it

353
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:58,440
You've clearly done something that has like done a kill bill style life like sworn oath on you

354
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,960
This is the only thing you have left now is you get to choose to die with honor to this

355
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:12,240
Yes, allow the ostrich a five-finger death punch you or whatever and then you slowly walk away into the sunset

356
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,920
The ostrich will nod to you knowingly and one warrior to another before it eviscerates you

357
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,120
It'll get a chance to straighten your tie before ripping your guts out

358
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:28,080
Isn't that better though then you like swinging this stupid stick after you'd have you struck it and it's beautiful powerful neck

359
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,080
And it's not fazed by it and you're like

360
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,600
And then you get murdered. No go for the legs anything after a neck attack is like completely excessive

361
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:42,200
You are not gonna reach you guys agree that like if I Justin McElroy at this point in my life

362
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:49,480
I'm the victim of an ostrich attack. It's a societal problem. Okay, there's been an

363
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,360
systemic

364
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,560
Something that's gone horrible roll. Yeah

365
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,720
infrastructure has

366
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,520
failed me

367
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,740
it can't be my fault that I'm getting attacked by an ostrich because like

368
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:06,160
the people that have ostriches and the people that are charged with looking after my welfare should

369
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,600
Have collaborated to keep me from this situation

370
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,360
There should be yes

371
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,280
There should be lines of defense between you and ostrich and if those have fallen apart

372
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,640
There are larger issues at play here. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, but I understand if I am killed by an ostrich

373
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:28,480
I want there to be like an investigation and like I want AOC to open up an investigation in Congress

374
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,480
Like how do we fail our boy so bad?

375
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,380
I'll tell you what this happened to our boy now my worry is that if those lines have broken down as Justin suggests and I get

376
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,280
Killed as an ostrich. I might not even make the news

377
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,880
No, right if that is like an etc of like horrible stuff has happened

378
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:53,900
See page 10 flip flip flip Travis McRae was killed terrible news tonight as the brother of the guy that uploaded

379
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,900
The

380
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:04,140
The only things that are left is there's two different tips saying stay the fuck away from ostriches and then there's one extra one

381
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,060
That says stay the fuck away from ostriches, especially during breeding season. Oh

382
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:14,820
Yeah, I know when that is. Yeah, if I knew an ostrich breeding season was I've probably been smart enough to avoid putting myself

383
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,100
in this

384
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,100
ostrich and then like oh

385
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,460
Like get out of there get out of that's weird

386
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,100
I smell I smell feathers and axe body spray. Oh, no

387
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:31,740
But nowhere in there Griffin. Is it how to calm down the ostrich? No your options are

388
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,180
Stay away

389
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,860
The order of this article is so fucking weird because it's like hide

390
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,500
Run away if that doesn't work

391
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,540
Doesn't work fucking hit it with a stick and it's glowing weak points

392
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:48,020
But for real though, you should probably just stay away from these guys

393
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:55,620
I like this idea that the ostrich is like a destiny to like boss fight of like aim for the glowing spot. Yeah

394
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,060
They are really given this ostrich to the business

395
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,580
It's three different people in these pictures to the shakes

396
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,780
It looks like it's three people ganging up and like you didn't think I'll take the wing

397
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:13,100
It's like the printer scene in office space, but with an ostrich instead. It's horrible. They should be arrested

398
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,860
They should and the ostrich too just for questioning at least. Yeah, well for its own protection, really

399
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,620
Though this world isn't built for an ostrich. It's not the ostriches fault that it got out here and panicked

400
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:28,280
I mean it's a ostriches world. We're all just living in it

401
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:33,540
No, I agree with you Griffin if I run into the ostrich on its native like habitat

402
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:40,100
But if an ostrich gets out of the Cincinnati Zoo and finds itself like an OTR or whatever freaks out

403
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:45,700
Everyone has to accept that like fuck. Yeah that ostrich freaked out. It doesn't understand any of this

404
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:51,020
Why why why is the parking so expensive? How come the restaurants are all so small?

405
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:55,740
Why is there a 45-minute wait right that kind of shit it runs up on me in a Trader Joe's?

406
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,340
And I'm like you're in my world now

407
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:04,140
Welcome to my world and you hit it with a baguette and then I get up right with a bag out right in the face

408
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,860
Yeah with a baguette

409
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:11,260
Griffin now you want to do another question, but unfortunately, I want to go to the money down. I don't

410
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,500

452
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:00,540
Yes

453
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:06,140
I get that these are the biggest question of our time and we're often joined by special guests like Nathan Fillion

454
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,180
Orlando Jones and Padgett Brewster

Welcome on squad the podcast within a podcast

459
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:45,100
Podcast profiling the latest and greatest of brand eating. There is a I mean

460
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,220
everyone decided to just

461
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,660
Like Jack it back up like the munch

462
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:56,260
My thing today that I'm gonna say to you is the munchies back because people are going wild

463
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:00,060
Do you think they were waiting? This could be where we saw started to see like

464
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:04,740
You remember when it seemed like code was going away and we saw the push into

465
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:12,620
into like some like travel and some of those other sectors and then it seemed like Delta was like back and then it's like

466
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:18,380
Maybe the stay-at-home brands are where we want to keep the bulk of our sort of interests. Yes. Sure. Sure

467
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,000
Yeah, I think this is kind of where we're at right now where it's like

468
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:26,300
This is a flush of people thinking like time to get nasty again, you know what I mean?

469
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:32,740
Where's also sucked a lot of the oxygen out of the room. Yeah. Well guess who's trying to start it back up

470
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,740
You're fucking kidding me

471
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,860
Taco Bell what?

472
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,020
Taco Bell is unleashing and it says unleash and they know

473
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:48,760
They know they're unleashing the crispy chicken sandwich

474
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,180
Talk now already knows

475
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,580
Nationwide on September 2nd. You can't just do that

476
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:02,380
He the words mean something Taco Bell beginning September 2nd Taco Bell's long-awaited

477
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:09,140
Crispy chicken sandwich taco will be available nationwide and participating locations for a limited time

478
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:15,100
Not quite a sandwich not quite a taco. It doesn't have to explain itself. It does

479
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:25,060
After locally testing earlier this year in Nashville and Charlotte to much success the test kitchen masterminds knew it was time to go nationwide

480
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:31,740
Pull the trigger fluffy. Okay. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Sorry. We've talked about this before in episode 550

481
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,900
We talked about this. Yes, my friend. Yes

482
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:41,680
This is now nationwide that we have not talked about the the fat wait 550. Yeah, bud

483
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,140
Yeah, this was the test. That was the test. It's it's here

484
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:50,740
It's not fluffy like a sandwich but folded like it. It's fluffy like a sandwich. Yeah

485
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:55,060
Yeah, but it's folded like a taco. Mm-hmm. No

486
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,900
No, I stand by I think what my position back then looking at a picture of these bad boys now

487
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,900
Which is that I would fuck them up proper

488
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:06,540
I'm looking at it again. I'm getting hungry all over. I would ruin these bad boys

489
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:14,500
They're the crispy chicken sandwich taco is a taco or a sandwich might just be the greatest debate of recent time

490
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,060
Oh, yeah, I think it might just be according this press release

491
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,060
in

492
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,380
2021

493
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:25,500
Whether this is a taco or a sandwich might just be the greatest

494
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:33,380
Debate of recent time and that's why Taco Bell has enlisted some of the brightest minds in the country to help fans

495
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,500
James Carville

496
00:41:35,500 --> 00:42:02,020
Now now listen, it's me, Ben Shapiro, I say it's a sandwich. It's a me! It's a taco have identity politics. It's a sandwich. It's a me. I'm Ben Shapiro. Now back to my toilet where I live.

497
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:10,780
I need to find some way of saying it's a taco that reveals like it is also the most brutal self demolishing own

498
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:14,580
Possible because that is his brand is like trying to chuck one

499
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,940
He like he does an air ball and then it bounces off the rim and gives him a concussion

500
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,540
So

501
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:27,780
It's gotta be a taco because when I ate it I got diarrhea for six hours that only happens when I eat tacos

502
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:35,500
You're right. That's right on September 4th Taco Bell will use two real college debate teams from the University of Georgia and Clemson University

503
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:42,500
To go head-to-head in the name of team. It's a sandwich and team. It's a taco. Oh boy

504
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:53,420
The great crispy chicken sandwich taco debate will air Saturday September 4th

505
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:58,380
During the Georgia vs. Clemson primetime college football game on NBC. Oh

506
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,120
record numbers, it's it's

507
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,740
What they have done here is they have wandered into the chicken sandwich wars

508
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,580
that is what bothers and yes, and while everybody else is like

509
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:15,540
Ah a new opponent a new contender enters the battlefield, but Taco Bell is like hold up

510
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,600
Because we have our own drama that we need to like

511
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,600
Figure out first, please. Don't don't go on the attack

512
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:29,560
Nobody else is allowed to announce a chicken taco until we figure out this shit and do some real soul searching

513
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:36,600
It's like it's like you can't decide if it's a taco or it's a it's a sandwich. Okay. Well one of them

514
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,920
Will enter you into will thrust you into an international

515
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:49,320
Conflict that has I will reiterate for maybe the dozenth time claimed human lives

516
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:58,480
Again I feel like I'm losing it with this thing, but people have done. Okay, it's not a joke

517
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,520
One of them enters you into that. The other one is like, I don't know. It's another bad taco

518
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,360
We did it or like it'll still be good. I mean bad in the sense of like

519
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,240
It's not a it's not a taco, but it stopped

520
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:20,240
You just no no Travis. It's important that we take a beat here and appreciate what Justin just did which is

521
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,320
Throw. Oh, I tried to like through your hat in the ring a little bit

522
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,000
I see my hat there a I mean

523
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,120
But it ain't a sandwich either as Hodgman that somebody get a Hodgman on the phone and ask you what they want Hodgman though

524
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,000
They want Hodgman for free juice and we're not gonna like that

525
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,440
I

526
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,580
Want to get I'm gonna text don't you don't know how I feel about the fact that

527
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,600
we've been doing Munchquad now for a long time and it's reached a point where

528
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:51,040
The fact that Taco Bell has enlisted human beings and let's human youths

529
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,240
To debate whether a thing they made

530
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,120
It's a taco or a sandwich on live

531
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:07,720
television they should know yeah, I don't know you're asking me right it should bother me, but

532
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:13,800
Instead I'm just left empty inside and thinking like well. Yep. This is where we are

533
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,480
where was this indecisiveness when they announced the naked chicken taco where the chicken was the

534
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,200
Was the the shell the tortilla they knew what they were they made that they made that fucking

535
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:31,400
Monstrosity and they were like this ladies and gentlemen this folks. This is definitely a taco

536
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,840
Right here. Why just while we're here

537
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:40,200
I just want to mention a couple of other things and I don't want to like outstay my welcome here with Munchquad

538
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,440
But there's a lot going on. Okay

539
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,240
Sonic is doing a lineup of wine inspired slush. Yes

540
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,800
excellent

541
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,200
fantastic

542
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:58,280
This free well, it's that thing of like I want to capture the the feeling of drinking frozen wine

543
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:04,760
That doesn't get me dry. Yeah, that's I love that stinky fruit flavor. They got strawberry for a say

544
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:12,000
Red berry sangria and peach Bellini. That's not gonna get confusing at all when people see that

545
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,840
Well, why would it be confusing? It's just it's a peach Bellini that doesn't

546
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,840
Yeah

547
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,640
It's a sangria

548
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:27,880
Which I believe is only a term used for the alcoholic drink, right? Not yet

549
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,520
It's not that one. No

550
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,720
and

551
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:37,800
Then I did want to I just have one other thing to talk to you guys about and that's that pumpkin month

552
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,640
It's coming up

553
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,280
Starbucks just decided to pop it off August 24th, which I think is ridiculous

554
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,920
we are a month away from calendar fall and a week away from Justin fall and

555
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,560
I I don't think that this is the appropriate time

556
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,840
I think you need to start wait till the beginning of Justin fall or calendar

557
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,160
15th says correct

558
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:09,960
Fall September 1st. Nope fog is 15. Yes. That's back to school season. No one cares. Nobody cares

559
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:17,640
Yes PSL. Hey just for fun. Yes. How many PSL do you guys think Starbucks is sold since 2003 2003 1 billion?

560
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,960
Okay, I'll say

561
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,720
600 million

562
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,120
Wow

563
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:30,160
500 million excellent job. Thank you. I still went over and lost. Yeah, he was over by 20 percent. Just that's not that good

564
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:37,080
Last last year if you'll remember Starbucks had a 1-800 number. Do you guys remember this where you could call?

565
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,640
Oh, I remember. Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah pumpkin jokes or something

566
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,860
Today, there is a this year. We got a pumpkin level meter

567
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:52,680
It's a quiz and we're gonna find out where you guys fall who wants to say I do for Travis me me me. Oh, perfect

568
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:58,160
Here we go. Which which would you get for a first tattoo? Trav a heart-shaped pumpkin?

569
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,880
What uh-huh?

570
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,280
Okay, a heart shape. Yeah, you know pumpkin in the shape of a heart a

571
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,840
PSL on your tongue so you can always taste it a

572
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:14,640
Pumpkin cream cold brew goes here on your palm or a full flannel sleeve. Oh

573
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,080
Please try to answer honest. Uh, I think of those four full flannel sleeve

574
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:26,480
Okay, that would be uh, it seems like all those would be something that a pumpkin fan would do

575
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:32,120
What would you do if your significant other proposed with a pumpkin cream cold brew?

576
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:36,000
Oh, fuck would you would you take the drink and run?

577
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,680
Would you say yes immediately?

578
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:45,000
Pumpkin is my significant allow or post a photo in the leaf rakers

579
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:50,500
Society ASAP, huh? I think I'd take the drink and run would be my honest answer

580
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:57,600
It seems like it I kind of thought this would be about like how much do you like pumpkin

581
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:03,260
Trav, what's the first thing you do after arriving at a pumpkin patch? Oh take a shit

582
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,440
pumpkin patch

583
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,440
photoshoot give him pumpkin

584
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,920
Is that a separate answer?

585
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:20,200
Semi-colon give him pumpkin to talk about. I was so worried that that was a separate answer

586
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,840
Pumpkin patch photoshoot comma

587
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:30,240
Give them pumpkin to talk about calm. Okay, it says this it's a semi-colon actually pumpkin patch foot, which I don't think it's being

588
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,680
used here

589
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:38,760
But whatever it's a it's it's a it's a AI cloud generated quiz spend hours hunting for the perfect pumpkin

590
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,440
hours hunting for the perfect pumpkin

591
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,440
Grab as many pumpkins as you can fit into your car and then some so I don't

592
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:53,740
Break my car? Shatter my car's windows with the pressure the internal pressure

593
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:58,400
I'm gonna duct tape them to the top right and then this was probably the wildest one of all

594
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,880
Get your pumpkins and go. Wow. Okay, that's awesome

595
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,120
So what this is implying is a very

596
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,880
mechanical very austere

597
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,280
Yeah, dutifully

598
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,400
No, no more chat I'm

599
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,960
I'm leaving now to return. I'll be honest fellas. It's hard for me to move on from give them pumpkin to talk about

600
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,840
I mean, that's the answer pumpkin to talk about is really

601
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,000
Yes, I wanted to reflect you as I get the first thing I do when I get to a pumpkin patch

602
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,400
I'm taking some photos for the gram to give them pumpkin to talk about. Of course. That's actually probably true

603
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:37,200
Something to talk about by Bonnie Ray is a song about people

604
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:43,240
Spreading rumors that you and somebody else is is is our lover. Yes

605
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:49,920
Yes, so oh so Griffin are you saying that this is implying that I'm taking this photo shoot and be we're gonna say like is

606
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,760
Travis fucking that pumpkin. I think it looks like in this picture. He's fucking the pumpkin. Yeah, that's what I do

607
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,180
Would you ever name your pet pumpkin I

608
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,640
already did

609
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,520
BRB changing their name

610
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:14,080
My pet is a pumpkin. No fourth answer provided. Oh boy. So

611
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,240
Again, would you name your pet pumpkin? I already did

612
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,500
BRB changing their name

613
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:25,440
My pet is a pumpkin. How are you supposed to judge your pumpkin love with these?

614
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,560
Yeah, where's the fourth one like hypothetically I would if that name fit with that particular pet

615
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:35,520
It's like seemed like a good name for I I guess my answer would be of those three

616
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,280
Uh

617
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:43,360
BRB I'll just change your name. Would you rather let a stranger hold your PSL or hold your baby?

618
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,400
Right. No third or fourth options provided

619
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,960
Um, I guess the answer would be that I'd let him hold my PSL because if they ran away with that

620
00:51:53,960 --> 00:52:02,480
It's a lot easier to replace sure. Wait is PSL penis leash. Yeah. Okay. Wait, what what's the S for there Justin?

621
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,480
Penis of penis

622
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:21,480
Wanna let him hold your PSL or your baby? Oh, well, then it's definitely my PSL if that's the case

623
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,600
Cuz why else have it? Why else would I have it?

624
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:30,520
You're not gonna hold your own. No. Why would I have that? It's for other people

625
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,080
Oh

626
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,480
POV

627
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,640
POV

628
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,640
You're lost in the corn maze. Yeah

629
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,120
How are you getting out?

630
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,920
This one's an essay

631
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:52,180
Yeah, right the plan your plan your route I'm probably not getting out tbh no or follow the smell of penis leash

632
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,400
Well, I'm not a defeatist

633
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:01,220
So I guess I'm gonna go with penis leash here when the real answer the third one would be just start charging forward

634
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,600
Through the corn. It's for help

635
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:11,540
What pumpkin item would we most likely find in your closet and it says no judgment. Oh wait

636
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,400
a

637
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,800
pair of shoes carved from actual pumpkins. Oh

638
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,720
Pumpkin fashion isn't my passion a

639
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,160
Pumpkin onesie

640
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:28,040
Or a vintage pumpkin patchwork jacket the vintage pumpkin patchwork jacket

641
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:33,400
Then there needs to be more options in this quiz. That's like I don't actually really like the pumpkin spice

642
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,000
That's what the second one is. The second was like, no, you know what on second thought

643
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,720
I know I've made it pretty far through this quiz, but actually fuck pumpkins and not in a fire

644
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:46,800
This is the last one. Okay, Trav. You make your way to the pumpkin prom

645
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,480
What move are you busting out?

646
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,460
An organized fall flash mob a

647
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,120
series of perfect pumpkin pirouettes

648
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,740
The pop lock and pumpkin

649
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:09,280
Not my style I'll be by the pumpkin punch. It's that one not my style be the by the pumpkin punch ball

650
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:15,880
Because if I'm being honest, I was always a little nervous that dances, but I did love punch

651
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,800
the results are in Travis, huh

652
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:28,800
You are a secret pumpkin admirer. Okay. This is the second to least you can like

653
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,900
The second to least you can like pumpkins is secret pumpkin Meyer

654
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,880
Even though you don't fully embrace the pumpkin loving lifestyle

655
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:44,880
It's hard to ignore that tingly feeling you get inside whenever you get your hands on one again

656
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:50,160
By that we mean a pumpkin get your hands on a pumpkin and you tangle. Don't worry

657
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,800
We won't tell if you don't want us to it can be our little

658
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:00,800
Pumpkin spice fill you can cook that pumpkin until the cows come home and we're gonna keep it quiet here at Starbucks

659
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:06,920
TM that that is until you share this with your followers, then it just says you can share now. Oh

660
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,760
What is the least you can like pumpkin there?

661
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,520
Yeah, well Travis a scientific quiz. I can't just move the needle to where it point

662
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,720
Yeah, I would just love it if like the least option is just like well you fucking got us

663
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,400
Hey, we got caramel macchiato

664
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,560
Come in for a plain black coffee, okay

665
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,720
So anyway, that's the bunch quad

666
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,800
Do we want to do one other question real quick?

667
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,400
Yeah, okay. I

668
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,720
Was recently able to order one of the new Xbox nice

669
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,440
nice

670
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,160
Nice nice during checkout the estimated arrival was sometime in the middle of next week great

671
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:51,840
I recently got an email that shipping have been expedited and it would now be arriving this Saturday also great right wrong Saturday

672
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,960
Is my fiancee's birthday?

673
00:55:52,960 --> 00:56:01,160
How can I avoid explaining to my fiancee that I bought myself a new present for her birthday some additional context something similar happened last?

674
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:06,640
Year, we're ended up buying myself a new bicycle on her birthday. I don't know how this keeps happening

675
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,400
Hmm

676
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,400
Conflicted about Cortana in Kentucky. I

677
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,200
Know hide-and-lie, and that's not a bad. That's not a terrible one to do

678
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,200
On the spectrum of of

679
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:25,560
Fibs is you know hiding away squirreling away your Xbox for a couple days

680
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,640
To make it seem like it arrived when it was supposed to arrive

681
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:36,400
Oh, that's a victimless crime, but if you don't want to do that. I do think you just got to get a better present than

682
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
the Xbox

683
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,400
Good fucking luck because I mean

684
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,640
Master chief blinks the time sweeper

685
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:53,040
Banjo-kazooie, it's like how are you gonna be you can't be that's the that's the dream team right there

686
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,200
You can't beat that at this point pretty soon

687
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:02,360
You're gonna be married right at which point 50% of your stuff will be theirs anyways legally. Just give them the Xbox

688
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,320
like

689
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:11,640
That's that seems bad though. It's like I know you won't like this as much as me, but here it is

690
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,640
It's a gift for you

691
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,980
Now here's the problem. Okay. Here's the problem question asker

692
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:23,340
Is that a year ago you preemptively fucked this up by getting yourself a bike on their birthday that you could have

693
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:27,940
Easily not done now. This is happening

694
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:34,060
You're gonna have to give that Xbox away to me as punishment damn. Well, here's the other thing

695
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,980
I was gonna say question asker and I don't want to be sort of a doubt downer

696
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,460
But maybe just cancel shipment cuz I ain't no game. Oh, yeah

697
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:45,860
Damn, I use their it. I hate to bring it like this to be kind of Sony

698
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:51,980
Oh, yeah, there's no games that Sony there's only we got them all

699
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,100
Sony's got them all

700
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,700
For Xbox. They're a they don't have crash

701
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:05,500
No crash bamdakut on that one or gex is the term Sony crony cuz I've always used like I'm a bro for Sony and just

702
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,500
Said like I'm a brony. Is that not?

703
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:12,340
No, that's not the one you could be a Sony crony or a Sony Sony

704
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:15,780
Uh, what's the one? Yo, is it Sony Pony? Oh

705
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:24,420
See that's so weird. I've actually combined it when I said I'm a brony pony. Is that bad? No, that's good

706
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,140
No, it's good. Okay. It's a good name

707
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:34,460
This it just and I'm someone who loves Xbox. So I've also also I just said I'm a sex box. Yeah

708
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,060
maybe you could try to do like

709
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:40,980
Oh, man, I won the contest. Yes

710
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:47,860
Maybe like I won that contest I entered. Okay, wait for Xbox. There is a way

711
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,280
This is gonna sound manipulative. I just did it. Of course. There's a way

712
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,780
I think you spend some time on this contest victory. It's good stuff

713
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:00,600
There's just I'm just saying you want a contest. I did hands-on. I did hands-on a hard body win

714
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:06,600
Um over overnight. Yeah, other people did a bad job

715
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,120
I thought it would take way longer. I thought the other day when I was gone for 20 minutes

716
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,800
That was it. It was a hands-on a hard body. It lasted 20 minutes

717
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:23,240
They filled the fucking room with scorpions and you know me I think I think they're cute. I think they're neat. So easy Xbox

718
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,600
