1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
If you change your mind

2
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,840
I

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,600
Don't want to do this

4
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,820
I'm brothers together for advising telling people

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,840
Tell them what they don't what?

6
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,960
Three of us are around a mic and we're so close

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,000
It's despicable like it's gross. I can feel I am feel

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,800
I feel Griffin's whiskers on my cheek. There's an odd number of us

9
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,640
I think you're too far you got to come close

10
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,680
I think we call I say this because we only have one mic so I know for a fact you have to get close

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,000
We got to take a vote if we should continue this show or if we should just abort it

12
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,680
When would we do it if we aborted it?

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,360
We'll figure out another time. I support our right to choose. All right, so advice, right? What's the story with that?

14
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,760
Is that is that how we're beginning the episode? That's the beginning of the episode? Yeah, that's how it begins

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:34,140
Advice, what's the story with that? What is the story? What's the dealio? What's the dealio? Hey, that's for some queries

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Hey there, ma'am. My boyfriend has been struggling with an addiction to internet porn for a long time

17
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,720
Neither he nor I like this issue that he has to deal with and would rather him get over it as soon as possible

18
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,740
What can I do to help? What are your suggestions to him? Thanks tannery what?

19
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,680
Tannery, all right. Well, that'll allow it

20
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,520
Um

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,180
Let me see if I get this straight you your BF your boyfriend is addicted to internet porn. Can you be addicted?

22
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,160
No, that is not a thing. It happens addiction is a physical thing

23
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,080
So he really likes internet porn

24
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,060
How do you stop that get it?

25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,780
We live without the internet for thousands of years just cancel it. Yeah, just get it sexy

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,840
Just one. I'm just saying if she's asking for a way to help she needs to get it sexy

27
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,840
I don't know what getting a sex

28
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,640
Yeah, tannery needs to sex it up. She needs to replace internet porn. What what what human have you seen the internet?

29
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,840
What like the things those people are willing to do are just despicable

30
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,520
How how could a regular woman help hope to live up to that?

31
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,760
Well, I guess the real question is how much do you love your boyfriend?

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:49,480
You love your boyfriend enough to foot crush some stuff. I'm talking about like the difference between love and just physical like just laws

33
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:56,040
You can't be as big as the internet. You can't be as sexy as it internet's on 24-7. It's available for you

34
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,880
It's gonna cater to whatever bizarre desire you want. The air is like a sex Hydra, right?

35
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,480
Sex Hydra, you can cut off its heads, but in other words just gonna spring right back into place. Yeah

36
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,040
so I would say

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,760
Cancel your internet because it's the only way you got to keep them from the internet because the internet is

38
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:21,960
Pretty much just porn these days or maybe it's something you two could share together. Watch that internet porn together. Make it a magical

39
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,200
weird

40
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,560
Weird, maybe you need to cancel your boyfriend

41
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,280
Justin you're pushing me. You're not cancel the mic. We got one mic. Do you remember one mic?

42
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,760
Remember this one mic one level look pretty tight, but I'm saying

43
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:43,040
Cancel cancel that cancel that boyfriend. I'm a chubby guy and I've never been a relationship. That's half true

44
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,000
I've not it's not that I have a problem talking to bitches or anything. It's just there's your problem right there

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,280
You got to stop calling them bitches. No, he didn't call bitches girls

46
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,560
It's just the only girls I find attractive are out of my league and can never

47
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,960
Work up the courage to actually ask them out all let me help you out with this man. Lower them standards

48
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:08,160
You got them too high you're reaching for dust bunnies on the ceiling we got shit under your couch it needs to be dealt with

49
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,440
Lower that standard there's no such thing as out of your league, bro

50
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,520
Yeah, except there is be that way. Wait, let me correct you. There's no such things out your league if you're hugely physically attractive

51
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,880
Because then anything is within your reach I would say

52
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,440
Your problem is you're getting intimidated because you don't have the skills yet

53
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,600
You're trying to friggin knock one out of the park when you should just be trying to pick up a grounder

54
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,760
You know, everyone wants to buy that Corvette first car out. Yeah, you just don't have the capital for that man

55
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:45,240
You're gonna need to get that used Kia. Yeah, you know the juice you consider hopping on that Atkins diet train get that Atkins

56
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,800
Hit that ketosis drop about 50 get your key to get your keyed up drop about 50 in a week

57
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,360
And then you pick up a fly honey, and then you start eating your breads and your balloon again

58
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,080
And then you look right up and you're like too late. You're already with this lady confusion. She'll never know

59
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,400
Fuckin hey, yeah answers user Charlie asks Christians if we did discover aliens

60
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,220
Should we share the gospel with them? Does Jesus love aliens too?

61
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,080
Deep I

62
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,320
Would think that it takes so much energy to love people

63
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,560
That like he's got to have an outlet and the outlet is probably hating people from other

64
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,080
I love everyone on earth, but everywhere else fuck them

65
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,800
Well, do you remember?

66
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,720
Independence Day right the end of Independence Day right when Will Smith he fired the nuke, but it didn't go off

67
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:45,120
Until a miracle happened and then I blew up the mothership and saying that miracle was Randy Quaid that miracle is Jesus love

68
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
Blowing up aliens through Randy Quaid

69
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,440
Through Randy Quaid Randy Quaid wasn't in that film

70
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,840
Yeah, it was you're too young to remember because you just remember him as a hero because you're a child

71
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,840
You've replaced him in your mind's eye with Jesus, isn't that Dennis Quaid? Now it's Randy

72
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,640
He does hate he does hate people from other planets but at the

73
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,200
Millennial Jesus convention, he always covers it up for like he doesn't tell Mars Jesus that he hates

74
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,800
Martian so it's a franchise, right? Because I've always assumed the Jesus franchise

75
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:24,600
Ah Jupiter Jesus is my new stage name. You should have been there. You should have been there when they excommunicated Pluto Jesus

76
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
It was crazy

77
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,960
No, no Jesus's for moons. Get out of here

78
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
Pluto Jesus is also my favorite Eddie Murphy movie

79
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,480
This summer

80
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,560
Eddie Murphy is Pluto Jesus. I work as a lead to the coffee house

81
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,400
How can I best impress the virtue of cleaning up after oneself on my co-workers and boss?

82
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,760
I still don't know. Hey, you're not the boss. Don't fucking worry about it. Yeah, don't worry about your boss

83
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:00,100
Let him do his thing your co-workers just the first time they leave trash around pick it up and throw it at their face

84
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,280
Probably when they're busy slash a couple tires and that shit changes around real quick. Just be careful that you don't get murdered

85
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
Wow, man. Yeah, don't get murdered

86
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,640
Seriously

87
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,320
There's a callback to last week's show. It's okay. It was a long time ago. It's been a long week

88
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,440
Just don't get murdered the 21st of June will be my birthday

89
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,200
Looking for advice on how to kick it like a McElroy any suggestions sort of drinking out of children's beach toys

90
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,880
Would be much obliged as I'm only turning 19

91
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040
James

92
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:45,040
James 19 years old. That's a rough age because you're not an adult

93
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,040
Anymore, I mean you're still an adult, but you're not turning into an adult and you're still two years away from any practical upshot

94
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
Even 20 is cool cuz you're in your 20s

95
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,280
So I guess I'm saying is keep it on the silent

96
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,560
Oh

97
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,800
I thought you're saying like sit at home by yourself. Keep it quiet. Don't bother people with it, man

98
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,640
Nobody cares calls to the year. It's just keep it quiet

99
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,920
So you're not suggesting he practiced some surreptitious flaskmanship

100
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,720
No, no, just take a chill pill. Everybody's first question is gonna be how old are you me like 20 19. They'll be like, yeah

101
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,480
What did you do? Okay. Well

102
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
Not a big deal, but I guess

103
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:35,120
19 wasn't a great year. So have fun James. You did it. Enjoy it. Yeah. Enjoy it. Drink it in drink it deep

104
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,120
I

105
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,900
Haven't been for a checkup in years and decided it's about that time

106
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,300
The only problem is I really like this like the idea of another guy touching my wiener

107
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,400
Whatever the context what I come across as some degenerate if I asked specifically for a female doctor

108
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,720
Is it normal for a guy to outright refuse to have a male doctor in a wiener related circumstance?

109
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,440
I I feel so completely the opposite on this subject that I only want a dude touching my wiener when it comes to

110
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,080
What if you have a female doctor and she chuckles? What if there's a chuckle?

111
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,140
I made the decision when I went in that

112
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,380
He was gonna be just as uncomfortable as I am like if I'm gonna be uncomfortable in this situation

113
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,280
Guess what brah? So are you put your finger in my butthole try to use the phrase get it as much as possible?

114
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,880
So like mmm get it or just like that

115
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,040
Just like that one finger. That's all you can get

116
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,600
Sometimes you can distract yourself from feeling awkward by making someone else feel worse. I

117
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,520
Mean more awkward or just worse just insert them while they're down there holding your wiener

118
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
It's like by the way, your haircut is ugly

119
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,600
So go into the office fully erect is basically what you're saying and don't ever address it like this. This is

120
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,160
Why don't you try to remember he's trying to keep you from having prostate cancer

121
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:15,240
You you terrible terrible selfish person out the worst. He's not gonna touch your wiener worst-case scenario. He's gonna cup them balls

122
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,640
It's not biggie no big juice that nut yahoo answers user

123
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,920
Tesorio asks, how do my nipples hurt?

124
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,800
Did you saw that please how do my nipples hurt I

125
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,320
Think that's supposed to be how do my nipples hurt and not like some sort of archaic like Oh

126
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,560
Do my nipples hurt?

127
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,080
I went swimming today at the lake while we were in the water for like an hour or so and my nipples started hurting like

128
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,000
After an hour. Why is that? I was wearing a t-shirt. They really hurt like they sting. What can I do to make it stop?

129
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,240
It's the t-shirt man. They're your nipples are sensitive. Some people say they're the most sensitive organ on your body

130
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,200
And you've got a wet t-shirt there. They're just

131
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Rubbing

132
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,000
Just run I had it we had remember those boogie boards we got once the beach one time

133
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,880
I got these boogie boards again about it

134
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,360
They had the texture of sandpaper

135
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,440
We would just dive in the ocean on them like nipple first like we land directly on our nipples

136
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,880
Funny McElroy fact our chests are all sandpaper smooth like all like nipples gone. No belly buttons

137
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,160
It's just a flat sheet. It's really weird

138
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,640
medical mysteries

139
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,900
Griffin ask a question. I want to do is two yahoos in a row. I'm president. What is the best flavor of jelly?

140
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,400
We don't have to answer this one but someone went on the internet

141
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,280
With this burning question that he had to fucking crowdsource

142
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:49,720
What is the best flavor of the worst things? He's still I'm looking at zero answers. That means he's still sad

143
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,000
Still standing at the curve. There's actually ten answers

144
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
strawberry

145
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,600
Flavor jelly get that jelly. It's just a matter of opinion. Mine is peach

146
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,760
Great, but even better is grape jam pear preserves by Braswell's are awesome boob flavor get it

147
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,640
All right, strawberry raspberry. I love orange marmalade

148
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:21,940
But my favorite is whatever is available for toast at the time. It depends on the person. I personally prefer grape boys and dairy

149
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,580
What a weirdo. I don't know what he said. Hey, why I don't know what he say

150
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:33,480
Hey as un-clever and awful as these people are nobody said can they really are the worst and the worst is being the only

151
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,480
No, it's worse that someone

152
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,720
Is curious what other people think about jelly or that someone thinks that they're curious about what they think about jelly

153
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,080
Like I'm gonna get on here and answer this guy. He needs

154
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,680
But listen Robbie if you are listening get that rose jelly we had some of those

155
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,080
Jesus it's delicious. You can only get in Britain, but it's worth the investment

156
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,720
Smear that on your English muffin. I have two gay brothers whose wedding

157
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,000
Sorry, I miss read it. I miss read it. I have a gay brother whose wedding is coming up soon

158
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,880
I'm the best man at the wedding

159
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,720
I am very happy for him and I wish him the best of luck my girlfriend

160
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,480
Who is supposed to come with me to the wedding has expressed her dislike for gay rights and gay marriage

161
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,260
She's expressed her unwillingness to come to the wedding due to her own beliefs. What the fuck do I do?

162
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:25,360
Andrew that's a tough putt man. Thank you. Wicked sick you wicked. I've been thinking about this and I have an idea

163
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,720
I'd like to play a game. All right, we're gonna play a point counterpoint game, right?

164
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:36,560
Which one of my Justin you are going to be pro gay marriage Griffin. You are going to be anti gay marriage Justin go

165
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,240
Okay, I think gay should be married. Okay, Griffin go

166
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,600
It's yucky. It's sake. It's a union that I

167
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,080
Respect and frankly love is real

168
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,000
Well, is it real if it's two mouths?

169
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,520
Maybe in your man mouth has been married for time five seven times, right?

170
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,280
But how Andrew I hope that helps how many times they married men how many times is man mouth? That's another man mouth

171
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
What's wrong with that? It's beautiful

172
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,440
Guys, I've seen a lot of movies and I know the way that this shakes out is that the

173
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Your brother and his free-spirited

174
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,120
Husband meet your girlfriend and they

175
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,280
Enchant her with their love and convince her that she was wrong all along. I've seen Lacoste

176
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:28,160
I feel I know how it goes or or it pulls the saving Silverman and you you kick a man to Pete to the curb

177
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,040
Yeah, and and also probably the case is she just doesn't want to go to the wedding because going to wedding sucks

178
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,800
So gay or straight wedding. Okay weddings are the bomb. You know, are they fun? They're dope

179
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,040
Yeah, I've been the one I gotta get down on that. They're very brief and the catering is usually very snappy

180
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,200
Yeah, and everyone wears briefs, which is weird

181
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:50,520
My first wedding anniversary is coming up on July 21st

182
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,480
You can use your expert advice on a cool gift for my husband

183
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,680
His primary hobby is gay being gaming but I typically steer away from buying games as he researches and buys those for himself

184
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,240
He also loves our college basketball team

185
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,920
That's nondescript, but I've already bought him all sorts of

186
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Local team I he enjoys local team all sorts of teen related perfinity over the years now. I'm at a loss

187
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,520
So I'm hoping that y'all can come up with a great anniversary gift for a 30 year old guy

188
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Any suggestions will be much appreciated?

189
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,920
My husband is a big fan of the podcast. So a mention on the show would be a little gift all by itself

190
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,440
But feel free to shout out my excellent husband Jonathan if you're so inclined that's from Rebecca

191
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,240
So shout out to Jonathan. I have a perfect gift

192
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,720
Track down Tenry's husband get him to make you a guide to all the hot sites

193
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:46,440
It's a gift that says hey, I'm cool. I'm down. I know you have needs and this is a guide made specially for you

194
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,360
I feel like we used up all of our good gift suggestions last week

195
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,920
But I'm sure we still got some in the tank. Have you considered a home brewing kit? Oh

196
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,640
Always good home bring kids a very is a great idea

197
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,680
maybe you could wait for your

198
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,920
If your beer to be done cooking as you explore all the new pornography sites at Tenry's husband

199
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
To

200
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,400
Meats

201
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Some form of meats maybe a meat

202
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,020
Subscription a meat of the month Club. Is that a thing that exists?

203
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,840
Sure, it should be noted that the two of them haven't received a gift for many years

204
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:25,640
So this is largely from memory and what they read in Charles Dickens books torches buck knives

205
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Coffers darning wool

206
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,300
Orphans how many orphans does a bolt of calico?

207
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:43,040
Twine does he have houses twine houses lard. How about a lesson in love Yahoo answers user on asks. How do you French kiss?

208
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,760
Well first you need to find a partner then you would just kiss regularly

209
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,560
But you need to put your tongue in each other's mouth. There is so much more to it

210
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,960
You know what there is so much more to it than that fuck honor for

211
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,600
Asking how to French kiss then explaining how to French kiss. Is it a question or an answer on a no?

212
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,480
He's always great. One of the answers is don't suddenly put it in and wiggle it around

213
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:11,600
But that's a turnoff. You need to do it very gently and softly good advice in the link above

214
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,620
That's how I learn to do it. And then there's a link to a wiki page on how to French kiss

215
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:21,040
Fuck you internet. Fuck the internet. I had to learn that shit at 15 by myself scared like

216
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,480
How's it my problem with the internet for every site? That's like, how do you make you know baked potato?

217
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,720
It's like oh, it's really helpful. Then someone feels the need to create a page. It's like here's how you French kiss. Fuck you

218
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,480
I don't need it. What why is that a thing on the internet that I would ever look up? Why are you stopping such a sinner?

219
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,320
Everyone's got to figure that shit out by themselves at age 15 and it's like going into an arena against an angry lion

220
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,320
and it's the scariest moment in your life, you know, you're either gonna come out a champion or

221
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,800
You'll be fish mouth for the rest of your high school career

222
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,540
Okay, almost two months ago my fiancee and I broke up after dating for five and a half years

223
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,560
We are still living with each other were and but I will be moving out July 1st

224
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,260
Okay, within the last month I discovered that she has been hooking up with my best friend since childhood

225
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
That is gross

226
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,400
Obviously I'm angry about this since he was slated to be my best man

227
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,720
and he was when this whole time he was hers and

228
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,160
That was I just extemporaneous that it wasn't in the email

229
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,640
The first person I turned to for consolation after the breakup. Oh

230
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,400
Ouch, man, and even with my knowledge of this

231
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,560
He still continues to talk to her and I know that things are going to pick up more so after I move

232
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:47,560
I've tried to get past this but in my mind, it's very difficult. I value my friendship with both of these people. Why?

233
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,880
And I don't want to waste my life holding grudges

234
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,680
I know they didn't do this with any intended malice towards me

235
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,600
But it's very difficult to put behind me any advice on how to deal with it. Jeff

236
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:04,280
I gotta say man, you're already dealing with this pretty cool. I mean, but you did you seem to be dealing with this pretty maturely

237
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,680
You're gonna feel hurt it's gonna happen, but don't be in a rush to try to forgive him

238
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,000
Sometimes no matter how much you care about people you gotta say fuck you

239
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,800
That's some cold shit life. And and if I can play devil's advocate here Jeff

240
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:26,040
Intended or not. This is your ex-fiance of five and a half years and best friends since childhood. So the malice

241
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,840
Whether they should that's something they probably considered and said fuck it. He'll be mad

242
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,240
So there is a little bit of not so good feelings there

243
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,520
So it's it's perfectly normal that you're still still dealing with it and not completely over it. Fuck him Jeff

244
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,160
Fuck him Jeff get out of there. Yeah, screw them Jeff move out before July 1st, July 1st

245
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
Jeff you can get him come stay with us

246
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,320
This is a safe place. Come stay with Griffin come stay with

247
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,440
Perfect to do your armies. Hey guys. Hey

248
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:05,640
So this last year I had my own apartment and it was where my friends and I would hang out basically all the time

249
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,360
Because it was centrally located between all of us and be the lack of parents rents

250
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,640
If you prefer was nice as well, but because of grades and money, I'm moving back home with my parents in August

251
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:24,480
It's putting me closer to some of my friends, but putting me almost 20 to 30 minutes away from some others

252
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,400
I just worried our group of friends is going to fall apart without that central place to hang out

253
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,680
What can I and my friends as a group do to make sure this doesn't happen?

254
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,720
You gotta find a peach pit. Hey Ian, how about you focus on your grades?

255
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,160
Yeah, so you can move out of your parents house and get a job

256
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,040
And your peach pit find your peach pit. It sounds like he's a high schooler. That's how he's a high schooler with his own apartment

257
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,040
He's doogie Howser. Yeah

258
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Listen dumb shit, if you're not even gonna listen to the questions. I can't I can't what advice are you gonna give that's gonna be worthwhile or practical

259
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,120
Find a third-party hangout location a peach pit or a pub a genus

260
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,920
Genus pub and family family fun center

261
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
Get your get your ski ball on

Cafe, what was the one from friends? Friends Cafe Central Perk. It was Central Perk

263
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,120
I think the Friends Cafe was what was the one from Joey?

264
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,720
Believe that was also Central Perk. Pinchel Cirque

265

Hey, there's my friends Handler. Hey guys. Hey guys. I got a question. How you doing?

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
You remember Joey?

267
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,880
You guys remember when Joey would say like pretty frequently he would be like, how you doing?

268
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,440
You remember that?

269
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,240
You guys are trying not to laugh. I wish they could see you. You're oh, you're trying really hard, but you're smirking

Not too many six two maybe ask me why don't you pick one more off this and I'll do more last

275
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,840
Yeah, I love this. I love this. Shut it down

276
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,920
Um, but now people are thinking about that. They're worried, but we'll probably throw in a bonus one

277
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,400
I just recently have braces for my teeth. What?

278
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,080
I just recently have braces for my teeth and I'm 20 years old and to be taken off when I'm 22

279
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,920
Well, will women let find me less attractive for having braces? I i'm not gonna answer this question

280
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,440
I'm gonna say something fuck you. If you come to Mbembe, this show is not called hard truths

281
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Don't make us deliver hard truths to you

283

284
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,840

286
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
But listen, look

287
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,400
When you get out of it, once you make it past once you break on through to the other side

288
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,560
You're gonna have that

289
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,760
That fucked up girl. You've been sporting your whole life. It's gonna be straight and narrow. Let us consider the caterpillar

290
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,640
In the mouth in the poopa

291
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
Is that

292
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,040
Listen 20 20 to 21 those years aren't that great anyway

293
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:29,460
What yeah, those years are pretty miserable for me. And so i'm having my first alcoholic beverage. Oh, but clinty gives my braces

294
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,080
I'm having my first alcoholic beverage. Oh, but clinty gives my braces

295
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,420
You will have a unique life experience and not a lot of people will be able to associate with

296
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,860
You can open beer bottles on your teeth if you could get that trick down. It's a it just became a w

297
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,740
Um, but yeah, they will find you less

298
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,500
You you should be less worried about the lack of female attention

299
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,420
You'll encounter in the next two years and worry more about the lack of corn chips

300
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,340
You'll you'll be able to eat because corn chips are completely off the docket
