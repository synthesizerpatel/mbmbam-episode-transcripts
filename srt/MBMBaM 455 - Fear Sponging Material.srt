1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,080
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,160
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm Griffin McElroy, and it got me good this year.

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,480
Griffin, were you shot? Are you okay? You got hit by a dart?

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,160
The tip of that just got me, Odell. The tip of that just got me.

10
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,720
They got me good. The tax man got me so bad.

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,280
Oh, they cometh and they just nipped me right in the duff with these taxes this time.

12
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,080
I tell you, the bad experience I had is the tax man cameth, and I said,

13
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,960
hey, I never thought to ask. I was just writing him a check, and I was like,

14
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,160
I never thought to ask, who gets this? And he was like, the president?

15
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,360
And I was like, wait a minute. I don't even like that fella.

16
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,880
I don't even want to do this anymore. I don't want to do this.

17
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,120
Here's what I did.

18
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,560
Wait, how'd that play out?

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,960
He was like, well, what do you want to do with it?

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,800
I was like, could he build a dam?

21
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,880
Because I feel like, I know the wall is so hot right now, and everybody's wild for it,

22
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,560
but what about a dam instead? A real powerful dam like America used to build.

23
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,600
In my grandpa's days, a powerful dam.

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,000
A powerful grandpa dam. I did a thing this year for taxes.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,960
This is a little life hack that they don't tell you at accounting school,

26
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,760
but rather than give my money, just every time I made a purchase,

27
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,520
I chopped off like a quarter of it and just sent that to the government.

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,360
So they got like a quarter of my Capri Sun, and like a quarter of a new pair of tennis shoes,

29
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,320
and that way they're still getting a quarter of everything I own.

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,360
Okay.

31
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:47,360
So in the fiction of your little confection,

32
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,120
in the fiction of your confection, the IRS opens a super sloppy envelope,

33
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,680
and it's got a quarter of a big back on it, and a picture of your face smiling,

34
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
and I would presume your social security number?

35
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,520
Yeah, or they wouldn't know what to bucket to put it in.

36
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,560
And then there's a post-it note that says four podcasts on it,

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,760
so they know what the income source was.

38
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,080
And then they're like, four podcasts, we wish.

39
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,160
I'll tell you about the life hack I've got.

40
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,000
Little money hack, and this one's good for your wallet,

41
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,760
is you know how I bought that cigarette boat back in 2017,

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,920
and then they got me with that cigarette boat tax in 2018.

43
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,480
Ah. In 2018, I bought a second cigarette boat,

44
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,520
and the tax, it didn't double.

45
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,920
It's like a, now it's like a fraction of the first.

46
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,200
So if I just keep buying cigarette boats,

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
eventually- You'll have a carton of boats.

48
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,320
It'll be a profit generator.

49
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,240
My dad's gonna make me smoke all my boats.

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,280
It's gonna be a revenue stream,

51
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,160
because the taxes are gonna be nothing on these puppies.

52
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,520
And then you can open up like a water taxi business, or like-

53
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,880
Yeah. You know,

54
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,000
one of those things where it's like,

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
hey, do you wanna go out and look at the water

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,240
that's farther out away from the land?

57
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,920
Because that's different water.

58
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,760
Yeah. You can do that.

59
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,680
I've seen people do that at beaches and stuff,

60
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,160
where it's like, I could stand on the dirt and see the water,

61
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,440
or I could go out like 100 yards onto the water

62
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,800
and see better water.

63
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,720
And I could stage cigarette boat fights

64
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,240
in the, you know, in Lake Travis or whatever,

65
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,840
and get people all around for that.

66
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,680
There's a lake named after me?

67
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, sell tickets to the cigarette boat fight?

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,360
This is money, money, money, money.

69
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,200
But then they get, and then they freaking get it

70
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,640
to build another dam next year.

71
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,160
Dammit! There's no winning.

72
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,600
Griffin, you could sell those boats.

73
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,440
Oh, don't even sell the boats.

74
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,480
Quote unquote, loan them to a stunt spectacular.

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,200
And then when they explode, insurance money.

76
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,000
Not taxed.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,960
I lost my boat.

78
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,600
You guys, I was about to talk about how cigarette boat

79
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,080
is a pretty bad name for that,

80
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,240
because it sounds like something wild.

81
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,920
Like, that sounds like a wild thing.

82
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,440
That replaces the term rum runner,

83
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,640
is the former slang term for these,

84
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,320
because smugglers used to love them.

85
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,040
But get this.

86
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,640
The real name of this, according to Wikipedia,

87
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,280
Jeff Bezos' Wikipedia, according to Wikipedia,

88
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
it's called a go fast boat.

89
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,360
No.

90
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,920
Yeah, okay.

91
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,680
It's called a go fast boat.

92
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,160
Yeah, sure.

93
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,120
Go hyphen fast boat.

94
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,520
Okay.

95
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,040
Well, let me check the,

96
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,640
oh my God, the go fast boat tax rate is so much lower.

97
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,400
I've been getting really boinked on this one.

98
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,240
I really got to talk to my people.

99
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,000
Can I tell you, this is true.

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,200
When I was a kid and I first heard the term cigarette boat,

101
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,000
that was during a time where, if I'm not mistaken,

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,920
I think there were like camel bucks or something

103
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,640
that you got like little coupons and stuff.

104
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,240
I thought that a cigarette boat

105
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,160
was a boat that you earned from smoking a lot of cigarettes.

106
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,800
I once redeemed points from a similar system

107
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,280
to buy a Mountain Dew branded pager.

108
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,160
Hell yes.

109
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,480
This man's a dealer of some sort.

110
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,200
Yes, that's right.

111
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,480
What does he deal?

112
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
Extreme excellence in sports?

113
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:19,760
I don't know.

114
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,040
He's always ready for a LAN party, I think.

115
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,480
I think that's it.

116
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,680
Hey, let's do some questions.

117
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,440
He's an eSports agent.

118
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,960
He's gotta be on call.

119
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
A question is what Griffin requested

120
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,880
and I live to serve my brother here.

121
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,120
We're recording this on sibling day,

122
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,960
so I have to do as Griffin bids.

123
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,240
Every day for me is sibling day.

124
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,680
You guys are my world.

125
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,400
Did you just sigh, did you just sigh at what I said?

126
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,840
It was a contented sigh.

127
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,080
It was like, oh, how sweet.

128
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,640
I work at a contemporary art museum

129
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,600
and people keep asking me, what kind of art do you have?

130
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,960
What does that mean?

131
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,680
What should I respond with besides paintings and sculptures?

132
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,120
What kind of art are there?

133
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,280
Is this art from in Austin, Texas?

134
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,520
Oh boy, I mean, you've come to the right place.

135
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,640
Yes, obviously.

136
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,200
Art critics.

137
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,800
I like to think of myself as something

138
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,480
of a amateur volunteer docent.

139
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,080
You haven't gone pro yet?

140
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,640
Well, I'm sort of a docent to the world.

141
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:16,880
Yeah.

142
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,160
Not working at any, not sort of tied to any one

143
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,960
establishment, just sort of wondering the streets

144
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,400
and telling people about good art that I saw once.

145
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,240
When they ask what kind of art do you have,

146
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,920
they're talking about one of the main buckets of art

147
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,280
and that's shapes paintings is one,

148
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,000
folks paintings, which is ones of folks,

149
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,040
statues and hanging statues, those are so fun.

150
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,560
You get one of those hanging statues

151
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,240
with all the shapes and dongle bits on it.

152
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,040
That's really cool.

153
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,040
Especially the hanging statues with the light.

154
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,640
And it's like, well, that's a dirty word

155
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,760
when you look at it that way.

156
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,400
Oh, but it's like, oh dear, when you look at it this way,

157
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,520
I love those.

158
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,160
And then there's just, there's a bucket called stuff.

159
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,520
And this is one where that's like,

160
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,880
if it's an old vase that somebody painted,

161
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,560
usually a horse on or a beheading,

162
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,280
then that's just kind of, that's just stuff.

163
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,040
That's just the flotsam and jetsam of the thing.

164
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,760
Can I tell you my least favorite bucket of art

165
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,600
is the bucket of might be a chair,

166
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,880
but isn't don't sit on it.

167
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,080
Oh gosh.

168
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,920
Those get me every time.

169
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,840
That might be what they're calling when they're like,

170
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,800
what kind of art do you have?

171
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,880
Just say like, none of it looks like chairs.

172
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,680
Don't worry.

173
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,180
Don't worry.

174
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,680
One thing that is an easy out for you

175
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,040
is because you work at a contemporary art museum

176
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,880
and people kind of ask what kind of art you have,

177
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,960
you can just look at it and be like, the new shit.

178
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,720
We got the new releases.

179
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,480
The new hot shit.

180
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,160
Yeah.

181
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,080
None of that old garbage.

182
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,320
Just the hottest new sound.

183
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,880
We used to have a water lilies from Monet,

184
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,760
but we threw that in the fucking garbage can.

185
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,680
And here's one I made with puke.

186
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
This is Trent's puke shirt.

187
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,640
He made it two weeks ago.

188
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,320
It's the new shit.

189
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,000
It'll be out of here in nine days.

190
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,600
So enjoy it while it lasts.

191
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,600
I'm gonna throw it right on top of Claude Monet's busted old ass.

192
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
Here's a dream catcher we made

193
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,280
from the shredded up water lilies.

194
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,080
It's hot shit.

195
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,640
And the poor thing is, it's new.

196
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,240
Oh, boy.

197
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,280
That's all the things we know to say about art,

198
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,080
ladies and gentlemen.

199
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,320
I was trying to think who was the nasty mess one.

200
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,280
The one who made the-

201
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,680
Jackson Pollock made the nasty messes.

202
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes.

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,880
Kevin Pollock.

204
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,640
Now we're fully exhausted.

205
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,440
And all of the things we know to say about art.

206
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,880
A similar thing used to happen to me

207
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,000
when I worked at Best Buy,

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,520
and people would call and say,

209
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,200
what kind of TVs do you have?

210
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,760
Like, tell me about your TVs.

211
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,000
And I don't know if y'all know this.

212
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,760
It's a lot of TVs.

213
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,880
It's like you're being pranked.

214
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,640
And I think, here's all you have to say.

215
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,560
If someone says, what kind of art do you have?

216
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,720
Say, art I think you'll like.

217
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,920
And then say, wink.

218
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,720
Because they're calling and they won't see it.

219
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,120
This is such a wild, unanswerable question

220
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,600
that I think you have to judo it back onto them.

221
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,520
And say, what kind of art are you looking for?

222
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,760
Because the answer is that-

223
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,720
What would I have to do

224
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,120
to get you into some of this art today?

225
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
I go to art museums.

226
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,600
I visit Houston and they have so many art museums.

227
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,440
Every time we go, we'll hit up a couple art museums.

228
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,080
They're wonderful.

229
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,640
If you were to ask me three feet from the front fucking door,

230
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,560
hey, Griffin, what are you excited to see in there?

231
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:32,960
I'd be like,

232
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,480
and I would run away

233
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,240
because I'd feel challenged in that moment.

234
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
Because I don't know what kind of art I want.

235
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,360
I just want to see it.

236
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,720
And then sometimes you'll see a painting

237
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,920
that you saw on a TV show once and that's cool.

238
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,120
Yeah, that's pretty great.

239
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,680
I think no matter what you tell these people,

240
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,120
they're not fucking coming.

241
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,880
If they're asking this question,

242
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,960
no one gets to the door of an art museum,

243
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,440
peeks in and is like, what the fuck is all this?

244
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,320
What is going on in here?

245
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,520
No one drives there to look in the door

246
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,600
to see what kind of good art you have.

247
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,920
I mean, just regular art.

248
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,280
It doesn't do anything.

249
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,200
I like art that does something.

250
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,840
You know how-

251
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,280
Like Cosi.

252
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,800
You know the fuck, yes.

253
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,920
A big pendulum that knocks shit over

254
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,160
and I just learned about rotation of the earth.

255
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,720
I love it.

256
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,200
You know that everlasting gobsopper machine.

257
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,400
It burps and farts with all kinds of beautiful colors all over

258
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,240
and at the end you got yourself a sweet treat.

259
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,760
There's a whole fucking room in there

260
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,480
where you can lick the art and it tastes like shit.

261
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,960
No one has ever let me lick art.

262
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,560
I went to this art museum once

263
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,040
where they let you put on these futuristic looking vests

264
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,960
and they gave you a little fake gun

265
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,520
and you could run around and shoot each other's vests

266
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,480
and you would get points if you did a good enough job

267
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,320
and then afterward you could go out to the concession stand

268
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,680
and you could have a pizza.

269
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,320
That's the best museum I've ever been to in my life.

270
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,440
Billy Bob's Wonderland.

271
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,360
It was a Q-Zar, I think.

272
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,720
It was a Q-Zar Museum of Art.

273
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,840
Yes, the Q-Zar modern museum of moving laser tag.

274
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,520
Designed by Guggenheim or whatever.

275
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,760
It's the Guggenheim Q-Zar Museum.

276
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,000
I only like poetry that has clues to a treasure.

277
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,320
That's art.

278
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,600
I only like paintings painted on top of another painting

279
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,440
that you can only see with an x-ray

280
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,800
and it leads you to something.

281
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,880
Songs that are meant to put a dragon to sleep.

282
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,760
That is a song.

283
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,480
It does something.

284
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,320
I want to call a museum now and be like,

285
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,040
hey, I'm really excited to come to a museum.

286
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,760
Very stoked.

287
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,960
I hear you got a Matisse, I think is one of them.

288
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,120
Anyway, do you have any of those paintings

289
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,560
where the eyes follow you no matter where you are?

290
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,680
Because fuck that.

291
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,160
I'm very scared of whoever's in there.

292
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,320
Do you have any paintings that I might be afraid

293
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,280
to be trapped in by a witch that I've crossed?

294
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,320
Because if so, no, thank you.

295
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,600
Do you have any paintings

296
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,400
where you have to kind of cross your eyes

297
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,480
to see them in their 3D?

298
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,960
Because I love, I'm wild for that shit

299
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,920
and no one's got it.

300
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,640
My ma used to have them at a concession stand.

301
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,480
That was all these goddamn fidget spinners.

302
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,120
Here's a Yahoo sent in by Michelle Smith.

303
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,360
Thank you.

304
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,280
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user name.

305
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,640
Oh my God.

306
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,680
I would usually look around the page for inspiration

307
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,520
for what to call these anonymous users.

308
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,440
And right now I'm looking at a Yahoo Finance

309
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
just like video that's in the sidebar.

310
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,760
And here's the headline.

311
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,480
I want a Munch, Munch Squad Junior.

312
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,760
Running on Dunkin?

313
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,480
Coffee Giant debuts signature sneaker.

314
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,720
So these are shoes that say Dunkin Donuts on them.

315
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,400
This is very strange.

316
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,480
This would be like if you were reading a Munch Squad

317
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,120
and there was just a Yahoo embedded in the middle of it.

318
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,920
I'm freaking out.

319
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,760
Okay, anyway, this anonymous user

320
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,280
who doesn't deserve a name asks,

321
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,840
all I want in life is to be able to cruise

322
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840
on my motorcycle with my dog.

323
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,360
How can I do that?

324
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,320
I know sidecars are an option, but besides that,

325
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,960
my dog is 80 pounds of Doberman slash Pitbull.

326
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,800
Update, demo.

327
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,200
Can you link me some carriers that would be good for that?

328
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,680
And I guess there's a, well, wait, there is no demo.

329
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,800
I'm looking at all three answers.

330
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,280
And one's from Marion, one's from Bill,

331
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,920
and one's from babyboomer1001,

332
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,440
which is a very sort of redundant name to have on Yahoo.

333
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,400
Of course you are.

334
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,920
I love the, you sometimes drop these Yahoo's, Griffin,

335
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,160
where it's like, here is my question,

336
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,360
and I know what the answer is, but I don't want that answer.

337
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,160
It sounds to me like the question asker

338
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,880
would like the dog to be driving the motorcycle

339
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,240
with this asker riding in the back of it.

340
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,760
See, even then, I still would prefer

341
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,760
if my dog was, if my 80 pound of Doberman slash Pitbull

342
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,520
was gonna be up there driving,

343
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,200
I would wanna be in the sidecar.

344
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,760
It's not an option, Travis.

345
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,080
We got a very narrow tunnel that we're planning on going to.

346
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,520
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right.

347
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,160
So that's just out of the question.

348
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
I need to get my dog on this bike.

349
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,400
He is-

350
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,200
See, then it seems more about the grips.

351
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,240
You would have special,

352
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,800
something they could slip their paws into.

353
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,360
Yeah, that's a big old dog, 80 pounds, it feels like.

354
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,760
So a baby Bjorn, a traditional baby Bjorn,

355
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,280
is not gonna go ahead and get you there.

356
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,800
Now, let me tell you about,

357
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,120
I want a baby Bjorn I could put Travis in.

358
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,520
Yes, please, I was thinking about this the other day.

359
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,920
My daughter's about 30 pounds and about three feet tall,

360
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,480
and I'm six feet tall, and about 200 pounds will round up.

361
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,960
So I did the math, and I think that means

362
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,000
that I need a 12 foot tall, 1600 pound person

363
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,120
to carry me around.

364
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,440
I think if I'm doing that math correctly,

365
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,320
I just want a giant to carry me around.

366
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,680
Oh, it feels so good, but that's not the question.

367
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,920
Oh, it feels so nice.

368
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,160
What if, I'll just keep putting these heaters up.

369
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,880
Yeah, please.

370
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,760
What if the bike is the dog?

371
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,240
Okay, elaborate.

372
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,680
You ever heard of this hybrid technology

373
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,280
that's going on these days?

374
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,720
Now, Griffin, do you mean the hybrid cars

375
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,280
that run on both gasoline and electric?

376
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,240
No, man, no, man.

377
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,560
I'm talking about bio cyber melting.

378
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,840
You know about this shit?

379
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,720
Do you know about this shit?

380
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,760
Justin, you heard about this shit?

381
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,920
Go on, Griffin, tell me about it.

382
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,240
Are you talking about like a robot dog bike?

383
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,600
Yeah, and I think they're real good,

384
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,520
and everybody has robot dog bikes.

385
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,800
Oh no, oh no, one's crushing my front door.

386
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,160
It's running over me over and over.

387
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,240
I died, but I got killed by the thing

388
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,520
I liked about the future.

389
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,120
So that's my new black mirror.

390
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,600
I found the thing I really liked about the future,

391
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,840
but they ended up driving over me and biting me.

392
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,080
It's like, oh, it's running over me

393
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,840
and biting me every time it goes.

394
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,440
But those are the two worst parts

395
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,280
of both a motorcycle and a dog.

396
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,720
I should explain, if you haven't seen the series,

397
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,880
Black Mirror, every episode ends with someone

398
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,520
getting run over by a cyborg dog bike.

399
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,080
So that is kind of the gag of that bit.

400
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,320
Sometimes it's more, kind of, it makes more sense than others.

401
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,880
Yeah, sometimes it's a metaphorical cyborg dog bike,

402
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,960
like a particularly weighty insult hurled at that person.

403
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,920
And then they say, oh, that was my dog bike,

404
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,640
and then they die.

405
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,720
Yeah, the one where the two women forged

406
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,240
a powerful relationship in the cyber environment,

407
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,000
I thought was amazing and so touching and heartwarming

408
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,800
until they got their own two big dog bikes.

409
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,600
And that was a weird, I was feeling uplifted,

410
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,120
and then that's how Black Mirror gets you,

411
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,320
because the future, it's deeks.

412
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,080
But it's always the twist.

413
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,800
Yeah, so, all right.

414
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,960
What about a big shirt?

415
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,080
Big shirt doesn't have big dogs.

416
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,120
No, like you wear a shirt,

417
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,560
but also the dog fits in a shirt.

418
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,280
Maybe big pants too that the dog also fits in.

419
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,680
A training shirt, he won't need that all the time.

420
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,960
This is what big dog shirts are made for.

421
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,160
This is what big dogs is.

422
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
Yeah, shirts you can wear with your dog.

423
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,880
That's what big dog shirts is for this entire time.

424
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,400
Then what are big Johnson shirts?

425
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,880
That's when you can stuff your hog up in.

426
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,040
No problem.

427
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,440
No fear is the one where you hide your fear in the shirt.

428
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,600
Fear, shh, stay quiet in there.

429
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,360
Can't let anyone know.

430
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,200
I'll take the fear.

431
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,640
I'm your shirt, I'll take the fear.

432
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,600
It's made of this fear sponge material.

433
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,800
It's so soft, it wicks the fear away.

434
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,440
It wicks it right away.

435
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,800
Jerome, let me wick your fear.

436
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,400
Jerome, I'll wick your fear.

437
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,240
I'm getting wet as fuck in this shirt,

438
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,880
but I am not afraid, thank you.

439
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,000
You wanna read a question?

440
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,680
I recently decided to patronize...

441
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,400
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

442
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,760
You fucking nerd.

443
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,040
I recently decided to patronize my local concert hall on a whim,

444
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,360
arriving only a few months before the concert started.

445
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:27,840
No.

446
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,240
Minutes, what is wrong with you?

447
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,120
What'd I say?

448
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,600
Months.

449
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,120
Hey, you guys throw a concert here in June?

450
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,880
Yeah, but it's only a few months.

451
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,600
Better hurry.

452
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,120
Who's playing?

453
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,840
Well, two months from now, we got a simple plan.

454
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,520
Ah, fuck.

455
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,000
Okay, I guess I'll stay for that.

456
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,560
I decided to patronize my local concert hall on a whim,

457
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,520
arriving only a few minutes before the concert started.

458
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,480
As I was approaching the box office to purchase a ticket,

459
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,440
a woman intercepted me and all but insisted

460
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,160
I use the spare ticket she had as one of her family members

461
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,840
when I was not able to make it.

462
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,920
Before I could consider the consequences of doing so,

463
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,120
I graciously accepted,

464
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,640
and she sat me among her family members

465
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,360
in the second row of the stage for very intimate to our concert.

466
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,880
Because of the proximity of the stage,

467
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
I'm worried these were rather expensive tickets.

468
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,920
Should I try to compensate her somehow?

469
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,320
She also invited me to her church.

470
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,760
Do I have to start going there?

471
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,240
Do I need to buy her a ticket to something now?

472
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,560
That's from a ticket tag along in Texas.

473
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,240
I don't even think,

474
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,640
how could you not tell us what the concert was?

475
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,960
I thought that was gonna be the whole thing.

476
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,480
I'm so disappointed.

477
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,440
Yeah.

478
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,800
James Taylor.

479
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,400
The church thing, probably not.

480
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,320
I think you're okay, I think you're okay.

481
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,920
That's a big decision for a person to make,

482
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,720
and I do not think you can be bought into it

483
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,760
by second row tickets for a James Taylor concert.

484
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,080
After all that James Taylor concert,

485
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,360
you got plenty of church in you

486
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,040
just from that right there, I promise.

487
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,120
Do you need to buy tickets?

488
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,200
Do you need to buy her a ticket?

489
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,840
Here's the thing.

490
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,400
At the moment that ticket entered your possession,

491
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,760
one second before that exchange happened,

492
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,400
that ticket's value was zero

493
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,880
because it was not going to be used, right?

494
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,360
Like if I have a gumball

495
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,120
and I was gonna throw it on the ground

496
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,480
as hard as I possibly can as a joke,

497
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
and then I saw Travis and I was like,

498
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,440
you want this gumball?

499
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,320
It's no longer the 25 cents I spent for the gumball.

500
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,640
It's valueless because I decided it had no value

501
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,000
because I was gonna throw it on the ground.

502
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,280
Does that make sense?

503
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,960
Yes, but I also think, Griffin,

504
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,640
this person welcomed you into their family,

505
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,920
probably shared some James Taylor branded popcorn with you,

506
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,880
fire and rain and butter and salt, and that was-

507
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,560
That's probably, we could probably do better.

508
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,720
I know, but there's no time.

509
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,320
And so they shared that experience with you,

510
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,200
and now even I think what you're feeling,

511
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,040
question asker, is a bond,

512
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,800
and you want to break that with money,

513
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,240
and I get that.

514
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,400
You feel like you owe them something.

515
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,080
Maybe just hand her a 20 and walk away.

516
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,280
I feel like you went to a concert,

517
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,520
going to a concert without knowing

518
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
what concert you're going to see

519
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,400
is the single wildest act I have ever heard

520
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,920
of any human doing.

521
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,800
That would be akin to mailing $100 to Amazon

522
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,880
and saying, eh, whatever, surprise me,

523
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,520
and make me, I'll video myself opening it,

524
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
and you can watch my reaction.

525
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,560
It's insane.

526
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,880
You deserve the worst that life has to offer you, but-

527
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,240
It's like going to a museum

528
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,520
without knowing if they have laser tag.

529
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,320
Like, come on.

530
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,800
Exactly.

531
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,240
I will say this.

532
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,280
You went there to open yourself up

533
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,200
to the adventure of life,

534
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,520
one of the many wonderful adventures

535
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,960
this world has in store for us,

536
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,280
and it seems like the door has been open

537
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,160
to a story where maybe you find a family

538
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,400
that has always wanted a child like yourself,

539
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,040
and you find renewal in the blood of Jesus Christ

540
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,200
or something, and it's like your story

541
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,880
that you started with this random thing,

542
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,640
and now you're just gonna close the door on it.

543
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,520
I think you need to repay these people

544
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,120
by becoming a part of their family,

545
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,200
like a surrogate member of their family.

546
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,000
Be there at Thanksgiving, at Easter, whatever.

547
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,160
Whatever they like it or not.

548
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,080
Yeah, you're gonna repay them somehow

549
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,520
until one of them, you know,

550
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,800
they'll become a moment when they need

551
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,600
a ticket for something,

552
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
and then you can get the hell out of Dodge.

553
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,920
Yeah, and then you're free.

554
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,560
Ah, shoot.

555
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,440
I really would love to go see Kings of Leon.

556
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,400
Oh, cool.

557
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,840
I got you a ticket for that.

558
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,200
Bye, fuckos!

559
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Dude, we spent three Christmases together.

560
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,760
Are you sure?

561
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,160
Yes!

562
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,400
Genie, I'm free!

563
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,360
Whoosh!

564
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,280
Hey, Brittany!

565
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,880
We all hate Dylan!

566
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,520
What's up?

567
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:55,760
Bye!

568
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,080
I'm out!

569
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,480
We hated him the whole time!

570
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Hey, Kevin, your haircut sucks!

571
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,280
I didn't like that sweater you knitted me for Christmas.

572
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,480
Y'all want a quick Yahoo?

573
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:06,960
Yeah.

574
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,080
Yeah, I think so, Griff.

575
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,320
Okay.

576
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:08,720
I think so.

577
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,400
Here's one from Drew Davenport, level 9000.

578
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew, Drew.

579
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,000
It's from Yajuransersuser.

580
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,880
They're anonymous too.

581
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,600
I'm gonna call them.

582
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,120
Bartholomew asks, did cavemen go to school?

583
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,840
Did cavemen go to school?

584
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,440
Not in the traditional sense, I think.

585
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Probably not in the school school as we know school.

586
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,080
I think school probably didn't get invented until more recently, I'm thinking.

587
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,440
But did cavemen have a school-like system where they could share?

588
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,320
Like a cave school?

589
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,160
I think they-

590
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,000
Where they sat at like rock desks?

591
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,080
You would assume some sort of hunting apprenticeship, right?

592
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,240
But that would be, I feel like cumbersome,

593
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,760
because you have one dude who's like great at hunting,

594
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,600
and all the kids would want to train with him.

595
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:55,840
Yeah.

596
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,280
So he would need to maybe educate them en masse,

597
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,280
which I feel like is all we're talking about, right?

598
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,720
Like here's how you beat a velociraptor.

599
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,160
Yeah, and they use pens made out of dinosaur bones.

600
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,000
Yeah, they would use pens out of dinosaur bones with dinosaur blood ink.

601
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Maybe like books that are just big leaves all stuck together.

602
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,480
Yeah, their books would be big leaves, and they wouldn't have iPads.

603
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,880
They would have rocks.

604
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,600
Rocks.

605
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,560
That can be funny.

606
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,000
Big, flat rocks.

607
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,920
They'd be like, oh, this is my tablet, but it's just like a stone tablet.

608
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,320
I'm writing this down for the cavemen, the Geico Cavemen comic series.

609
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep that in mind.

610
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,920
Oh, wait, stop, stop, shut up.

611
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,000
School clubs.

612
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:41,840
Okay.

613
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,120
Okay, I'm fine.

614
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,560
Because they're cavemen.

615
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,520
Yeah, I don't think I deserve that.

616
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,720
They can be a drama club, but it's an actual club.

617
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,840
Okay.

618
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,720
And it says drama on it.

619
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,520
Okay.

620
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,280
Glee club, but it's a club that says glee on it.

621
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,960
All right, I don't know why you said shut up, though.

622
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,080
Yeah, I had this perfect joke, Griffin, and I was afraid it wouldn't.

623
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,640
It says swim team, but they do it in a tar pit.

624
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,040
Yes, yes, yes.

625
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,120
Oh, and at lunch, they just get a big side of brontosaurus ribs.

626
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,880
Okay, so, okay, listen.

627
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,720
It tips their car over.

628
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,040
When the cavemen invented the wheel, did everyone else just immediately agree like,

629
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,080
yeah, that's better?

630
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,040
Or did they have to take some time and be like, is this better?

631
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,440
Is it good?

632
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:28,960
Fire.

633
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,880
I mean, it's warm, it's bright.

634
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,920
There is just nothing funny about cavemen.

635
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,320
And it makes me wonder why they decided to do a whole situation comedy about it.

636
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,080
You heard me say drama club, but it's a club, right?

637
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,600
That was more amusing.

638
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,040
That was more Reader's Digest, like a real toilet thinker.

639
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,800
It wasn't a real gut buster that I expect from a mad magazine.

640
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,160
So, yeah, I'm sorry for this one, guys.

641
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,360
I would like to take a moment.

642
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,840
I've been led onto the internet, and I know that we need to do the Money Zone and everything,

643
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,800
but I'd like to take a moment to talk about the TV series, Cavemen,

644
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,800
and the things that I've learned about it on the Wikipedia page.

645
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,520
And I know what you're thinking.

646
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:26,000
A sitcom that is about the Geico Cavemen that briefly aired in 2007.

647
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,160
It doesn't seem all that funny, but listen to this description from the synopsis.

648
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,080
Cavemen have prominent brow ridges and more body hair than homo sapiens,

649
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,640
but beyond superficial differences in appearance,

650
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,960
they actually are not that much different from modern humans

651
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,720
in terms of behavior or physical abilities.

652
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,920
Male cavemen are very hairy, have thick long beards, and wear their hair shoulder length.

653
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,720
A cavewoman that appeared on the show also had a prominent brow ridge

654
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,440
and comparatively more body hair than a modern human female.

655
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,240
Some cavemen attempted to pass as homo sapiens.

656
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,000
This is for about the series.

657
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,160
Some cavemen attempted to pass as homo sapiens by shaving their body hair.

658
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,840
Other cavemen called them shavers.

659
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,520
The central humor of the show is that cavemen characters are not brutish primates,

660
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,480
but fully integrated into white collar jobs.

661
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,760
The central cavemen characters are modern city dwellers.

662
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:27,200
They must endure racial epithets such as mager, a pun based on Cro-Magnon.

663
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,400
Oh my God.

664
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,640
Fuck this is funny.

665
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,720
Damn, I'm laughing already.

666
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,360
And that's before I get to the last line of the synopsis.

667
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,920
According to producer Joe Lawson, the show was originally going to be set in Newport News

668
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,840
due to its proximity to the water.

669
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,600
Then the setting changed to Atlanta, Georgia, and finally San Diego, California.

670
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,920
The 13 episodes of this series were made.

671
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:58,000
The final six did not air on traditional television.

672
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And if you can do a little math, that means that cavemen got seven episodes,

673
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:15,120
which is again, one more episode, one more episode than our TV show.

674
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,480
But good news is all the episodes aired in Australia.

675
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,200
I always said they should have done a show about the talking stack of dollar bills.

676
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,120
Cause that's fun.

677
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,640
Cause that one's funny.

678
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,960
And they could have called it the money zone.

679
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,520
Yeah, the gecko's pretty good too.

680
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,320
Oh, that was a transition.

681
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,720
Fuck, sorry.

682
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
Transition, fuck.

683
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,320
Well, I'm going to talk about Squarespace now.

684
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,960
You've got a great idea somewhere inside you.

685
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,720
I believe that all people are formed by their life experience to put something,

686
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,360
anything into the world that only they can create.

687
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,080
Are you talking about me?

688
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,240
Right now, right now.

689
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,160
Yes, Travis, even you right now, that flame lies buried within you

690
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,000
and there is a way to unlock it.

691
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,760
Friends, I am Justin McElroy and I'm ready to unlock the power within you

692
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,680
by harnessing the creative energy of Squarespace.

693
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,720
Are you still talking about me?

694
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,960
Still about you, Travis.

695
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,840
This is direct conduit from your heart and your mind into the computer.

696
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,280
It will turn your dreams and your imaginations into emotions

697
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,240
that can be seen on any computer screen, but not just phones.

698
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,280
What?

699
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,320
Like in Lawn Mower Man?

700
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,560
Just like in Lawn Mower Man.

701
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,200
And these aren't just on screens, phones too.

702
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,520
They're designed for mobile from the ground up.

703
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,960
They're going to help you design a website to showcase your work,

704
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,040
promote your business.

705
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,840
And now it's an upcoming event or special project like a reboot of Caveman.

706
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,480
There's got beautiful customizable templates created by world-class designers.

707
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,400
I don't know why they need to be customizable though

708
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,160
if they're created by world-class designers.

709
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,680
But you shouldn't fuck with them.

710
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,360
Maybe they put a lot of work into them.

711
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,720
You should just use them like they are.

712
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,760
And there's e-commerce functionality too.

713
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,160
So make your dream stand out.

714
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,280
Make it stand out.

715
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,360
Stand out with a beautiful website from Squarespace.

721
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,040
That's really nice.

722
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,880
Is that a poem?

723
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,000
Is that a poem?

724
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,440
Yes, because it's meant to sell something.

725
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,080
There's a purpose.

726
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,120
Ah, perfect.

727
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,880
Justin, speaking of domains, could I have lilyisaveverygoodgirl.com back now?

728
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,600
Or where are we at on that?

729
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,480
I'll tell you what, Trav.

730
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,680
If you get into Supernatural Season 15, I'll give you the URL back.

731
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,480
Okay, there we go.

732
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,840
I want to tell you about Stitch Fix.

733
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:06,720
I have had a 100% hit rate with Stitch Fix for the last couple months.

734
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,160
Stitch Fix, you go in, you tell them what your style is.

735
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,080
They even show you some different options and say, do you like this?

736
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,280
What about this?

737
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,560
Is this something you would wear?

738
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,720
You also could tell them what you'd be willing to pay for a pair of shoes or a shirt,

739
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,640
where you would wear the clothes.

740
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,360
And then they send you a box of, I would say, super high quality,

741
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,040
amazingly tailored to your style clothing and not just like shirts and pants.

742
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,600
I've also gotten, you know, shoes.

743
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,960
I've gotten hats.

744
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,200
I've gotten really cool stuff from them.

745
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,800
Jackets.

746
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,520
Oh, I got this jacket in my last one that has just instantly become a favorite

747
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,760
because you work with a personal stylist who gets to know you and what you want.

751
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,200
Hi, it's Ali Kokash, one of the cast members of Mission to Zix,

752
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,360
a new addition to the Max Fun Network.

753
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,240
We're blown away by the welcome we've received from Max Fun listeners,

754
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,280
telling us you've discovered the show and are binging it hard,

755
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,960
supporting us during the drive and just being rad humans all around.

756
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,040
Mission to Zix is an improvised, obsessively sound designed sci-fi comedy epic

757
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,480
following a group of ambassadors as they explore the ass end of space.

758
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,080
I play Dar, the 12 foot tall,

759
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,920
omnisexual security officer with furry scales, chest talons,

760
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,920
and a series of flaps and chutes that are for...

761
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,360
Yeah, you know what?

762
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,080
You'll figure it out.

763
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,320
We'd be delighted if you joined our crew aboard the aging sentient starship,

764
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,880
the Bargerian Jade, as we travel the Zix Quadrant,

765
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,400
meeting all sorts of weird aliens played by brilliant guest comedians.

766
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,200
That's Mission to Zix, Z-Y-X-X.

767
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,080
Question.

768
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,760
Another question.

769
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
Here we go, another question.

770
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,160
Coming at you.

771
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,120
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

772
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,240
Oh my God, Justin.

773
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,560
I'm interrupting myself this time because I thought that was more polite.

774
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:06,800
Yeah.

775
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,680
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

776
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,880
I want a munch.

777
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,360
Quad.

778
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,440
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

779
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,120
I've got some drainage and I want too much.

780
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,960
Squad.

781
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,080
And it's messing up my voice.

782
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,240
Quick update.

783
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,360
Don't do the Duncan Shoes, I did the Duncan Shoes.

784
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,200
Quick update before we get in.

785
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,440
Welcome to the family.

786
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,080
Fresh and Co. launching a cannabis-focused menu.

787
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,620
It's a special 420 hemp and CBD-infused menu

788
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,680
that launches exclusively on Fresh and Co. app

789
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,520
on April 9th, you fucked up.

790
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,760
We'll be in restaurants from April 12th through April 30th.

791
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,400
Fresh and Co. executive Craig Rispoli

792
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,760
curated the menu in collaboration

793
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,520
with Jeepney's chef Miguel Trinidad.

794
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,840
And just so you're plugged into where the scene is at,

795
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,680
they got the half-baked shrimp salad,

796
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,960
which is hemp cakes, hemp mixed greens,

797
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,000
sea beans, red onion, whatever.

798
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
There's CBD-infused ginger cashew aioli on that.

799
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,240
Good.

800
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,340
There's a blazed beet sandwich.

801
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:16,680
Again, this is CBD, folks, and hemp,

802
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,040
which they can make ropes out of.

803
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,760
These sandwiches will not get you high.

804
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,600
They're not gonna get you high.

805
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,520
I wish to God these companies would stop making sandwiches

806
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,120
pretending they're gonna get you high.

807
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,500
I see.

808
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,220
I wanna talk very quickly about Topper's Pizza,

809
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,640
which just added pretzel bites to its value menu.

810
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,480
I've never been to a Topper's Pizza,

811
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,040
and I don't know anyone who has,

812
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,960
but I feel like I've learned a lot about Topper's Pizza,

813
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,680
namely that the person they talk to,

814
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,840
namely the president,

815
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,560
doesn't give a shit about these pretzels.

816
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,520
This is a good obby.

817
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,160
Topper's Pizza's continued its commitment

818
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,320
to great pizza and quality offerings,

819
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,340
all at an affordable price,

820
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,840
thanks to the launch of its newest value item, pretzel bites.

821
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,340
Built on the belief that better doesn't have to cost more,

822
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,560
in the words of founder and president of Topper's Pizza,

823
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,960
Scott Gittrich.

824
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,800
The brand rolled out a pick any two or more from-

825
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,840
Scott Gittrich?

826
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,280
Scott Gittrich.

827
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,800
That's not, that's a fake person's name.

828
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,000
His name's Scott Gittrich.

829
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,300
President Scott is the CEO.

830
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,680
The 5.99 value menu lets customers choose

831
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,080
any two of the following, baked mac and cheese,

832
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,240
gooey monkey bread, half pound orders of boneless wings,

833
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,800
and single orders of topper sticks,

834
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,360
plus any medium, two topping pizza.

835
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,640
Folks, if you wanna put weed into food,

836
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,200
that's your route right there.

837
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,520
That's where you're gonna put weed in.

838
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,720
I know what it is, and I do enjoy it,

839
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,240
but hearing the phrase gooey monkey bread is like-

840
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,500
Yeah, it's rough.

841
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,440
It's upsetting, it's viscerally upsetting.

842
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,720
So these Topper's pretzel bites are snack-ready morsels

843
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,260
fried to perfection and dusted with sea salt,

844
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,520
in case you're curious.

845
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,300
This is one of the weirder lines.

846
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,440
Customers can pick from any dipping sauce

847
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,560
with nacho cheese, the brand's favorite.

848
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,000
Oh.

849
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,160
That's exactly what it says.

850
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,080
With nacho cheese, the brand's favorite.

851
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,040
5.99 value item includes 12 pretzel bites.

852
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,020
And so they come to Scott Get Rich,

853
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:21,120
and they say, Scott, Scott, give me a quote, Scott.

854
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,080
We need a quote.

855
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,360
This press release is going out hot.

856
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,700
Give me a quote for the pretzel bites press release.

857
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,160
For almost 30 years, we've been relentlessly committed

858
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,480
to doing pizza better, says Scott Get Rich.

859
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,920
That means our fans shouldn't compromise on quality

860
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,180
in pursuit of affordability.

861
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,680
Our ever-expanding value menu reflects that.

862
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,480
Scott. Scott.

863
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,320
How do you begin with, we are relentlessly committed

864
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,240
to doing pizza better, and your next sentence is,

865
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,260
and folks, we've strayed from the path.

866
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:57,260
With these abominations that have nothing to do with pizza.

867
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,400
Bread should not be bathed in an alkaline bath.

868
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,960
It goes against my beliefs.

869
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,800
So Scott Iverson, the VP of marketing for Topper's Pizza,

870
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,660
busts in the room, and he's like, wait, Scott,

871
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,600
hey, it's me, nice Scott, and that quote was terrible.

872
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,860
Here, I'm gonna get people horny for pretzels.

873
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,080
Not again. You were good, Scott.

874
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,740
You've twisted my bread dreams.

875
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,360
We work tirelessly to make sure our pizza lovers

876
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,540
enjoy a variety of complimentary options

877
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,200
that we develop after closely attending to the data.

878
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,720
What?

879
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,560
What data?

880
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,680
We work tirelessly to make sure our pizza lovers

881
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,960
enjoy a variety of complimentary options

882
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,080
that we develop after closely attending to the data.

883
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,720
What the living fuck, Scott?

884
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,360
What are you talking about?

885
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,200
Man, I'm hungry for pretzel bites.

886
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,320
Do you know a good place?

887
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,380
Well, we make good pizza and look at data.

888
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,960
Do you want some of these?

889
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
Every time you order a Topper's Pizza,

890
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,840
as you open the box, someone rises up from behind your couch

891
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,120
like, don't mind me, just observing the data.

892
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,560
I'm minding the data on this.

893
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,120
I think of myself as something of an appetizer sommelier.

894
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,800
So it looks like you're having a sausage and mushroom,

895
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,680
might I suggest, the fried pretzel bites.

896
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,800
Mm-hmm.

897
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,240
They are dusted with sea salt.

898
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,120
And now, fill out this form.

899
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,000
My favorite dusting, my favorite dipping

900
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,520
is the nacho cheese, of course.

901
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,120
It's the restaurant's favorite.

902
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,160
It doesn't matter what you like.

903
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,240
We've attended to the data.

904
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,640
It's all of your favorites.

905
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,220
Anyway, I will now read a question.

906
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,920
I was working the ticket counter at my university theater

907
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,540
when a man approached, this is a very performing arts

908
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,800
centric episode, isn't it?

909
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,420
It's very arts, arts heavy.

910
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,520
Not just performing arts.

911
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,080
The first question about art, it's about the arts.

912
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,120
I was working the ticket counter

913
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,880
at my university theater when a man approached the counter

914
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,700
and said, stone cold, I'm just gonna bust in.

915
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,140
Walked into the theater unchallenged.

916
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,760
How could I have stopped him?

917
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,400
That's from steamrolled at the Sing-a-rama.

918
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,240
My friend, I don't think you could have.

919
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,880
He did say very clearly he was gonna bust in.

920
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,280
He stated his intention

921
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,200
and he completed his objective.

922
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,320
It's not a crime if you warn him.

923
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,480
That is true.

924
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,400
And what's this crime evil?

925
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,240
What is the crime?

926
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,360
What are you gonna get tried for in this?

927
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,560
And I hate to revert to shoplifting is cool, Griffin,

928
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,120
but like it's not shoplifting this one.

929
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,680
You can't shoplift a beautiful performance

930
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,900
from David Hyde Pierce at the Broadway.

931
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,940
Like you can't, David Hyde Pierce isn't gonna be like,

932
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:25,940
hey, give me my performance back that I did in show.

933
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,220
Right, it's impossible to imagine

934
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:34,220
that we have gone this far in the history of the arts

935
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,580
and have not come up with a countermeasure

936
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,380
for I'm just gonna bust in.

937
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,060
No one's ever thought of this.

938
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,300
Like Broadway, Hamilton tickets are real tough to get.

939
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,460
I've got a solution.

940
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,820
I'm just gonna bust in.

941
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,080
I'll go.

942
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,300
And you know what?

943
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,700
If I sit in someone's seat,

944
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,340
cause I already bought it, you know what I'll tell them?

945
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,540
Sit somewhere else.

946
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,380
Yeah.

947
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,780
I bust it in.

948
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,080
Or I'll just get up and move to the next empty seat I see

949
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,260
and just keep doing that

950
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,940
until I get to stay in a seat the whole time.

951
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,780
Yeah.

952
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,600
Or I'll stand in the back.

953
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,440
I bust it in.

954
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,660
You've got nothing on me.

955
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,660
You have no way to track me.

956
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,480
I'm off the grid.

957
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,940
I'm a self-made man.

958
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,100
And if you're watching this show,

959
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,720
you'll learn that those are good.

960
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,560
Yeah.

961
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,380
So I'm kinda like the-

962
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,620
Hamilton would've stood in the aisle.

963
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,540
I'm the Hamilton of this theater.

964
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,580
If you think about it, really.

965
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,860
Would the Phantom of the Opera sit in a seat

966
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,700
or would he lurk in the back as I am doing?

967
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,700
Yeah, look at me now.

968
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,140
I'm trying to catch you, but I can't

969
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,380
cause I'm so slippery.

970
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,820
Just like Rummy Tumbles, the cat.

971
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,700
Rumbly Tumblies.

972
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,160
Rambletumbles.

973
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,400
Here's what you can do to someone who announces

974
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,020
that they're just gonna bust in.

975
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,660
You could say, I'd prefer you didn't.

976
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,260
You could try that.

977
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,680
This is something my daughter is taking to do.

978
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,820
Say, I'm just gonna bust in.

979
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,380
And you just say, no.

980
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,220
No.

981
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,040
And it's a strong-

982
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,880
And then they'll do it anyway.

983
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,420
Yeah, but it's a strong response.

984
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,660
That happens when you look at BB

985
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,900
and it's like, well, nap time.

986
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,180
And she just says, no.

987
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,860
And it's kind of irrefutable.

988
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,180
Once they get in there, you can't stop the show

989
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,020
to get the performance burglar.

990
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,500
You can't do it.

991
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,740
You could call the cops and it's gonna go like this.

992
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,980
Hi, this is the cops.

993
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,440
What's your emergency?

994
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,720
Well, they busted in.

995
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,560
Yeah.

996
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,380
What do you want us to do?

997
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,700
It sounds like they're already in.

998
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,420
This happened one time when I was at CSC

999
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,620
and a person walked in,

1000
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,940
I think it was like 10 minutes into the start of act one

1001
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,260
and made eye contact with the person at the front

1002
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,980
and just nodded as if I've been in.

1003
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,020
And the person in the front went, uh, what?

1004
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,320
And immediately reacted.

1005
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,180
But the person, the guy who walked in

1006
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:44,500
just kept walking down the aisle to backstage

1007
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,940
and then just stood in the backstage looking around

1008
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,800
and then turned back and left.

1009
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,700
Yowch.

1010
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,540
That's not great.

1011
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,980
You used to work at the marquee cinemas, right?

1012
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,060
Yes.

1013
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:58,780
Were you given any protocol for I'm just gonna bust in?

1014
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,620
No.

1015
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,580
And you know what?

1016
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,180
I don't think I would have noticed.

1017
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,960
Yeah, I'm just gonna bust in.

1018
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,100
Don't.

1019
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,940
No, I'm going anyway.

1020
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,060
I want to see the show and I don't wanna pay for it.

1021
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,140
I'm gonna bust in now.

1022
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,020
Please don't.

1023
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,660
You know what's fucked up?

1024
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,320
I've been sitting here trying to think of something to say

1025
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,060
and I just now realized that everything I've been trying

1026
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,100
to think up is good ways to bust in.

1027
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:22,940
And.

1028
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,760
And.

1029
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,600
And.

1030
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,060
Because I was just thinking about saying out loud,

1031
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,220
you dress up in all black and you put on a headset

1032
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,220
and you carry around a, you know, a three ring binder

1033
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,940
and you just walk into it really quickly.

1034
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,620
You can give them like a, hold on, hold on finger

1035
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,140
if they start to talk to you.

1036
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,580
Because they don't know who, you might be stage manager.

1037
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,420
That's true.

1038
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,240
You might be trying to stage managing

1039
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,820
and you need to be up there.

1040
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:48,580
I don't, I feel like if you sneak in, you'll be arrested.

1041
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,180
I think that is a crime to sneak in.

1042
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,260
I don't want anybody sneaking in.

1043
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,040
I wanna push against this nation's inability

1044
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,660
to stop people who are just gonna bust in.

1045
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,740
We're performing arts.

1046
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,460
I think if you, if you rolled up to,

1047
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,700
let's go back to Hamilton.

1048
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,100
If you rolled up to a matinee of Hamilton dressed.

1049
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,580
I can't afford it, Trav.

1050
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:12,100
No, Justin, you're dressed as Hamilton.

1051
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:12,940
Oh.

1052
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,900
And you're gonna bust in and you're gonna say,

1053
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,420
I'm going to bust in in like a Hamilton accent.

1054
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,540
And like at that point, everyone's like,

1055
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,680
this is part of it.

1056
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,860
This is, this show kicks ass.

1057
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,620
It starts even before you get into the theater.

1058
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,420
Yours is, yours is too stealthy still.

1059
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,460
I feel like to maintain the bust in,

1060
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,660
cause that's so important, bust in makes Justin feel good,

1061
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,340
is you dress up like Alexander Hamilton

1062
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,700
and then you bust in, charge the stage,

1063
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:46,620
grab the real Hamilton and you two spin around real fast.

1064
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,140
Okay, don't do that.

1065
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:52,580
But then they don't, and then you say, arrest who?

1066
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,880
Which, okay, okay, ask me something

1067
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,560
only the real Hamilton would know.

1068
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,500
That kind of thing.

1069
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,060
You gotta bone up before you go in.

1070
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,740
Which number president were you?

1071
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:03,780
14.

1072
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,380
Fuck, damn it.

1073
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,140
No, got it in one.

1074
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,580
And then they take you to jail and you say,

1075
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,740
I'm gonna bust out.

1076
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,660
And they're like, damn it,

1077
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,900
why haven't we thought about something?

1078
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,660
Damn it, Bim Bam, I'm a prison warden.

1079
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,860
These dang guys keep slipping on dang through.

1080
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,980
Do you guys know how just like existentially fucked it is

1081
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,540
that we have now spent, I don't know, six minutes

1082
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,980
talking about other fun ways to do the crime

1083
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,000
and other cool places to do it?

1084
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,840
Yeah.

1085
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,660
I don't know what to tell you,

1086
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,540
cause the answer for the question that we received

1087
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,940
is CalTrips, and I wanted to make some jokes

1088
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,980
before we landed on the obvious answer of CalTrips.

1089
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,700
This is a thing I think about,

1090
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,980
like how much stuff we all kind of just do

1091
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,280
because we know we're not supposed to do it.

1092
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,400
Like, you know, I have a running joke with Teresa

1093
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,660
every time like a check comes for a meal,

1094
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,620
I just look at her and like kind of quietly say like,

1095
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,900
so done and dash.

1096
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,740
But then I think like, people then like just leave your table

1097
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,780
and you could just get up and leave.

1098
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:01,620
Like- But you shouldn't.

1099
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,360
You shouldn't, listen, you should not do that

1100
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,340
and don't do it.

1101
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,300
But there are things that we don't do

1102
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,300
because everybody just knows that they're like

1103
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,300
the wrong thing to do.

1104
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,940
And one of those is, I'm just gonna bust in.

1105
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,460
So it feels like the thing to do to stop that is,

1106
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,020
I don't know, better education in schools maybe.

1107
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,980
Well, I don't know.

1108
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,660
Just every time you turn in a ticket to any event

1109
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,180
to a ticket changer, take a moment,

1110
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,580
look at them in the eyes and share a moment

1111
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,300
where the both of you just appreciate

1112
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,260
the long moral arc of the universe.

1113
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,340
Yes.

1114
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,180
How about a Yahoo?

1115
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,500
And say, I'm not going to bust in.

1116
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,260
Yes, I'm going- And they say thank you.

1117
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,660
I'm going to saunter in.

1118
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,860
Adrian Cal sent this in, it's from Yahoo Answers user,

1119
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,780
Johnson, who does ask,

1120
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,540
how to build a koi pond for cheap.

1121
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,380
Oh.

1122
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,300
I love these big guys.

1123
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,140
Pfft.

1124
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,860
This is me, this is Griffin saying.

1125
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,500
Griffin said that, I love these big guys.

1126
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,340
Okay.

1127
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,980
They're so fucking big.

1128
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,900
Every time I see a koi,

1129
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,340
and I do with alarming frequency,

1130
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,980
every time I see a koi, I forget,

1131
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,400
like, wowzers, you guys are so big.

1132
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,500
I feel so at peace looking at you in there.

1133
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,860
But I've got $3.

1134
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,020
Mm-hmm.

1135
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,900
And I want it to be like you're in a fancy bank

1136
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,500
when you walk by my-

1137
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,940
Yes.

1138
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,500
My house, or inside my house.

1139
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,580
I preferably it would be inside in my lobby,

1140
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,500
where the shoes live.

1141
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,000
Oh, well, I was just going to say, plug up your bathtub.

1142
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,540
No, no, no, because then it's only for the shitters

1143
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,180
who go in there to use the bathroom.

1144
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,380
I want everybody, I want where my shoes live,

1145
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,660
where I kick off my boots

1146
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,500
at the end of a hard day at the factory,

1147
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,860
I want there to be koi there instead.

1148
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,780
But again, I got like $3.

1149
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,780
Do you know what my problem is with koi?

1150
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,620
Yeah.

1151
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,180
They're always pretending to be shy.

1152
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,620
Nah.

1153
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:51,440
I don't think so.

1154
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,900
I checked, Trav, I don't think.

1155
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,980
Because they're being koi.

1156
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,700
Yeah, I don't actually think so on that.

1157
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,860
Here's one thing you could try is take all your koi

1158
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,220
to the local swimming pool and dump them in.

1159
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,100
They're fine.

1160
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,380
They live for this shit.

1161
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,780
That's the thing you don't know about koi.

1162
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,260
They're nasty and you can't kill them.

1163
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,380
People really like it when we get things wrong

1164
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,300
about fish care, so I just want to announce it.

1165
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,820
You can't throw your koi in the local swimming pool.

1166
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:17,620
And then you say, hey, nobody fucking swim in this.

1167
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,840
This is my koi pond.

1168
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,900
I just busted in and I threw all my fish in here

1169
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,700
and you can't do shit about it.

1170
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,980
And don't give me the sad eyes, they're fine.

1171
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,340
These things are nasty and they live for chlorine

1172
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,180
and they love it.

1173
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,400
How much are kiddie pools?

1174
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,420
Could you get a kiddie pool for like 10 bucks?

1175
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,260
You could.

1176
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,080
You know, Trav, I thought about that.

1177
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,580
That was the first thing I was about to say.

1178
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,300
And then I thought, well, that probably wouldn't work

1179
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,260
because you probably need to dig a hole for it.

1180
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,300
And it's like, okay, so you dig a hole for your koi pond

1181
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,220
and then you put the kiddie pool in

1182
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,420
and then maybe you put grass over it to kind of hide it.

1183
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:49,900
I was like, oh no, it's a good idea.

1184
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,740
Oh no, tragically.

1185
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,380
You could lay down some plastic bags to line it.

1186
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,900
Oh no, wait, that's a good idea.

1187
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,060
Wait, wait, no, get out.

1188
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,240
Oh shit, that's it, Trav.

1189
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,200
I want them in my house, right?

1190
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,500
And a kiddie pool buried in the ground, that's not great.

1191
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,600
But, but clear garbage bags that I fill with water

1192
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,740
and stuff one individual koi in before tying it up.

1193
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,700
And then I could just leave it in the living room

1194
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,440
like a beanbag chair that no one can ever sit on

1195
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,900
or else the consequences will be so dire.

1196
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:23,300
Oh my God, oh the consequences.

1197
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,900
Oh my God, they'd be so bad.

1198
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,060
Everything would be ruined.

1199
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,580
Including the koi.

1200
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:31,420
Everything.

1201
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,380
The koi's fucking fine.

1202
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,800
Don't worry about the koi, they're nasty.

1203
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,780
They live for it.

1204
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,520
Oh God, the terrible mess.

1205
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,900
The terrible mess.

1206
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,300
But then, but it would be badass though.

1207
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,860
It would look like a cool bank.

1208
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,260
Yeah, that's for me.

1209
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,520
That's the one for me.

1210
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,140
Folks, that's gonna do it for us this week

1211
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,260
on my brother, my brother and me.

1212
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,540
We hope you've enjoyed yourself as much as we have.

1213
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,380
It's always a treat getting to spend some time with you.

1214
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,980
If you have four spare bucks this week,

1215
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:02,060
we would ask humbly that you go to your local comic book store

1216
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,940
and buy War of the Realms Journey into Mystery number one.

1217
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,940
I know it sounds like grade A nerd shit,

1218
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,460
but we wrote it and it's not, it's pretty good

1219
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,300
even if you don't read comics,

1220
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,460
I think you'll like it, it's pretty funny.

1221
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,180
Our daddy wrote it with us and we worked together.

1222
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,660
Actually, he did the bulk of the work.

1223
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,220
But we're taking the credit.

1224
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,300
Oh, we're taking the credit.

1225
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,080
That's the McElroy Family Crest.

1226
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,420
It's right on there, look it up.

1227
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,240
Also, we have.

1228
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,340
It's a cat stealing a cake from another cat.

1229
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,380
We also just announced like a shit ton

1230
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:34,300
of tour dates coming up for 2019.

1231
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,860
They went on sale last week,

1232
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,820
so hopefully they're either not sold out

1233
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,060
or you got your chance at those tickets.

1234
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:44,340
But if they're not sold out, go to McElroy.family,

1235
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:47,700
click on tours, there's a whole bunch all over the place.

1236
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,260
And if you're sitting there thinking,

1237
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,860
well, you're not coming to where I am,

1238
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:53,020
there's lots of places where people are

1239
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,620
and we can't go to all of them.

1240
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,500
But maybe if these tickets sell really well,

1241
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,020
we'll go to other places next year, who knows?

1242
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:00,860
Who knows?

1243
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,340
We're so wild and unpredictable.

1244
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,420
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1245
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,260
for the use of our theme song,

1246
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,900
It's a Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed,

1247
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,540
which is a fantastic album and can I say, funtastic.

1248
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:14,620
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1249
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,540

1250
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,940

00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,220
So if you haven't checked in a while, go check it out.

1258
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,060
Yeah.

1259
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:37,900
Here's the final yahoo.

1260
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,720
It was sent in by Adrian Callas.

1261
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,560
Thanks, Adrian.

1262
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,460
It's yahoo answers user coolbirds who asks,

1263
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,700
does anyone else ever accidentally call lotion yogurt

1264
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,740
and vice versa?

1265
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,700

00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:51,900

What's an example of a game, Manolo?

1285
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,860
Pokemon or medication.

1286
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,780
How do you play that?

1287
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:43,300
You have to guess if something's a Pokemon name

1288
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,540
or a medication.

1289
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,660
