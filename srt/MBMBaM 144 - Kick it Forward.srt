1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:48,720
Hello, everyone. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother Man. Atop of the mornin' to ya.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,800
He said he had some in the chamber. I did not. Wowzers. Yikes. Let me try again. Okay.

7
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,760
Hello, everyone. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother Man. Atop of the mornin' to ya.

8
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,600
He doesn't know any other ones. That's the only one that he knows.

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,160
I can't look at someone. Okay, try one more time. One more time. Okay.

10
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,520
Hello, everybody. Atop of the mornin' to ya.

11
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,680
I think we nailed it on that. Use take three. Yeah, got it in three. Whatever take you want to

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,480
use it at. Three takes slightly racist McElroy over here. I also have something lined up about

13
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,720
Aaron GoBrawlis. Okay. But we can talk more about that. I'll work it in. Okay. This is an advice

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:41,040
show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Justin O'Mickelroy. There it is.

15
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:50,000
And I'm your middlest brother, Thomas O'MacRoy. I'm Griffin O'MacRoy. That became Italian. I'm

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,880
sorry, everybody. I know the first rule of comedy is to say yes and I'm saying no bye.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No and then goodbye to this whole enterprise. No, but I'm leaving. This is the first St. Patrick's

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,520
Day. It used to be a thing for me in Huntington and then less of a thing for me in Cincinnati.

19
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,800
Every year that passed, it became less of a thing. This year, I'm just like,

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,160
oh, I just don't want to deal with it. Well, you know what really killed me is like yesterday,

21
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,440
everybody was out for St. Patrick's Day. And like by yesterday, we were recording Sunday,

22
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,160
so that means Saturday. Like Saturday, all the bars were packed and it's like, hey, dog,

23
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,240
it's not St. Patrick's Day. Yeah. What are these people doing? It's Saturday and they're out

24
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,160
drinking. Well, no, I mean, it's not that. Where do these creeps get off? I'm just saying like two

25
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,200
o'clock in the afternoon. Maybe that's not a good excuse. This is a my brother, my brother made

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,800
creep alert. Some people are in bars on Saturdays on the day before St. Patrick's Day, which is a

27
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,920
Sunday, because where do they get off? Well, they are wearing those Jamiroquai like, you know,

28
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,960
green and white hats with like a shamrock on them. And I hate them. I want to kill them.

29
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,680
You want to kill Jamiroquai? No, I want to kill anyone that impersonates Jamiroquai.

30
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,200
There can be only one. How does anyone still harbor any sort of emotions whatsoever towards

31
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,560
Jamiroquai? There is nothing you can say to Jamiroquai that he has not heard from the man

32
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,200
who lives in his hat. There is one, there is one reference to Jamiroquai aloud and that is if you

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,200
were in some kind of room with a moving floor and then you can say, oh, this is like that

34
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,560
Jamiroquai video. And then the person will laugh. You can't say Jamiroquai hat, you have to say cat

35
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,040
in the hat hat. Yeah, because I think of all the things that left a cultural mark on our culture,

36
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,560
I think Jamiroquai maybe ranks in maybe a little bit lower than Dr. Seuss. You're saying Jamiroquai.

37
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,840
I think it's Jamiroquai. Jamiroquai is the plural. From the Latin Jamiroquauses.

38
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:05,200
It's Jamiroquus. To Jamiro. Yes. Oh, God. Do we want to do advice or just Jamiroquai this time?

39
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,600
Yeah, just Jamiroquai material. Listen, March 19th, these all expire. So

40
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,600
I've just been offered a job transplanting dead bodies to morgues and mortuaries.

41
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,360
This means I will be cleaning up dead bodies from crime scenes, car wrecks, hospitals, etc.

42
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,680
The problem is, how do I tell my family members without them freaking out? How do you tell your

43
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,920
favorite podcast without them freaking out? Cause you didn't. Well, he doesn't know that cause he

44
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:45,600
done did it wrong. Yeah. Okay, go ahead and finish it. Hold on. How do I ease them into the idea that

45
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,320
this is an okay thing for me to do? That's from Bring Out Your Dead in Denver. Well, you should

46
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,680
probably start off by telling them who you're employed by and not just saying, I have a job

47
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,320
moving dead bodies. Yeah. Like how about this? Let me hit you with this. I work for the city.

48
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:13,360
That is fine. And I specialize in disposal. I make dead bodies disappear. I'm a man with a

49
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,760
man with a particular set of skills. I just bought a pig farm. You ever see that movie,

50
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,040
Pulp Fiction? You remember that guy, the wolf? That's like me, except state sponsored.

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,600
I'm the man you call when you have no other options. I'm a fixer, you might say. I'm a fixer.

52
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,880
I'm a fixer for the city. Here's the thing. Your family has every right to be freaked out because

53
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,080
when the zombie apocalypse happens, you are first to go. They're going to come back for him? No,

54
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,320
I'm saying, have you never seen- You touched my dinkus while I was dead. I remember it.

55
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,680
In movies, there's always that scene where the dude gets out of the ambulance or something,

56
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,600
and then the sheet rises up and the zombie kills him. We watched the wrong movie. I watched

57
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Porky's 4 when the lead character from Porky's 3 dies. I think you mean Porky's 4 at Night of

58
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:20,400
the Living Porky's. Porky, when Porky dies. You know what? I have to tell you, my friend,

59
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:29,840
you have absolutely nothing to be embarrassed of. We are so lucky as a society that there are

60
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,040
weirdos like you who are strong enough to do this job. Thank God there are freakos like you,

61
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,040
freako. Thank God there are weird, weird- Weird dudes like you out there just doing it.

62
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:48,560
Just get off on this kind of thing and love it. You love death bodies, you freako. You weird guy,

63
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,280
you're a hero. Just let your freak flag fly, you freako. I think you can have this job. You

64
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,640
got to take this job. It's fucking hard out there, you guys. You want this? Just say to your parents,

65
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,840
hey, in this economy, I'm employed. When they're like, doing what? Just go, huh? What? Yeah,

66
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,560
I'm totally employed. Literally anybody gives you a hard time about it, podcast included.

67
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,240
The only response is, do you want to do it? Because someone is going to do this. True.

68
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,520
And they're going to fucking rake in the cash while you're working at Arby's,

69
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,840
and you'll still be moving dead bodies around, but it'll be cows, I guess.

70
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:29,360
It'll be people that had a Jamocha shake on the floor just dead. There's somebody who works at

71
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,480
Arby's whose only job is to move the dead people who died from the Arby's outside.

72
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,360
It is a full-time year round job. I'm a fixer for Arby's is my job. The mozzarella sticks are people.

73
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,960
I think, though, that anytime you meet somebody- It's good mood food, guys. It's good mood food

74
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,120
because you get to meet your lord and savior, Jesus Christ. Who wouldn't that put into a good mood?

75
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,000
If you meet anybody or you go on a first date, you got to run the screen pass on them until

76
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,000
they know you well enough that when you tell them that you touch dead bodies for a living,

77
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,480
they don't just assume there's some sort of Wednesday Adams scenario.

78
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,800
Yeah, I think you could also start off just by saying, start off saying, work for the city,

79
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,080
and then you work for a morgue, and then you work in transportation for the morgue,

80
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,880
and then what you actually do, because if you start off with, oh, I roll up in my heavy van

81
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,040
and load some dead bodies up in it, they're just going to picture a whistling dude slinging bodies

82
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,720
over his shoulder. I think morgue step two is I think you're jumping several guns that you can

83
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,920
really squeeze in there to prolong the magic. You could say, I work for the city, and then say,

84
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,960
I work for a city in which people die. Okay, but even that, I would say, I work for the city,

85
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,640
and they say, doing what? You would say, shipment, and they would say, of what?

86
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,280
And you would say, materials, and they would say, what kind of materials? And you would say,

87
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,960
organic materials. Formerly organic.

88
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,680
They would say, animals, and you say, nope, keep guessing, and they say,

89
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,560
this is the worst game and date I've ever been on.

90
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:09,840
But then the desert's there, you just got free. Just hope she loves mystery.

91
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,400
If you want to find out the answer, see you for round two.

92
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,320
Mm-hmm. Or maybe you get in a car wreck on the way home,

93
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,560
and then I will see you also there also. I think there's a great opportunity here.

94
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,640
If you are actually okay with this job, and God bless you for being so,

95
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,800
I think it would be really fun to just pretend all the time that you're horrified,

96
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,800
because it's completely human. Can you imagine the dude like,

97
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,720
go ahead and call the body truck, and you say, oh my God.

98
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,320
Oh God. It's never been like this before. This is my first day.

99
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,760
This is somebody's ping-pong.

100
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,200
You would think they would train me or something. It looks like my Nana.

101
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,800
Why did I have to drive my own car? I had to drive a Toyota Corolla.

102
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,600
I didn't have any room for this car. I have a two-door.

103
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,400
Someone cut off his legs. Does anyone have a leg axe?

104
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:14,160
I need to put him in the trunk of a boot. If you're in Canada, I guess.

105
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,400
I think there are so many options. There's so many directions you could take that character.

106
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,840
Oh man. You could be like weird philosophical guy.

107
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:30,080
Like, oh, so young, so short. He's 90. He's 90. He died fucking.

108
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,840
He's 90 years old. I know. So beautiful. What a beautiful body.

109
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,880
I've seen a lot of cadavers, but your peepum's cadaver is fucking beautiful.

110
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,240
It's a beautiful form, beautiful life.

111
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,480
You could be the guy that shows up and suddenly hints at the fact

112
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,640
that maybe someone should stake him. You should definitely stake the body.

113
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,080
Gosh. Anybody got any chopsticks or anything?

114
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,120
A little final cleanup, if you know what I mean. You smell garlic?

115
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,080
You could also just pick one up and go and just announce loudly,

116
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,440
I'm recreating Weekend at Bernie's 2 tonight. Get it? It's a Bernie. I'm going Bernies.

117
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,040
I'm doing Bernies, guys. Or you could help out the detectives without

118
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,920
them asking. Oh, this looks like poison to me. Poison again.

119
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:27,280
He is on the side of the road and his car is cut in half on a tree, literally 200 feet away.

120
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,040
Natural causes. Naturally, he was poisoned.

121
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,640
Well, man, I'm so glad that people do this. Right?

122
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,720
There aren't just dead bodies everywhere? This is everywhere.

123
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,840
I think that's how probably America rolled for like 50 years,

124
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,600
and then eventually they're like, you know what, guys?

125
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,240
I've been thinking. We should clean this up.

126
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,040
You know how we've been talking about job creation and this tough economy?

127
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,720
I got a great idea. Let's move these fucking bodies everywhere.

128
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,160
You know what would be like the boldest move, like the body movers would on strike.

129
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,120
I guarantee you can have whatever you want. Oh, my God.

130
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,800
If you were just like, hey, Mayor, if you don't pay us an extra $5,000 a week, we're out.

131
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,360
Yes, yes, yes, whatever. Please don't make us touch dead people.

132
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,800
Please, we can't do this again with you. We can't touch dead people.

133
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,680
Imagine going to that union meeting. I would not be able to.

134
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,280
The meeting of the party movers. My name is Morpheus.

135
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,840
My name is also Morpheus. Wait, are we all Morpheus?

136
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,600
Damn it, guys. I said we could have 10 Morpheus' tops.

137
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,960
Listen, I know it's inconvenient with the pipe organ being out of service.

138
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:43,920
I brought an MP3 player and some speakers. Morpheus, please set it up for me.

139
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,680
Morpheus 6? No, Morpheus 6. Morpheus 6, he's good with technology.

140
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:01,840
He was the first one of us to have email. You can read me at deadguycarrier at hotmail.com.

141
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:09,440
My address is deadguycarrier13 because there's 12 of you guys in the union.

142
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:16,400
My last request is please refer to everybody as this fat piece of shit.

143
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,400
Hold on, let me get this fat piece of shit in the truck.

144
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,280
This is a six-year-old girl.

145
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,080
This is a six-year-old girl. That's awful.

146
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,480
Interesting litmus test between Griffin and I.

147
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,520
For me, she was an eight-year-old girl. Griffin's a little darker today with a six-year-old girl.

148
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,000
Well, that's just me. You guys want a Yahoo?

149
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,440
Yes. This Yahoo was sent in by who else? Ira Ray.

150
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,680
Are you Ira Ray? Who wants to know?

151
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,200
I never know when you're setting it up for the assist or if you're just putting in dramatic pause.

152
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,920
The number one thing people tweet about our show these days is not understanding the reference.

153
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,160
Jimmy Ray, guys. Just Google Jimmy Ray. That's it. Google it.

154
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,440
It's asked by Yahoo! Interest user whiteandnerdy who asks,

155
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,840
How can I overcome my strange sexual attraction to my high school mascot?

156
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,240
My high school mascot is a mustang, as in a horse,

157
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,440
and I can't stop feeling sexually attracted to the person in the costume at all the games.

158
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,160
It's beyond embarrassing since I'm one of the cheerleaders.

159
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,320
What are some ways to get over this strange attraction?

160
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,800
I'd love to hear from others who have had this same problem,

161
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,520
and what they've done to get over it. Thanks, everyone.

162
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:42,000
Okay, so let me tell you what I did. You gotta just get it out of your system.

163
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,720
Yes, get on that. Get to the enough previews, time for the main attraction.

164
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,000
Just lock yourself and this poor, poor person inside of this mascot costume

165
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,360
in a hotel room for a weekend and just work it out.

166
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,040
And run out of fluid. There are so many-

167
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,720
Just love till you're dehydrated.

168
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,160
I need so much more detail, because it could be,

169
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,680
maybe this person has a horse thing, maybe this person has a furry thing,

170
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,360
maybe this person just thinks the person inside the costume is sexy,

171
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,640
maybe they just have an objective sexual attraction towards disguises.

172
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,880
The one that really threw me off is the statement of,

173
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,920
I am attracted to the person when they are in the costume.

174
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,000
Right, maybe they just have an overabundance of school spirit

175
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,560
that manifests as a chub. Yes.

176
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,440
Okay, they got a spirit chub.

177
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,320
Hey, go Mustangs, we're just so proud of- Oh, fuck.

178
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,920
We've got bonus, yes we do. We've got bonus, how about you?

179
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,680
Wait, is the person asking this question a guy or a girl? Does it matter?

180
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,040
I think it's a girl based on the avatar, which is a cartoon girl.

181
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,360
So, I take it back. And she's blue.

182
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,160
She works with a tree.

183
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,240
It's hard to think about these things.

184
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,720
It's hard for- Do you mean for you?

185
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,600
For me. It's difficult for me as a person.

186
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,960
It's hard knowing these things we know about people.

187
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,840
Let's go down the list. Okay, here are- I can really-

188
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,320
When I don't have anything to say, like any advice,

189
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,680
I just try to go back to my own experience. So, let's see.

190
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,000
In elementary school, there were the Miller Owls,

191
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,200
which I guess is kind of a sexy animal. So sexy.

192
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,400
With their big, wet eyes. They have big, moist eyes.

193
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,520
And a wingspan that can really wrap around you.

194
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,240
Hey, if you guys saw an owl that had one of its eyes gouged out,

195
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,640
would you fuck the socket? Now wait, hold on.

196
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,480
You get $8. Oh, yeah.

197
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,120
Wait, wait, wait. As a reward?

198
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,080
Or just that's what happens when you fuck an owl's eye?

199
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,200
He can- Also, two other things. Two other facts.

200
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,960
He can talk and he wants it.

201
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,120
Okay, well if those are- Then yes, all day, every day.

202
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,360
Is anyone watching? Where is this taking place?

203
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,200
In the privacy of my own home?

204
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,640
Has the owl come to find me?

205
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,320
It's taking place in that citadel from the Hunger Games.

206
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,080
Does everyone else want it too?

207
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,680
Yeah, they all want $8 so they can buy a healing paste.

208
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,680
You need a healing balm. Okay, wait.

209
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,080
You have a laceration on your penis and inside every owl's eye socket,

210
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,520
as we know, is a healing balm. You're in the Hunger Games.

211
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,720
Your penis has been lacerated by someone from District 11

212
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,520
with the fish guts and what have you.

213
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,640
And the owl is like, listen, I only have one eye.

214
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,120
The other sockets all balm. Also, let me sweeten the pot $8.

215
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,040
Also, I'm totally down. I am down with this.

216
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,920
Also, I should have you know, it will be consensual

217
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,040
because man, oh man, I am hard up over here.

218
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,360
Right? I love those District 12 boys.

219
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,480
I don't know what it is.

220
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,600
Maybe it's the way you smell like coal or are malnourished.

221
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,840
I'm a big fan of this right now.

222
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,360
And I, man, sometimes Sydney listens to the show

223
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,160
and sometimes I'm like in the place where I can see her facial expressions.

224
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,120
And I'm just gonna be good.

225
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,120
I may have to go on vacation or something, a private vacation just as a J-Man.

226
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,640
I don't think I ever had a mascot that I found even remotely sexy.

227
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,080
I had an owl. I had a blue streak, whatever the fuck that is.

228
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,800
I had a Highlander and I had a herd of bison,

229
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,760
which I guess if there was one of them, yeah, I guess maybe one sexier than the other.

230
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,160
Yeah.

231
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,080
You know, you got to pick off the sexiest.

232
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,160
That's how it works.

233
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,760
I think what's really got to be the worst moment

234
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,680
is when you are like in middle school and stuff

235
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,520
and you're walking around with your friends

236
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,760
and one of them says like, man, this may sound weird,

237
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,480
but like Mrs. Smith is like the hottest teacher.

238
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,880
And they're like, you know what, I agree.

239
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,440
And then it's like, yeah, did you check out Jimmy's mom?

240
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,880
Yeah, yeah, she's really hot.

241
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,640
And then the other one's like, and I really kind of want to fuck the mascot.

242
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,040
Yeah, did you see Chompers out on that last game?

243
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,320
Chompers the biting horse.

244
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh, man.

245
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,240
And that's the moment where you get to realize that you're weird.

246
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,760
Or like you can pinpoint him and I don't mean that as,

247
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,240
I don't mean that judgmentally from my point of view.

248
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,080
I mean, like up until that moment,

249
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,240
who are we?

250
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,160
Who are we to say what's right and wrong?

251
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,800
You know, right.

252
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,200
But that's so easy for us to point to point fingers.

253
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,880
But that's what you're doing.

254
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,440
I think doing exactly that.

255
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,560
I'm saying the people that judge this person were wrong.

256
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,880
So you're saying this was a learning.

257
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,840
This is a lesson for the people who were like, I want to fuck my teacher.

258
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,680
And there were the other guys like, I want to fuck the mascot because it's a beautiful horse.

259
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,560
And they were like, oh, you just made me think about things.

260
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,060
Uh-huh.

261
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,640
You know what?

262
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,840
Maybe, maybe I can see things from your point of view.

263
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,160
Chompers is a beautiful, beautiful mascot.

264
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,440
Mm-hmm, sinewy.

265
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,400
Uh-huh.

266
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,840
So, so sinewy.

267
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,600
And look at the emotion.

268
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,560
It's like a poem.

269
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,000
But that's, let's not, let's not discount the fact.

270
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,480
Erase the hate.

271
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,400
Erase the hate, let's not fucking discount the fact that this horse mascot

272
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,720
might be doing some of the sexiest moves we've ever fucking seen before.

273
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,360
He may be out there like, like, okay.

274
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,280
Have you ever seen those YouTube videos of that guy that dresses up in like

275
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,280
this skin tight horse outfits and then goes to like public park and just like.

276
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,720
They're all I watch.

277
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,760
Just gets it.

278
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,120
You know what I'm talking about, though, right?

279
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,680
No bullshit.

280
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,400
Fuck yeah, I dare you.

281
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,440
This fucking guy.

282
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,520
Imagine that moves like Usher.

283
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,040
Like, how are you not supposed to get lubed up over that?

284
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,280
That's, that fucking would get anyone's noodle going.

285
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,000
Mm-hmm.

286
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,800
Like, yeah, I'm completely with you on this front, Griffin.

287
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,440
I do not think that there is a principal alive who would allow that, though.

288
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,760
Oh, what do you want?

289
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,080
A skin tight rubber horse outfit and you want to fake jerk off.

290
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,160
I don't know, but okay.

291
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,600
If it'll help win games.

292
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,040
If it'll put butts in the seats.

293
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,800
Puts in the seats.

294
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,000
Man, 21 Jump Street 2 is really messed up.

295
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,240
Yeah.

296
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,560
Hey, here's another question.

297
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,680
I recently broke up with my long term, long distance girlfriend.

298
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,800
Doesn't seem to be any lingering feelings between us, which is good.

299
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,400
However, for the extent of our relationship, she was better employed than I was

300
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
and bankrolled many of our visits.

301
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,560
I recently became gainfully employed and now I feel I should repay her for months of being a

302
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,840
broke bum somehow.

303
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,760
Is there a tactful, mature way to do this without sending the wrong signals?

304
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,400
That's from Newly Employed in New York.

305
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,080
I mean, honest answer.

306
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Yeah, just like do it.

307
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:10,640
Well, I mean, say like, hey, Susan, I've got this new job and I'm feeling like maybe I should

308
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,840
pay you back for all the times that you covered my my ticket to come visit you.

309
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,880
And here's the thing.

310
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,040
Well, she's going to say no.

311
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,280
Ignore the things that this is a secret.

312
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,920
This is a secret B side track.

313
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,640
Don't do what Travis is saying.

314
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,640
This is what Travis.

315
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,600
No, why is that not the right thing to do?

316
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,760
Because Travis, you don't do reparations for X.

317
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,800
You don't do it.

318
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,920
It doesn't work.

319
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,840
She would rather just not shoot.

320
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,360
I would pay however much money this person is thinking about giving me to not have to

321
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,120
enter into this scenario.

322
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,320
This conversation.

323
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,400
You could be spared this conversation.

324
00:22:52,400 --> 00:23:01,280
If you I mean, they didn't the they didn't pay for you guys to visit each other with

325
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,480
any expectation of a return on that investment.

326
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,400
OK, so, OK, there's the twist.

327
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,160
If in the original discussion, OK, she said something like and she was like, I want you

328
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,800
to come visit me.

329
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,520
And you said, I can't really afford that right now.

330
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,360
Maybe we can set something up soon.

331
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,040
And she said, don't worry, I'll cover it and you can pay me back.

332
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,560
Then I think that door is open.

333
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:29,680
OK, if it was a loan, if it was clearly, clearly put forth as a loan, I think that that's one

334
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,160
thing.

335
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,080
But like nobody wants to I mean, this is just the cost of doing business.

336
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,080
Like there's a cost of being in a relationship.

337
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,680
No one gets their money back.

338
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,120
Now, I would I would love that if it was when you break up, you're like, OK, so I did keep

339
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,000
track of how often I pay for dinner and you pay for dinner and it does work out.

340
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,440
So you owe me like 15 bucks.

341
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,960
There's a slight imbalance out of the I do need $15 from you.

342
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,560
I just need to get it to zero.

343
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,160
You know, it's a fiscal thing.

344
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,960
It's my account.

345
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,240
My board is on my board once you forget about you, forget about that shit.

346
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,800
And the first time you go to secure a home loan, they're like, oh, it looks like you

347
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,120
still owe your ex-girlfriend from high school $15.

348
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,040
So your credit is just in the pooper because with with the Jews, that's now up to fifteen

349
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,080
thousand dollars.

350
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,960
Sorry, Griffin, what was that?

351
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,760
The Jews.

352
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,200
OK, so I think step one is fire your anti-Semitic accountant.

353
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,680
No, not the Jews, the Jews.

354
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,640
OK, I'm with you.

355
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,800
Because of the Jews, you owe your girlfriend fifteen thousand dollars.

356
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,760
There is no God's chosen people must be tattooed.

357
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:47,920
There is no lower form of comedy than, hey, that sounds like Jews that there isn't.

358
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,400
There is.

359
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,440
It's that false.

360
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,400
Here's my B side to the point you're making.

361
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,840
OK, isn't it?

362
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,560
OK, hey, I like I really you know, I think I'm ready to forgive Tom Cruise.

363
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,920
Did you say Tom Jews?

364
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,360
That's my impression of you all day.

365
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,240
OK, that was a good impression.

366
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,600
I think you got me on that one.

367
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,080
Thank you for not making me sound as nasal as I am.

368
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,680
I appreciate you adding some baritone.

369
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,480
This is not a conversation.

370
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,360
Here's a good metric for if you should do something.

371
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:36,400
Talk to everyone you know and see if anyone has ever heard of the thing you're talking about.

372
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,520
Because if not, it is safe to assume that society as a whole

373
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,360
has tried it out and there were some unforeseen consequences.

374
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,480
You just have to trust that people have thought of this before

375
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,440
and it didn't work out if you can't find anyone who has been in a similar scenario.

376
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,240
The other thing is, I'm of the opinion that once you break up with somebody,

377
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,080
the only sane thing to do is to put them in a mine rocket and shoot them in the sun.

378
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:14,480
Like, as far as you're concerned, no, I'm as far as you're concerned, who visited where, paid for what?

379
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,160
What is money?

380
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,000
What is money?

381
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,040
Who am I?

382
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,560
How did I get here?

383
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,320
Why is there blood everywhere?

384
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,880
John G. raped and murdered my wife?

385
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,080
What are you saying?

386
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,080
Call the fixer.

387
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,920
Call the fixer.

388
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,880
I got a body here.

389
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,920
I don't, no, like, don't do that.

390
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,520
There was no, if she was asking you about it, I think that would be one thing.

391
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,280
But like, I think that that could, you run a genuine risk of that coming off as very hurtful.

392
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:52,480
I mean, when you were together, it was worth that money to spend time with you.

393
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,360
And like, I don't think the relationship ending should or would negate that.

394
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,280
I mean, if you guys had invested in a thing together, that's one thing.

395
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,480
But this is just time.

396
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,520
To go a bit deeper with our diagnosis, is it possible?

397
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,920
And there's nothing wrong with this impulse, but is it possible that because you were,

398
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,600
as you said, a broke bum while you were dating, and now that you are not dating,

399
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,760
you kind of want to show her, without malice or intent, that you've kind of gotten your shit

400
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,520
together because now you have the money that you did not have while you were dating.

401
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,720
Does that make sense?

402
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:38,160
Yeah, it sounds like this might be a bit more about assuaging your guilt than actually trying

403
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,040
to set it right.

404
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,320
I'm not even talking about guilt.

405
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:48,960
I'm talking about either, like you may have some deep, dark desire to get back with her,

406
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,240
or not even that, just to show-

407
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,800
It may also just be a message of like, hey, I'm doing okay.

408
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,920
Yeah, like I am doing better than I was doing when we were dating, which I really,

409
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,400
as long as you're not a dick about it, I don't think there's anything particularly wrong with

410
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:08,080
that, but I think that might be what you are also doing by saying, here, let me give you some money.

411
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,280
Here, have this money, you know what I mean?

412
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,200
Hey, that's another great test.

413
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,600
Say the phrase, hey, let me give you some money and see if it doesn't make you feel like you're

414
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,720
paying a prostitute.

415
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,960
Yeah, say, listen, I left money for gas on the dresser, how does that make you feel?

416
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,720
I feel like, I mean, maybe it's oversimplifying, but I feel like if you say, here's some money

417
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,360
for the time that we loved each other, like-

418
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,360
Here's some money for the time that we loved each other.

419
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,880
I mean, is that not it?

420
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,600
Thank you for the love acts, here is the money.

421
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,000
Travis, can you please go back in time until Travis from four minutes ago, this axiom,

422
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,240
this wisdom, you somehow gleaned?

423
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,080
Yeah, listen, sometimes the people that learn the most is me.

424
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,440
Speaking of money for love acts, do you guys want to go to the money zone?

425
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:13,040
Travis, do you know Dana Ray polling?

426
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,600
Yes, I do.

427
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,120
Shit, really?

428
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,760
Yeah, he lives next door to me.

429
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,120
What do you know about him?

430
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,240
Well, I know that he has two best chippies, Jordan and Joe.

431
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,200
Okay.

432
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,040
And it also is important to note that all three of them are dudes, even though two of

433
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,720
them have lady names.

434
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,520
Jordan's not-

435
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,040
Jordan, I mean, Jordan's like an ambiguous lady name.

436
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,520
Yeah.

437
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,320
What about Joe?

438
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,440
Joey Potter?

439
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:37,920
Anyone?

440
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,960
Anyone know about, ever heard of Joey Potter?

441
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,520
Anyone?

442
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,200
Did you finish it by the way, Griffin?

443
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,640
Not yet, I fucking stalled out on that last season, it gets bad.

444
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,600
You were so close!

445
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,320
Uh, yeah.

446
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,840
Can we go back, hey, guys?

447
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,600
Hey, Travis, tell us about Dana.

448
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,960
Well, basically, Dana grew up on a bird farm, where they would plant birds in the ground,

449
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,800
I think, and he is supremely aware of making love to a goose.

450
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,880
That's not what the sentence says!

451
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,240
But we read between the lines.

452
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,960
I love it, you chopped and screwed their intent.

453
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,360
It says, Dana is supremely aware of what you mean by love goose, which I can only take

454
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,200
to mean he's taken a bird lover.

455
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,440
I should also mention before we go too much further, happy birthday, Dana!

456
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,320
Oh yeah, that's cute.

457
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,080
What a great dude you are.

458
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,760
He loves video games and bargain hunting, for collectibles preferably.

459
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,240
Chairs, life hacking, and goose fucking.

460
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,360
Happy birthday, Dana, and we're sorry.

461
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,400
We're so, so sorry.

462
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,080

She is, we're tight, we're bros.

472
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,080
I like friend of the family better.

slash My Brother.

477
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:24,160
That's audiblepodcast.com slash, all one word, My Brother.

478
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,760
So do that and let them know of our power.

479
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,240
But it's hard with a book to, hold on, I can do this.

480
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,680
Get it.

481
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:41,760
If it was a real book that Audible gave you, like physical, you shouldn't put your dick

482
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,400
inside between the pages and shut the book and then try to fuck that, because it would

483
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,840
not feel great.

484
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,760
But because it's an audiobook, that's cool?

485
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,720
No, I was just trying to transition into Extreme Restraints.

486
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,600
Sometimes when I listen to the Audible reading of Huck Finn, I just jerk it.

487
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,320
Okay, we're not going to do this to our friends at Audible.com, but what I will say is Extreme

488
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,000
Restraints.com is my choice for things to fuck with.

489
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,400
Well, not just with, but things to fuck with, fuck on.

490
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,520
Fuck on, fuck near.

491
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,600
Fuck, fuck up, fuck down, fuck side to side.

492
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,560
Fuck adjacent to.

493
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,840
Whatever, man.

494
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,560
Whatever you want to do.

495
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,400
Fuck any proposition you want.

496
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,040
Doing the electric slide.

497
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,160
So we just got it.

498
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,360
Now Charlie Brown.

499
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,240
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

500
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,760

You're going to just love shoving these things in you.

511
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,440
Yep.

512
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,640
You're going to find so much room you didn't even know you had.

513
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,920
This is so, they are a small company based in Huntington Beach.

514
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,320
They love our show and we love them.

515
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,920
They've been a long time.

516
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,760
They have, think about this for a second.

517
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,640
ExtremeRestraints.com has supported this program more than anyone you know.

518
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,560
More than anybody on earth.

519
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,200
Like combined.

520
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,920
ExtremeRestraints.com has made this show possible.

521
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:39,840
I just found out very excited that they're going to be sending us a box of some samples.

522
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,640
So I was curious.

523
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,240
Have you guys decided what you're going to?

524
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,760
I'm thinking just grab bag this time.

525
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,720
Just surprise me.

526
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,320
Now be careful with the grab bag.

527
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
It is more painful than it sounds.

528
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,440
I've ordered a gumdrop bar.

529
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,960
I'm just going to see how that works out.

530
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,160
It's a gumdrop bar for your dick.

531
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,480
It's a pain box that you lower your balls into.

532
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,240
Fear is the mind killer.

533
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,440
I must not be a fear.

534
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,560
Oh god my balls.

535
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:14,560
ExtremeRestraints.com is obsessed with finding the one object that will cause you genital pain

536
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,640
but no pleasure to anyone.

537
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,040
So far they have not managed.

538
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,320
If you envision the site as that ongoing experiment.

539
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,480
Just the floatsome and jetsome from one man's quest to find something that will hurt your

540
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,240
dick but won't turn you on.

541
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:36,000
Yeah their newest edition is the puzzle box from Hellraiser.

542
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,840
Just have demons just tear your dick and body into shreds.

543
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,080
And then some weirdo in Des Moines was like yes mama do likey.

544
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,280
So it's for sale now.

545
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,800
You can buy it because he hates it so much.

546
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,600
There's only one of everything that's not true.

547
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,040
None of the things we've said for the past minute are true but here's what is true.

548
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,200
You gotta fuck and it's going to make it better.

549
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,480
ExtremeRestraints.org

550
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,600
Use the coupon code sexygarfield all one word for 20% off.

551
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,200
It's a dot com I fucked up.

552
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,080
It's disappointing.

553
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,720
It's upsettingly discreet I would say because I really want I don't give a fuck.

554
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,040
I want the neighbors to be like oh they're fucking right.

555
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,840
Yeah look at them they got a dildo shaped box.

556
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,040
Hi this is Biz.

557
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,920
And I'm Teresa.

558
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,040
And we host a new show about the epic fails and genius moments of being a mom.

559
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,840
How do you take care of a baby and still find time to moisturize your tattoos?

560
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,280
Join us every week to find out.

561
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,120
And remember you don't have to be a bad mom to be one bad mother.

563
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,200
I'm pretty staunchly opposed to piracy but one of my close friends uses this as his number

564
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,680
one avenue for accessing his movies and music.

565
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,200
He often enters into conversations with me about why he thinks piracy is right

566
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,240
and offers completely unjustified reasons for his standpoint.

567
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,720
In favor of not getting into an argument over something so trivial I tend to just end the

568
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,160
conversation as soon as possible but I feel this leaves him thinking he has the upper hand

569
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,240
and he is on occasion feels free to remind me I couldn't come back with a better argument

570
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:06,880
and he is right.

571
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,280
Is it better to just take his banal arguments or should I make my stand in hopes of ending

572
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,720
his prattling on and that's from Sincerely Plundered in San Jose.

573
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,640
I am sick of this discussion.

574
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,040
Piracy is evil.

575
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,840
They make people walk the plank, they take people's booty, they're sinking ships all

576
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,720
over the Spanish main and I am sick of it.

577
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:39,520
My dad, my father, made gold doubloons for 30 years in his workshop.

578
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,200
You're taking food out of his children who is me's mouth.

579
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,560
I think there's an alternate solution to this problem and that is to call the cops on your

580
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,360
shitty friend and get him thrown in jail.

581
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,320
Is there a hotline?

582
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,160
Is there something I can do to be like hey my friend got that Hobbit movie on the DL.

583
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,200
Please take him away.

584
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,040
Do you know how sweet it would be if you lured your friend into an argument and you get him

585
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,760
to detail all of his piracy and then at the end you're like I guess you're right and then

586
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:16,320
you pull out a micro recorder and you pull out the flower and the flower on your jacket,

587
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,440
on your jacket, the comically large flower that turns out was a microphone the whole

588
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:21,760
time.

589
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,800
You've been the Wired.

590
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,800
You got me again Bobby.

591
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,400
That's all that the show The Wire is by the way if you haven't seen The Wire.

592
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,200
It's just about a man hiding a wire on his body and being like so you stole those bowling

593
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,480
shoes from the alley huh?

594
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,120
Yeah I did.

595
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,000
What's it to you?

596
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,840
It's not to me but tell to the judge and he pulls his shirt off.

597
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,440
And the best part is that man is in no way affiliated with any kind of law enforcement.

598
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,760
And every, every, this is like a freelance wire.

599
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,520
Every week he hides the wire in a different place so like he takes off and it's up to

600
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,240
you to find it out.

601
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,200
He takes off his Jamiroquai hat and there's a tiny stenographer under there.

602
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,040
You know that under Jamiroquai has a smaller hat.

603
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,240
God what a great guy.

604
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,920
I bet he starts every concert that way.

605
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,440
Hold on let me get more comfortable.

606
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,080
What does he sound like that?

607
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,200
I don't know.

608
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Why is he eating a mouthful of cheese?

609
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,160
I don't know if he's British or Jamaican or a mouse so I made it all of them combined.

610
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:23,120
Um man I don't uh it's hard to have a conversation with anybody about piracy ever because there's

611
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,640
a lot of companies that really have it coming to them.

612
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,760
You know what I mean?

613
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,600
Yeah corpse.

614
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,040
But at the same time like I don't I haven't pirated music since I was in college I think.

615
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,200
Um and that's just like I don't want to get holier than thou because really if it wasn't

616
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,880
for Spotify who knows like who knows where I would have landed.

617
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,880
I mean that's but that's a great point like there are companies out there like Spotify

618
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,760
and now I've forgotten the other ones.

619
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,160
What's the other ones?

620
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,240
Where you can get the music from them?

621
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,520
Like those catalogs that you get in the magazine and you get six free CDs and then you have

622
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,080
to like sell them to your friends.

623
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,120
Oh you fucking know what I'm talking about.

624
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,840
Don't be a dick.

625
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,380
Come on.

626
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:15,940
There's uh my my neighbor uh Suzanne she uh she just sings a lot.

627
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,620
She sings while she gardens it's really nice.

628
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,220
Anyways but there are things out there that will give you.

629
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,140
Sometimes a car drives down the street and they've got their their radio turned up really

630
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:31,060
loud so you get like it's on my phone you get like a few free sets sometimes you can

631
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:36,100
just like whistle yourself a tune and that's free music so maybe you make your own music.

632
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,660
Listen to this it's a free song for you guys it's called T.M.S.

633
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,940
T.M.T.M.T.M.

634
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,700
Do not redistribute it.

635
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:53,220
Can I say I uh I I I think that this argument is probably the most boring one you can have

636
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,980
and I've fallen into it uh 150,000 times.

637
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:02,740
Here's the here's the only thing you can say right yeah I've done it too because everybody

638
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,780
has in their entire life please don't say you haven't.

639
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,380
But I try not to because it's I don't think it's right it's just a personal thing you

640
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:15,460
don't have to convert anyone to believe anything trust me the problem doesn't get any better

641
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:20,020
at all if you convince the person that it's stealing if they can't like use their they're

642
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:27,300
not unless you set up a Christmas carol type situation with musicians and movie stars from

643
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,700
the past present and future to sit there and come to your friend at night and tell him

644
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,420
what to do.

661
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,340

662
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:12,420
to stay on with the radar I can't go back to prison Dunkel's not going back to prison

663
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,900
Dunkel got hit up by the survive another stretch Dunkel got hit up by whatever that whatever

664
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:22,100
that anti-piracy thing is who went and did all the suing of all the college students

665
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,540
gave him a formal warning for downloading for downloading feature films in their defense he

666
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:34,500
pirated more shit than any other 10 people I know combined but he got hit up because he downloaded

667
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:39,380
I think it was like Mulholland Drive or something he got he got dinged he got dinged by the by the

668
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:46,100
motion picture association of America so like it does happen I mean they'll keep an eye on it

669
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:50,660
I hope those guys are just torn at things because they were there like you might want to watch them

670
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:54,980
someday why do you have Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 in Spanish I don't I don't know

671
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:02,020
I have a real problem it's only half of it and it's it's they actually it's homemade somebody

672
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:07,380
did a shot for shot homemade like in Be Kind Rewind which I also pirated in Dutch this is a

673
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:14,580
sweetened version of uh Sisterhood that's what fans call it I hope he's okay I hope he didn't

674
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:20,820
I hope he's not incarcerated I hope they didn't get him he's not he's not on the inside he's fine

675
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:30,420
probably not still but he was dead Griffin I need a yahoo here's a yahoo answer is sent in by um

676
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:37,220
oh god all of them are Ira Ray come on Ira Ray you're the best um it's my yahoo answer

677
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:40,900
somebody's listening to the show the other day somebody treated the other day asking if we just

678
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:45,220
use his questions so we could do the theme song no we keep like I don't want to discourage everybody

679
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:49,860
else who's sending in questions because like they're all great and I appreciate it and uh

680
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:54,260
like I do I read everyone that people send in a week and I do not mean to put you all down but

681
00:43:54,260 --> 00:44:00,740
Ira Ray's are just they're superb they're so good um Ira Ray thank you it's by yahoo answers user

682
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:07,540
question mark who asks did the popularity of the Karate Kid basically ruin the effectiveness of the

683
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:13,460
crane kick since now everyone will know what's coming when you get in the crane kick position

684
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:18,980
and the element of surprise is gone has the crane kick become an extinct move do martial arts experts

685
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,220
not like the Karate Kid for ruining the crane kick in the way magician magicians don't like

686
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:31,300
other magicians who reveal their secrets so by this person's logic if anyone has ever done the

687
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:38,740
crane kick once uh-huh it is no publicly publicly it's well not even that because the person who

688
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:44,260
receives who's on the receiving end of the cake they tell two friends they tell two friends and

689
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:49,380
then they two sell two friends and pretty sure soon it's you know the fucking t-fury's printing

690
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:54,020
on t-shirts like all right I bet it's more of a thing like when somebody gets in the crane

691
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:58,500
kick position at a meet or competition or whatever the judges just like roll their eyes

692
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:03,860
uh fuck you if I was the judge of a martial arts contest and I saw somebody get in the

693
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:09,220
crane kick competition I would be the most excited for anything I've ever been in the

694
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:13,780
better question is how sick do you think officials are at those meets of people yelling sweep the

695
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:20,260
leg like literally every time every has to be right three minutes has to be ladies and gentlemen

696
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:26,420
welcome first and foremost we ask you please don't yell sweep the leg we fucking get it we

697
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:32,660
have all in fact seeing karate kid you are very funny please do not say see the leg also not

698
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:40,740
allowed put him in a body bag that is done also i never die is out also uh later on this evening

699
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:46,020
we do have a roller derby bout happening here they have as that you not shot whip it everybody

700
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:53,780
thank you please thank you i'm jb miller i'm huntington radio personality and deep deep

701
00:45:53,780 --> 00:46:01,060
in joke jb miller god fuck you guys so a little i'm huntington wall of famer jb miller and now

702
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:08,180
a little reference for no one jb miller so let's jb miller is awesome by the way he's a great great

703
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:13,700
he's just fun to impersonate him he has a great radio voice just google him listen come on people

704
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:20,420
hashtag jb miller you get in a fight with someone at a bar we'll call we'll call this

705
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:28,340
someone jb miller for all intents and purposes would you be hero to millions jb miller arcs

706
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:33,940
one of his legs up bends his knee upwards lifts that leg up while the other leg is planted firmly

707
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:40,100
on the ground slightly bent and puts his two arms up as if he is flapping his arms like a bird

708
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:47,540
if you have not seen and are not even aware of the karate kid i still think you can assume

709
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:53,140
like oh that kick is coming like that that physically i should lean slightly back like

710
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:58,900
you have exposed yourself in a way and prevented one of your legs from moving in a way that the

711
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:04,660
only thing that can mean is that the other leg's coming up face words you know be great i think

712
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:10,820
there's somebody did that to me in a bar yes my first thought would be to like just punch them

713
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:16,180
because they've left themselves very vulnerable and open alternatively just push them gently and

714
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:22,980
they'll fall right over but i'm gonna be honest i would let it happen just to see how they did it

715
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,900
because there's got to be like 90 percent of people that do that have to be like don't worry i

716
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,860
saw this on karate kid right and then they're gonna do it and just fall on their fucking faces

717
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:36,900
yeah but there's gonna be 10 of people yeah that are just gonna it would be worth it to take that

718
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:42,820
kick just to see this just to see this bad boy unfold i'm just saying like it'd be it'd be you're

719
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,580
like on the ground with your nose bleeding so it's like oh what happened like that guy just fucking

720
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:51,460
crane kicked to know that he nailed it even if that person like said some really racist shit

721
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:57,700
and like you know poured an entire beer on your friend or girlfriend and like it was a total jerk

722
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:04,260
and you know you desperately wanted to fight him i would let that happen just so that he can have

723
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:11,540
that story the chance to give somebody a gift that magical it never comes along and to yeah and to

724
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:15,460
just like i would lay on the ground and he would bend over and be like thank you i'll be like pay

725
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:21,940
it forward grandson granddaughter come here allow papa to tell you of the time he gave the greatest

726
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:31,380
gift kick it forward you you have to let three other people crank kick you in the face and it's

727
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:37,700
not a very good now and now let me die peacefully the conversion rate is not very good i know what

728
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:42,500
if the guy who originally crank kicked him came back like at the end of late miss iraq when he's

729
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:49,380
on his deathbed he's gonna kick you into infinity now i thought you'd forgotten about me i never

730
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:56,900
forgot the secret was it was the best moment of my life too and i'm gonna die also but i want to

731
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:04,740
die and then they kick each other and it's like perfectly time so they both go flying back and

732
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:09,380
they freeze in midair and their outlines form a heart it's like the end of d3

733
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:14,660
and they just crank kick each other freeze frame

734
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:26,100
stephen sodberg filmed the end before box office smash i wish i'd been there the first time that

735
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:32,580
somebody was crank kicking somebody when that when that prior art in the crane kicking case was

736
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:40,180
uh was created because i would imagine that probably looked ridiculous because the implication

737
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:48,580
of the crane kick is that i can't stand on one leg without falling over unless i am balancing

738
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:54,660
with my hands so it seems to me you could do a crane kick well i i don't think that's actually

739
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,500
yeah i don't think it is a i don't think it has anything to do with physics i think it has

740
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:05,620
something to do with birds with large wingspans are terrifying how about because here's the thing

741
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:09,220
like i think that you're the opponent and you see it happen you're like whoa whoa whoa where

742
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:13,620
daniel's son go suddenly there's a bird here and then you're kicked yeah yeah you see you see a

743
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:19,700
flamingo and you're like big fucking deal skinny ass legs it's pink this is no this is no trouble

744
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:24,180
at all i can fucking wreck this bird they get those wings out and you're like nope nope nope

745
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:29,140
nope nope nope out now griffin you know it's not called the flamingo kick right no like you

746
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:34,580
could have said crane but i am talking about another large goofy ass looking bird of prey

747
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:40,500
and then he did the heron he wanted to go with ostriches but ostriches are objectively terrifying

748
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,860
well they have judgmental faces yeah well that's not why i was i was more talking about the fact

749
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:51,780
that they have fucking velociraptor talons but oh yeah i guess i guess that also doesn't help

750
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:58,340
this is a two-part question okay and i put them together because i wanted to close on this very

751
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:02,740
important point that we apparently have not made yet and i wanted one last chance to make it

752
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:09,220
here's the first question i'm a mid-20s guy who lives in a suburban area and i have trouble

753
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:14,500
meeting women my age around here however there's one girl who lives nearby who seems like she could

754
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:19,700
be really cool her sister and brother-in-law are good friends of mine and i've met and i met her

755
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:24,420
through them the problem is i only met her once a while ago and aside from recently becoming

756
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:29,860
facebook friends exchanging the occasional like or comment have hardly interacted with her since

757
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:34,740
my question is this how can i find some way to hang out with her again i don't know her well

758
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:40,340
enough to ask her out but i'd like to get to know her in a more casual setting my friends rarely

759
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:44,660
come to the area and when they do they usually just hang out with her and her family not me

760
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:50,260
what's a creative non-creepy way to cross paths with her again see if she's cool as i hope she is

761
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:57,060
that's from hangout hopeful here's another here's another question okay next weekend i'll be going

762
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:02,180
to an event with some friends that should be totally awesome but i've just been informed

763
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:06,340
that my mutual friend that one of the people i'll be rooming with is secretly pining for me

764
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:11,220
and thinks i feel the same i like spending time with him but i don't have any romantic feelings

765
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,540
and i don't want to give him the wrong idea should i give him a heads up and risk making him really

766
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:20,820
uncomfortable or should i wait to see if he brings up the topic on his own and that's from from

767
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:27,540
perplexed packs goer is what are we doing both of these together because they both represent

768
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:33,780
opposite ends of i just when i read these two actually like in sequence travis i happen to

769
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:38,340
star them and they're of course not related obviously these people are not the same people

770
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:43,300
they're not regarding the same problem but we we used to hit on this a lot during the show

771
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:50,500
and i and i really i want to circle back around to it jokes aside and really try to hit this home

772
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:59,140
okay this conniving and the strategies and the oh yeah and the like trying to make you guys are

773
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:08,980
fake you have a name your facebook friends you've liked each other's just ask her dummy just say do

774
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:16,500
you want to go out sometime and stop wasting your life minutes trying to come up with a way to make

775
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,180
yourself more comfortable with that because that's all you're really doing i mean well yeah what

776
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:24,660
you're doing is you're trying to recreate like a romantic comedy moment right exactly oh hey

777
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:29,860
didn't expect you to be at the driving range we didn't have a meet cute so now i want to try to

778
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:36,420
create one when like if you've here here's the question that i don't think people people are

779
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:40,260
amazing and they're worthwhile and i think everybody listening to the show right now

780

782
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:57,220
costume cutting down carbs you you're great if you could develop feelings for this person even

783
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:03,460
sort of the first inkling the first spark of feelings why why do you make the assumption

784
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:09,060
that there's no way this person could be thinking the same you know why simultaneously if you're

785
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:15,540
wanting to get to know them the way that you do that is by asking them out and spending time with

786
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:21,380
them we like there's there's no time clock that you gotta punch and get like 10 hours credit before

787
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:26,500
you can ask let me let me tell everybody where we are as a civilization this is where we are

788
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:33,780
where i feel like for a good long while there like back in the the the you know soda shop days

789
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:40,100
the custom was hey i met you and i liked you and this is crazy but here's my number so call me call

790
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:45,620
me maybe no it was i met you i found you interesting let's spend more time together to

791
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:50,980
get to know each other and then maybe we can procreate by the time we're 17 and that became

792
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:57,460
such that was the norm and then all of a sudden it wasn't anymore and it did become about this

793
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,700
conniving and trying to find ways and trying to be too cool for school and trying to sneak

794
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:08,740
sneak your way into love and now i feel like the people who can fucking get up the courage to say

795
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:14,340
hey i think you're interesting i want to get to know you better let's go on a date like that has

796
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:19,220
come back into fashion now and like if you can pull that move off it doesn't matter if they say

797
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:24,740
yes or no they're gonna think you're fucking cool well i know dudes like my friend john sheller is

798
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:31,860
is one of the smoothest guys and i really think the whole trick to that is that he just says what

799
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:37,940
he's thinking to women it doesn't he's a very nice confident good-looking guy who just like

800
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:42,660
grows up and he's like hey how's it going i like there's no pretense or something i don't even

801
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:49,620
think it has anything to do with charm or intellect or anything it is just having that fraction of

802
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:55,220
courage required to say i think you're interesting and i want to get to know you better literally

803
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:59,860
no what i'm saying is that that is what comes across as charm it's not though having that

804
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:04,980
curry but i'm saying that if you have that courage and you're confident and you can do it that comes

805
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:10,820
across as being one of the charming guys if you try to if you try to fucking sneak it in sideways

806
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:17,300
though you're gonna come off as a creep you're gonna be arrested well no you know what i mean

807
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:24,580
you know like no you're absolutely imagine imagine uh dating imagine you're a car dealership okay

808
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:30,820
you are a used car all right and that is not a great analogy just hang with me hang with me

809
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:37,780
okay if you show up in the car salesman you see a car like over in the corner the car salesman's

810
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:43,620
like i can't show you that one i don't think you're ready to like it yet i have to i have to

811
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:49,060
apply you a bit what kind of vibe are you gonna get about that car the answer is not a good vibe

812
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:53,700
but if as soon as you show up at the dealership the guy's like never mind you know what i have

813
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:58,500
the car for you this is a great car you're gonna love this car that's confidence and that's

814
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:03,620
appealing that that we like that we we like to think that anybody else knows what the fuck

815
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:09,940
they're doing because we certainly do not confidence that's all confidence is is holding

816
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:14,900
up your end of the social bargain to pretend like you know what's going on because none of us do

817
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:20,580
i'm saying that's right it is so uncommon to be to be straightforward with somebody when it comes

818
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:27,620
to when it comes to dating it's so rare that when you pull it off it's like seeing it's like seeing

819
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:32,660
a fucking unicorn it's like holy shit like i don't know how i feel about you but yeah sure

820
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:38,340
i i got asked on a date can you fucking believe it and he did you know he didn't do it on a text

821
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:45,460
message can you fucking believe it the crazy thing about it is like the it's it's also doesn't have

822
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:50,340
to mean like coming across as desperate or doing that like that i think that's what people are

823
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:55,220
afraid they will seem like if there's like hey you're pretty you know what i mean but like just

824
00:57:55,220 --> 00:58:01,620
do it you don't say hey you're pretty or hey the shampoo you use smells good you say hey i think

825
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:05,380
you're interesting and i want to get to know you better do you want to hang out sometime never

826
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:10,820
start a sentence with you probably get this a lot but don't say that no don't say i know i don't

827
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:18,340
look like much don't uh-huh i know we just met no or i don't want to seem creepy but i don't want

828
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:24,100
to nope stop doing that don't don't apologize for yourself don't make excuses for yourself i know

829
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:31,860
i know i have a half-formed vestigial twin hanging off of my neck but you just don't even acknowledge

830
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:37,940
it let them bring it up let them if you have a half-formed vestigial twin on your neck that can

831
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:45,140
talk if you still straightforwardly ask somebody else they're gonna say yes i'm gonna take a drink

832
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:51,060
of water while your twin sings river you okay so you but we've been paying a lot of attention the

833
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,620
first half of the question though no but this is that what i'm saying is the two are connected

834
00:58:55,620 --> 00:59:02,020
because well the second one doesn't want to go out the one breeds the situation though what i'm

835
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:06,660
saying is it makes the first cause and effect it's cause and effect the first breeds a second

836
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:12,180
situation where you're actively making the person uncomfortable it's bad for both parties to create

837
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:21,860
this uh you know to to you know create this weird pre-dating phase that like just ask you just ask

838
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:24,980
and if it doesn't work out cool maybe you can be friends afterwards and you don't have to spend

839
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:30,100
another night thinking about it here's the secret you wonder the secret i'm gonna let you guys hear

840
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:34,500
that book the secret of course you didn't read it so i'm gonna tell you what the secret is you're

841
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:41,460
ready no matter what you look like bruce willis is dead at the end no matter what you look like

842
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:47,860
and no matter what the person doing the asking looks like getting ass out on a date makes you

843
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:58,660
horny i do not care this is irrefutable fucking irrefutable when you get ass on a date it makes

844
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:04,740
you horny because you think oh i can have sex with this person maybe it doesn't matter who you are

845
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:12,740
or what you look like or any of it getting ass on a date makes you feel good and usually well don't

846
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:17,860
backpedal because you just made it sound like a hundred percent of the time it always makes you

847
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:23,780
horny always so if you can go to someone and you say hey do you want to go out on a date they may

848
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:31,460
say no but they will also say thank you for making me horny i'm gonna go use this i'm gonna go use

849
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:38,260
this on someone else i'm gonna store this up cashed in later with my husband i'm gonna bank

850
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:44,260
it i'm gonna ask my husband um i just want a short answer to the person in the perplexed

851
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:48,900
packs goer i don't think you have to bring it up as long as you have not done anything that is

852
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:54,580
misleading yeah then if this dude has feelings i mean i would be straightforward with them though

853
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:59,780
just as a courtesy like you don't want him spending the entire trip like trying to yeah but i also

854
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:03,140
don't know how you bring that up if you're like hey dave just so you know before we get on this

855
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:09,380
road trip i don't have feelings for you all right pack it up everybody let's roll out did you get

856
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:14,980
the cheetos got the cheetos cool we're good to roll you want to sit in the back with me nope uh

857
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:22,420
you're crying fuck the the best thing you can give somebody is your time and by asking someone on a

858
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:27,620
date you say to them i think you met there's a chance you could be the person i want to give all

859
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:32,660
my time to i don't care what you look like or if you're a dirt bag or any of it that's that's a

860
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:39,220
nice thing to say to somebody even if nothing ever comes of it okay nothing ever comes of it

861
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:44,340
you have still done something nice for them and made yourself a bit more confident and a bit more

862
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:50,420
used to getting you know if you if you are rejected and you know what if you're rejecting

863
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:55,380
it's based on nothing because the person doesn't know you so it's nothing to feel bad about if you

864
01:01:55,380 --> 01:02:00,420
uh say mooch a bunch of a girl's money off of her so you can keep visiting her and then you leave

865
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:04,340
her and don't give her because you really like traveling to new york city like that's your

866
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:09,700
business that's your business no that uh it's it's a great thing to ask somebody out it's nice

867
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:16,100
and it's not weird and it's how society has operated for so long don't make it into a big

868
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:21,380
thing don't like that's what i'm saying you got a cool hand lucet because your friends if you ask

869
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:25,380
if you ask out somebody that your friends know they're going to make both of you try and feel

870
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:29,940
weird about it because people are fucking dicks and you just gotta be like i don't man just calm

871
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:35,060
down you know we're just we're just hanging out and just spend some time together just see if we

872
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:40,500
see if we are simpatico and if you could say it in that kind of tone and when you say it like lower

873
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:47,380
your sunglasses down your face then uh let me do this other favor for you if you say do you want

874
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:53,540
to go out sometime and the person says i don't know let me think about it you rescind that offer

875
01:02:53,540 --> 01:03:00,340
yep so fast that you do not have time to even let the like they don't even finish the sentence

876
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:03,540
you listen as long as we're making big broad strokes i'm going to throw this out too because

877
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:09,220
we get this question once a week i'm worried if you schedule a date with someone and then they

878
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:15,220
tell you uh no like call you 30 minutes beforehand and they're like uh no i just it turns out that i

879
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:21,380
gotta get a wisdom tooth out at 9 pm or whatever can we reschedule it and then they reschedule it

880
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:27,700
and then they cancel on you again no don't even don't even do the second one yeah whoa don't even

881
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:35,060
do that if they can't suffer a rotten lightning pain in their mouth to spend time with you then

882
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:40,260
if they love you they set you free and then you run away and that's how you that's how they know

883
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:45,700
they fucked up is how i the same people's misguided attempt to try to like let you down easy by

884
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:50,340
stringing you along it's fucking bullshit if they wanted to go out with you they would find the time

885
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:55,300
to people say dating stop asking me that people say dating is so hard and it's not it's the shit

886
01:03:55,300 --> 01:04:00,420
that happens right before the dating starts that sucks so everything that you do to prolong that

887
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:07,780
shittiness is is not a favor yeah so let me say this to the other side if somebody asks you out

888
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:13,620
and you don't want to go out with them say like oh no thank you but i'd rather not booyah i mean

889
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:17,860
you don't necessarily need no i'm sorry sorry offering you an order you have to say booyah

890
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:26,420
i just ask if you rejected that's fine the hundredth time you get rejected i'm gonna feel it

891
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:29,940
and then you'll be that cool guy that gets dates all the time if you're not asking if you're not

892
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:35,780
like i some dude i know like a couple months ago said to me like i just i can't seem to stay with

893
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:40,260
a girl i can't find the one i can't all these relationships end and it's like yeah because

894
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:46,340
they will until they don't anymore and then you marry that person like it's not this magical thing

895
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:52,260
we're like oh i bumped into this girl on the subway married right like there's a half can you

896
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:58,980
walk me through that again i ran into a girl on the subway wait i think my reaction was she fell

897
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:05,780
