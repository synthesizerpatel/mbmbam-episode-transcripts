1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:52,000
Cory, Penga, the whole gang has gathered here for this, the 18th anniversary of Boy Meets World

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,960
special edition of My Brother, My Brother, and Me. Name me one other character from Boy Meets World.

7
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:09,680
Mr. Feeney. Sean. Travis, name me 12. Eric. The dad. The mom. Mr. Turner. Four. Minkus. Five.

8
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,920
Oh, deep cut. Thank you. I can't remember Sean's brother. I think his name was Sean's brother.

9
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes, it's Sean's brother. Brotherly love. Brotherly love. Joey. Clarissa.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,880
Whole gang. Phoebe. Phoebe. Blossom. Monica was there. Family ties. Cory Feldman. What the fuck,

11
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:38,720
guys? 18 years. We're celebrating. We've got confetti. We've got large pictures of Ben Savage

12
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,200
pasted all over our walls. What an unfitting name for that gentleman, don't you think? Ben Savage?

13
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,240
Yeah. Yeah, he's about the least fat guy that I know. Yeah, his name should be like Stephen Huggs.

14
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,440
Did you ever see the episode, there was a special episode where his brother Fred Savage was on the

15
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:03,600
show, and for some reason they decided the best thing to do with his brother was to make him a

16
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,400
teacher that sexually harassed Topanga and have Cory throw him through a door. Yeah, I remember

17
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,520
that. I remember watching that going, that was your play? Like you couldn't have them be like cousins

18
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,600
or something cool and fun? Like he threw his brother through a door? Shit got Savage. Yeah.

19
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:26,160
Have you seen that new ABC sitcom, Shit Got Savage? You got Ben Savage. You got Rory Savage.

20
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,480
You got Adam Savage from Mythbusters. Yeah, and they just fucking wail on each

21
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,240
other for a half hour every week. It's a weird show. It's not very good.

22
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,440
No, it's not a good show. This is a good show though. It's My Brother, My Brother, Me,

23
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,280
and the Advice Show. It's not starting out good. I thought it was pretty good. It's My Brother,

24
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,960
My Brother, Me, and the Advice Show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

25
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,600
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm the Ben Savage of the family, Griffin McElroy.

26
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,000
He's the youngest, right? I think he's the littlest one, yeah.

27
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,160
Let's get right to the questions. I'm ready to just dig in this week.

28
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:05,680
I want a big mouthful of questions. Oh, the imagery. Hey, just put your questions in my

29
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,440
mouth real quick. Just put it right there. My molars are going to grind away on your queries.

30
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,440
My pre-wife and I are getting married. I like that. Yeah, me too. My pre-wife and I are getting

31
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,640
married in a smaller venue for our very special day. The only problem is that people seem to

32
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,440
think they could bring a guest to the wedding, even though only their name was on the invitation.

33
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,400
We do not have enough space or alcohol for this nonsense. How should we drop the news?

34
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,960
That's from no randos in North Carolina. I think what's important to note is that you can't be

35
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:43,840
surprised that people think they can bring a guest, because they think that that is the norm.

36
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,720
Well, I think that's become the norm, so I think you have to state.

37
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,960
Is it too late to put on the invitations plus zero? Plus negative one. Don't even blame yourself.

38
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,640
I think in this case, if you didn't clarify on the invitation, I think if this is the situation,

39
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,840
invite yourself in. You've got to reach out to those people. You've got to call them or email

40
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,160
them or probably email. And that's nice and impersonal to say, hey, no, I wasn't clear.

41
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,560
They made this bed. They have to sit on laps at the church when it's time to go. I'm assuming

42
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,400
you're getting married at a church. Otherwise, it doesn't count. And so they got a lap it.

43
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,600
That's all. That's the choice. That's the business. Is this a situation in which they should kind of

44
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,560
maybe expect it when they tell someone like, hey, you can't bring your S.O., then that person might

45
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:40,160
not come? I honestly, it is assumed if you invite someone and they're married or in a couple even,

46
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,560
like they're going to bring someone else. Like that's just the price of doing business.

47
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,400
Come celebrate our special bond alone. We want you to think about what you don't have at the moment

48
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,400
and what we do. We don't want anybody's love distracting from our love. Yeah, it's like you

49
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,040
can't wear white and you can't hold hands at a wedding because it's not your time. It's not

50
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,160
your desperately alone. You could just announce that your wedding is standing room only. We're

51
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,920
packed. We're sold out. Yeah, it's a crazy wedding. This is Bieber's wedding. Bieber and Kim Kardashian

52
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,200
got married. I never thought it would work between the two of them. And you know, there's something

53
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,240
there. It's magical. I'll tell you what there is between them. And that's about two and a half feet

54
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:31,200
of height room. He would have to climb her like shadow of the Colossus to please her.

55
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,080
Like a midget changing a light bulb in a lamp post. It would be a weird scene. All kinds of

56
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,440
shenanigans. All kinds of things going on in that relationship. Where's that reality TV show

57
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,480
of that non-existent relationship? How about a Hollywood? Yeah, you got to assume people are

58
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,880
going to bring in guests. Like I, there are a lot of things that if they said you can come,

59
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,800
but your wife can't like, I probably wouldn't come. Like that's kind of just shitty. I'm sorry

60
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,920
to be the one to break this to you, but this is why you plan on like, you don't count on

61
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:15,680
300 lonely hearts coming to your shindig. Um, well they probably, they probably did take into

62
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,480
account. I mean, you, you remember how meticulous it was planning, uh, who to invite for your, for

63
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:27,520
your wedding. They probably did plan on couples, established couples and marrieds and datings. Um,

64
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,360
but they didn't want like, you know, Roger to bring his friend from work, you know,

65
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,320
I don't think this is okay. To be fair in my, in my wedding, I wasted a lot of my invitations on

66
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:50,880
people like Mr. T and the Harlem Globetrotters. Yeah. You got to send those out because one of

67
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,280
them is going to say yes. Yeah. Maybe the Voltron's like, I don't have anything going on that weekend.

68
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,560
I'll be there. No big deal. The car from Knight Rider shows up. Um, I think you just got to take

69
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,280
your lumps. Yeah. Cause I think the problem is even if you like planned on married couple and

70
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,720
dating couple to expect like that single lonely guy to show up by himself knowing that there's

71
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,480
going to be married couples and dating couples there. It's like, but not you. Who's he going to

72
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:27,200
meet? Someone married. One of them bride ladies, brides, bridals. And that's the situation you're

73
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:33,600
setting up though is infidelity, which I think is kind of fucked up at a wedding, you know? Yeah.

74
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:42,000
It's supposed to be about vows and shit. Eternal love. Not, not sex. Not sexist. Not sex. Hey,

75
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:49,200
on the subject of sending gifts, should I send presents to my SO's family? If to be frank,

76
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,400
they did not send any to me. That's from Brett's lady. This is one of the toughest questions

77
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:01,200
in dating. The question, the answer is yes. Like why not? Why wouldn't you? They didn't send any to

78
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,000
her. Yeah. Oh, that's a good, good point. No, I mean, send them some soap or some shit. Like

79
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,760
send them some soap. Just let them know that they are in your mind. I think we talked about it

80
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,040
before, but giving gifts is like, especially, I don't know how long you've been dating your SO,

81
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:21,200
but especially early on is one of the like toughest challenges of like the beginning of

82
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:27,840
a relationship where you go, do I get them a gift that's very personalized or do I get them something

83
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,440
that's safe? And I know that like, you know, I don't know, like a popcorn tin, like something

84
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,800
that I know they're going to like. I would rather, I would rather them not have a gift than have the

85
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,480
gift of guilt, which is what you're giving them. If you get them a present and they didn't get you

86
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,600
one, but you always run that risk of like, maybe they didn't think you were going to get them

87
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,600
anything. And so now it's just this like unspoken, like, well, we didn't get anything for each other.

88
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,920
I don't know. It's so tough because you don't want to make them feel bad, but at the same time,

89
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,160
maybe you need to break the cycle. How are you going to make them feel bad if they get a present?

90
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,600
How do you feel? Because they didn't get you a present. Fuck that. They'll be so excited to get

91
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,000
a present that they'll just be like, ooh, present. Who does it like a shiny present? Just go to,

92
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,280
go to stop overthinking it. Just go to Pier 1 Imports and buy them one of those wicker basketballs.

93
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Imagine gift to the Magi and the woman's like, I sold my hair to get you this wash chain. He's

94
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,120
like, oh cool. That'll go great with my watch. Oh man. That was very thoughtful of you.

95
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,400
But listen, I'm going to need a new lady. You're bald.

96
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,080
Hey, I'm just looking at my watch. It looks like it's time to get a new girlfriend.

97
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:46,880
Out of the way, Lex Luthor. That trade-off is not very fair, is it?

98
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:54,480
Hey Vicky, me and Hellraiser split up. Yeah. I got a new chain too.

99
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,680
I said, there's the door, Willy Willy. Thanks for the watch.

100
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,040
Oh man. What horse shit? Yeah. I sold my watch. What did you do? Oh, you're bald now.

101
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,720
That's rough. Yeah, but his watch isn't going to grow back. Yeah.

102
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,600
That's true. Yeah. Cause he had his watch gland removed.

103
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,400
You got to go to Pier One. Got to get him a wicker basketball.

104
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,200
Bitches love that shit. And by bitches, I mean this person's parents.

105
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,680
People do love, people love getting presents and you're, you're probably are overthinking it,

106
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,760
Breath Lady. Just, Brett needs you to buy his parents a thing. And then, you know what?

107
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,040
No matter what it does for them, it'll make him think a lot of you and, and that relationship.

108
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,560
Ooh. Ooh. What about this? Get them the present. And they're like,

109
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,520
oh, we didn't get you anything. Say you already got me the greatest present.

110
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,400
Don't fucking do that. Don't do that at all.

111
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,640
Just the right size. No. Cause if you say that,

112
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,680
if you say that, then they won't buy you gifts anymore. They'll be like, oh, check it.

113
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,600
We got you Brett again. You're welcome. You want to return him? I'll get you,

114
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,120
get you a wicker basketball. Those things are so great. I got one that smells like

115
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,240
semen and sorry. That put it in a bowl. It smells like seven and all the time.

116
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,040
What does it smell like?

117
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,960
Smells like fresh rolls. Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

118
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,480
Yes. I have one. How did Griffin just say cinnamon?

119
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,760
This one was sent in by Justin Russo. Thank you, Justin Russo. You're a gentleman

120
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,760
and a scholar. It's asked by Yahoo answers user Buck Peters who asks.

121
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,520
Come on now. What a power name.

122
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,280
Buck Peters asks whatever he wants to.

123
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,800
Is it weird to watch porn with nine other dudes with surround sound and order pizza for the event

124
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,200
like with sports? Cause that's what's happening at our bachelor pad right now. We started off

125
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,360
with four guys. Now the neighbor and his buddies came over and it's nine guys watching porn,

126
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,320
drinking beer and eating pizza. If my buddy Seth and his two other buddies come over,

127
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,560
that'll bring the tally of this party to 12 dudes.

128
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,240
Oh my Jesus.

129
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,200
There's a question mark like mathematically. Yeah. Yeah. You got it.

130
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,280
Should we invite some girls to balance out a possible sausage fest?

131
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,320
A possible sausage fest?

132
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,960
You can't invite girls from now until the end of linear time.

133
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,440
Not one is going to darken the door of that party.

134
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,200
So here's the setup.

135
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,720
There's so many question marks in this question where question marks didn't need to be like,

136
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,800
yeah, you got 12 goddamn dicks. It's a sausage fest. Also,

137
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,000
you're eating pizza with probable sausage on it.

138
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,400
I'm going to go.

139
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,280
This is like sausage woodstock.

140
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,680
Yeah.

141
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,520
You called all the sausage together for nine miles.

142
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,200
And there's sausage on the TV too.

143
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,320
Wouldn't you imagine?

144
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,560
Yeah.

145
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,120
Some dude.

146
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,320
Do you know what my biggest problem with this setup is? The surround sound aspect.

147
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,880
Yeah.

148
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,440
What was that?

149
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,080
Yeah.

150
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,600
There's a dick right behind my head.

151
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,840
I feel like there's just a dick on my shoulder.

152
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,760
Is there someone gooshing behind my head?

153
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,280
Phillip, are you gooshing?

154
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,560
Yeah, go. Don't say that.

155
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,320
How's this become like a regular, like it's Thursday, poor night again.

156
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,600
Like what the hell is the matter with an event?

157
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,800
Don't you call it an event.

158
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,000
Only not with sports.

159
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,160
Looks like looks like that penis is winning against the vagina.

160
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,920
He could go all the way.

161
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,880
Surround sound.

162
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,640
Perfect choice.

163
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,180
Gross.

164
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,560
I don't get it.

165
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,680
Of course, it's like this is this is the thing where it like it makes us sound like

166
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,400
we're going to be like like we're homophobic and it's not it.

167
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,520
It's that you're not embracing your own thing.

168
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,240
Like you're not embracing your own identity.

169
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,280
Let's look at it through the eyes of the pizza guy who rolls up and delivers your pizza.

170
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,520
Yeah.

171
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,840
And he swings up the door and he's just like, I'm going to go.

172
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,800
I don't know what this is.

173
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,280
There are porn sounds coming from every corner of your room.

174
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,720
Is this like 9.1?

175
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,160
Jesus, how many speakers are there?

176
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,480
I heard your house gooshing from the Johnsons.

177
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,280
Wait a minute.

178
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,200
Wait one goddamn second.

179
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,040
Can you please never say the phrase gooshing from the Johnsons?

180
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,280
I can.

181
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,440
I mean, like, I can't make any promises, but I'll do what I can.

182
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,640
Psychically unpleasant.

183
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,840
That bad, huh?

184
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,320
I thought maybe it was, I don't know, evocative, I would say.

185
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,080
12 dicks is too many dicks.

186
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,880
I'm sorry.

187
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,600
I don't care.

188
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,800
Sexual preference doesn't even even it's not part of it at that point.

189
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,400
That part it's fucking feng shui.

190
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,560
Like you have 12 dicks in one room all watching porn and also pizza.

191
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,360
Pizza, guys.

192
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
Greasy, slimy pizza.

193
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,000
Don't just don't put it away.

194
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,280
Put all of it away.

195
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,280
This is how you know it's not a if the question was, is this gay?

196
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,240
Like, no, because a gay person would never go to that.

197
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,800
Yeah, that sounds like the worst thing.

198
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,880
Yeah, I mean.

199
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,160
There are new movies coming out all the time.

200
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,760
Did you watch Avatar?

201
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,680
Yeah, what the fuck is the matter with you?

202
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,360
Nothing else on.

203
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,880
Guess I better watch some porn.

204
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,560
Get everybody in the minivan and just go see Contagion or something.

205
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,080
Hey, hey, did you and your friends watch Downton Abbey yet?

206
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,000
It's starting up second season.

207
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,280
Just just torrent it.

208
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,760
Don't get a bunch of porno and watch it together.

209
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,040
I don't know.

210
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,400
It's like a secret shame that I think it would be equivalent of me and my friends are

211
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,280
bathrooming in the same bathroom with 12 toilets.

212
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,760
We love it.

213
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,800
The doors open.

214
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,000
Ricky's playing guitar.

215
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,520
Jimmy's roasting marshmallows.

216
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,520
We are all just stacked from stem to stern.

217
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,160
Bowling.

218
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,040
Floor to ceiling.

219
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,680
Just beaming.

220
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,560
People are the worst.

221
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,280
People are the worst.

222
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,800
Don't watch porn together.

223
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,920
Watch it alone.

224
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,880
Don't even do that.

225
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,520
At least don't tell us about it.

226
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,600
Did anybody have any answers?

227
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,640
Any advice?

228
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,680
Yeah, Chrissy says, just keep an eye on anyone taking a long bathroom break.

229
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,800
If it's your house, hire someone else to clean your bathroom tomorrow.

230
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,960
And to which the asker responded chewed at.

231
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,960
Hey, both of you, but both of you answer and question.

232
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,400
I mean, Travis, he has a good point.

233
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,640
That's the that's the main problem when you're throwing us around.

234
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,760
Sound porno pizza experience because you don't want you don't want, you know,

235
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,480
strands of just seed hanging from the ceiling when you're done.

236
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,160
Oh, yeah, because it's so the experience would be so erotic.

237
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,320
They'd had a rush to the bathroom and go to not as much as I don't understand this

238
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,360
idea of like group think watching porn together.

239
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,280
Isn't porn like a means to an end?

240
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,960
It's not like I love the story and the character development was awesome.

241
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,320
Let's watch it again.

242
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,680
You know, like, I don't get this idea of like just chased 12 dudes just sitting around

243
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,960
eating pizza watching porn.

244
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,760
I don't I don't know.

245
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,240
Trust me, that's a pretty broad generalization, which do you guys remember?

246
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,160
Scorsese directed one of the butt slammer's and I can't remember which one.

247
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,000
It was butt slammer's 12, whichever one had Leonardo DiCaprio in it.

248
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,760
I remembered it was in the low tens, but you got to be careful.

249
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,080
Yeah.

250
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,400
Yeah.

251
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,520
Leo showed up.

252
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,320
Yeah.

253
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,360
And he slammed all the butts.

254
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,400
All the butts.

255
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,280
Yowza.

256
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,520
Yeah.

257
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,880
I've been dating this girl for a few weeks now and she's borderline perfect.

258
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,840
The only thing that concerns me is that she's more into me than I am into her.

259
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,880
Any advice concerned in Connecticut?

260
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,200
Yeah.

261
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,520
So your problem is she's almost perfect.

262
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,280
If only she didn't like you so much.

263
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,880
Here's the thing.

264
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,960
Oh, to have your problems.

265
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,040
That must be so rough.

266
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,840
Almost perfect.

267
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,480
See, I want to close.

268
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
She might not be close to that borderline.

269
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,640
You know, she might have half a face started like right at sideways.

270
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,320
Like nothing below the nose.

271
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,360
What are you talking about?

272
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,760
I'm saying she's almost perfect.

273
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,960
Yeah, the almost perfect thing is that the only problem with her is that she likes him

274
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,520
too much.

275
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,800
This question makes me so angry.

276
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,120
I know I'm trying to recuperate because like when people say that, when people are like,

277
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,880
she's more into me than I am into her.

278
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,400
That's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

279
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,800
It's because you are less into her than she is into you.

280
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,240
So she's pushing.

281
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,280
She's fighting to try to get you on the same level.

282
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,360
Right now the ball's in your court.

283
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,880
You need to give her the ball.

284
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,520
Yeah.

285
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,440
You are not playing teamwork style.

286
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,240
You are not.

287
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,920
I don't know any more basketball references, but no teamwork style.

288
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,560
That was a good one.

289
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,560
We're going to go into this with a teamwork style defense.

290
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,560
What you got to do, you got to get Bugs Bunny to pass it to Bill Murray and slam jam it

291
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,360
on the Monstars.

292
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,880
That's right.

293
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,000
That's the only basketball.

294
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,200
And also, Wayne Knight is there.

295
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,400
Wayne Knight is there also.

296
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,520
And he drinks Michael Jordan's special stuff, which man, that movie is pretty suggestive

297
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,560
now that I'm older.

298
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:20,320
Yeah, I think Travis makes a rare great point that she is trying to compensate.

299
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,360
She feels things not working.

300
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,040
She feels you're not putting the energy into it.

301
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,680
I don't know what this I don't like her is, but if she is borderline perfect and you don't

302
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,720
like her to your full capacity, that's a problem with you.

303
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,520
Yeah.

304
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,640
I got this sweet, perfect angel.

305
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,600
Only problem, though, is that I want somebody who's terrible for me.

306
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,480
Yeah, right.

307
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,360
It's one of those things whenever someone says, you know, I should really like her,

308
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,080
but I don't.

309
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
OK, well, then you don't.

310
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,920
So I think you need to analyze like what your real problem is.

311
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,200
And maybe she's not quite as perfect for you as you think.

312
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,400
Or you don't appreciate her on the level that you should.

313
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,520
There's something stopping you from being happy in this relationship.

314
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,200
What do you think it is, you guys, without any information about this person whatsoever,

315
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,440
except for a pseudonym they provided with us?

316
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,400
They live in Connecticut.

317
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,680
Do you think that maybe their apple orchard has had a rotten harvest?

318
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,360
No, I think that's a definite possibility.

319
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,520
I think it's that I think it's that they've only been dating for a few weeks and that

320
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,680
people in this day and age have a tendency to rush from dating to like we are boyfriend,

321
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,920
girlfriend, and they don't take the time to like actually get to know each other

322
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,760
and figure out if they're perfect for each other.

323
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,520
They just kind of jump into it.

324
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Yeah, but that's not that's not that.

325
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,040
No, I disagree.

326
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,600
I don't know.

327
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,480
It's not always bad.

328
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,840
It's not always bad, but it's this idea of it's never put someone on a pedestal.

329
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,720
She's not perfect.

330
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,080
No one's perfect.

331
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,720
What like?

332
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,720
No, yeah, I think that that's the problem.

333
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
You're saying that the problem.

334
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,920
The reason he doesn't like her is because he thinks that she's perfect.

335
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,320
Well, I think he doesn't know her well enough.

336
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,440
You've done lost the plot.

337
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,960
You have no, no, no.

338
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,240
I'm saying if you think she's perfect, maybe you don't well know her well enough.

339
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,360
Maybe you guys just need to have some more conversations.

340
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,120
I'm saying it's his.

341
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,880
I'd say it's this person's problem.

342
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,640
You're putting it on this person who?

343
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,800
Now I'm assuming that the writer of this question listens and the girlfriend doesn't.

344
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,400
So I'm going to put the blame on her because she'll never hear me do it.

345
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,160
Cowardly, you say?

346
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,520
Maybe I say it's practical.

347
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,200
Hey, why are you so amazing?

348
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,080
Hey, you maybe need to aim even higher than almost perfect.

349
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
Maybe you need to go take it to the limit.

350
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,800
Hey, is there any way that she that you can like him less?

351
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,920
Maybe he's okay to completely shift gears here.

352
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,480
How do you have that conversation?

353
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,680
Can you like me less?

354
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,280
Yeah, I always say like communication, explain your problems and be like, hey, you like me

355
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,320
way too much.

356
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,920
I am clearly too awesome.

357
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,840
I know I'm great and I'm always cooking your favorite grilled cheese sandwiches and I always

358
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,880
drop the best Napoleon Dynamite quotes the most appropriate times.

359
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,000
But you've got to stop liking me so much.

360
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,880
I get it.

361
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,600
I get it.

362
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,400
Maybe it's it's time for you to, I don't know, just lower the bar a little bit.

363
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,640
Yeah, you got to like next time you're smooching her, maybe he's being too great.

364
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,920
Yeah, maybe he forgets a dinner date, stands her up once or twice.

365
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,720
Well, no, no, no, no, no, nothing that disrespectful.

366
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,080
I'm saying next time you're smooching her, maybe you burp a little bit.

367
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,160
Maybe you invite her to a 12 man straight off jerk off festival.

368
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,320
Like a, like a summer jerk off festival.

369
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,000
Jerk off fest 2011.

370
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,320
Yeah.

371
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,880
Jerkeroo.

372
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,480
Jerkerpalooza.

373
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,480
Jerker shoot.

374
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:01,280
Maybe make it, maybe make a offhanded comment about, um, tomorrow's underwear changing day.

375
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,400
Just mention it.

376
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,640
Actually I've been waiting for so long.

377
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,160
Oh, time's up.

378
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,720
Um, maybe talk about your mites.

379
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,360
Say bed bugs.

380
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,720
Say something about bed bugs.

381
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,160
You don't even have to like do a sentence.

382
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,400
You can just say the words bed bugs and you drop like two rungs.

383
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,280
Here's the thing.

384
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,000
Smother her.

385
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,240
Not, no, wait a minute.

386
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,720
Come back.

387
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,560
Not like that.

388
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,760
Put that pillow down.

389
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,880
Put that pillow down.

390
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,520
That would fix your problem, but not really in the way that you need.

391
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,160
It would create some new problems.

392
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,480
Yeah.

393
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,840
With the law, Johnny law.

394
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,080
A new one with Johnny law to deal with.

395
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,680
Um, I really, can I, can I, I, I, in, in the serious advice realm, I would say that

396
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,280
if you hang in there with this relationship and you really care about this girl,

397
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,160
these things will, um, uh, balance out.

398
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,640
But he doesn't care about it.

399
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,080
You'll find an equilibrium.

400
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,320
What?

401
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,360
He's, he's bored.

402
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,240
He's bored.

403
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,400
Yaw, no thanks perfection.

404
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,680
Too perfect.

405
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,960
I'm saying Griffin has already turned on this question asker and I'm trying to give him a way

406
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,360
out.

407
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,000
You know what I'm saying?

408
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,480
Just chill.

409
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,480
If she's perfect, he shouldn't have any problems staying in the relationship.

410
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,080
It should be a joy, a delight, unless there's something he's not telling us.

411
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,880
Half a face vampire.

412
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,240
Half a face vampire.

413
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,120
Half face vampire.

414
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,280
She sucks other faces to get the other half of her face.

415
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,240
Is that a thing?

416
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,640
Yeah, sure.

417
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,200
Yeah.

418
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,520
Yeah.

419
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,680
It's probably a series on the BBC.

420
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:27,920
Yeah.

421
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,800
That's what it's about.

422
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,200
Half face vampires take out and Netflix.

423
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,840
It's not an appropriate second date, right?

424
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,320
I just started dating a guy who's recently out of a long-term relationship and he's jumping

425
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,280
into a comfort level.

426
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,480
We have not reached yet.

427
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,000
How can I get him to back off without being too harsh?

428
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,040
Form spring.

429
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,520
Yikes.

430
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,800
Yikes.

431
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,160
Oh buddy.

432
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,800
Can you put them on the line?

433
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,760
Can we talk to him?

434
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,520
Here's the thing.

435
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,280
I think that's not a bad second date, but it is a bad second, third, fourth, fifth,

436
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,960
sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and 10th date.

437
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:01,920
Yeah.

438
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,800
In a row.

439
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,720
It also depends on what the first date was.

440
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:06,880
Yeah.

441
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,560
Well, I imagine the first date.

442
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:08,960
Nobody does have a first date.

443
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,920
With their wedding.

444
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,320
Yeah.

445
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:10,560
Yeah.

446
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,560
No, yeah.

447
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,720
And that's a tough conversation to have too.

448
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,800
Like, really?

449
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,560
You want to, I guess we can stay in and it's a little, it is kind of intimate, I guess.

450
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:22,960
Yeah.

451
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,360
Doing that.

452
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,720
And yeah, he's, you know what?

453
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:31,840
He's trying to slip into the sweat pants of stage a relationship long before he's,

454
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,400
it's time.

455
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,920
It's the hot pants stage.

456
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,160
Is there a way to like jokingly bring it up?

457
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,920
Like we're not quite in the sweat pants phase yet.

458
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,640
Ha ha ha.

459
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,400
Without going, hey.

460
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,200
Put on some fucking slacks and take me out before I leave you.

461
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,560
I'm beautiful.

462
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,360
I'm ready.

463
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,000
I'm ready.

464
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,120
I'm thrumming.

465
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,880
Your slacks are pressed.

466
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,280
Get in the car, drive me to the dance hall.

467
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,720
We're going to the DAV and we're going to boogie.

468
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,600
What?

469
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,160
Yeah.

470
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,640
The where?

471
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,040
The D.A.R.

472
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,720
The Dogs of the American Revolution.

473
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,440
Uh huh.

474
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,640
Or maybe the Eagles.

475
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,280
The Dotar?

476
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,920
The Elks.

477
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,720
The Elks?

478
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
The Knights of, the KFC, the Knights of Columbus.

479
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,840
We're going to go to the KFC.

480
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,400
We're going to.

481
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,760
We're going to go to the Veterans Hospital and we are going to cut a rug.

482
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,880
Um, I, yeah.

483
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,640
I think joking about it is that, cause there's a thing with a lot of guys.

484
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,880
If you make a joke, he'll really take it to heart and it'll eat at him.

485
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,800
So maybe that's the way to go.

486
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,440
You know, just something fun like that.

487
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,000
But don't make it too serious because I, this is going to sound weird, but you're,

488
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,840
I think second date is too early to be having serious conversations about anything.

489
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,160
Yeah.

490
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,040
I don't think you can have a serious conversation about like, hey, listen, this is really,

491
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,800
this is moving too fast.

492
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,360
Like I would just, you know, make a casual joke about it.

493
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,720
And that's the thing is, what's funny is it's not that it's moving too fast,

494
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,880
so much as it's slowed down too fast.

495
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,040
Yeah, it slowed down like really fast.

496
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,440
Yeah, he threw, he was just revving up the engine.

497
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,800
He threw on the brakes.

498
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,760
Who like brings it?

499
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,600
He's like, Hey, I got Pad Thai and we're about to stream some Downton Abbey.

500
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,360
And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

501
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,400
Chill out.

502
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,680
Hang on.

503
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,680
I gots to go.

504
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,960
That does sound like a good night though.

505
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,680
It sounds nice.

506
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,240
I might do that tonight.

507
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,120
I might do that tonight.

508
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,360
Yeah.

509
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:19,840
Sounds good.

510
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,400
God, I'm old.

511
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,520
I'm 80 years old.

512
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,840
This is called my brother, my brother, my octogenarian.

513
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,240
My brother, my brother, my grandpa and his sage, sage words.

514
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,520
Um, yeah, I think you, I think if you make a fun joke about it, I don't think it'll be that

515
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,560
big of a problem anymore.

516
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,120
You can get over it.

517
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:48,320
See, and maybe, maybe wait to see what the third date is because maybe, yeah, maybe that's his

518
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,640
pattern.

519
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,000
Maybe it's like epic first date, lame second date, but then his third date is like hot air balloon

520
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,680
ride and you're losing your mind.

521
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,160
That's right.

522
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,640
You're eating Thai food and watching Netflix on a laptop in a hot air balloon.

523
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,520
Listen, I love when you took me to the fancy Italian restaurant and we watched Netflix and

524
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,160
ate takeout at the table and then you took me to your house and we watched Netflix and ate

525
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,160
takeout and now we're on the space shuttle and we're watching Netflix and eating takeout,

526
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,120
but maybe change it up.

527
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,560
This Downton Abbey is so gripping.

528
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,000
Why do they only make seven episodes?

529
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,800
You know what?

530
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,320
I think you just got to take charge because this person was in a long-term relationship.

531
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:32,480
They probably would be very excited to, to go out and do things that they didn't do in

532
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,360
their last relationship.

533
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,440
It was, if it was as sedentary as you're making it sound like, I think you just got to take

534
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,520
charge and be like, today we're gonna, you know, go river rafting or something, something

535
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,080
exciting.

536
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,520
You know, I think that that person will really, really appreciate that and sort of break out

537
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,880
of the doldrums and then, you know, try even harder to impress you.

538
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,600
Speaking of doldrums, guys who have been in a long-term relationship for a long time,

539
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,320
don't forget that every once in a while, you got to put the sweatpants up.

540
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,160
You got to put on some slacks again.

541
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,400
And do it for no reason.

542
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,240
Don't wait till like an anniversary or birthday because then it doesn't count.

543
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,840
It's got to be like, hey, you know what?

544
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,000
I just realized how much I love you today.

545
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,360
Let's go somewhere special tonight.

546
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,920
It's, it's much like sieging a fort.

547
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,320
The most important part in love is the element of surprise.

548
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,200
That is correct.

549
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,440
Yeah.

550
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,640
Hey, uh, Griffin, do you have a, and make sure you don't make her pay for it.

551
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,600
Don't you dare.

552
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,640
That really kills it.

553
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,720
Yesterday, just yesterday, my lady, I went out to a fancy dinner.

554
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:33,680
I had a, um, uh, the, the sea bass, Southern style sea bass coated in polenta.

555
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,180
Delicious.

556
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,120
Yeah.

557
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,080
She had the swordfish.

558
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,800
I, uh, last night I cooked for my lady.

559
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:44,320
I made her, uh, uh, salmon filets, which I stuffed with baby spinach and pine nuts.

560
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,960
And, uh, and, uh, it was a real treat.

561
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,000
What about you, Trev?

562
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,120
What'd you eat last night?

563
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,080
Uh, Teresa made me a country dinner with mashed potatoes and chicken fried steak.

564
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,600
And damn.

565
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,360
Can we all just, can we all hold hands across the internet and just appreciate

566
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,960
how good our lots in life are?

567
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,600
Yeah.

568
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,840
I don't, I day to day, who knows, but like dinner, at least we got our dinner, right?

569
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,040
My breakfast, I don't know what I'm going to do yet.

570
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,080
It's still early.

571
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,600
I wish there was some really squawky, harpy lady who was here right now.

572
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,280
I'd be like, I ate a bowl of salad out of a bread bowl from Marie Callender's.

573
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,360
And then it would turn into a Marie Callender's commercial.

574
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,520
Marie Callender's is good anytime.

575
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,480
It's good anytime.

576
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,280
Or like a woman who's like, I ate half a Hershey bar and some bunions.

577
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,000
Who is this Kathy-like character you're trying to cast in the show?

578
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,160
I don't understand the sociological profile you're trying to tap into with this new character.

579
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,520
I ate cat food because it is all I had.

580
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,240
So a homeless person.

581
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,640
Is this a homeless ad for Marie Callender?

582
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,960
This actually sounds like an episode of The New Adventures of Will Christie.

583
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
Marie Callender homeless delights.

584
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,440
Cat food, surprise.

585
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,120
Surprise, you only have cat food.

586
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,840
Requires a microwave and now my teeth hurt.

587
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,720
I made soup out of newspaper.

588
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,640
Today's headline, these is delicious.

589
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,880
Do you know where you'll be going with all the savings from Marie Callender using coupons

590
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,920
in the mail from the newspaper that you made in the soup?

591
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,960
With the money time.

592
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,400
That's so awkward when you go to buy a Marie Callender homeless meal and you realize that

593
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,400
you already made the coupons in the soup.

594
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,040
Thank you Marie.

595
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,720
Is this soupons?

596
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,120
The soup that keeps on souping.

597
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Let's go to the money zone.

598
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Ethan wants to wish his girlfriend Ariel a happy 21st birthday.

599
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,920
Today, today, today.

600
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,960
Both in Indianapolis, both devout MB&B AM listeners.

601
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,720
And Griffin, kind of channel Ethan and give me this next quote in the voice of Ethan.

602
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,760
Oh yeah, so Ariel, she's a model.

603
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,960
Oh, I'm talking like fucking the guy from Nicolas Cage.

604
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,240
I was talking like the guy from Men in Black after he gets taken over by the alien.

605
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:36,400
He's like, oh, Ariel, he says, is a model.

606
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,600
Good, good, good get.

607
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,560
She likes giraffes and penguins.

608
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,240
She's hilarious.

609
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,920
And he loves her very, very much.

610
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,760
Happy birthday, Ariel.

611
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,640
Happy birthday, Ariel.

612
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,520
Go get just wasted on Arbor Mist because you can buy that now legally.

613
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,040
Yeah, all the Arbor Mist you want.

614
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,320
Go get some Arbor Mist in Wild Irish Rose and go crazy.

615
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,280
They think it'd be cool.

616
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,720
It would be a good promotion for Arbor Mist if they could somehow make it where you could

617
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,560
drink Arbor Mist when you're 20.

618
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,600
Just as like a warm up for real alcohol.

619
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,760
Yeah, I thought that was Boone's Farm.

620
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,480
It's like juice.

621
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,640
Boone's Farm, Arbor Mist.

622
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,560
Because let's be honest, you're drinking Smirnoff Ice at like 16 for that slow, slow ramp up.

623
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,160
Yeah, for the slow.

624
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,400
It just legally instituted indoctrination in the culture of alcohol.

625
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,840
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

626
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,800
Hey, if you would like to be on our Jumbotron, you go to maximumfund.org

627
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,800
forge slash Jumbotron and we'll talk about your special event or your corporation.

628
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,640
And there are rates there and thank you for your money.

629
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,960
And listen, don't actually drink before you're 21 unless it's like Zima.

630
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,120
Or you're being pressured to.

631
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,840
If you're being pressured to drink a Four Loko, that's fine.

632
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,280
That's fine.

633
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,440
Especially if it's by a member of the opposite sex.

634
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,720
Oh yeah, yeah.

635
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,600
Who's older than you?

636
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,080
Because you might get the smooch.

637
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,320
Don't actually drink Four Loko.

638
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,200
I'm 24 and I don't think I can handle one of those things.

639
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,000
And listen, I saw it on Twitter last night.

640
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,600
Oh yeah, he's drinking trash monkeys.

641
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,960
I can't stress enough.

642
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,520
Don't drink trash.

643
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,880
It was a fun little short story because she's like,

644
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,480
my boyfriend's about to drink trash monkeys.

645
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,880
And then like two hours later, she's like, my boyfriend's dead.

646
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,520
My boyfriend died.

647
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,400
I miss him very much.

648
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,480
Thanks for the advice.

649
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,760
Thank you.

650
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,040
Just don't drink anymore, you guys.

651
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,960
Yeah, Griffin.

652
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,100
Yahoo.

653
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,360
Yes.

654
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,600
How about another one from Mr. Justin Russo?

655
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,240
He really knocked it out of the park this week.

656
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,280
Thank you, Justin Russo.

657
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Vic Philadelphia Freedom who asks,

658
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,920
this might be too gross.

659
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,840
Let me know if it is and we'll do something else.

660
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,920
How do you make a scrotum more attractive?

661
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,880
I mean, if you leave it as is,

662
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,280
it looks like a Velcro tennis ball rolled in pet hair.

663
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,000
If you shave it, it looks like an orange

664
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,760
that somebody forgot in the fridge for a year.

665
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,000
How do you make it look any better?

666
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,840
Serious answers only, please.

667
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,800
You can make it look like a kitty with like face paint.

668
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,160
What's the additional infographic?

669
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,040
Additional details.

670
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,240
Will you marry me, cat?

671
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,400
So I don't know.

672
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Maybe he's using this as like the worst proposal.

673
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,880
Like he was trying to genetically scientifically come up

674
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,360
with the worst proposal ever imaginable.

675
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,840
Because this would be it.

676
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,280
This is pretty high on the list.

677
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,080
This is actually an easy one to answer.

678
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,120
What you want to do is go up to,

679
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:32,160
you go up and click layer and then click filter

680
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,520
and then click artistic and then click scrotum

681
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,800
and then click de-speckle, de-vein and uncheck smoothing.

682
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,680
And you're just going to want to save that as a keyboard shape.

683
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,680
To get the TIFF or JPEG file format.

684
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:01,840
If you have a TIFF, you're going to want to check in laced hair

685
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,440
and that's going to give you a look like the pubes are woven

686
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,360
into like a dick dicky base.

687
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,160
Yeah, it's going to be a really nice look.

688
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,080
I tell you what, I usually just blur it.

689
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,600
Blur, blur, blur, blur, blur.

690
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,480
And then I slap a mosaic filter on it

691
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,720
and then I print that and I use it as a sort of basis

692
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,920
for my stained glass work.

693
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,440
You know, and we run into this a lot,

694
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,080
but you guys are just so much more computer savvy than me.

695
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,440
I just use paint and just kind of do a spray paint smile on it.

696
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,680
Yeah, which is fine.

697
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,880
That's good, I guess.

698
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,760
I'm still using clip art.

699
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,680
I've been looking into flash to like animate

700
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,240
to just make it look like the left and right gonads

701
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,040
are sort of going up and down as if it were walking down

702
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,080
like a path, like a rose covered path.

703
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,520
So maybe they're not any more attractive,

704
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,280
but they're definitely more active.

705
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,840
Yeah, well, and you can't spell attractive without active,

706
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,040
you know, if you think about it.

707
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,400
It's true, it's so true.

708
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,600
Everybody get fit.

709
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,240
Just a reminder.

710
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,160
You thought about maybe throwing a third ball in there?

711
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,520
Giving something they haven't seen before.

712
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,080
Just like that classic scene in Total Recall

713
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,880
when that girl says, baby, you made me wish I was dead.

714
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,040
I hate your third ball so much.

715
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,000
Oh, man, I don't think that there is a,

716
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,560
I don't know, an equal thing for having three balls.

717
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,320
Like, made me wish I had six fingers.

718
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,040
I don't know.

719
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,320
Made me wish I had left after our second date something.

720
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,200
How about this suggestion?

721
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,320
One sentence, get yourself an Easter egg kit.

722
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,080
Oh, you're saying that he should dip them?

723
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,480
Yeah, but make sure you use the wax pencil before.

724
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,800
Yeah, because afterwards he doesn't do the designs as well.

725
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,880
Yeah, you can write your favorite Bible verses.

726
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,640
Don't overdo it with the glitter.

727
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,840
You don't want it looking like a Mariah Carey video down there.

728
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,080
Yeah, get your glitter straight.

729
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,680
That is the most ostentatious scrotum I have ever seen.

730
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,840
It's a little showy, okay?

731
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,080
Listen, did you bedazzle it?

732
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,880
What is that?

733
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,120
We're just 12 guys trying to sit around

734
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,640
and watch the pornography.

735
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,600
I don't need you showing off your Elton John disco ball scrotum.

736
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,240
Hey, get those googly eyes off there.

737
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,280
That's ridiculous.

738
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,360
Tyler, you have to leave.

739
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,320
Tyler, I'm trying to eat pizza and fucking pound it and I can't do it.

740
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,280
Oh, you've just given me a great idea

741
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,360
for like a survivor style reality show

742
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,520
about 12 dudes watching porn together.

743
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:39,760
Yeah.

744
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,520
Yeah, would you watch that show?

745
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:42,480
No.

746
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,760
Okay.

747
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,560
Not at all.

748
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,960
But you'd make a fortune off of it.

749
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,360
Oh, yeah.

750
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,920
Can we give these testes some utility?

751
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,720
Can we give them function, not form?

752
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,520
How about like a fanny pack for your balls?

753
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,120
They have those.

754
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,720
It's called being a transvestite.

755
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,080
Can we please come up with something other than that?

756
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,280
What about paperweight?

757
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,760
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

758
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,280
I'm not talking about something to hoist your gonads.

759
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,640
You're saying dip them in like metal

760
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,720
and then use them as paperweights.

761
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,160
So just bronze them.

762
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,600
No, no, no.

763
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,000
Griffin, why do you want to bronze his testicles?

764
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,040
I'm confused.

765
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,640
It seems like while that would make them

766
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,800
more attractive on one level,

767
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,520
I feel like it would be a little bit painful.

768
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,800
Yeah, it would not be pleasant.

769
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:43,200
I'm, could we, ooh, could we candles?

770
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,480
Can we turn them into candles?

771
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,680
Like candle dip them?

772
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,640
That wouldn't feel good.

773
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,440
That would never mind.

774
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:48,560
You know what?

775
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,440
Neither would bronzing.

776
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,480
Your ideas suck too.

777
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,840
Can you have them removed?

778
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,480
Can you have them moved?

779
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,280
Yeah.

780
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,280
Have them moved to a place in your body

781
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,880
that's a little more discreet.

782
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,080
How about on top?

783
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,480
Stop it.

784
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,760
Oh no.

785
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,200
Is that Gonzo down there?

786
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,280
He looks ridiculous.

787
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,640
Oh, that's so crazy because mine looks like Rolf.

788
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,160
Would you just put the balls up there

789
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,360
or the whole thing?

790
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,080
The whole kit and kaboom?

791
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,400
I don't know.

792
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,480
Is it possible to just turn the whole thing upside down?

793
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,760
That's what I'm wondering.

794
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,360
I don't want to do that.

795
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,240
Can we turn it sideways?

796
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,760
There's so many options.

797
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,880
But it looks quizzical.

798
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,520
Interesting.

799
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,240
It's like when you were a kid and you cocked your,

800
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,000
sorry for the word choice,

801
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,840
cocked your baseball hat to the side

802
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,520
to let people know that you were street.

803
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,800
Oh, you got rally balls.

804
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,040
Yeah.

805
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,200
Come on, Reds.

806
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,440
I turned my dick 35 degrees to the left for you.

807
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,280
Come on, Gomez.

808
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,520
Hit it.

809
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,480
Oh, shit.

810
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,640
Yahoo Answers user Nate responded to this question.

811
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,560
He said, I have a tattoo on mine.

812
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,160
It says, please hold with a telephone cord wrapped around it.

813
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,280
When I get really old, hopefully it'll say something else

814
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,240
in between the wrinkles.

815
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,200
I have a tattoo on my penis,

816
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,800
but that's a story for another day.

817
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,720
Believe it or not, believe it or not,

818
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,320
those are my only two tattoos.

819
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,000
You, if you have two tattoos in your genitals,

820
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,520
you are not so busy that you cannot finish answering a Yahoo answer.

821
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,480
Nobody's that, you're not that busy.

822
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,920
I'll catch you on Tuesday to tell you about my dick tat.

823
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,480
Tune in to the second part.

824
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,520
Click subscribe and you're going to get the second half.

825
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,720
Listen, a witty tattoo on your balls is maybe, maybe, maybe funny.

826
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,160
Like the first time,

827
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,560
and then after that, it's just like, yeah,

828
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,480
I still have writing on my balls.

829
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,680
I did not think this through.

830
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,680
Didn't think this through, but when I get older,

831
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,080
gonna get some wrinkles, gonna say all kinds of stuff.

832
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,520
Please kill me.

833
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,000
Please hold.

834
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,560
Please kill me.

835
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,560
Free me from this flesh prison.

836
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,760
Hello, brothers.

837
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,640
I'm the proud father of two sons, ages 10 and six.

838
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,320
Individually, they're great kids.

839
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,160
Together, however, they fight and bicker

840
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,920
during every waking second.

841
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,400
Do you have any advice on how I can get them to at least show brotherly kindness?

842
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,280
Rather than brotherly hurling harsh words

843
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,520
and clenched extremities at each other.

844
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,800
Perplexed progenitor in Indiana.

845
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,920
This is going to be trick.

846
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,240
Progenitor is what you meant to say.

847
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,360
How about a brotherly cage match?

848
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,320
Did I say progenitor?

849
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,120
You said progenitor.

850
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,600
Yeah.

851
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,640
Ugh, progenitor.

852
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,200
Sorry.

853
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,240
I don't know what happened to me.

854
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,760
This is going to be tough for us to answer,

855
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,080
because we were all very docile towards each other.

856
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,160
Not me and Justin.

857
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,040
Do you think maybe that's it?

858
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,240
Cause it was just two of them?

859
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,440
No, not three.

860
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,360
Once I came along, I was sort of the mediator.

861
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,040
I think that this age, I think 10 and six,

862
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,480
it's like a pack of wild dogs and they have to establish dominance.

863
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:54,960
Right.

864
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,920
Exactly.

865
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,520
Was that really important to you guys?

866
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,360
Yeah.

867
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,120
No, but I think that's what brothers do.

868
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,440
I think like there's a certain amount of, it seems,

869
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,360
here's what it is.

870
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,720
Oh, this is a great example.

871
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,960
Uh, with dogs, um, when dogs like snarl at each other

872
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,080
and like nip at each other,

873
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,400
and chase each other, if you don't know better,

874
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,320
you look at it and go, oh my God, they're fighting.

875
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,240
But in reality, that's how dogs interact with each other.

876
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,440
That's how they play.

877
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,880
So I think that this is just the way that boys of that age

878
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,800
are relating to each other.

879
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,080
By the time they're 15 and however old,

880
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,800
uh, 15 and 11 or 15 and 19, they're going to get along so well.

881
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,320
So you got all that shit out.

882
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:36,640
Sorry.

883
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,880
Do you just want this guy to live in like a waking,

884
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,480
screaming health the next five years?

885
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,560
Is that what you want? Well, what dad used to do

886
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,600
when Justin and I argued is he would like try to,

887
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,000
you know, step it up and say, I'm going to just,

888
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,200
I'm going to make you guys fight.

889
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,480
And then Justin and I would always stop and go,

890
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,520
God, that's ridiculous. Yeah.

891
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,680
That's for foster arguing.

892
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,280
Punch him right in the jaw.

893
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,400
Like, I don't want to.

894
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,960
Um, no, Sidney's mom, when Sidney and my wife,

895
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,080
Sidney and her sister Taylor,

896
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,760
when they would fight when they were little,

897
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,520
her mom came up with a game called pretend your sister's dead.

898
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,640
They would start fighting and she would drop that one on him.

899
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,640
And, and how it would pan out is Sidney would, uh,

900
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,160
start crying and she'd say, I'm sorry, Taylor.

901
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:20,480
I'm sorry.

902
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,480
We fought and Taylor would say, shut up.

903
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:22,960
You're dead.

904
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,400
So you never know how that's going to backfire,

905
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,800
but they're, uh, they worked it all out.

906
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,840
I think, um,

907
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,760
I think, um,

908
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,240
I think, um, I don't know.

909
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,960
I don't, I never fought with either of you guys.

910
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,720
I don't think maybe you're so little.

911
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,320
We were plotting behind your back.

912
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:44,640
Really?

913
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,720
I remember this one day where I was,

914
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,240
I was smarted off to Justin.

915
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,320
I wasn't doing my chores.

916
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,600
And I think that you were in charge.

917
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,160
I could panic.

918
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,720
The folks were away and you, you slapped me.

919
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,120
And then I was so upset by that.

920
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,400
And you were so upset by that.

921
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,640
And I think that was the only confrontation we ever had.

922
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,440
Except sometimes you would get angry

923
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,600
when I would throw a baseball bat at you.

924
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,880
You did throw a baseball bat at me,

925
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,520
but that was a, that was pure accidento.

926
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:09,760
Right?

927
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,920
No, that was a game we were playing.

928
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,880
That was taste my steel,

929
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,120
but like, I feel like it was pure accident.

930
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,000
And there was the time that you kind of swung Griffin around

931
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,120
and like hammer through him.

932
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,480
You did hammer through me like, like fucking trunchable.

933
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,040
But we've talked about taste my steel before, right?

934
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,920
Like, I don't think.

935
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,000
Let's do a quick recap in case we haven't.

936
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,600
Quick recap in case we haven't.

937
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,680
Taste my steel is a game that I invented with Griffin.

938
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,240
A real collaborative.

939
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,160
No Abner Doubleday and taste my steel.

940
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,200
It was a real collabo.

941
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,560
Basically, I had an aluminum baseball bat

942
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,480
and I would throw it at Griffin,

943
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,320
but he would know it was coming.

944
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:46,880
How would I know?

945
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,760
I would say, because I would shout taste my steel.

946
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,840
Yeah, throw the bat at him.

947
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,040
I was, I was very live though.

948
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,160
Yeah, wispy I would say.

949
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,720
I was wispy and I dodged it every time except the last time that we played it.

950
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,240
When you hit me, you hit me right in the eyeball.

951
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,560
I got the biggest, nastiest, shiniest anyone's ever gotten.

952
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,360
And then our mom was like, hey, don't play taste my steel anymore.

953
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,600
So maybe that's the solution.

954
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,320
Get your kids some weapons and let them work it out.

955
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,760
Or don't let the commish catch you.

956
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,800
Our mom was the commissioner of taste my steel.

957
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,400
She got it down single-handedly.

958
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:24,640
Yeah.

959
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,840
She was the steroids of taste my steel because she ruined the purity of the sport.

960
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,480
Travis was never allowed to play because he got caught juicing.

961
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,560
That's right.

962
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,120
He tried to up his taste average.

963
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,120
Up his vibrancy.

964
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,200
And I would have taken it and just made it violent.

965
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,160
I would have taken out the beauty of the sport.

966
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,640
Yeah, you would have made it less of a ranged game, more of a melee.

967
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,680
Okay, Griffin, let's have one more Yahoo Answers question.

968
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,280
I feel like that would go down real smooth if you got one.

969
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,800
Okay, how about, man, it's tricky.

970
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:09,440
Do you want a creepy one or do you want a more thought-provoking one?

971
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,440
You know I like to get creepy.

972
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,560
Yeah, give me the creepy one.

973
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,800
This one was sent in by Grace Russell.

974
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,360
Thank you, Grace.

975
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:24,320
It's by Yahoo Answers user HIUH who asks, I want to kiss Sarah Michelle Geller on the forehead.

976
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,040
How can I do it?

977
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,560
Who can help me with that?

978
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,480
Every night I'm going to bed, I'm kissing something thinking of kissing her in forehead.

979
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,440
I also dreamed kissing her in forehead.

980
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,160
If there is none, how can I get over that?

981
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,120
Why do I want it?

982
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,960
Oh, no.

983
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:47,280
No, he's actually being very mature because he's not just asking how he can gill about

984
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,160
kissing Sarah Michelle Geller right on her sweet forehead.

985
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,600
He wants to know how he can get over it if it truly is impossible, which so few things

986
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,320
in this world are.

987
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,400
This may be one you don't want to do.

988
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,520
You don't want to have to do battle.

989
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:07,120
I think you have a better chance of kissing Sarah Michelle Geller square on the lips than

990
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,440
you do on the forehead.

991
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,560
If someone came up to her and he said, I have a proposition for you.

992
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:17,280
I want to give you a kiss one of these two places, you think almost certainly would choose

993
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,080
the lips.

994
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,680
Yeah, not even a question.

995
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,720
Here's the thing, and I'm not condoning this action because it's wrong, but you could kiss

996
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,640
her on the forehead if you found her, but it would be the last thing you did of your

997
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,960
own free will for a while because you would go do it.

998
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,800
But how would you prosecute that?

999
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,640
Assault, Travis.

1000
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,280
That's assault.

1001
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,000
That is assault with kiss on the forehead.

1002
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,400
Are you that would be the greatest court case?

1003
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,080
Go around kissing anybody you want to.

1004
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,520
Is that no, I believe that it is illegal.

1005
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,800
I'm saying I want to know what the actual title of that crime is.

1006
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:56,480
One of my friends here in Austin was talking about this this sort of criminal that that

1007
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,440
plagued their school.

1008
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,680
I think it was a university, North Carolina, and they called him the campus cuddler.

1009
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,720
I can't tell if this is funny or horrifying.

1010
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,760
It's a little bit of both.

1011
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,360
And what he would do is he would go to the dorms and look for people who were like asleep

1012
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,320
in their dorms, who left their dorm door like open or unlocked.

1013
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:21,040
And he would cuddle with them until they woke up and like were being cuddled with by a fucking

1014
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:21,680
stranger.

1015
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,760
And then he would like rubble, rubble, hamburger his way out of the room.

1016
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,000
You know what's really important in that?

1017
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,800
The dismount.

1018
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,240
If you don't have a good rubble rubble or, you know, something similar.

1019
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,840
Hey, what are you dreaming about?

1020
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:44,160
Rubble, rubble, waka waka, waka waka play.

1021
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,360
What's the verdict on that?

1022
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,120
I think it's the scariest thing ever.

1023
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,200
Maybe we shouldn't joke about it because I think he was a student, which makes it less

1024
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,640
creepy if it was like a sociology professor.

1025
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,160
That would be mega creepy.

1026
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,960
If it's a psychology professor, it's an experiment.

1027
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,240
Yeah, it just has.

1028
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,480
I would say that that is really funny until it happens to you or someone you know.

1029
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,600
It's assault though.

1030
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,520
So what I'm saying is if you kiss Sarah Michelle Gellar on the forehead without her permission,

1031
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,880
folks, it's a crime.

1032
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,960
Folks, I don't know how many times we have to tell you this, it's a crime.

1033
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,720
And make sure that you get permission from her in writing.

1034
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,320
Yeah, I don't want to change her mind when you start slobbering on her noggin.

1035
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,320
Yeah, but if you do get the kiss on the forehead, make it count.

1036
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,840
Yeah, cause don't do a little peck.

1037
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,840
You need to be like a barnacle up in there.

1038
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,560
Give her a forehead hickey.

1039
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,920
Do not let go.

1040
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,120
Never let go.

1041
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,920
That's your peak.

1042
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,960
You're peaking right then.

1043
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,640
Smear some superglue on your lips and go to town.

1044
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,560
Do you want to do this so soon in your life?

1045
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,120
You know, it's all downhill after you do it.

1046
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,720
Oh, you're saying like he saves it up.

1047
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:53,760
Save it up?

1048
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,240
And like get permission from her and then just wait.

1049
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:56,800
Just wait.

1050
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,280
Say like, have her send you a coupon and then redeem it when it's appropriate for you.

1051
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,120
Oh, and then she dies in like a tragic accident and it's like the worst day ever.

1052
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,400
Why would you do that?

1053
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,120
I mean, I'm just saying.

1054
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,240
I'm saying take your, take your chances now.

1055
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,320
Kiss someone on the forehead now cause you never know when they're going to die in a tragic accident.

1056
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,920
Can we somehow capitalize on this?

1057
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:22,480
Can we put Sarah Michelle Geller on retainer and just sort of, um.

1058
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,160
Like the creepiest kissing booth ever.

1059
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:24,800
Yeah, sort of.

1060
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,000
Like for charity though.

1061
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,680
Oh yeah.

1062
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,480
I like it.

1063
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,920
Here's Sarah Michelle Geller, you have to pay, I think a hundred isn't unfair.

1064
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,840
Uh, pay a hundred dollars.

1065
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,000
I think she, I think she'll set the price point.

1066
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,680
I don't want to make that decision for her.

1067
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,480
Do you think maybe we could get like a sliver of it?

1068
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,960
And by which I mean the money and not like free Sarah Michelle SMG forehead kisses.

1069
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,600
Oh well, can we just say like we'll get paid however we choose?

1070
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,840
Because I don't, I mean not hypothetically.

1071
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,600
You want 10% with an option of 5% and five kisses.

1072
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:56,480
Yes.

1073
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,640
Well, not me, not me.

1074
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,520
I want to leave that option open in case one of us wants that.

1075
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,280
Wants to kiss her on the brow.

1076
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,640
Yeah, but not me.

1077
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,320
I feel like we could do that without our respective significant others getting angry about it

1078
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,920
because it's like for the story.

1079
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,720
Well, mine definitely listened.

1080
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,840
So I'm going to go ahead and lean on the side of I'll take the money.

1081
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,960
Yeah, I'll take the money too.

1082
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,460
Travis!

1083
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,680
I feel like, I feel like my significant other would get mad.

1084
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,760
Not because I kissed another girl, but because I kissed someone on the forehead.

1085
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,360
I think she would just be mad in principle.

1086
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,080
That's so personal.

1087
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:30,880
It's the worst.

1088
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,760
Is she your daughter?

1089
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,760
Because if not, get your lips off there.

1090
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,280
Hey, I want to hear Griffin's last question.

1091
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,640
First, thank you so much for listening to our show.

1092
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,800
This is my brother, my brother and me.

1093
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,720
You made time again.

1094
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,200
If you know someone who would like the show, please send them, send them MP3,

1095
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:53,120

1096
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,080
it's mbnbam.

1097
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,960
That helps us out a lot trying to spread the word.

1098
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,040
It seems like more people have been talking about it on Twitter,

1099
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,400
which is like infinitely exciting.

1100
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,880
And more people who are like, just started listening to mbnbam.

1101
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,640
Thanks for the recommendation, so and so.

1102
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,080
And we see those and we love them.

1103
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,680
When, and when, if you see someone say something like,

1104
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,600
maybe it's time to find out what this, my brother, my brother and me is all about,

1105
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,760
make sure you descend on them like jackals.

1106
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,480
Like, like, like a hawk, like a condom.

1107
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,880
And you gotta, and if someone asks, what's mbnbam?

1108
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,400
You gotta make sure to put that link in there.

00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,200
Yeah.

1110
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,000

00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:27,840
Just hyperlink it.

1112
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,360
Thanks to, we got a new fan, Bile Kojima, is there tweeting about the show.

Lyrical nuisance, always Amy H.

1114
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,680
Liquid paper cut.

1115
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,480
Eric the Wheeler.

1116
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,400
So many, so many people turning out to, to, to root us on.

1117
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,880

00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,120
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of their song.

1133
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,520
It's a departure of the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1134
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,960
It's our theme song.

1135
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,680
And you should listen to all the songs on that album,

1136
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,000
because they're all very good.

1137
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,400
And if you, if you get our show off of iTunes

1138
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,480
and you haven't been checking out MaximumFun.org lately,

1139
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,240

and write about this show on the thread.

1145
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,280
So just to, you know what it is there?

1146
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,520
It's just a, just a think tank.

1147
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,680
Just dig in.

1148
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,120
Get into the experience.

1149
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,560
Get in the synergy and stuff.

1150
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,200
Get in the synergy and stuff.

1151
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,040
Hey, we're talking about live shows.

1152
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:07,680
We hear you.

1153
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,440
Yeah, we're working on it.

1154
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,560
We're working on it, I promise.

1155
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,920
It's just hard because not everybody has shared the link to our sampler yet.

1156
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,480
It's really-

1157
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,440
Yeah, it's like-

1158
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,320
It's like, we don't want to do these shows

1159
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,440
and then nobody shows up because you didn't whore us, you know?

1160
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,280
Yeah, because you are failing us.

1161
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,080
You're failing us.

1162
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,640
And like, I don't want to put the blame on anybody,

1163
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,400
but I'm gonna put it on you if I have to.

1164
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,080
So yeah, feel bad and stuff, I guess.

1165
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,000
Quit letting me down, Devin.

1166
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,080
Devin?

1167
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,960
I have a friend named Devin and I used that name last show

1168
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,720
and he thought I was talking specifically to him.

1169
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,080
Oh, shit.

1170
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,880
So anyway, thanks, Griffin.

1171
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,000
You want that final question?

1172
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,800
Is that what you want?

1173
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,440
You know I do.
