1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:46,480
What's her bit? What's her thing? Christmas creep?

6
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:57,840
Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving... You still like that, huh?

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:07,680
It's Whack Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. Whack Friday is the day after Thanksgiving

8
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,720
when you go shopping for more weed. I guess that is pretty Whack. Yeah,

9
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,260
I mean they do the weed dealers all sort of get together to you know

10
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:25,540
The problem is whack Friday is sort of bled over into what I almost call it Thanksgiving, but that's a different holiday altogether

11
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:33,780
Is it I hear that they blend bled over into Thanksgiving and now they're doing all their deals then and it's like these weed dealers

12
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,260
Should be with their families disappointing them. Mm-hmm

13
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,460
Yeah, I think we started yeah, okay

14
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:47,020
Hold open that cold open. I'm Justin macro. I'm your oldest brother here. My brother my brother mean if I show from the modern era

15
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:53,760
I'm Travis macro. I'm your middle is brother. I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy coming to you hot and live and loud

16
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,880
Raw and real it's my brother my brother me

17
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,280
Thanksgiving is behind us. Whack Friday is behind us was also two days ago. Yes

18
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,060
Leon that creep now. It's wait what happens on Monday?

19
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,080
a moot moot moot ring Monday. No, that's nothing

20
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
Is there a thing that happens on Monday?

21
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,460
Yes, I bring it is it's it's when Monday is reboard

22
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:28,060
From the ashes of Monday. There's a new electronic Monday that has all the emotions of Monday

23
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,260
But new robotic parts, it's called cyber Monday. It's called cyber Monday is a liquefied

24
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,860
They called it liquefied the organic material that used to compose

25
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,060
Monday drank it for energy fuel and now it's turning it into I don't know like a fun robot dance or something

26
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:53,960
And now is this Monday more effective because it lacks like the the fear and hesitancy of human Monday

27
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,580
Cyber Monday is judge jury and executioner. Yeah

28
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:06,380
um, our only hope is our only hope is to send Thursday back in time to Sunday to try and kill it before it's

29
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:13,340
When it when its mom was pregnant with it Sunday is Monday's mom. Okay, you guys know who really hates cyber Mondays

30
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,700
I'm gonna

31
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,900
Garfield cyber Garfield absolutely hates. Yes

32
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,420
Crossover

33
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,460
Okay, I every every news story you see is

34
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,660
That everybody's shopping online now Amazon comm oh man

35
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:39,820
I read that I read that on the times the true North Pole. That's Amazon comm I went to the mall on Saturday

36
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:47,060
Everybody's still at the mall. I think they're gay on Amazon at the mall because everybody's still there

37
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,540
You can't get a job there to save your life. Everybody's still at the mall you joke

38
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,020
But even like ten years ago not ten eight year when whenever I worked at Best Buy

39
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,520
People would come in look at the thing and while standing there like holding in their hands be like, yeah

40
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,240
I do want to buy this they put it back pull out their smartphones and order it from Amazon to have it shipped to their

41
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,460
house

42
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,860
Amazon changed the game. They have a thing on their app where you literally like take a picture of the thing

43
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,860
Yeah, and Amazon's like, oh, yeah, I know what that is

44
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,920
Buy it for you. Oh, I got that way cheaper. I got this

45
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,100
Yeah, I doing that and I do not a small business here in Austin

46
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,740
They don't they won't allow it every time you do that Jeff Bezos like kicks in the door

47
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,480
It takes a dump right there on that small business floor

48
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,180
It's symbolic you're just opening the door for Jeff Bezos to come in and add insult to injury or

49
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,640
More specifically to add poop to the small business floor, but you think if he was trying to punish retailers

50
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,240
Jeff Bezos would pick a corporate location if only for a time-saving

51
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,000
Maneuver because the word would get out quick, right?

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,520
If Jeff Bezos took a dump in one Best Buy all the Best Buys would hear about that

53
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,600
But if he goes to Darren Steve's electronic world, he's gonna like he's got a long day ahead of him

54
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,920
But pooping a different electronic mom, but I know he's like Santa Claus but for a very bad gift

55
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,720
No, really that means put a lot of small businesses out of business now. They're just smalls

56
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:23,200
Do you think Elon Musk is trying to make all the rockets and stuff so he can make Santa Claus real

57
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:31,240
That's something that I've thought about a lot. Maybe his endgame is to make the dream of Santa Claus like a real thing on earth

58
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Start over

59
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,040
Musk it's doing like, you know space stuff

60
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:50,360
SpaceX guys. Elon Musk is not a not a perfume scent. Now. Elon Musk is like the boss of Tesco and

61
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,520
Tesla and not Tesco the British

62
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
but rather Tesla

63
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:03,140
And he's like into like SpaceX and all this kind of stuff. So my theory is that he's trying to make the dream

64
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,400
Claus

65
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,380
He's trying to become a true true Santa

66
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:14,860
That's TRU S a NTA for true Santa with his different electronics advancements

67
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:21,420
Elon Musk is trying to become true Santa and and actually like do the Santa thing in our

68
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:27,580
Life, that's why the hyperloop is exit. That's why SpaceX. That's why all electronic cars

69
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:34,460
That's why it's also important to him because he's going to make Santa real Justin. Can I say that theory 100% bulletproof?

70
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,340
Santa for real Elon Musk

71
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,200
Um, can I also say we're doing a night record, which we almost never do

72
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,820
Which opens up the possibility that Justin might be drunk

73
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,340
Everyone's Santa to be real

74
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,240
Elon Musk Elon Musk had his time where he's like I he took a

75
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,140
Long look at that deep dark shift from areas that I can make Batman real I can make Santa real

76
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:08,220
I could definitely get one of these done. Yeah, every rich person's doing Batman these days. Like that's

77
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,300
Is he gonna put on some weight

78
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,660
Seems important, huh?

79
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:21,420
like why why go through all the the trouble of inventing a rocket sleigh and a hyperloop and all that shit and

80
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,340
Like not seal the deal by putting on those Santa Claus with an E

81
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,520
Well, that's the thing Griffin is like the the horrible truth that he has to face is to do all this work and then realize

82
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,460
That really what he was doing is he was setting it up for the next person that this was not his it was not his

83
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,940
Place to become Santa. It was merely his place to facilitate

84
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,360
for the Santa is person

85
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:50,580
Welcome to my page for a new new web series the Santa is person fuck web series. We can get this on cable

86
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,700
Are you kidding me this reality show of casting Santa starring your host Elon Musk?

87
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:01,420
I just feel like in this cyber world we need to move faster than we can with traditional media and this needs to be like

88
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,580
a minute-by-minute live stream update

89
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,660
Like yeah, like it's more like you're just watching this the different Santa's compete

90
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:16,480
24-7 until last man standing. I'm just saying the traditional more traditional advertising models are still the most profitable. So

91
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,120
It's me, okay, listen salary this is a good show

92
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,840
There's a salary on the line of 1 million dollars a year. Okay, and

93
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,400
One day of work

94
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,840
Yeah, I know who's gonna cheer me or something like that. I got a I got a yule coming up

95
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,360
So he's got a Elon Musk's got to find the truth Santa to your USA NTA

96
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
True Santa and

97
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
Can we go ahead and put our seal on that

98
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,800
True. Yeah, I don't think my obscure channel acceptable TV reference is gonna be a very good title for that

99
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
So we're gonna go a true Santa

100
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
And it's Elon Musk

101
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,440
Find the man with or woman with the true or in between it doesn't matter

102
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,360
the gender is not as specific to the Santa myth will all compete for the

103
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,720
Right to become the true Santa and Justin one one. Are you ready?

104
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,800
When we get to season five, we enter robots into the equation

105
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,000
Only one season because he said to forever Santa Claus

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,800
He will see or they as Tim Allen has proven that no one gets to be Santa forever

107
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,480
Is it did they do a Santa Claus for starring somebody else? I?

108
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,440
Mean not yet. Okay, so you're just full of horse apples that it sounds like well

109
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,400
But there was another Santa before him Griffin. It's not like he was Santa Claus and it's oh shit. It's an aura Boris

110
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,040
Yeah, he was the Santa he pushed off the roof

111
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,240
What would be some of the challenges on?

112
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,080
Elon Musk's bowl full of jelliness. That's past right? I want we need active like a race or something

113
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,620
Oh who's like who can fit the most kids on their knees at one time?

114
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,040
Yeah, mm-hmm kid based stealth is definitely gonna be like up there

115
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,960
reindeer

116
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:05,320
Like reindeer acquaintance like how how how compatible are you with rocket reindeer? Yeah

117
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,400
I mean the only test that's gonna matter right is

118
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,520
Can you even ride in the rocket sleigh without just liquefying? Oh

119
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Like is it more of like a g-force?

120
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,780
You know NASA kind of thing like reindeers won't be part of the equation if he could if

121
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,120
Elon Musk could have like figured out the reindeer

122
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,540
Conundrum like he would have had this sorted a long time ago right reindeer aren't part of it. It's hyperloop. It's Tesla

123
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,860
It's maybe PayPal to a certain extent

124
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:43,020
Paypal is works in here. You're saying true Santa once they get going so in the show

125
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,220
The secret is they hit out they Santa for real

126
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,700
He hits up LA or she hits up LA or they hit up LA they hit up LA done did that what that take?

127
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:58,620
Oh god, two and a half hours. Oh my god. That's I'm way behind schedule to the hyperloop hyperloop, San Francisco

128
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,400
Let's hit you all up. Oh my god, the Sun's coming up and then rocket from San Francisco

129
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:09,980
Well, you have to use the are in dr. X Rockets and that is that that's the reindeer X Rockets

130
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,740
I'm trying to incorporate the mythos into the I love this. Yes

131
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,260
Yeah, you got to incorporate the old with the new baby

132
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,300
That's what this is all about in this ever-changing world in which we live in

133
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:29,420
Okay, like and then like in a shitty like modern Wizard of Oz they would call the teleporter like this is the wizard

134
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:36,140
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, like oh just hop on the twister. That's not what we're calling it Steve like that

135
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:44,300
Should we do some advice? Yeah, what the fuck is this show? Yeah. What is this show about? Are we doing it?

136
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,860
Here's good news 13 minutes

137
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:54,300
down the toity my friends got married in Vegas a few months ago and are having a party because their families are forcing them to

138
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,780
Celebrate the nuptials they insist on not getting them a gift, but all my other friends are getting them gifts

139
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,980
Anyway, should I honor their requests or should I just get them a gift so I don't look like a cheapskate?

140
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,220
That's from giftless in the Great Lakes State

141
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:16,100
You know what notice I mean I'm gonna notice and you have a perfect excuse for not doing it

142
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,140
I did I there are I'm not gonna say they don't notice people getting a gift some say they won't notice

143
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,500
Someone not getting them again. Well, you know what the big hiccup is here the real like when people get married

144
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,860
There's a reason you register for shit

145
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:35,540
So people don't all get you like six blenders when you already own a blender like so this like I get these people

146
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,220
We're like we already have too much stuff like when we did ours

147
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:43,860
We mostly were like, please just like give money to our like honey fun so we can pay for our honeymoon

148
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,580
So maybe what you want to do is like a gift card that says like hey

149
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,620
I care about you use this whenever you want to get whatever you want

150
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:58,500
I think a gift quite like rarely do I advocate to the gift card because again, I said it all well

151
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,500
The gift card says I couldn't think I don't know you well enough to have gotten you something myself

152
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,700
But here you go

153
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,100
But I feel like this is the perfect opportunity to say like hey, I didn't get you something

154
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,860
I got you the opportunity for you to get you something. I don't enjoy gift card gifts

155
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,420
No, I feel like they're giving me a chore

156
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,940
They every gift card should say hey bad news. You've got a good

157
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,060
It should come

158
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,680
gift each gift card should come floating in a

159
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,900
single size serving like a water balloon full of gasoline and for me it would I would need diesel and

160
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,220
It I would have that and they'd be like this is you pop this in your tank

161
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:44,740
You explode this right in your tank and you get the amount of fuel that you need to drive to Lowe's and back

162
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,020
He will spin the gift card floating inside the diesel at Lowe's now

163
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,580
They're gonna smell the gift card and they are not gonna want to take it

164
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,340
Also, the paint's gonna come completely off of it because diesel she's a she's a hungry fluid

165
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,100
You have not given me a gift card to Sears

166
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:06,180
What you've given me is a year of buying things at other stores and then on the drive home thinking

167
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,780
Ah, damn, I should have got this at Sears. I got that gift card and everything

168
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,300
I should have gotten this at Sears

169
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,020
but

170
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:19,740
They've also gotten you the joy of when you open a drawer and you find that gift card and you find that it hasn't expired

171
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:26,060
And not a pirate's booty. Well, yeah the feeling of potential that arises off of a non-expired but forgotten gift card

172
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,980
He's like, oh my god, I could do anything with this. Well, yeah

173
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:36,620
but never done this done the move where you find an unexpired gift card and you think you do the all right, bud

174
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,380
You're coming with me. Let's do this and it goes in the wallet like a prominent place

175
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:48,740
So I I'm definitely gonna get to an AMC theater very very in the very near future. You're top slot here friend

176
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,860
Your perseverance has paid off Lowe's gift card my faves when you roll it to Lowe's you're like, ooh

177
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,940
I have a gift card. I mean, I'm gonna buy this drill and you buy it like sir

178
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,100
There's only 71 cents left on this gift card. You're like, I

179
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:10,500
Know what don't look like I'm made out of 71 cents a bunch of them do it do it. Take it

180
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,140
The guy behind you who

181
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:21,540
Guy behind you who is made of several pennies a couple of nickels is what's wrong with being?

182
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:27,500
Made of 71 cents and then the Skittles logo comes up and that's the end of the commercial

183
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,380
Running off the rails this yahoo was sent in by

184
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:41,660
Brooks Oglesby, thank you Brooks. It's by yahoo answers user John who asks

185
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,580
Recurring nightmare. I am on a Nickelodeon game show. I have a recurring nightmare

186
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:54,700
I am on a children's game show like you can't do that on television or guts or legends of the hidden temple

187
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:01,060
I always lose and sometimes drown in the green slime parentheses GAC. Thanks shithead

188
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:09,580
Was that stuff called I am NOT a child but all the other contestants are I have been having these streams about five times a

189
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,660
Week for three months. I feel pretty happy in my life

190
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,460
So I'm not sure why I should be having these dreams

191
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:21,180
They children are very mean and mocking and usually cheat to team up even with my adult strength and size

192
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:27,220
They win looking for some interpretations or advice on how to not have these dreams anymore. I'm sick of them

193
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:35,260
Was you can't do that on television a game show? Yeah, I don't think there was a competitive. There was not a competitive

194
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:42,900
No, and I'm sorry and just another point of order as long as we're getting pedantic GAC and slime are two different things

195
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,420
Yeah, slime is not GAC and GAC is not slime. GAC was a much more

196
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,540
Non-Newtonian. Yeah. No if you drop that shit on a child if you drop like a big bucket of GAC

197
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,760
They might actually die because it's a slower child

198
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,440
Probably couldn't dig their way out of that of that hearty thick cream

199
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:07,060
Yeah, but but but slime I think was just like water and flour and like yeah

200
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,860
and what

201
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:21,740
Sorry, Justin. They dumped GAC on Rosie O'Donnell. They dunked slime on Rosie O'Donnell annually at the Kids Choice Awards

202
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,440
You're telling me that you're telling me that Rosie O'Donnell walked away

203
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:29,020
she strolled back down that red carpet back to her limo at the end of each night smelling like

204
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:35,180
Nickelodeon slime farts and then agreed to come back the next year and then would come back next year. She liked it

205
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:42,480
What I'm saying is the farts were in it. Now, here's my question if you guys could get every night

206
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:50,380
Virtually transported to the set of your favorite Nickelodeon game show and the only price you had to pay was some gentle mocking from children

207
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:57,100
Wouldn't that be worth it? I would love I would love to be transported the set of Double Dare for example. Let's do this

208
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,920
What was your what's your favorite? It's not favorite. It's not favorite. It can't just be favorite

209
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,680
It has to be which one you think you would own bones at and for me, it's Legends of the Hidden Temple

210
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:12,020
Because that show was about a big statue face. It would be like the princesses chambers had three statues

211
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,000
How many statues to the princesses chamber have in it?

212
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,300
Yes, Jiffy two. No, not two

213
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm a giant face cleft from stone. You should really be listening to what I'm saying

214
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,200
What else are you paying attention? What could possibly be more interesting in the room than me?

215
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,800
Yeah

216
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,720
Have you noticed that phenomena if you watch old Nick game shows?

217
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,880
About half the kids do seem pretty distracted a lot of the time like oh, yeah. Yeah

218
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,800
I uh, I do think it's a legit fear though because I bet that

219
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,920
You did not get very good

220
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:58,040
Explanations of the rules like think about how well you understood like so I have to dig between the two giant waffles and

221
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,360
Find a yeah

222
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Yeah, exactly that's exactly it

223
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,680
From a Christmas story just kicking you back down the slide. Yeah

224
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,300
Go find the flags. That's why half the time on legends

225
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,480
At the very end the big stone face is like, all right

226
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,880
You're gonna go through the jungle kick over the third tombstone climb down under that tombstone jump in the second

227
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,640
Hole you want to climb that rope and then turn right and then you're gonna press a button to open up the secret door

228
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,720
To the shrine of the silver monkey

229
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,400
And then you're gonna put that shit together backwards in reverse order and then go back the way you came but turn left at the jungle

230
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,500
And finally you'll find yourself in the scarabs hiding place

231
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,400
You got all that go nuts and they forget room one they get to the jungle like well fuck that was way too much too

232
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:49,000
fast I would bet money that at every recording of legends of the hidden temple a shadowy figure like slughorn from

233
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,500
a

234
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:56,480
Willy Wonka would like sneak into the kids dressing room and be like I'll give you a hundred dollars if you forget how to put

235
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,040
Together a monkey because like what are the odds that like every kid comes in and is like wait, where'd the feet go?

236
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,040
God, yeah shit

237
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:13,740
Like they they had to be doing like I don't even know that $100 is gonna spin so good. Yeah way better than a Casio keyboard

238
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:20,620
Maybe this is happening all over if you were a contestant on the bozo super sunday show a slug

239
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:27,100
We're type figure entered your dressing room said hey listen if you take a big chokeski throwing a ping-pong ball into the first bucket

240
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,140
I'll give you 20 bucks. You're not gonna make it to the end anyway. What do you want that for?

241
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,780
Mr. Slughorn can I ask why why?

242
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,160
Why do you want us to perform poorly in bozos games?

243
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:46,340
because every time a kid does well it extends the length of the show and the cubbies are on later and I want to make

244
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,980
Sure, I don't miss any of the game

245
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,920
You're saying the bozo super clown show was of a variable length and the same could be said of legend long

246
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,100
Spiffin you're out Spiffin you're not in this one. Sorry, but you know

247
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,980
Why are all these voices that ghost of Christmas passed from Scrooged?

248
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:11,300
I do you not think that there was like there have been like bozos is a I

249
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,620
Agree with you that bozo is a face length

250
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,980
But you know what's pretty rad is if you think about how long that show ran there was probably a few days like listen guys

251
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:25,500
We have seven minutes until the Cubs game starts, and we have nothing we have nothing planned

252
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,060
You just have to go out there and clown or something of pies

253
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:35,660
Who has is it some without cards? I don't I haven't I haven't done that since college you can do this bozo

254
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:42,900
Oh look at this kids. I'm making a pile of whipped cream on the floor, and then oh oh oh oh oh

255
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,660
Oops, I stepped in it oops stepped in the whipped cream

256
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,100
Floor and we're out. Thanks for watching everybody

257
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,580
He comes back and somebody drapes like a cape and like a thing of roses over his shoulders

258
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,300
And he's like I didn't know I could clown like that. I feel alive

259
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,400
Maybe I'll kiss my wife for the first time in ten years

260
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,180
What if you did tune in to bozo and it was like?

261
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:14,020
253 and you just saw a man in a cloud costume just strutting in a circle singing this is McClellan song

262
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:20,820
Come on a clowning walk with me your favorite clown bozo seven minutes of that watch

263
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:27,900
How watch the silly way that a clown ties his shoes rip rip rip over and over?

264
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,980
Somebody have a TV guide that I could read out loud

265
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:43,620
Reads another question yarn spinner. I'm a college student who is house hunting for the first time in my life

266
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:50,100
Previously my parents chose which apartment I lived in but now the rains are in the hands of my roommates

267
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:55,980
And I fortunately find in a house or apartment that's closed to campus and within our budget is a lot more difficult than we were

268
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:04,060
Expecting any tips for house hunting in a city with an extremely overvalued housing market almost homeless in Austin. Oh

269
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,020
Austin is expensive, isn't it Griffin? I mean, it's not just expensive

270
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,580
It's it's like Hunger Games style competitiveness to get that we lost the house that we got

271
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,860
The house we got we were the backup offer on and they beat the shit out of us

272
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,900
And it's not I say beat the shit out of us. The only rule of that game is

273
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,220
Write a bigger number than the other people

274
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,740
But boy, howdy did they dunk did we get dunked on?

275
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,140
But hey, it all worked out in the end. It's rough man. I can't imagine doing that as a student

276
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,540
Is it rough renting to is renting is back

277
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:43,660
Oh, yeah, dog when we the house we moved to this house from the house. We were renting before we owned this house

278
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,460
we were one of

279
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,660
11

280
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:53,700
Applicants that they were considering and we had to like sit down and meet them and then you know, we wrote them a letter

281
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,940
that was

282
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:00,980
There were that I made a tasteful new drawing of myself and attach that and just said whatever you want

283
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,220
And that helped her hurt it. I mean we've got the place didn't we? Well, I

284
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:12,100
can say we just finished house hunting here in Los Angeles where it is also quite expensive to live and

285
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:19,940
I I mean we had to go look at like 30 different places in two weeks and every place we went to there was like

286
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,200
Eight other people looking at it at the same time we were

287
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,660
And and the key is like just if you like it apply right away

288
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,340
Like just get you know get your name in there as soon as you can, you know

289
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:38,260
Check out as many places that you can like have a variable budget that helps a lot if you can like don't say

290
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:44,620
Yeah, you gotta keep in mind. Hi, you know, yeah by those how high you gotta liquidate the correct assets

291
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,020
You got to keep in mind that there's a billion other people like you who are doing the same thing

292
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,540
and if you think of the mindset of just like how can I

293
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:56,000
Get around those people or beat those people like maybe you go a little bit just a little bit outside the bubble

294
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,540
It's a little bit outside where you're comfortable doing and you'll find like a really really nice spot or you get on Craigslist

295
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:07,200
you refresh that shit every 30 seconds and you email the people when the place you want goes up like instantly and maybe

296
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,320
a

297
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,200
Drawing and a noodle doodle. What about this? Yes, maybe

298
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,640
Expand your concept of what constitutes a house in quote-unquote. Okay

299
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,480
To be continued, it's Perry white

300
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,880
So maybe an affordable cave or parking structure or someone else's garage, yeah

301
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:40,240
Um, yeah, it's many pizza boxes many pizza boxes. I mean, what's your what should I put down?

302
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,360
I want to invite you to our wedding. We're getting married in February very excited about it. What's your address?

303
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,000
Oh, just write many pizza boxes on an envelope and then give it to a bird a

304
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,000
Bird, huh? Yeah, just a secret to the bees any bird will do cuz they'll smell these boxes

305
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,840
We did not we were not diligent about cleansing them of sauces and like the de-cheese

306
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,640
Solution that we bought at the family dollar was not as effective as it

307
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,960
Super good. In fact, it just added a sort of bird attractive scent that is

308
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,560
Implaceable we have contacted Ralph Nader and the Better Business Bureau and the Better Business Brewery man

309
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
They whip up a fresh IPA

310
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:28,040
In all seriousness know what really helps is pick pick a pick a neighborhood because things are getting a little bit

311
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,360
Funny pick a neighborhood that you want and just drive around and look for for rent signs

312
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,020
Because if you go through a service or a website or something

313
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:43,240
You want to catch something that comes on the market quick like maybe just like you like predator like predator

314
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,040
Let Justin let Justin make jokes. He's bored of his question. Let Justin make jokes

315
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,040
Go ahead Justin

316
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,240
Catch something on the market and then I just said like a predator like catch

317
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,540
Like to catch a predator

318
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,320
Okay, see isn't that better?

319
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,360
Aren't we all happier now

320
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:14,120
I mean except for like the three people that were trying to buy a house in Austin and we're taking furious notes

321
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,360
But other than them, I think everyone's doing very well

322
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,940
Shoot us an email if you want to know my realtor

323
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,640
She's a she's a man. She's a beast. She she tore shit apart. She's a bear

324
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,960
She's actually a living bear and not a dead bear. Should we go to the money zone?

325
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah, we've certainly earned it this time. You say that half the time people obviously are consuming our product week in week out

326
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,560
even if it's

327
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
Climbed into your fucking

328
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,640
X

329
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:51,600
careening jet of a question and try to pull up pull up pull up my third in some catch a predator jokes

330
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Just try keep this shit float

331
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,880
Yeah, sorry, I said sorry my metaphors got mixed maybe if I had some more money

332
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:14,680
I wouldn't be so distracted. My metaphors would be more on point C male confidence confidence competence

333
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,880
We got a new sponsor to kick things off this week it's club

334
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,000
W so let me tell you this works. It's a it is a wine club

335
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,160
That's what the W will get together. They complain about stuff. It's better than that

336
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,000
There's no interacting with other people who like wine

337
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,000
You just go to club w.com and answer six simple questions and then they've got an algorithm

338
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,960
That creates a palette profile just for you now and then they send the wine directly to your door perfectly customized to match your taste

339
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,960
Here's the neat thing about that. Like yeah, I went through this process

340
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,680
They don't it's it's kind of pointless for me who doesn't know a lot about wine to say, you know

341
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,360
I want a pinot noir. I want a pinot grige or I want some Chardonnay. I don't know what I want

342
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,360
I have no earthly idea

343
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,880
Their questionnaire asks you things that you actually do have like a reference point for stuff like like how do you take your coffee?

344
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,080
Do you know do you like it creamy or do you like it black or you know?

345
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,120
Do you like what kind of fruit pies do you enjoy that kind of thing? Have you ever killed just for the fun of it?

346
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,420
Yeah, have you ever killed just for the fun of it?

347
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:26,120
What and then it has some fun money Python joke references like that whole land speed of a swallow thing that's in there, too

348
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,960
It's great a little bit everything

349
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,000
That's not but it it is questions that you might actually have a reference point for even if you don't drink a lot of wine

350
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,800
They are leading the grape to glass wine revolution

351
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,040
And that is a fancy way of saying that they actually work with people who are making wine and they don't have a mill

352
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,840
Man, it's just like get it from those people and then they bring it to you the labels look cool

353
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,640
what I like best about it is that the

354
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,640
Wine comes with an informational card that explains to you sort of like grapes are in it where it's from

355
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:01,160
Flavor profile that kind of thing so you can read the card and then if you have a party with people over you can hide

356
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:06,040
The card and just seem really smart about the wine and not just that let me say it like this sounds like one of those

357
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,800
Like super expensive of the month clubs, right where you're like

358
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,380
Oh, I'd love to do a steak over the month club or whatever and then it's like $50 a steak

359
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:20,060
This is like so reasonably like if I may if I can let you in on a secret that you would find by going to the

360
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,620
Website it's like $13 a bottle

361
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,420
They have a no risk 100% guarantee that they'll love what you send you if you don't love it

362
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:33,100
They'll make it right. So don't even don't even trip on it right now Club W is offering in BMA limit centers

It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet. How do you react?

Oh, no, sure. Well, okay. Good news. Travis is an Android Justin is not. Oh

That's gonna smell good and a cool travel kit to hold everything that's gonna taste good. Probably

379
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:57,820
Yeah, come on. You don't don't eat the travel kit. This is not us. I don't hate it. God. No, don't eat it

404
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,540
What's the end game there? Well, it's a secret that you share with your lover

412
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,680
Guess my question is what is an Android knee with underpants? Like what do you got to hide down there?

413
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,120
You're by your bed. Oh, no, it's smooth, but they're so comfortable. Don't worry about my genitals, right?

414
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,920
You don't have but you don't have them. You just got a little battery pack or something

415
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:50,240
I mean we have like a big dog though. Oh boy. Oh, no

416
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,120
Pack a pack of a default down there

417
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,080
We also have a couple personal spots here. I would like to talk about before we talk about my smooth genitalia. No

418
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,880
They're shaped like a dick

419
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,840
It's so it could be shaped like a dick and feel smooth. All right, stop and read these questions

420
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,760
Who is this message for Andrew Johnson? Who is this message from? It's from I think it's for everybody

421
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,080
Well, it's from Eleanor Haskin, but we'll say it's for everybody like the duct-tape bandit

422
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,560
You've stolen my heart between the Mothman Festival and Disney World

423
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,740
I guess we fell in love but I still know no one could wish you a better birthday than your favorite brothers

424
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,200
Yeah, that was some tight-ass West Virginia lore

425
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:37,320
Have we talked about shit? I forgot about the duct-tape. Yeah, we talked about Casey Kazee and his perfect crime

426
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,920
No, I was thinking of the Sticky Bandit. I was way off. No duct-tape bandit was Casey Kazee

427
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,240
He conducted the world's only perfect crime. Look it up. Google it

428
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
To this day. Nobody knows his name

429
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:56,540
Yeah, I know his name because I was him for Halloween and that was a good slash bad hurtful costume hurtful to my face

430
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,440
Duct-tape wise and we have another personal message. This one is for Matt always alone Jones

431
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,640
Oh, and it's from Sophie well-fit Johnson

432
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,520
You wished me. Happy birthday. Well, I'm about two months late for yours, but baby, I'm late

433
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:20,080
I'm not pregnant out obviously sex is involved but poo poo poo. I'm drunk. I can't really afford this

434
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:29,300
Can't wait to see you in November. Whoops. I hope you're less hideous than when last I saw you hashtag drunk purchase

435
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,280
Yes

436
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,040
We should have this is fucking all time

437
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:42,800
There should be standard. We should have some sort some sort of a breathalyzer or something

438
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:49,840
They're going to oh man. I know we're turning on jumbotrons folks some sort of confirmation email

439
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:55,540
They're just driving their car less than a like whoa, this person sounds drunk. Whoever this was. I sure feel bad for them

440
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,160
Oh, no, it's me. Ah, man. That's damn it

441
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,040
Definitely ballin

442
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,680
I was I was about to say like yeah

443
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,780
We should make you like a tattoo parlor where you come in you can't get a tattoo if you're drunk except she

444
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,920
Used words on our show. So it's like she gave us a drunk tattoo

445
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,960
That's true. They make us say that the words

446
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:23,120
Amazing. What if it was a tattoo parlor that where you came in drunk and then the tattoo artist had to give themselves whatever tattoo

447
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:29,980
You came up with can't do a Popeye, but just the bottom half what okay?

448
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,200
Do Popeye, but he's fighting a dragon and the dragon is my mother

449
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,620
Yeah, but she's got Popeye's face

450
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,440
It's like what?

451
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,080
Pop out on the aisle no

452
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:53,000
I'll get it underneath it in block letters

453
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,760
But spell it Pearl Jam and with Sanskrit

454
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
I've sobered up by this

455
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,600
I listen. I'm dead sober now, but I still I I've been playing this tattoo for months

456
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,880
And it's for you again. Just to restate again. I've looked at I've been

457
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:27,160
I've been scoping your body out for months trying to think of the perfect tattoo and I think what we've landed on which is

458
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,800
Popeye's bottom half fighting a dragon shaped like my mother and then underneath that in Sanskrit radio had spelled Pearl Jam

459
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,280
I think that we've really split

460
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,280
Price

461
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,640
Let's be honest we live in a world with too much media you need a podcast on the front lines figuring out

You guys want Yahoo?

468
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,800
Yes

469
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,920
No

470
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,600
This Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Rosin formerly Rachel Sperling the name done changed

471
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:28,280
But the game still recognizes the game and it's still a gerund. I think she deserves a new moniker like game changer

472
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,480
game changers fine, but I still like

473
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,720
Game but recognize I still think she wants the game recognized. Oh

474
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:41,480
Game changer recognize get no game recognize game changer too much too much too much. Mm-hmm

475
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,360
It ain't there. It ain't broke. Don't don't fix it Rachel Rosen game recognized game

476
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,100
It's by Yahoo answers user Turtha who asks

477
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,240
How do I make something look like an old man was saying it

478
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:01,280
What I am writing. I am writing a web novel. There is an old man there. I want to make his dialogues

479
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,920
To seem like an old man was saying it

480
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:10,300
Give me some suggestions on how to tweak general dialogues to make it seem like an old man was saying them

481
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,440
So it's nano rhyme Oh for the next when this comes out

482
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:31,440
14 hours How do you write a book I don't read a lot of books I mainly just you know play Bloodborne all day

483
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,480
So like in a book if there's an old man in a book and I know there's not a lot

484
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,440
How do you power that the writers of the book make it like when you're reading it?

485
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,440
How do the writers make it like when you're reading it? You'd be like doll. That's an old person saying that well

486
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:53,040
I know okay. So the one thing I know about old people speak old speak. Yeah is they talk real slow, right?

487
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:59,000
They talk like they got nowhere to be so maybe one word per page. That's two

488
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,680
That's probably I'm gonna go and separate their publisher probably won't approve that just because price-wise. How about one word per line?

489
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,960
Is better meet me in the middle

490
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,440
Two words per page two words per page, I guess would be meeting you in the middle

491
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,240
All right, all right. I feel like I won this negotiation shit

492
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,540
How do you make it look like an old man was saying it can you make the can you make the pages?

493
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:31,960
Where the old man has dialogue in it smell like an older man nice

494
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,040
So the book like old man in the sea

495
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,360
They would not even put down in library shelves anymore or they put it in a special room

496
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,440
That was you know hermetically sealed

497
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,680
Be wait because it smells like an old man and the sea well

498
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,800
No, it only smell like an old man, but I imagine there'd be a lot of books that are like old man

499
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,800
Just all over them

500
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:02,040
Most Dickens books I imagine would be like, oh welcome to the Dickens room. Yeah, it's it smells like the Dickens. Oh, man

501
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,840
Yeah, it's not great

502
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,640
It's not great. You just shot like a tiny

503
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:13,680
Spider webs between the double L's and the double R's and stuff. Oh, I like that

504
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,080
What about coming so you make the words in the shape of an old man?

505
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,220
It's gonna take some doing yeah

506
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:30,760
Like those greeting cards that play music and just every time you open to a page where it has old man dialogue on it that

507
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:36,400
Auto plays like just a general moan from an old man. Like you open you turn to page 61 and it's just like

508
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,640
And then you know

509
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,360
Make you write a program perhaps in Q basic or some other sort of software

510
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:50,160
Where every five words it would just insert open bracket cough close bracket just every five words

511
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,000
So just insert a cough in there because he's coughing. He's old that works for me

512
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,200
Um and the webs thing too. What about like just all in caps?

513
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:08,040
Lie for that. Well, he's an angry old. It's specific to an angry. Yeah, but I mean even when older folks get angry

514
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,440
They're still older and they're like throats don't work as good. So they what about all in caps with a smaller font? That's

515
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:19,680
Working for me gonna lose a little bit of that spiderweb effect though. I think I think I'm really just sort of stuck on

516
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,680
this idea stinky books gang

517
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,680
I

518
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,600
Introduce that

519
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,920
The problem is I've seen I feel like it's a slippery slope

520
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,320
Okay

521
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:34,560
Where do you stop when you do like the Sun also rises and you turn to a page and it smells like a bullfight

522
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,560
Right. Like where do you stop? Where is that? Where do you draw the line? Where's the line drawn for stinky books?

523
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:44,200
I need to back up for me because for the first time in literally 13 years

524
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:50,260
I actually wanted to read a book what you just described for me is a sensory experience that I would love to have

525
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,600
Yeah, we're talking about 4d books fellas

526
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,600
This is it. This is the fourth. This is dance for smell. Yeah, this is our little mention of smell

527
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,000
Listen, I saw page master when I was a little kid and those books came to life. It's probably talking on it. What's that?

528
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,320
That's well

529
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,520
No, the movie didn't have it. It was not a for you didn't see it in sense around

530
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,080
No, you're getting no all both of you are getting confused about a lot of things

531
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:23,200
I saw page master. I was a little boy and I was like, I want that whoopee Goldberg becomes a romance novel or some shit

532
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,920
That's not how that movie happened. I don't think there was a romance all the characters like yeah

533
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,240
Yeah, necromancer did to watch the movie

534
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:42,600
Anyway, I've never had an experience like that where a book came to life and took me with it to somewhere away from the library

535
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,160
And my mom came back was like, where did Griffin go?

536
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,080
Books took him away again. Yeah, damn it

537
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,700
I want that though, and I feel like smells gonna get me there

538
00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:00,200
Yeah, it's like a my my fucking eyes and brain and reading comprehension certainly have not done it yet

539
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,440
Let's get my nose in the mix

540
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,540
That would be a rough temptation though

541
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:10,040
Like if you're if you're an author who's cranking out a lot of books like you're Stephen King's or whatever

542
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,240
You there would be a temptation to maybe lean on this new technology a bit like listen

543
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,640
I don't know how I don't know how to spice this story up. We're just gonna look the smells take it from here

544
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,880
Get yeah, get our best smell guy on this one

545
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,960
See if he could punch it up a bit cuz I got nothing. I got no closer

546
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:32,800
I got no act three got no day tomorrow rising action. You're putting in too much effort into it in authoring new works

547
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:39,400
I'm saying we return no classics. I mean he's with this for deed Charlie in a chocolate factory. Hey, what's up? Hey, what's up?

548
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,040
That I think when Roald Dahl wrote that shit. He was like mmm. This is gonna be perfect

549
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,040
sticky boy

550
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:51,880
With me like you wrote that a fever dream waiting for 4d technology and here I am

551
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,240
But Griffin what about like you're so excited because you get to like your favorite book three musketeers

552
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:02,840
You get to read it in 4d for the first time you open. I'm like, oh shit everything in France and England

553
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,860
So why are you only thinking about the fat stuff sticky boy?

554
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:13,060
Come with me to my book of pure candy smell tasting

555
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:20,740
This whole book smells like Oompa Loompas you're thinking of the worst part of it chocolate boy

556
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,060
Come to town

557
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:26,180
Smell my book and then take it to daddy

558
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,340
What really sad thing is that Roald Dahl thought this technology already existed

559
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,780
So every time he'd watch him and read one of his books for the first time

560
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:40,460
He just sort of raised his eyebrows expectation every few pages like tell me about the stars very road

561
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:44,020
Your book is a masterpiece. You don't even fucking get it yet

562
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:50,780
You're not even reading it right yet. Live in it. I've been wondering why all the Roald Dahl books

563
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:57,740
I have have a smell disk sleeve in the right near the jacket. Apparently. He's just future-proofing them

564
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,220
Sticky boy, that's

565
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:06,820
Yeah, that's gonna be caught my head. That fakes all you came up with.

566
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:11,740
Yeah, I like we can move on to another question, but it like while we talk about like, you know

567
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,860
Somebody's shitty roommate or something

568
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:18,260
I'm just gonna be thinking of how this 4d technology could completely change the landscape of book technology

569
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,460
if you not I don't I don't want to put the I don't want to

570
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:27,620
Muddy the waters by talking about this in movies, but for some reason I'm always like

571
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:33,020
I had a really intense fear of the scene in Wonka where

572
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,380
Gene Wilder gets really angry at me. Yeah

573
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,020
Well, it feels that way doesn't it and

574
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:46,900
I always get this really intense fear about that scene and I just wanted to mention that like I'm glad this technology doesn't exist for

575
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,420
that because I bet that kid between like

576
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:56,980
angry heavily acting Gene Wilder and some old suits that they definitely rented from like a

577
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:03,380
Funeral parlor or something and like the sets and all the like candy that he has like under his fingernails and stuff

578
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,740
I bet there was like some intense smell

579
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,660
Action going on for young Charlie Bucket that day

580
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:12,740
I did not have to put too much energy into crafting a performance

581
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,780
I doubt Charlie Bucket was a was a shower a day kid

582
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,780
Yeah

583
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:24,740
Joe has just climbed out of his bed of filth for the first his bed of filth and by the way lies

584
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,260
He's been fine this whole time. Yeah

585
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,860
About the lies. I know he absolutely can't

586
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,500
Okay, but like and he smells bad

587
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,420
I do want to say you're talking about 4d Charlie and

588
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:42,020
the scene you brought up was the scene where Gene Wilder gets mad at some children in a tunnel and not a scene where a

589
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:48,580
Little boy and an old man burp on each other for 45 minutes. I don't want to talk about that stank

590
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,500
Yeah, he's a nightmare I hate his guts

591
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:12,540
I wish he would have gotten chopped up in that fan

592
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,780
When he left I

593
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:21,740
Guaranteed grandma Josephine and the two other old people in the same bed were like we can all agree

594
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:27,220
We hate him the least right like we're so fucking glad he's gone. Yeah, I hope he dies in a fan

595
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,380
Dolls original title for Charlie chocolate factory was sad cabbage boy prays for death

596
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,140
It's the original thing. He wanted to call it

597
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,980
Sad cabbage boys candy contest

598
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,420
Asterix to fix this in editing

599
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,700
No to self think of better title

It's kind of like going to the barber shop if your barber knew all about the first season of the show elf

707
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:51,200
It's like a 90-minute massage where the masseuse is two people talking to each other with a third person

708
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:56,640
It's like the monsters of metal tour only quieter. No music and just talking
