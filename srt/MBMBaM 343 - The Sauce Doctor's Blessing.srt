1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:48,160
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, the podcast.

6
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,000
My name is Justin McElroy. Ring, ring, ring, ring. Sorry, let me get that. Yes, hello. Uh-huh.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,280
Uh-huh. I would love to, Marty, but I'm busy recording a podcast. Yeah? Okay. Okay. Sorry.

8
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,240
This is your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. And this is your baby brother,

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,520
Griffin McElroy. Hey, guys, what are we doing here? What? What is this? Oh, sorry. I just got

10
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,960
a call from Marty Scorsese. Do you know? Oh, Marty. Do you know his work? He was just calling.

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,160
He wants to direct a gritty, like McElroy Brothers-based movie with a lot of intrigue

12
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:32,720
and betrayal. A lot of drug use. I was confused because me and legendary director Martin Scorsese,

13
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,000
and over my hours of hanging out with him, I did learn the proper right way to say his name.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,960
I just call him El Scorcho. Thank you for correcting that pronunciation,

15
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,320
because suddenly that makes so much more sense as to why when you're ribbing him about some of his

16
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,080
badder movies, why you call him Martin Scorcheasy. It makes so much more sense to me now. Thank you.

17
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,760
Yeah. So me and Scor- I had Scorcho on the phone the other day. He's like,

18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,000
Departed 2, are you in? And I was like, what's it all about? He's like, get this, Martin Sheen,

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,040
he's back. He's super dyed in the- Yeah, no, he's back. And this time, you're his little brother.

20
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,480
I don't even understand how chronologically, don't doubt the Scorch, he said to me, yelled it even.

21
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,000
Ring, ring, ring, ring. Hello? Jerry. Okay. Yeah, it's J-Man.

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:29,040
Yeah. These pretzels are making me thirsty. Okay. Great. Yeah. Yeah, just send him on over. Bye.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,560
Who was that, Justin? So that was Jerry Seinfeld. He watched the first episode of our TV show,

24
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,560
and he is actually sending me all his Emmys in shame, he said. Oh, wow. He's embarrassed of his

25
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,880
TV show, and he doesn't want the Emmys anymore, and he's sending them to me. That is both nice

26
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:54,560
and humble of him. That's really sweet of him. He doesn't deserve them. He saw our comedy show,

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,560
and he says, oh, that's how you do it. I don't deserve all these. I don't deserve all these

28
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,200
Emmys. I'm going to give them back. Oh, hey, hold on one second. Oh, wow, a real phone ringtone.

29
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:12,560
Hold on. Hello? Hey, Joe. How's it going? Do you want to... Oh, today? I'm a little bit...

30
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,280
We could do lunch today. Pasta... You want to go to Pasta Garden?

31
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,200
I think it's Olive Garden. The name of the restaurant is Olive Garden, not Pasta Garden.

32
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,760
There's not a restaurant called Pasta Garden in Austin. That would be crazy if there's a

33
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,240
restaurant called Pasta Garden. You get that, right? It's Olive Garden. Okay, fine. I'll meet

34
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:42,400
you at the Pasta Garden. 1230? Fine. Okay, bye. That was Joe Pantaleano. He's in Austin,

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,560
and he was insistent the restaurant was called Pasta Garden. I didn't know what to tell him.

36
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,280
Jelly Pants.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,440
Griffin, I'm sorry. That was so rude of me. I left the sound on, but I actually got a text

38
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,440
in the middle of that call from the Oscars committee, and they said that they were

39
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,920
retroactively giving me Leonardo DiCaprio's Oscar. They were going to take it away from him

40
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,440
for his Bear movie, and they're going to give it to me now so he still doesn't have an Oscar

41
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,280
anymore. The Bear Challenger, I believe was the title of it. From Bear Man. The Bear Man movie.

42
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,000
From Leo's ill-fated gritty Yogi Bear reboot.

43
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:29,920
I love fame. It's so good. Let's just say it. I love this stuff, man.

44
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:36,480
I can't get enough. I wish we weren't still under contract to do a thousand podcast episodes,

45
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,680
or I would just quit doing this show and focus on being famous all the time.

46
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,040
I mean, this podcast has been, I think, about as successful as the medium can get. Has it ever

47
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,520
secured me one ticket to paradise, by which I mean a 1230 lunch reservation at Pasta Garden with my

48
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,720
good friend Joe Pantaleano? No. Only television got me there. Only television got me across that

49
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,680
beautiful finish line.

50
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,640
There's just so much power that comes from being on a streaming internet comedy show.

51
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,200
You know what I mean? You don't get that from podcasts. You got to get on the old media,

52
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,960
like streaming internet comedy.

53
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
Has it changed things, though?

54
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,840
Has it changed things? That's what everybody's wanting to know.

55
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,120
That's a problem.

56
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,720
I'm recording this laying down on my polar bear skin rug, but I've always done that,

57
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,240
so that's not new.

58
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,800
It's like when Michael Jordan was playing basketball, wherever he did it before,

59
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:36,000
he did it, and then he did it, and people were like, whoa, and he was like, things have changed.

60
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,400
You know what I mean? He was the best basketball player, and as soon as people were crazy about

61
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,880
number 23, he was just like, things have changed for me, I think.

62
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,640
That's actually what most people-

63
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,120
Oh, shit.

64
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,120
Sorry, guys. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Hold on. MJ.

65
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,640
Oh, it's actually him.

66
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:06,880
Oh, yeah, dial him in. MJ. Hey. You want me to take... Oh, so I would be 23.

67
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,080
Oh, wow.

68
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,280
Okay, and the... Wow.

69
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,240
It's the call, Travis.

70
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,480
And, okay, so I'll be 23, and you're just going to give me all of your basketballs.

71
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,040
Oh, okay. I mean, just from the one episode, don't you want to wait to see the rest of the...

72
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:29,280
Okay. And, oh, yeah. Oh, well, the cover of Bad. So I'll be on the cover of all the copies of Bad

73
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,360
that they sell from now on, and you'll get stickers to put my face on.

74
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,280
Okay, so it's all MJs.

75
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,320
Okay.

76
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,120
Seems like it.

77
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,240
Whoa. Mahalia Jackson, you're on here to... Wow. Okay, so you're going to give me

78
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,480
your Grammys as well. So I'll be on the cover of Bad, I'll own Neverland Ranch,

79
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,480
I get all the basketballs, and I'm number 23. Just from the one ep... You guys don't want to wait to...

80
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,320
Okay. Sure. Yeah, for sure. Okay, thank you so much. That means a lot. Thanks.

81
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,280
Yeah, these pretzels are making me thirsty too. Yeah. Love that shit. Okay, bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

82
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,440
Wow, Juice, that sounded like a pretty big call.

83
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,600
Just a lot of MJs giving me their honors and their awards and their recognitions.

84
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,440
Well, congratulations for all your... Ah, fucking shit. Hold on one second.

85
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,520
Hey, Bryce? I can't today, Bryce. I'm sorry. Bye. This is my friend, Bryce.

86
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,040
He wanted to get lunch, but obviously I'm spoken for, so...

87
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,680
This has never been more important that we help people.

88
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Oh, sorry. Just one more call. Sorry. Yes, hello? Joseph Gordon Biden.

89
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:58,800
Oh, no. A life debt? Uh-huh. Follow me to the ends of the earth? Uh-huh. Like a Belvedere situation?

90
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:08,400
Okay. Can you start tomorrow? Cool. Cool, cool, cool. All right. I'll have Debra send over the

91
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,280
address. I'll see you then. Okay. Bye. Guys, you'll never believe who it was.

92
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,160
I can't guess. It was Barack Obama.

93
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,320
Whoa, weird. Okay.

94
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,440
Doing a character?

95
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,720
Yeah, he was using his nom de plume, Joseph Gordon Biden.

96
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:35,760
All right. I think it's time that we reveal that these have all been pranks that we have done so

97
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,480
far. Basically, everything you've heard up to this point, except my fucking rude friend,

98
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,600
Bryce calling me, somehow piercing through the do not disturb that I have said on my phone.

99
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,280
I don't know how you hacked into my shit to get the phone call through, but all the other stuff

100
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:56,560
has been just pranks, and we don't know these people. We hope you enjoyed all the

101
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,680
stuff we've done so far.

102
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,760
We would never do something like that on the TV show. We really save our really fully formed

103
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,280
great gags for our new medium of television.

104
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,760
Should we do... Please watch our TV show. It comes out on Thursday on CSO. Go get CSO on

105
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,360
whatever set top box you got. Go to CSO.com and check it out on Thursday.

106
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,680
And if you want to and you haven't yet, we have an episode of the show up now. You can see it on

107
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:34,960
YouTube. I put a link to it on McElroyShows.com, and you can watch a full episode now wherever

108
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,720
you are. So go enjoy that.

109
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,680
Sorry, by the way, sorry that the one that we put out has spiders in it. Apparently,

110
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,000
for some people, that's challenging. I've heard it's a challenging thing for some people. A lot

111
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,040
of people are not very pleased about that, and I am sorry for that.

112
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,280
It is the only episode with spiders in it, though. I can guarantee that.

113
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,080
Yes. Let's hit... Can we do some fucking advice, please?

114
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,400
My husband calls petting the dog, rubbing the dog's fur. How can I make him stop?

115
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,360
That's from Dogs Deserve Dignity in Michigan.

116
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,280
I don't know that this is like a full meaty question. So much as I just want to say to

117
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:24,960
the question asker's husband, I respect you. This idea of... This was probably one time

118
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,320
you meant to say, I'm going to go pet the dog, and you couldn't think of the word pet,

119
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,360
and you said, I'm going to go rub the dog's fur, and you fucking committed to it. And you're like,

120
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:40,560
this is me now. I'm a man who pets dogs, I rub dogs fur from now on. That's me for life.

121
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,880
I have to say, I think that the question asker said they call themselves Dogs Deserve Dignity

122
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,440
in Michigan. I would argue that this is a much more dignified way of referring to the practice.

123
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,200
Because by saying you're petting the dog, what you're saying inherently is like,

124
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,440
I'm petting my possession, I'm owning my possession, which is a pet.

125
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,200
I'm massaging my friend.

126
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,680
My friend has fur, just happens to have fur, and I'm rubbing it with my hand,

127
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,480
which is an equal appendage to a paw. We are all on equal playing field here.

128
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,160
I am going to go interact with the dog in an adult, consensual way.

129
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,680
I'm going to massage my friend's hairy body in a way that we will both enjoy very much.

130
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,600
And when you say it like that, it could be anyone at that point, you know what I mean?

131
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,360
That's not patronizing to the dog. I'm going to go rub my friend's hairy body. That's universal.

132
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm feeding my friend some table trash, and I know some do not approve, but this is a personal

133
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,200
relationship between my friend and I, where I feed him trash from the table.

134
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,160
I'm watching my friend defecate in my yard.

135
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,200
My friend looks hungry, so I'm going to serve them up a tall bowl of stink cereal.

136
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,600
I'm just going to tie this rope around my friend's neck and walk him down the street.

137
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,280
It's for my friend, though, because he'll see a car and he'll be murdered by the car, by a person.

138
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,480
So the rope is for my friend.

139
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,760
Hi, thanks for seeing me on such short notice. I need you to express my friend's anal glands,

140
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,080
and I need you to express my friend's anal glands, and I need you to express my friend's

141
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:29,120
anal glands, and I need you to express my friend's anal glands, and I need you to do it in a mature,

142
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,000
consensual way, because it's too yucky for me personally, because we're friends,

143
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,360
and it would be overstepping the line.

144
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,720
And please don't make eye contact with my friend while you do it. He hates that.

145
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:47,040
My friend ate my fucking car keys, and so I'm not really sure what to do about that.

146
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,160
I was rubbing his hairy body, and I looked down, and my dang keys were gone.

147
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,160
Do you guys want a Yahoo? This is good. Just keep doing this. You're fine.

148
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,840
This one was sent in by Aaron Keys. Thank you, Aaron. It's by Yahoo Answers user AGLU, who asks,

149
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,200
should it be illegal to steal someone's kill on Call of Duty?

150
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,920
So I've just been playing some Call of Duty Black Ops 2 when this kid kept stealing my kills.

151
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,960
It was the same person over and over. Every time I went in for a kill,

152
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,920
this kid just ran in and took it. 11 assists I got. They should have been kills.

153
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,600
So I think you should be put in prison for stealing someone's kills in an FPS.

154
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,640
Remind me, which one is the Call of Duties?

155
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,120
It's the one with the soldier men, but they have future guns.

156
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,600
Gotcha. You know, the irony here is that it's illegal to steal someone's kill in a video game,

157
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,840
but in real life, if you're about to kill someone and somebody else kills them first,

158
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,240
that's suddenly illegal. You're now legal. You're off the hook.

159
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,880
Yeah, you're good to go.

160
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,680
Because you didn't actually do the kill, you know what I mean? It's ironic if you think about it.

161
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:05,600
But if you want to get all the, I don't know, duty points that you can use to buy new

162
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:15,120
weed emblems, weed skins for your gun to turn your character into just a big three-dimensional

163
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:23,680
sort of ganja guy, you can buy him for 3000 duty bucks, you're going to need to get those kills.

164
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,560
And this child is coming in and really just griefing him. And so can I put the kid in jail?

165
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,160
Actual jail, too. This person is talking about real-world physical

166
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,160
jail, not just Call of Duty jail.

167
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,840
No, this is interesting, Travis. You've just given...

168
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,200
Justin and I work in the video games industry.

169
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,960
So we know the people to talk to to make things happen.

170
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,320
We know the people to talk to to get these sorts of ideas going because

171
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,320
I think there should be a jail for every game. And not like you get banned and you can't play

172
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,040
the game. I think if you do too much bad stuff, maybe not stealing somebody's kill, but if you

173
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:10,240
call somebody mini epithets, then the next time you log in, your weed-shaped soldier man is just

174
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,320
in a cage. And there's a little timer there that's like one month, he's in the cage.

175
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,680
Like real time?

176
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,120
Real time one month.

177
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,120
Yeah, real time one month. And you can walk around in the cage and try to find a way out,

178
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,600
but there is no way out. You're in the cage.

179
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,440
Is there an opportunity, Griffin, there for a time off for good behavior thing

180
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,520
where they bring other people to the cage that you can talk to and say,

181
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:37,760
let me tell you why I'm in here and you shouldn't make fun of people online and be mean to them.

182
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,760
And maybe that shaves some time off of your sentence.

183
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:47,200
When you log on, the cage is also filled with orphans and there is a book there in the cage.

184
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,320
So if you read to them stories, read them The Lion, The Witch, The Wardrobe or whatever,

185
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,400
you can shave some time off your sentence.

186
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,000
And the orphans are real time.

187
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,040
You gotta really read it.

188
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,480
Real time, real orphans.

189
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,360
Plug in your microphone. I know. Dig it out. Gotta read orphans.

190
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,760
Listen, I have some advice for you, question asker.

191
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,120
Get good.

192
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,760
Oh yeah.

193
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,560
Just close the murder deal.

194
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:14,800
Yeah.

195
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:23,760
You opened the store of murdering and you didn't stick around to close up for the day.

196
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,840
There's probably a better metaphor there, but get good.

197
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,800
Yeah.

198
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,600
Scrub, just get good. Just close the deal.

199
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,080
If you would have given them one right in the old brain box,

200
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,560
they wouldn't have time to get stolen.

201
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,200
You know what I mean?

202
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,240
Can't steal a headshot.

203
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,760
Can't steal a noscope.

204
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,080
May I pitch a zag?

205
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,320
Yeah, sure.

206
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Should we all get fucking MLG pro level Call of Duty gamers?

207
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,880
No, no, no.

208
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,320
Start a clan or something?

209
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,600
Question asker follows this kill stealer around and steals their kill stealings.

210
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,160
Like you have a sniper rifle right over their shoulder as they're pointing a sniper rifle.

211
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,960
They can't see you because they're looking down their sniper rifle and it's like,

212
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,400
oh, he's about, and I stole his kill steal.

213
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,200
Stole it back.

214
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,280
I'm the Robin Hood of Call of Duty.

215
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,680
Sort of.

216
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,680
Yeah, I steal the kill from the kill stealer.

217
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,400
Steal, fuck, got away from me.

218
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,400
What if everybody just waits for everybody else to initiate the fight?

219
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,600
There's only kill stealing and then nobody starts it.

220
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,760
It's like, oh, it's reservoir dogs.

221
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,680
Why don't we talk it out, you know?

222
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,440
Like maybe we just talk through it.

223
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,000
Whatever's going on between the red guys and the blue guys.

224
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,440
Maybe we just figure it out.

225
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,320
I like that.

226
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,320
It's like, hey, rather than kill stealing, let's just sit down and rap about this beef.

227
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,000
Let's wrap this beef up and sell it.

228
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,200
Check this out.

229
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,520
New Call of Duty game comes out next month

230
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,160
because I'm pretty sure them shits are coming out on a monthly basis now.

231
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,520
You pick it up.

232
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,960
You get it together with your friends.

233
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,480
You get all your stuff together.

234
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,360
You're four loco.

235
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,400
It's a time for a night full of shooting and hooting.

236
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,720
And you go in and you play a met round and you do okay.

237
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,840
You get like six kills.

238
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840
Your friend Benny gets 14.

239
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,640
You're like, damn, Benny.

240
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,760
He's like, I just have it.

241
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,480
I just have it.

242
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,000
And then the match ends.

243
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,880
You're like, time to rack up my duty bucks and see how well I did.

244
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,680
And you and all of your teammates and everybody you played against are all in small jail cells.

245
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,520
And there's just like, I think there's just a guy that comes and walks through the jail,

246
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,400
like the warden.

247
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,160
And he's just like, what were you guys doing in there?

248
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,200
You can't just kill.

249
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,520
You can't just shoot and kill and hurt.

250
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,480
So what did you do?

251
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,280
Six kills?

252
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,600
That's fucking 14 to life.

253
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,680
So that's pretty, that's not great.

254
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,240
Benny.

255
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,200
Oh my God.

256
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Benny actually come with me.

257
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:49,600
Benny, it's, we save this for only the most brutal monsters that rear their heads in this game.

258
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,440
But you need to come with me now, Benny.

259
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,360
Maybe you follow after this person steals your kill.

260
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,840
Just get right up in their face and scream.

261
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,560
What did you do?

262
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,360
That was a living person.

263
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,680
Yeah.

264
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,560
You can't just snuff.

265
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,000
I was just trying to scare him.

266
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,960
You can't just snuff out a human life like that, you animal.

267
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,680
And then follow them around for the rest of the game shouting that kind of thing.

268
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:09,920
Yeah.

269
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,560
Yeah.

270
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,800
That's going to hurt their KD for sure.

271
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,080
Or at least hurt their feelings.

272
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,720
It's going to hurt their KD lying.

273
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,960
Read another one.

274
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,800
I work at a software company and we have a communal kitchen with shared dishes.

275
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,360
During the other day, during lunch the other day, sorry.

276
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,120
I caught a coworker lifting a plate to his face and licking it clean.

277
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,720
I had a full on panic attack in my head as I watched in horror as he continued unabated

278
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,280
in his quest to get every morsel of sauce off a plate that I could very well be using tomorrow.

279
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,440
My question is this.

280
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,640
Are you hiring because now I need a new job?

281
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,200
And that's from Clean Plate Club in Atlanta, Georgia.

282
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,560
Holy shit.

283
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,520
No, no.

284
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,120
Yes.

285
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,360
No.

286
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:57,920
What?

287
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,320
No.

288
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,600
What, Griffin?

289
00:19:59,600 --> 00:19:59,920
What?

290
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,280
How could you?

291
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,360
I feel betrayed by you, Griffin.

292
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,000
Okay, fine.

293
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,360
But if you go to a fucking nice restaurant and you and you see how I did the accent there.

294
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,840
That's how you know how nice this restaurant was.

295
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,040
And you fucking get yourself a fucking etouffee.

296
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,920
Play the gumbo.

297
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,640
Gumbo.

298
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,480
Get yourself an etouffee.

299
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:28,240
And you finish the etouffee but you don't want to waste the good hard work done by the sauce doctor.

300
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,080
Then you fucking lick it all up good and then guess what?

301
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,600
You're going to put it in like a hot, steamy, soapy box.

302
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,000
And then all of your tongue stuff is just going to be gone in the soapy box.

303
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,440
Griffin, this person did not go to the Cajun kitchen.

304
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,560
This person fucking microwaved a Stover's lasagna and like-

305
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,040
You don't know that.

306
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,520
You don't know that.

307
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,240
You don't know that.

308
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,960
You don't know that.

309
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,440
You don't know that.

310
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,800
I do know that because they were in the break room at work.

311
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,800
Like, this was not-

312
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,280
Okay, even so, Griffin, are you telling me it is your belief

313
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:09,200
that this work break room has a functioning sanitizing dishwasher in it

314
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,120
and not just a sink that people lazily rinse dishes in

315
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120
and then immediately put back in the cabinet?

316
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,440
I don't know.

317
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,800
There's a lot of variables here.

318
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:26,800
But even if it was just you run hot soapy water over it, their tongue stuff is gone.

319
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,840
How are you guys this upset about this?

320
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,840
Because I know, Griffin.

321
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,000
And even worse, I sort of know.

322
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,720
Because if all the plates look the same, they're all bad now.

323
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,120
They're all-

324
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,840
What are you going to do?

325
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,520
You're going to fucking walk up to them and grab the plate

326
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,960
and fucking shatter it on the floor and be like,

327
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,240
I hope you enjoyed the sauce doctor's good work, but now-

328
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,740
Yes.

329
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,540
Okay.

330
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,200
We're glossing over the point that this is unacceptable workplace behavior.

331
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,880
There is also that.

332
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,000
You can't watch someone do that and then like,

333
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,720
I guess we're teaming up on the new project for the boss together.

334
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,360
And also I just watched you lick a plate clean like my friend who is a dog.

335
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,360
Like my hair friend.

336
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,560
Like my hairy friend.

337
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,280
So guys, close your eyes and just think of,

338
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:24,080
have you ever had something where the good stuff wasn't immediately fork accessible

339
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,080
and you had to go hair friend on the plate to get to receive the sauce doctor's blessing?

340
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,400
Then you mop it up with a bread, buddy, Griffin.

341
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:32,800
Crusty bread.

342
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,240
A nice crusty bread.

343
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,720
Okay.

344
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,640
So they just have sauce bread.

345
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:36,960
They have like a bowl of-

346
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,560
You plan ahead, Griffin.

347
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,320
You have to plan ahead.

348
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,120
If you know that you got a good sauce from the sauce doctor,

349
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,480
you got to bring a crusty bread, buddy, and plan the fuck ahead.

350
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,080
You can't just fucking like live in the moment and lick it clean.

351
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,120
Could you bring crusty bread to this person?

352
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,760
Say hey.

353
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,960
I use this.

354
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,040
I saw you licking the plate like a toddler.

355
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,960
Would you maybe enjoy a baguette?

356
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,440
For next time.

357
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,800
Can I maybe interest you in this for next time forever?

358
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,840
And also, can you go back and find the plates that you've ever licked in your life

359
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,440
and shatter them, please?

360
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,160
The only place that this is okay, work behavior.

361
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,680
This is all right work behavior.

362
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,520
If you work at someplace like Pixar,

363
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,320
where everything is just a little bit more cash, you know?

364
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,880
Everybody's just razor scootering around

365
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,760
and they've made their cubicles look like tiki huts.

366
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,920
And like, you know, they've got a ping pong table in the break room.

367
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,480
Okay.

368
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,120
Lick it clean.

369
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,360
Fine.

370
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,960
We're all in Hawaiian shirts anyways.

371
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,560
It's all higgledy-piggledy up in the air.

372
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,320
You nervously walk into John Lasseter's office

373
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,480
and he's, I don't know, he's in there eating himself a good plate of gumbo.

374
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,800
And you're like, hey, I've got a good pitch for a movie.

375
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,320
And he's like, oh, just one second.

376
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,000
And then he licks the plate clean because he's John Lasseter and he can do whatever.

377
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,400
It takes 15 minutes in complete silence.

378
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,040
Complete silence.

379
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,720
And he leaves one little scrap of the sauce doctor's blessing right there.

380
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,520
He's like, what?

381
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
Oh, yeah, it sounds good.

382
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,640
What are you talking about?

383
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,800
It's cats, but they are firefighters.

384
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,320
Yeah, sure, what the fuck ever.

385
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,720
We did airplanes as firefighters, so I don't see why not.

386
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,680
Anyway, come on over here.

387
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,680
And I guess if you want me to green light this,

388
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,240
why don't you get up on this sauce doctor's blessing with your dog tongue?

389
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,560
What did you say to me, John?

390
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,360
Lick this up with your doggy tongue

391
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,040
if you want me to make your cat firefighter movie.

392
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,920
You're a good hairy boy.

393
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,000
Why don't you lick the sauce doctor's blessing from this terrain?

394
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,000
But it's a trick.

395
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,120
It's a trick test.

396
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,240
You go over there, lick it.

397
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,240
But before you do, you realize that he has licked the sauce, the remaining sauce,

398
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,800
into the perfect shape of the next Nemo-esque hit character.

399
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,400
We're like, sauce boy.

400
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,800
And then that's all over bed spreads and lunch boxes.

401
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,160
Sauce boy everywhere.

402
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,320
Because he's John fucking Lasseter and he's a genius.

403
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,560
And you slurp up the sauce doctor's blessing right off this plate.

404
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,000
And John says, I could never make a movie with such a nasty boy.

405
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,520
And then he drives off in the bumper car he's been sitting in the whole time.

406
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,120
And he snapchatted you with doing it.

407
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,520
And he put it on his snapchat so now everybody's seeing it.

408
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,160
And you're ruined.

409
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,660
Damn it.

410
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,560
Got me again, John?

411
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,960
You'll put that on the gram, huh?

412
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,720
You make such, you make great movies, John.

413
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,400
But your Machiavellian plots in the workplace, they need to stop.

414
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,640
Hey, and also, John, for future reference, John, you kind of just fired me.

415
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:22,960
Yeah.

416
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,400
You're the boss of the thing.

417
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,560
Like, if you didn't like my work, please just fire me next time, John.

418
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:30,960
Oh, shit.

419
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,360
Sorry, guys.

420
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,400
Hold on one second.

421
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,120
It's OK.

422
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,620
Hello?

423
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,400
Oh, it's really John Lasseter.

424
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,320
Oh, you hacked our Skype call the whole, you were listening the whole time?

425
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,280
You do want to make the Cat Firefighter movie starring me and, OK.

426
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,680
I have a friend, Joe Panigliano, he's great.

427
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,480
He was in the Matrix.

428
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,680
Do you think we could get him?

429
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:56,320
We can get him in as Taz, Tabby, we'll figure out the name later, John.

430
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,360
But yeah, I'm very excited about this.

431
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,080
The Tabby Cabby.

432
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,880
The Tabby Cabby.

433
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,360
Pitch that.

434
00:25:59,360 --> 00:25:59,840
Tabby Cabby?

435
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,520
He drives, sorry, what was that, Travis?

436
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,600
Give me a, Travis, I'm on the fucking phone with John Lasseter.

437
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,160
Give it to me now.

438
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,120
He's a tabby who drives a cab.

439
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,800
Tabby Cabby, he's in a cab and he drives around?

440
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,760
He's in a cab and he drives around?

441
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,960
I'm off the, I'm off the project.

442
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,460
OK, bye.

443
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,360
Damn it, Travis.

444
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,000
That was my one fucking chance.

445
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,360
We'll pitch it to DreamWorks, Griffin.

446
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,800
We'll pitch it to DreamWorks.

447
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,720
Sorry, guys.

448
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,280
Hold on one second.

449
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,240
Hold on one second, everybody.

450
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,180
Taz?

451
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,880
The real Taz?

452
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,840
Tasmanian Devil?

453
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,360
Oh, it's the cartoon Taz.

454
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,200
Justin, could you, could you put it on speaker so we can hear both sides?

455
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,160
Just put it on speaker quick.

456
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,720
I want to hear him.

457
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Yeah, let me put it on speaker, hold on.

458
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,280
Well, that's uncalled for.

459
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,780
Yeah.

460
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,840
I wouldn't say we stole any of your jokes for the show.

461
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,560
When you and I were.

462
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,160
OK, well, that's, I mean, that's, that's racist.

463
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,400
You know, you know that that's.

464
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,320
No, I want to work this out with you, too.

465
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,080
Yeah, OK.

466
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,120
Let's find something.

467
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,600
How about instead of a protracted legal battle,

468
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,680
you and I find something that we can work together on soon?

469
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,960
Justin, Justin, Justin, pitch him.

470
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,960
Well, that sounds pretty good.

471
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,160
Whoa, whoa.

472
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,660
Whoa.

473
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,720
Thank you for calming down.

474
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,920
First off, thank you.

475
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,880
Travis, did you have something you want me to add to Tasmanian Devil?

476
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,000
Pitch him the cat firefighter movie with the tabby cabby.

477
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,800
Yeah, tabby cabby.

478
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,680
Give him tabby cabby.

479
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,240
Hey, I had a project where, you know, Lassie?

480
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
John Lasseter.

481
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,800
Yeah, Lassie.

482
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,920
So here's the pitch.

483
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:41,760
Tabby cabby is a cat that drives a cab and.

484
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,040
Reel him in, reel him in.

485
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,240
You know, there's an arc.

486
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:52,720
Of course, he goes to China and there's lots.

487
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,680
Give him the name.

488
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,520

505
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,640
Can I tell you all about a thing that's very important?

506
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,800
Very close to me, literally.

507
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,600

Basically, my whole collection now is me undies.

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,040
Zag, zag, zag, trying to lose a few LBs, but mostly just stay healthy.

541
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,280

542

and you know, you see that bag of chips or like a thing of cookies and you just start eating.

543
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,040
And when you're done, you don't feel good.

544
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,280

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,280
Um, which it, which it is, but it's also like the big, can you imagine if we did adventure

578
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,160
zone and there were 12 fucking people on the call each week?

579
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,240
This is so many adventurers.

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,280
It's a hell of a thing.

We're crossing time, planes, and storylines to congratulate you on officially becoming

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,760
a doctor of dungeoneering.

583

Dr. John.

590
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,200
Dr. John from, from one, um, from one DM to the other.

591
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,960
Although again, like, this is a Herculean effort that you've done here.

592
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,920
Cause maybe they're doing, I've done this before where I had like a D and D league where

593
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,440
we had like 10 people and we would swap in whoever was available that night.

594
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
So we didn't have to like wait.

595
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,640
And then like we would just level people up accordingly when they would step in.

596
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,120
That'd be cool if I could do that with you guys.

597
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,880
Just replace us?

598
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,960
Well, just like if they have a bad week, it's like, well, let's just try out somebody else.

599
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,160
Let's give Rothfuss a chance.

600
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,280
Let's see what he does in there.

601
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,640
Uh, so congratulations, Dr. John.

602
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,640
Sounds like you were in the right place at the right time.

603
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,440
God, Justin.

604
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,880
Joe, may the force be with you, Sidon.

605
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,560
I've got a message for you and it's from Sarah Yarrowizard.

606
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,800
Uh, Gries, Gries.

607
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,120
Gries.

608
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,320
They, it says pronounced Gries right after Justin.

609
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,960
Gries.

610
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,760
Sarah Gries.

611
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,560
Gries almighty, Justin.

612
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,200
Surprise.

613
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,080
Happy new year, birthday, Valentine's Day, day we met.

614
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,040
Special fun day or second anniversary.

615
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,720
Whether it's January, February, April, November or December, I've got us covered.

616
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,280
Good.

617
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,000
After five years of friendship, I'm proud of the nerdy, loving, healthy relationship

618
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,120
we've built together.

619
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,880
I love you as much as I love hit points or Harry Potter.

620
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,920
It's HP.

621
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,040
Probably Harry Potter.

622
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,520
Probably Harry Potter.

623
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,120
I love you as much as I love Hewlett Packard and you love Star Wars combined.

624
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,280
Thank you for being you, Boo.

625
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,880
And so it's just a nice message.

626
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,480
There's nothing to really congratulate them on.

627
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,640
So birthday, I guess.

628
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,240
It seems like the month for the birthday.

629
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,080
So happy birthday, Joe.

630
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:50,400
I love you as much as I love Harvey Purvis, who is an accountant living in San Bernardino.

631
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,040
Thank you, Harvey.

632
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,880

You guys want to get who?

650
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,200
Yeah.

651
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,600
Got a few good ones.

652
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,200
This one was sent in by, and I apologize for how bad I'm going to pronounce this,

653
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,760
but from Aulia Irham Waisessa, who, thank you, Aulia.

654
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,280
It's from Yahoo Answers User.

655
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,240
They are anonymous.

656
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,680
Let's call them.

657
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:04,640
Todd asks, would a toaster still work in a freezer?

658
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,600
Their subhead for this is, would this create cold toast, which is fucking stupid.

659
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,200
But the good question is there at the top.

660
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,440
You put a fucking toaster in a freezer, run the extension cord in there.

661
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,800
You put some good bread in there.

662
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,600
You click it down.

663
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,840
What even happens, right?

664
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:29,120
Because you say, if you think it would get hot, well, then the freezer hasn't done its job.

665
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,960
But if you say it gets cold, then the toaster hasn't done its job.

666
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,160
Let me say there is a factor here which makes this more of a brain puzzle to me.

667
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,800
Yeah.

668
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,640
If you immediately take the toaster, put it in the freezer, press the thing down,

669
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,760
I think like, yes, it's still going to work because the freezer has not had time.

670
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:56,080
But if you put the toaster in the freezer for say like 20, 30 minutes, then do it.

671
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,320
Yeah.

672
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,680
So like the coils, those toaster coils, they done cooled down.

673
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,240
And so it might come to room temperature.

674
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,240
So you might end up with room temperature bread because it's a timed thing.

675
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,960
Unless you have a toaster that operates on some kind of heat sensor.

676
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,400
I think it's a timed thing.

677
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,680
So you would end up with like the coils would reach room temperature,

678
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,880
but not necessarily hot enough to toast the bread.

679
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,760
Possibly, potentially.

680
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,560
I'm worried that-

681
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,160
You're just talking out of your ass though, Mr. Wizard.

682
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,720
Yeah, I'm worried in having this discussion we're ruining

683
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,360
the new season of Bill Nye the Science Guy that's coming out.

684
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,440
Like first, Bill's listening to this and he's like,

685
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,880
fuck, that was like first episode.

686
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,400
We're three quarters of the way through shooting.

687
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,040
I don't think you could, okay.

688
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,840
But you couldn't close the freezer all the way.

689
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,520
So you're gonna have-

690
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,960
I mean, it would seal around like a small thin enough cord.

691
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,400
Like it was that like that seal thing that is on freezers.

692
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,520
It would still seal around it.

693
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,720
I don't think that's a factor.

694
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,080
That's a fucking easy out, Justin.

695
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,320
You try to fucking like cheat your way out of this question.

696
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,520
What's gonna happen in there?

697
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,800
Because I think we're worried about whether or not the bread's gonna turn into toast.

698
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,120
I'm on some like, this is gonna be like we're inventing time travel.

699
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,800
Like we're on some like accidental weird science Steins Gate shit.

700
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,400
Like I'm worried that like it's gonna open up a black hole of temperature.

701
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,560
I just don't think it'll get as toasty.

702
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,280
Like it'll be less toasty toast, right?

703
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,200
Probably less toasty I would think.

704
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,600
Why does-

705
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,080
Like warmed through, but not as toasty.

706
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,600
Why does one of them win?

707
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,520
Is like, because in your mind you're saying the freezer beats the toaster.

708
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,000
Why?

709
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,600
I think freezer beats toaster.

710
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,240
It's bigger and it's been doing it for longer.

711
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,720
Like I've been keeping things frozen in here for years.

712
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,120
You cannot come into my house and try to toast things and expect it to fly.

713
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,560
It's not gonna fly with me.

714
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,320
I'll get colder if I have to.

715
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,160
Okay Justin, what about this?

716
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,840
Imagine if you will, we're gonna get into some, this is all mind puzzles and not real.

717
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,640
Keep that in mind.

718
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,600
I realize that we-

719
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,040
It's real to me, damn it.

720
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,600
Griffin, we're about to go on a flight of fancy.

721
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,800
Fuck it, buckle in.

722
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,520
Oh fucking shit.

723
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,280
All right, Ms. Frizzle, take me.

724
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:18,400
What if instead of toaster in freezer, we had a giant toaster that we put a freezer,

725
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,240
a smaller freezer in.

726
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,200
We started the toaster, would the freezer still keep things cold inside of it?

727
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,000
That's a fucking banger of a question, Travis.

728
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yes, because I posit that Justin is correct in a roundabout way, that if you put something

729
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,440
inside another thing, the bigger thing containing it will always be dominant because it is bigger

730
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,360
and containing the inner vessel.

731
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,040
And it's been in the game for longer.

732
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,800
I don't wanna discount Savvy.

733
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:53,280
I feel like if you put a toaster in a, okay, if you put a freezer in a giant toaster,

734
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,000
I feel like the freezer is still gonna get it done.

735
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,440
But every time you use the toaster, the freezer is gonna be like, what the fuck?

736
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,920
I just got it cold in here.

737
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,560
And you ruined everything again and you refreeze it, you're definitely gonna get some ice crystals.

738
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,920
That's gonna be a big problem.

739
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,960
But I feel like the freezer won't give up.

740
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,640
The freezer would never quit, always trying to get things cold again after the toaster

741
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,960
did its thing.

742
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,240
Is it possible that we get that cold, crunchy toast?

743
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,880
Is it possible that this is just a new fucking molecular gastronomy thing where it's like,

744
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,600
this toast isn't burned or cooked at all, but it's crunchy, but it's cold?

745
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,840
It's crunch like toast, but cold like ice cream.

746
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:46,640
If you toasted a toaster pastry, toaster strudel, it's got the hot filling and the

747
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,720
hot flaky crust, but then immediately did a quick dip in some liquid nitrogen,

748
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:59,120
would the inside remain molten hot while the outside was frozen?

749
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,680
I think so.

750
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,280
That would be a take.

751
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,120
I would jam on that.

752
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,400
I mean, I'd probably die because I think maybe the liquid nitrogen would be bad for my tum-tum.

753
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,440
This reminds me of the scene in the brave old toaster where the brave old toaster went

754
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,680
up to the freezer and was like, 1v1 me, motherfucker.

755
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,560
Can I do a different?

756
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,560
I didn't think that that yahoo was gonna have my new legs.

757
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,840
And I also feel this way about this one.

758
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,760
Can I do like a two for one?

759
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,960
Yeah, two for one sale.

760
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,600
This one was sent in by Rachel Rosen, game recognized game, Rachel Rosen.

761
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,080
Thank you, Rachel.

762
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,120
It's by yahoo answers user J who asks, in Italian cuisine,

763
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,760
is it appropriate to mix two different types of pasta?

764
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,480
I had lunch at a recently opened restaurant in my area and one of the pasta dishes I saw

765
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,080
served to the table diagonally for me had both spaghetti and fessucine,

766
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,480
maybe tagliatelle in white sauce with clams.

767
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,600
I'm not sure what it's called.

768
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,200
First thing that came to mind was, wow, that's different.

769
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:53,920
But the more I think about it,

770
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,800
mixing two types of pasta together doesn't sound right at all.

771
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
To reiterate my question, in Italian cuisine,

772
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,960
is it appropriate to mix two different types of pasta?

773
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,080
I read this and I don't know how serious to talk about here,

774
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,280
but I also imagined spaghetti macaroni together,

775
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,440
just chilling together in a bowl with some sauce.

776
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,000
And I was like, hey, that's the most wack shit I think I've ever heard of in my entire life.

777
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,040
Yeah, good luck finding which fork to use.

778
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,200
Because do I use my macaroni fork or do I use my linguini fork?

779
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,800
I don't know.

780
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,240
There's also different techniques.

781
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
There's different pursuit techniques.

782
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:26,880
Yeah, for sure.

783
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,520
If you do the swirl, you know that big, silly swirl

784
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,840
that people like to do where they do a big, silly swirl

785
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,720
and then they put it on a spoon and eat it like that?

786
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,760
That's one way of doing it.

787
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,120
Like they made a Donald Duck style like, whoop, ow, whoop.

788
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,080
Like they made a pasta nest that they're gonna roost in for a bit.

789
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,480
You're not gonna get, you may get all macaroni, like singular.

790
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,320
I don't know what the singular of macaroni is,

791
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
but you might get one macaroni in there.

792
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,360
You know, I would like to be in the kitchen of this restaurant

793
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,080
where like the chef reached for the box of pasta or whatever

794
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,160
and was like, ooh, there's not enough of this dish.

795
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,880
And there was like a solid like five minute rushed,

796
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,720
heated but whispered conversation about like,

797
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,920
can we convince a customer that mixing two pastas is a thing

798
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,000
and not just because we ran out of this kind of pasta halfway through the dish?

799
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,640
It's like, yeah, I call this fettighetti, enjoy.

800
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,360
I love Guy Fettighetti.

801
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,840
I've been watching a lot of his stuff since we got cable.

802
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,600
Now, exception to this,

803
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,160
if we could somehow thread the most tender angel hair pasta

804
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
through the juiciest macaroni noodles.

805
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,200
Into a beautiful necklace.

806
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,880
Into a beautiful edible necklace

807
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,440
that we would serve to you on my, while I'm wearing it.

808
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,880
And you would have to, it's the-

809
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,080
On your friend's hairy body.

810
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,400
This is my naked brother Griffin.

811
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,080
I've coated him in chains.

812
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:00,580
Hello.

813
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:02,880
Thank you, Griffin.

814
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,320
Griffin, I did ask you not to speak.

815
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,520
Please, you'll move the noodles.

816
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,640
I've layered him much like chain mail, but it's noodle mail.

817
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,080
It's noodle mail armor where I've threaded lovingly,

818
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,920
threaded spaghetti through the macaroni noodles

819
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,480
and made him sort of an edible armor.

820
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,600
So now he's just sort of a noodle boy for you to enjoy.

821
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,400
Enjoy this noodle boy.

822
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,520
I am working on a jingle.

823
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,520
I don't have a tune yet, but it's coming along.

824
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,360
Noodles and noodles on this beautiful boy.

825
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,560
It's something like that.

826
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,920
Just one moment, I'm all plain.

827
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,960
I'm feeling a bit under the weather.

828
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,720
Time to get a visit from the sauce doctor.

829
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,720
And then the sauce doctor come and just dumps it on me.

830
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,560
And then I'm ready to go.

831
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,000
It's going to get messy, I say.

832
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,920
See, I love this because this is both fitting in the most upscale Italian restaurant

833
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,800
and also could double as like a Cirque du Soleil performance.

834
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,000
So it's like it's a performance art right there at your table.

835
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,400
People love that because sometimes it's a magician

836
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,680
or sometimes it's like a fun band who like walks around the restaurant place.

837
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,680
And sometimes it's a naked boy wearing macaroni mithril

838
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,600
and you just eat it off of him.

839
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,920
What's hard is, though, you know that eventually Griffin's going to get some job offers

840
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,920
from somebody else, maybe Pasta Garden or Marty Scorsese,

841
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,080
and he's going to have to quit and there's going to be a new boy.

842
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,200
And everybody's going to say, I really like the flavors different,

843
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,560
I think, off the new boy than the old one.

844
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,560
I prefer the old noodle boy.

845
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,320
I like noodle boy classic.

846
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:40,240
The old noodle boy Griffin had almost like a Parmesan grime.

847
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,240
So I guess I'm a little bit disappointed.

848
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,560
I'm so excited about this question.

849
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:44,880
Please.

850
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,240
The other day I was spending quality time with one of my best friends

851
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,400
when he mentioned that he was starting to cook breakfast for himself.

852
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,160
This was fine, but the way he said it struck me as odd.

853
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,760
Fuck, I've been frying eggs instead of just having cereal.

854
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,480
Yeah, but cereal is good, I replied.

855
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,160
I do like it.

856
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,840
Nothing beats a nice warm bowl of cereal.

857
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:15,600
I inquired further and ascertained that he has been microwaving the milk

858
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:20,720
for his normal breakfast cereal his entire life.

859
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:21,760
What?

860
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,200
Help.

861
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,160
Am I good?

862
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,880
Am I good? And that's from Toasty in Toledo.

863
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,440
I love that this person recognizes this is such a breach of trust

864
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,680
that they are curious if they are good.

865
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,840
They are good, if they are good by association.

866
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,480
The answer is no, obviously.

867
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,360
You are ruined.

868
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,280
What could you have be-

869
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,840
What?

870
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,600
Who did this to you?

871
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,920
Who hurt you back in the day?

872
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,520
Someone did this to you as a child.

873
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,360
I'll tell you who did it to them as a child.

874
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,480
Fucking Cocoa Weeds.

875
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,600
Cocoa Weeds did their dark things and they're like,

876
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,440
this is gonna be your jam.

877
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,880
It's like cereal, but hot.

878
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,680
It could also just be oatmeal, like oatmeal in general.

879
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,160
They're like, this is good, but what if checks?

880
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,560
No, nah, nah.

881
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,560
They do it with Grape Nuts.

882
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,160
People will sell you this on Grape Nuts where if you heat it up,

883
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,040
it's just, I mean, hi, is Justin here?

884
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,480
If you pour milk on Grape Nuts and heat it up, that's gruel.

885
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,160
That's gruel that you make at home.

886
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,240
It's not just sad.

887
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,200
It's just sad.

888
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,400
You're having Grape Nuts and it's time to spice it up for yourself.

889
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,680
Just sit down and eat it as quickly as you can

890
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,720
and move on with your day.

891
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,320
The reason that Grape Nuts tells you to do that

892
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,160
is because maybe you'll heat the milk up too much

893
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,920
and burn your tongue so bad that you don't realize

894
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,080
how fucking shitty Grape Nuts taste.

895
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,600
That's why they tell you to do that.

896
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,000
The fact that you are doing this to Cinnamon Toast Crunch

897
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,560
when I could eat the Cinnamon Toast Crunch with a cold milk

898
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,000
makes you so angry.

899
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,160
Do you know, this falls into a category,

900
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,280
it's a very slim category,

901
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,800
but a category of like breakfast

902
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,800
that then asks you to take one more step.

903
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,280
Like before Frosted Mini Wheats were mini

904
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,880
and it was just one giant wheat

905
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,360
that you yourself were supposed to break up.

906
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,880
Like, no, the process is pour milk, eat.

907
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,600
There is no other step in the middle of this.

908
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,160
Now that is still how shredded wheat is distributed.

909
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,520
Yes, I will, I will.

910
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,160
I hate it.

911
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,480
I agree with you.

912
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,480
Also, I think people eat shredded wheat hot.

913
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,320
I think that's another thing that people are doing.

914
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:14,800
I'd fuck with that.

915
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,520
I'd get down with that.

916
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:15,680
Yeah, I think so.

917
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,440
And I actually like the hot Grape Nuts too.

918
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,560
You have just added a second,

919
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,360
you have shred the wheat yourself and then heat it.

920
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,800
That's two more steps in what it's supposed to be a,

921
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,640
oh no, I've only got two minutes

922
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,480
before the carpool gets here.

923
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,440
Like milk cereal, done, out the door.

924
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,120
I think I could get behind this

925
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,240
under the shredded wheats clause.

926
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,360
But also if you worked at like,

927
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,280
if you were like a construction worker in Buffalo,

928
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,880
and like you showed up to the site

929
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,120
and they were like, hey, Denny, what are you eating today?

930
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,920
And you were like, I'm having some hot rings.

931
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,880
And they're like, hot rings?

932
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,600
What are those?

933
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,680
I heated up my Cheerio milk

934
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,120
and you slobber it out of the thing

935
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,880
on a cool blustery winter day.

936
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,960
I think that that would be acceptable.

937
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,240
Hot rings for a construction worker is acceptable in Buffalo,

938
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,240
but that's about, that's basically it.

939
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,320
Otherwise, I don't want to hear about your hot Cheerios.

940
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,040
That's sort of like the first time

941
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,880
I tried to make warm milk for myself

942
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,200
because I'd been sold that as a sleep aid.

943
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,600
And then I tried to drink it with my own mouth.

944
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,120
And it's absolutely repellent.

945
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,920
And the fact that you would bring something like that

946
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,560
into the blessed bond of cereal and cold milk

947
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,000
is honestly hugely offensive to me.

948
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,280
It's hugely offensive.

949
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,600
Can I read another question that makes me really happy?

950
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,600
And as we near the end of February,

951
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,760
the February question list will fall off.

952
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,000
And I just want to say this out loud.

953
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,600
I want to put this out in the world.

954
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,960
We don't even have to discuss it so much.

955
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,960
Yeah, secret the shit.

956
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,680
Today, as I was painting sets for the school play,

957
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,760
my drama teacher came in to get a can of paint

958
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,440
and spilled it all over the floor.

959
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,240
She then said, ugh, this makes me so mad I could bust a nut.

960
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,960
I think she thinks bust a nut

961
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,600
is an angry version of the phrase bust a gut.

962
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:05,920
It is?

963
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,080
I told her to never say that phrase ever again,

964
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,760
but she just laughed and took it as old people

965
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,760
like you shouldn't use slang.

966
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,040
My question is, how do I make my 60 year old teacher

967
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,600
never say bust a nut ever again

968
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,080
without having to explain to her what it means?

969
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,640
And that's from, and I still have to clean up the paint.

970
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,120
There's a typo in this.

971
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,880
And I believe the typo is when you said don't.

972
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,280
Yeah.

973
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,880
And instead, as much as humanly fucking possible,

974
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,840
get your 60 year old teacher to say bust a nut.

975
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,840
This woman is a walking story.

976
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,920
She is a walking story that she gifts to people

977
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,360
who are around when she does something that makes her angry

978
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,480
and she says the bad, wrong, very, very funny, good thing.

979
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,480
Assumedly, assumedly, she's using the wrong thing.

980
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,360
And it is very selfish of you to say,

981
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,080
I would like to be the last recipient of this story

982
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,000
because we might get another question.

983
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,480
We've probably gotten questions about this very person before.

984
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,240
You don't wanna be the person that brings that story to an end.

985
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,840
And you are also in a position where in the middle of class

986
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,560
you could get into a fake fight with somebody and yell,

987
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,320
one more word out of you

988
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,800
and I am gonna bust a nut in this place.

989
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,280
And your teacher would just be lolling.

990
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,960
Like your teacher would be loving it.

991
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,880
And everyone would look at you.

992
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,880
Miss Stevens is cool as shit.

993
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,480
She's just laughing this off.

994
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:32,880
Yeah.

995
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,520
I thought she'd give him a pink slip, but no dice.

996
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,800
She's loving it.

997
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,920
Maybe we should all talk about busting a nut.

998
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,360
And now it's a thing.

999
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,160
That's the thing is now you have the opportunity to like

1000
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,800
the next time you get mad with a group of friends say,

1001
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,360
this is making me so mad I could bust a nut.

1002
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,600
And everyone says, excuse me, what?

1003
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:51,920
Sorry?

1004
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,880
And then you say, ah, okay, thank you for inquiring.

1005
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,400
And then you tell them the story.

1006
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:01,120
And now this is weird because you can travel back in time

1007
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,040
to make this phrase make sense the way she's using it.

1008
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,440
Because now you're gonna start this and in 20 years

1009
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,600
people will be using bust a nut to describe how mad they are.

1010
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,960
And she started that.

1011
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,360
Are you suggesting this person could tort the fabric

1012
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,560
of language around this person rather than correct them?

1013
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,520
Inception.

1014
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,840
This is inception to busting a nut.

1015
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,320
So it all just comes back around.

1016
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:30,000
You do this nut busting chuckle routine for like a month.

1017
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,960
And like a month later in that drama class,

1018
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,040
your friend Derek is like, man, I'm so frustrated over here.

1019
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,240
I'm about to jizz.

1020
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,920
And your teacher's like, Derek, leave principal's office now.

1021
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,440
We don't use words like that.

1022
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,440
No, no.

1023
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,880
We don't say jizz in this class.

1024
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,840
We don't say jizz.

1025
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,880
You've made me so frustrated.

1026
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,200
I'm about to seriously bust a nut right here.

1027
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,360
What if you confronted your teacher

1028
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:00,320
if I was like, Ms. Stevens, bust a nut means,

1029
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,160
if she's like, I know exactly what it means.

1030
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,600
Hilarious, right?

1031
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,240
It's good, right?

1032
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:04,800
Oh, shit.

1033
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,300
Oh, shit.

1034
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,800
Ms. Stevens is funny as fuck.

1035
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,280
Oh, my God.

1036
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,640
I can't wait to be 60 now.

1037
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,240
I'm going to run this con on everybody.

1038
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,120
Oh, she doesn't know.

1039
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,000
Oh, I know.

1040
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,640
Oh, I know.

1041
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,440
Oh, I know.

1042
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,480
I've always known.

1043
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,600
I've always known.

1044
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:22,880
Inception.

1045
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,720
What a good teacher.

1046
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,080
What a good time.

1047
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,040
What a great teacher.

1048
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,520
I remember-

1049
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,320
What a great teacher.

1050
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,240
Thank you for meeting me, President Obama.

1051
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,920
I was wondering if you could call my favorite teacher.

1052
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,280
It would be very, it would be very special to her.

1053
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:35,840
If you could just give her-

1054
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,000
Sure.

1055
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,320
What kind of impact did she have on your life?

1056
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:38,560
Well-

1057
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:38,720
All right.

1058
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,600
So check this shit out.

1059
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:41,680
Okay.

1060
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,320
Get Joey in here.

1061
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:42,960
He's going to love this.

1062
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:46,560
Whatever.

1063
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,760
Joey's the one that convinced her.

1064
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,280
Joey comes in, he's like, yeah, bust a nut means you're angry, right?

1065
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:52,580
Joey.

1066
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,920
Yeah, you got me.

1067
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,000
I, by the way, I just want everybody to know,

1068
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,480
I'm not going to die on this nut busting cross

1069
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,360
to change the language, to contort around your teacher.

1070
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,200
I will not give up busting nut.

1071
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,520
No, it's an important phrase for what it means.

1072
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,680
Justin, your obstinance is making me so angry I could bust a nut.

1073
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,280
Don't stop.

1074
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,480
Like, don't do it.

1075
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,840
Because what you're going to do

1076
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,720
is this will not extend beyond our community.

1077
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,040
Yeah.

1078
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,520
And we're just going to lose the ability to tell

1079
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,360
whether people are angry or horny.

1080
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,960
Yeah, that's true.

1081
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,840
Or both.

1082
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,280
Or both in some cases.

1083
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,040
That's going to do it for us, I think.

1084
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,160
Yeah, we're done.

1085
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,160
That's the end of this podcast for this week.

1086
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,440
All right, so this is our big pitch, okay?

1087
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:41,840
If you like us at all, we've got a TV show coming out on CISO,

1088
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,400
which is a comedy streaming service run by NBC.

1089
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,000
At CISO.com is where you can sign up and what all.

1090
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,640
But there is also an Apple TV app.

1091
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,680
There's a Roku app.

1092
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,040
There's a iOS app.

1093
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,080
It is US only.

1094
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:02,240
But if you could just go ahead and go watch our TV show,

1095
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,920
it comes out February 23rd.

1096
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,320
And we would really appreciate it.

1097
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,360
We think you'll like it.

1098
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,400
We also just, we have a ton of people on our Facebook group.

1099
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,640
We have a spin-off Facebook page for specifics

1100
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,200
about the TV show because not everybody can watch it yet.

1101
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,960
We don't want to spoil anything or what have you.

1102
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,960
So if you search for MBMBAM TV show,

1103
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,280
I think it pops up there on the book.

1104
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,080
So you can sign up for that if you want to talk about the show.

1105
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,200
And just to clarify, because we made that TV show thing,

1106
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:38,560
so if you try to post stuff about the TV show

1107
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,520
on the regular podcast group, it's gonna get denied.

1108
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,160
We want to make sure that we keep that-

1109
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,120
Specific stuff.

1110
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:48,240
Specific stuff about the episodes that are going up.

1111
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,920
Maybe not more general things.

1112
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,400
But I just also want to say,

1113
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,480
the absolute fact of the matter is

1114
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,080
we would not have had this opportunity

1115
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,360
if it weren't for you all

1116
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,480
over the past almost seven years,

1117
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,400
spreading the word about the show,

1118
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,880
listening to the show, reviewing the show, all that stuff.

1119
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,440
And we really owe it to you

1120
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,880
and we'll be forever indebted to you.

1121
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,560
And we hope we made something that will delight you

1122
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,720
because that was the absolute 100% only ideal

1123
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,400
that we had in mind when we were making the show.

1124
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,880
So thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1125
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,380
Thank you.

1126
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,880
And just as a reminder, I also want to say the mods,

1127
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:39,360
Rachel and Wes and Anthony and Lucy and Stormy,

1128
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,880
who are mods on the podcast group

1129
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,880
are also the mods on the TV show group.

1130
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,960
And they're working really hard,

1131
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,200
but it takes a while to sort through all the membership requests

1132
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,640
because we want to make sure that we keep,

1133
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,480
that we don't get spam accounts in there and everything.

1134
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,200
And they also work really hard to sort through everybody's posts

1135
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,240
and it can take a while.

1136
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,320
And we've given them fairly specific guidelines

1137
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,960
as far as like what kind of stuff should be approved

1138
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,680
and what shouldn't.

1139
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,840
So just know it can be, you might have to wait a while.

1140
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,120
A post might get denied.

1141
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,480
Yeah, please be patient with them.

1142
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,440
Please be patient with them, they're working really, really hard

1143
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,440
and it is a completely thankless job.

1144
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,280
But we sure appreciate it.

1145
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,640
Like we literally don't thank them.

1146
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,840
Yeah, not at all.

1147
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,280
I thank you all very much.

1148
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,840
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1149
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,560
for using our theme song.

1150
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,560
It's a part drop the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1151
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,920
It's also the theme song for the TV show.

1152
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,480
I saw a lot of people like excited that we got to use it

1153
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,160
for the TV show when the premiere episode came out.

1154
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,720
And we were super excited too,

1155
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,080
because like it would have been weird if I'm like,

1156
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:48,000
and now I'm a bim bam bing bing bing bing bing bing bing.

1157
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,120
Like some shitty song.

1158
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,760
That was what I think a shitty song sounds like.

1159
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,040
Although really it was kind of a banger.

1160
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,880
Like it hadn't like a nice sort of-

1161
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,360
That was good.

1162
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:55,920
It wasn't bad.

1163
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,160
Yeah.

1164
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,560
It was polyphonic spree level right there.

1165
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,480
So we have a live show in Austin in May.

1166
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:02,980
Oh, geez.

1167
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,800
May, what is it?

1168
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,440
What day?

1169
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,000
What are we doing?

1170
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,760
I think 20th and 21st.

1171
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,480
Is that right?

1172
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,280
Yeah, that sounds right.

1173
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,080
Nobody's really quite sure.

1174
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,520
No one knows when.

1175
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,680
But so May, I believe it's May 20th and 21st.

1176
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,000
It is.

1177
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,320
Saturday the 20th and Sunday the 21st.

1178
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,480
And those tickets are going on sale this week.

1179
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,680
You know, I know that-

1180
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,480
Listen, you know, if they sell out, I know that sucks.

1181
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,200
But just in case, make sure, you know,

1182
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,640
know when it's going to happen.

1183
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,520
Be ready for it.

1184
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,080
Camp out on the website, I guess.

1185
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:45,520
The link is going to be bit.ly forward slash Austin, M-B-M-B-A-M, 2017, 2-0-1-7.

1186
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:53,840
And if you want to see Adventure Zone, that ticket link is going to be bit.ly slash Taz Austin, 2017.

1187
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,280
It's not up yet.

1188
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,440
I believe the tickets go on sale the 24th.

1189
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:03,280
So let me get the exact time for you so I can let you know.

1190
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,600
They're going to go on sale 10 a.m. Central Standard Time.

1191
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,120
What is that?

1192
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,080
No one knows what that is.

1193
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,520
That's the time zone our brother lives in, that Austin exists in.

1194
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,160
So it's like 11 a.m. regular human time?

1195
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,320
It's normal here at normal time minus one.

1196
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:25,200
They're going to go on sale Friday the 24th, 10 a.m. Central Time.

1197
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:31,120
Bit.ly forward slash Austin, M-B-M-B-A-M, 2017.

1198
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:34,880
It's going to be fun.

1199
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,680
We're doing M-B-M-B-A-M and Adventure Zone, so it'll be a hoot.

1200
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,480
So y'all want that final?

1201
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,160
Hit me.

1202
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,920
So I sent it by Paige Andrews Johnson.

1203
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,400
Thank you, Paige.

1204
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,000
It's Yahoo Answers user.

1205
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,800
Another anonymous, we'll call him Hieronymous, asks,

1206
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,000
is it immature when a guy says penis power during sex?

1207
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,760
My name is Justin McElroy.

1208
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,960
I'm Travis McElroy.

1209
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,400
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1210
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,520
It's been my brother, my brother, me.

1211
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,160
Kiss your dads.

1212
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:32,080
Square on the lips.

1213
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:37,520
We host the weekly comedy podcast One Bad Mother, we celebrate our moments of parenting genius,

1214
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,200
as well as our failures.

1215
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,280
Just like, we're going to have hot dogs.

1216
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,120
And I'm like, no, we're having fun.

1217
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,400
Everybody loves hot dogs.

1218
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,320
And it just like smashes that thing right on my chest.

1219
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,360
And then I'm just crying in the middle of like kids space while people are like literally

1220
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,560
dancing with their children.

1221
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:54,320
Parenting can be sad and painfully funny at the same time.

1222
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:59,280
So join us each week as we admit that this is hard, but we're getting really good at it.
