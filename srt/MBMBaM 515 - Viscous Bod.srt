1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:49,600
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,640
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I am your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,800
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Dang, you just came right in there with that,

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,120
Griffin. I like the authoritativeness, you know what I mean? It's who I am,

9
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,960
and I'm done hiding it behind a bunch of qualifiers. Yes, yes, you are the youngest

10
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:21,520
brother. My name is Griffin, and I came after these two gentlemen. I was brewed up in the womb

11
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:29,360
after these two gentlemen, and it's just a fluke that I'm the youngest one. And this is what fucks

12
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,000
me up, and I think about this sometimes. I could have been Justin. Do you guys know what I'm saying?

13
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,680
Then who would Justin be? I don't know, either you or me. But do you understand what I'm saying?

14
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:47,040
Like, what if I came together first and Justin was the youngest? It's just like, right?

15
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,560
I am okay with picturing you as the oldest and Justin as the youngest. I cannot think of myself

16
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,000
as anyone but the middlest. I'd love to have your youth, Griffin. I'm so envious. I'm covetous of

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
your youth. I'd love another chance at these last seven years. Do you guys ever think about the fact

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,440
that I get the best of both? That I'm not the oldest or the littlest? Yeah, not the smartest,

19
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,120
not the most virile. But I'm also not the least smartest or the least virile, right?

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:25,040
No, you're just kind of there. Your virility is just not. Listen, what I am, I'm the RPG character

21
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,000
that doesn't get a lot of bonuses but gets like plus one to everything. Yeah, but you think like,

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,560
he could be whatever he wants. He could be anything. Yeah. And then he doesn't. But then it's

23
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,480
like, where did it go wrong? Well, I don't think anyone has ever looked at me and thought he could

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,160
be anything. But I find that they've maybe looked at me and thought- No, certainly not. You didn't

25
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,400
need to clarify that. No, but I think people might've looked at me and thought, I bet he could

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,680
be mediocre at anything. Like I think that he could be a pretty average to slightly below average

27
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,520
lawyer, right? Sure. So the king rolls up and he's like, oh, we need the most virile knight in the

28
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,000
land. And I'm like, I got this one guys. And I walk off and then the queen comes up and is like,

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,640
we need the most wise and sorcerer in the land. And Justin's like, don't worry guys, I got this.

30
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,400
But then that's all the royalty that there is. No, but then, oh, excuse me. But then perhaps

31
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,120
a Duke rolls up and says, I just, I'm on a budget and I need a good kind of catch all knight. And

32
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,440
I'm like, I am the one for you. Listen, I'm a jack of all trades, master of none.

33
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:40,000
The prince is like, I need someone to carry my packages back from ye gap.

34
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,200
Now you've lost the, I feel like you lost the metaphor a little bit, Justin.

35
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Is that me? Cause I am the strongest.

36
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,960
No, you're not the strongest. You just are strong enough to carry a package.

37
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,000
Justin's the strongest. Justin's the strongest?

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah. Strongest, smartest, bravest, coolest.

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,120
My head is like a shark's fin.

40
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,200
I need someone to carry my light packages from the gap and half impregnate my wife.

41
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,320
Yep. That's me.

42
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,080
That's Travis. I can do both of those. But see, that's the thing. If someone said,

43
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,440
I need someone to carry packages and impregnate my wife, everyone would be like,

44
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,800
I can do one of those. And Justin would say, I can do one of those. And I would say,

45
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,960
I can be mediocre at both of those.

46
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,560
Well, no, I could do, I could half impregnate twice because I'm fully,

47
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,440
I'm Herbie fully loaded over here.

48
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
I mean, yes, that is true. Go to the doctor.

49
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,000
What the fuck are we talking about? It feels like we're flying without a net a little bit.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,400
I'm loving it. I'm loving the energy. It's an exciting energy. It's an exciting time

51
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,480
for no one. And we hope you are hanging in there with just like the world and stuff.

52
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,400
We got a big show for you today. We've never done this before.

53
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,040
You know what? You fucking jinxed me. You jinxed me because I was like,

54
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,640
this is just easy free flow conversation. And then you were like, it's a show.

55
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,920
We're like, oh no. Okay. I'm fucking James Corden now.

56
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
We got the McElroy house band here.

57
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,160
Let me hear you guys.

58
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,400
You guys heard about this? Denny's has a new special.

59
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,400
Oh, it's time for doing Munch Squad and Denny's is doing a new thing.

60
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,280
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show, Rosario Dawson.

61
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,800
Oh, wow.

62
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,400
It's a big gift.

63
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,320
Hey, it's me, Jake the snake. I got my big snake here to do tricks for you.

64
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,400
Animal expert Jake the snake is here to show us his collection of reptiles.

65
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,960
I've got three snakes. One, two.

66
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,680
I'm into herpetology. I don't wrestle anymore. I got into actual snakes.

67
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,000
Let's get into the advice.

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,480
Yeah.

69
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,920
We've waited long enough.

70
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,800
This Monday I came home from my first shift back at work since the start of the apocalypse

71
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,280
to find that all my posters about 15 had been flipped upside down.

72
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,880
I have three younger siblings and a friend staying with me this summer.

73
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,000
No one will confess.

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,720
How do I find the flipper or at least get them to anonymously write the posters?

75
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,840
That's from poster problem in the purple mountains.

76
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,360
Wow. This is an easy one.

77
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,240
Flip them back over and then when the person who did this ill-conceived prank sees that you have

78
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,200
fixed it without even acknowledging that the prank has happened,

79
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,400
they will feel a sense of shame that will be so heavy.

80
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
It will be like a boulder has landed on them.

81
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,400
There is nothing worse.

82
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,720
The worst possible outcome to pulling a prank is that the other person is just kind of mildly

83
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,360
annoyed by it and doesn't even like acknowledge.

84
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,480
If you act like it made you sad, that's great.

85
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,160
That could be cool.

86
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,880
No, the worst possible outcome to a prank is somebody dies.

87
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,440
Somebody dies.

88
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,720
No, no, no.

89
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,120
Okay.

90
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,280
The worst possible outcome to a prank is everybody dies.

91
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay, yes.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,400
That is the worst possible outcome to everything.

93
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,960
Or every all life.

94
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,160
Just all life is extinction.

95
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,520
Mass extinction is the worst possible outcome of a prank.

96
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,320
Yes.

97
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,440
Oh no, I put a bucket of water on top of a door frame

98
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,160
and it fell and somehow cracked the earth in half.

99
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,720
It fell onto a molten.

100
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,200
Yeah, right.

101
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,520
Exactly.

102
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,960
You hit it in just the right way.

103
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,800
The earth's got a glass jaw right there.

104
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,680
Ashton made Beyonce think she knocked the Christmas tree over,

105
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,360
but it unearthed some sort of turbo virus.

106
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,720
Yeah, that's the worst possible outcome.

107
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,080
I prank called someone a random dial number.

108
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,360
It was Cthulhu.

109
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,480
He got pissed.

110
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,240
It was actually a nuclear launch code somehow.

111
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,280
I don't know how that worked.

112
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,800
But right behind that is being embarrassed because your prank was just sort of like

113
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,520
brushed off annoyance by somebody else.

114
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,200
So just flip these posters right back over.

115
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,440
You're going to like the way you look, I guarantee it.

116
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,400
Next question.

117
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,600
You know what, I will say there is an opportunity for a poster whodunit here.

118
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,160
Okay.

119
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,120
And this could be a good mystery to cut your teeth on as a detective because-

120
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,440
Everybody's always looking for that first big case.

121
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:16,320
For Nancy Drew and her friends, it was when the city girl's doll went missing at the slumber party

122
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:26,400
and she and the other members of the Clue crew got together and found the missing Hollywood Halle doll.

123
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,640
And of course, Encyclopedia Brown's first case, it was Bugs Meanie and Bezzling.

124
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,480
And Encyclopedia got him.

125
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:34,980
Got him.

126
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,640
But what I'm saying is the stakes are very low here.

127
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,040
So if you do fail to solve it, you know, now you have a first case to look back on when you're like,

128
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,760
you know, your close rate is 100% and people are like, ah, they always get it.

129
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,120
They always get their person.

130
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
And you're like, not this one time.

131
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,480
It's what haunts me.

132
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,680
It's what drives me.

133
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,040
I'm like, oh no, did like a kidnapper get away or like a murderer?

134
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,560
And you're like, a poster flipper.

135
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
And I'm like, well, that's not so bad.

136
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,680
And you're like, yeah, I know.

137
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,120
It doesn't haunt me a lot.

138
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,960
Just a little bit of haunting.

139
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,880
It's just so low stakes.

140
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,360
You have the opportunity here to dish out such a gnarly riposte,

141
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,400
such a gnarly little parry counter-attack that like will completely...

142
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:29,200
I remember one April Fool's Day when we were young, I tried to do some pranks on Travis,

143
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,280
who I shared a room with at the time.

144
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,800
And like one of the pranks, I remember this very clearly,

145
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,080
is I took down whatever calendar you had.

146
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,920
I think it was like a nerd-ass Xanth calendar, which hasn't aged well.

147
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,360
And I replaced it with like your nerd-ass Xena calendar.

148
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,760
And I was like, gotcha, motherfucker.

149
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,760
And you were like, yeah, that's my Xena.

150
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,560
Travis only reads his calendar as far as the X at the very beginning.

151
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,120
Right.

152
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,240
So he didn't even notice.

153
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,280
He didn't even notice.

154
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,920
But really this last 15 seconds or so was just me viciously dragging

155
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,520
young Travis for happy Xena ends.

156
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,120
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

157
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,400
I mean, I'm embarrassed by Xanth because it didn't age well.

158
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,040
Right.

159
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,840
But I'm not embarrassed by liking things, Griffin.

160
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,960
I enjoy things.

161
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,440
I'm a fan.

162
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:15,920
Sure.

163
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,720
You want to list some other?

164
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,920
I also like Supernatural.

165
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,920
Oh, do you?

166
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,560
Oh, you what?

167
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,400
Oh, Travis, you like...

168
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,040
But I didn't know you were a Supernatural fan.

169
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,160
Oh, I hadn't mentioned it?

170
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,320
Can I do a Yahoo?

171
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,720
Yes, please.

172
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,760
I like that, I think.

173
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,120
This one was sent in by lots of folks.

174
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,040
It's from anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I am gonna call Xena.

175
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,520
Asks...

176
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,520
Asks, do you...

177
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,120
Sorry, Travis, not real.

178
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,440
Oh.

179
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,440
Do you miss the days when it was still popular to shop at Sears?

180
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,720
Yes.

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,800
That was a cool era.

182
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,200
Yeah, I mean, I worked at a Sears.

183
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,080
Worked at a Sears.

184
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,560
Yeah.

185
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,520
Wait, is that true?

186
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:57,600
Yeah, it's true.

187
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,280
At the Land's End department, correct?

188
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,200
In the Land's End department.

189
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,440
And I remember.

190
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,040
And I would say you worked at a Land's End that was eaten by a Sears that was eaten by a mall.

191
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:07,920
Sure.

192
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,520
And I'll tell you what, it was cool in there every day for a while.

193
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,200
It was like, I remember I'd be there and I'd look over and I'd be like,

194
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,080
is that Ray Liotta shopping in the Land's End department?

195
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,280
And it was, because it was cool to shop at Sears.

196
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,480
And there's no one cooler than Ray Liotta who I need to now make a point of order.

197
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,280
Just a quick Google.

198
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,840
Make sure to eat.

199
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,520
I know nothing about Ray Liotta.

200
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,160
So if he's done some bad stuff, I take it all back.

201
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,240
He hasn't done Xanth himself.

202
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:46,880
Yeah, boy, Sears is a, I never necessarily understood Sears.

203
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:54,320
Cause it's like where I went to get my inexpensive suit jackets for Cotillion.

204
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,600
But also if we needed some new bedding and also some grill tools.

205
00:11:59,600 --> 00:11:59,920
Yeah.

206
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,680
I don't necessarily love that all of that is in the same location.

207
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,040
Sears is like the Travis McElroy of stores in that they don't really excel at any one thing,

208
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,640
except Land's End clothing.

209
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:12,960
Right.

210
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,680
That was fine.

211
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,120
Yeah.

212
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,360
But it wasn't like, oh, who has the best fill in the blank?

213
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,640
And the answer is not Sears.

214
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,680
But if you're like, I only want to go to one place.

215
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,960
Oh, good news.

216
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,600
Good news.

217
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,320
It's Sears.

218
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,160
It's weird to be.

219
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,840
I don't think, is Sears gone?

220
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,960
Sears has got to be gone.

221
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,080
If Sears ain't gone now, there's no way it's going to get through the unpleasantness.

222
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,320
I mean, Sears is around, but like many Sears are not.

223
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,640
Like Sears in Huntington closed in August last year.

224
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:44,960
Wow.

225
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,120
So it's been a little bit.

226
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,720
Man, it was, I'm thinking about it though.

227
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,640
It was fucking cool to shop at Sears.

228
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,440
Right?

229
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,000
I mean, the one in Huntington was next to the Quidoba and the Books of Millions.

230
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,200
So that's cool.

231
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,440
Yeah.

232
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,920
Uh, cause you could get kind of like, get us, get a book to read and enjoy, get a snack

233
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,960
and some chips at Quidoba and then go get yourself a socket wrench at Sears and just

234
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,040
have an afternoon, make an afternoon of it.

235
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,760
That's a nice shopping experience.

236
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,880
That was so cool.

237
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:20,160
I cannot tell you how many times I have needed to buy the hot new John Grisham book and fucking

238
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,280
bust up a burrito and also buy a socket wrench and a webbed belt at the same store.

239
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,520
And luckily that little corner of the mall always had my back, didn't it?

240
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,760
You got to get that hot new socket wrench because you're like, I got this old busted

241
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,280
socket wrench at home.

242
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,280
It doesn't have all the new features.

243
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,120
So they have the new ergonomics.

244
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,520
I, um, I did a quick Google to double check the date on the Sears closing in the Huntington

245
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,160
mall.

246
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,600
And, uh, I just, I didn't want to say Google, the Google maps listing says temporarily close.

247
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,760
You fucking go for it Sears.

248
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,560
Fuck yeah, dude.

249
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,680
You'd never know.

250
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,240
You might be like, fire it back up.

251
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,240
These people need washers and shorts.

252
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,280
Let's go do it again.

253
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,840
Last time I went to a Sears here in Austin, I needed, I did need a belt and I went to

254
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,480
like the dress clothes section and they had just sort of a big metal garbage can full

255
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,560
of belts and it feels like Sears is a lot of Sears are just kind of making it up as

256
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,680
they go along.

257
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,120
It feels like Sears always kind of has more stuff than it knows what to do with.

258
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,960
And sometimes it dishes them up, um, uncooked, let's say in a, in a big garbage can.

259
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,920
Did you try the Land's End department, Griffin, to see if they had any belts?

260
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,800
The Land's End department was in incredible condition, Travis.

261
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,960
Everything was, uh, it was like a museum for outdoor wear.

262
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:43,680
Yep.

263
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,280
That was our motto.

264
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,600
Um.

265
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,400
Fuck Macy's.

266
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,760
Fuck Macy's though.

267
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,080
Wow.

268
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Whoa.

269
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,400
Just kidding.

270
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,440
They're the same store.

271
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,920
Um, they're basically, um, I.

272
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,480
You know, nobody's making, nobody's starting new department stores anymore.

273
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,760
It's weird.

274
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,960
Yeah, it's, it's bizarre.

275
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:09,840
I guess Amazon, um, there was a quote in, um, there's a quote in the, the WCHS story

276
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,040
and I'm sorry to cheat on Rob Johnson by not talking about WSCC, but in the WSCC story

277
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,480
about the Sears one closing, they captured, they got, I got a quote from the manager of

278
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,280
the Huntington Mall, formerly Joe Johnson, our, our, uh, uh, down the block neighbor

279
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:31,280
now, uh, replaced with, uh, Vals and Tenno and Vals and Tenno, um, a human, as he's always

280
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:37,600
quick to point out to anybody who hears his name, Vals and Tenno says, everybody knows

281
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,920
Sears for good or for bad.

282
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,160
Whoa.

283
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:42,880
Drag him.

284
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,320
Fucking get him, Val.

285
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,280
Damn.

286
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,480
Anyway.

287
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,760
Anyway, how about another.

288
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,400
It's a pretty, pretty sick.

289
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Oh, fucking Sears.

290
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,760
Don't get me started.

291
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,920
Uh, yeah, uh, I would love that.

292
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,680
Uh, I visited my local CVS a couple of weeks back.

293
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,920
While there, one of the clerks asked me the name of the cologne I was wearing.

294
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,360
I didn't know what it was called, but I told him I'd come back in a couple of days and

295
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,320
let him know.

296
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,720
When I returned to the store, the clerk was nowhere to be found.

297
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,720
I returned to the store about once a week since then, but I haven't ran into that clerk

298
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,040
again.

299
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,680
Does he still want to know the name of my cologne?

300
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
How do I get this information to him?

301
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,040
Should I just give up my quest?

302
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,120
That's from CVS Cologne Conundrum.

303
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:34,800
It's weird that you don't know the name of the cologne you wear.

304
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,960
Presumably you have to pick up this bottle every day, right, to squirt it on you.

305
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,600
Right.

306
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,360
That, this may be an indication that it's time to practice some mindfulness in your

307
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,560
day-to-day life, maybe.

308
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,960
Stop going through the motions and really read your bottle of cologne every day.

309
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,240
That would be step one.

310
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,320
I don't think you should give up this quest because he wouldn't have asked if he didn't

311
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,880
want to know.

312
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,000
Why would someone ask something that they don't want to know?

313
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,440
He clearly is dying to know the name of your cologne, and it seems like you guys, much

314
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:13,200
like the hit film Serendipity, are just barely missing each other until you reconnect in

315
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,840
that magic moment and you're like, it's just like a body spray.

316
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,360
It's like an axe thing.

317
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,000
It's like an axe.

318
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,840
Oh my god, you're there.

319
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,320
It's fucking bod.

320
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,280
I found an old bottle of bod and I'm wearing bod.

321
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,000
Oh, thank god.

322
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,360
It was pretty viscous.

323
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,840
I had to scoop it out with a tongue depressor.

324
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,360
It didn't, it wouldn't, it wouldn't spray anymore.

325
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,880
It was all gummed up.

326
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,680
It's like a bod jam and it's, it goes on smooth.

327
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,720
Two, I have two thoughts that kind of dovetail into each other.

328
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,760
One, don't tell anyone the name of the cologne that you're wearing.

329
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,440
I certainly wouldn't because the last thing I want is other people out there smelling

330
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,760
like me, you know, and like stealing my profile, doing whatever the fuck they want with it,

331
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,240
robbing banks with a mask on.

332
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,400
That masked robber sure smelled like Griffin and then I'm in jail.

333
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:10,640
Yeah.

334
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,320
But the other thing is that you always have the opportunity when somebody asks you what

335
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,160
scent you're wearing to say like, oh, I'm not wearing anything, you silly.

336
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,880
Oh yeah.

337
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,400
This is my fair man's.

338
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,160
That's just, that's just me.

339
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,280
Also, it's been a long time since I bought cologne, but I remember that I would never

340
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,200
tell anybody the name of the cologne I was wearing because I can't remember the last

341
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,320
time I heard the name of a cologne and thought, that's a cool name of a thing to say out loud.

342
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,040
Yeah.

343
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,400
I mean, for a while, because I was a person in the 90s and early 2000s, I wore Curve.

344
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,840
Oh yeah.

345
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,280
And then for a while I got bored because everyone was wearing Curve.

346
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,720
So I started wearing him Bora Bora.

347
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,240
Oh yeah.

348
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,680
Oh, going on a trip.

349
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,740
Yeah.

350
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,640
There's just, I don't know a cool name.

351
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,840
Like what you could be like, what scent, what is that cologne?

352
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,760
And you would say a word and be like, oh, that was a cool thing to say out loud with

353
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,240
your face.

354
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,560
Yeah.

355
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,520
I mean, I did briefly have a stint where I tried on 23 by Michael Jordan when I tried

356
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,240
out for the high school basketball team because I was dressing for the job that I wanted.

357
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,440
But I was terribly allergic to this scent.

358
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Did Michael Jordan start 23 and me?

359
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,320
He did.

360
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,560
Yeah.

361
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:37,040
And originally it was a sort of program where he would fly to your house and he would show

362
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,080
you some of his favorite shots that he can take from like different places.

363
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,600
And also swab the inside of your cheek, but just cause.

364
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:45,920
Yeah.

365
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,800
That was just for him.

366
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,720
Griff, do you have another Yahoo?

367
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,960
I do have a Yahoo here and this one was sent in by Emma Cant.

368
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,240
Thank you, Emma, crushing it.

369
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,200
It's another anonymous Yahoo answers user.

370
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,880
Put your fucking name on your work, Michael Jordan asks.

371
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,400
Ooh, what a gift.

372
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,040
Titanic was such an excellent movie that it's hard to critique anything about it.

373
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,960
But what is something small you would critique about it?

374
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,440
I didn't like that the boat broke.

375
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,480
The boat breaks, it's like, what were you doing?

376
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,600
Yeah, they spend this whole movie like getting us way into the boat and way into like the

377
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,560
people on it.

378
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,240
And then they're just like, twist, the boat broke.

379
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,600
And you know, Jimmy Cameron like spent a bunch of money building this huge boat prop and

380
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,520
then he accidentally broke it and was like, I don't know, we got to keep making it.

381
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,640
Because they talked throughout the movie a lot about how the boat is unbreakable.

382
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,040
They're like, this is an unbreakable boat.

383
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,080
And then they break it.

384
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,920
And it's like, that's bad writing because like you said it was unbreakable.

385
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,560
You lied.

386
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,800
You are an unreliable narrator.

387
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,280
You said that the boat was unbreakable and then you broke it.

388
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,880
That's like having a murder mystery where it's just like, they didn't do it, but then

389
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,000
they did do it.

390
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,440
Well, you know that, you know why that happened, right?

391
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:03,840
Why?

392
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,960
This is actually pretty well established Hollywood lore.

393
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,440
I heard it.

394
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,480
I think I heard it on Blake Chuck.

395
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:16,320
He wrote like two thirds of a movie about these two people falling in love on the Titanic

396
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,200
and he couldn't come up with an ending.

397
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,480
And he's like, God, I've written so many fucking pages of this thing.

398
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,800
And then he's like, maybe, and then maybe what if the boat had sunk?

399
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,960
And everybody's like, are you kidding?

400
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,280
He's like, no, but what if it had sunk?

401
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,760
Well, and everybody's like, the Titanic was fine and is still fine to this day,

402
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,440
shoveling people back and forth.

403
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,920
And Jimmy's like, but what if it?

404
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,040
What if it broke and sunk to the bottom?

405
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,400
What if it broke and that was the end of the love story I did?

406
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,720
I also don't like that they don't end up together.

407
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,880
It sucks.

408
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,800
And this is my main problem with the movie.

409
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,800
If I'm going to, and it's a fucking great flick and it's like impossible to critique it.

410
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,440
But if I were to critique it, I would say that it spends a great deal of time

411
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:08,480
making me fall in love with all of these amazing characters like Jack and Kathy Bates.

412
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,080
And Billy Zane.

413
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,880
And Billy Zane.

414
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,760
And then like most of them die.

415
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,480
And it's like, why did you just spend like two and a half hours making me like get to know

416
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,720
Kathy Bates' character name only to kill her off, I think maybe at the end of the movie.

417
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
That's a fucking great.

418
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,240
Okay, Griffin, you have actually hit on something.

419
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,200
It fucking sucks.

420
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,600
It's a waste of my time.

421
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,240
Unintentionally, you've hit on something because the two main characters,

422
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,880
Jack Dawson and Rose, should have been Rose Dawson.

423
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,400
They should have gotten married.

424
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,600
Should have gotten married on the boat.

425
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,320
There was a captain right there.

426
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,760
You know, real quick.

427
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,400
I do want to just as long as I want to get to my point.

428
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,840
But Bill Paxton's character was named Brock Lovett.

429
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,920
And that is that is one of the few characters who is a complete invention by Jimmy Cameron.

430
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,120
So he's just like, what would be a good name for an undersea explorer?

431
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,920
I got it.

432
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,960
Brock Lovett.

433
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,360
Well, he said the name is Brock and someone said Lovett.

434
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,040
And he said, yeah, okay, perfect.

435
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,600
Exactly.

436
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:05,840
Good.

437
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,280
It's the Titanic sucks because you're getting invested in those characters, right?

438
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:19,200
And then towards the end, spoilers, but towards the end, the boat break and everybody sink into ocean.

439
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,480
And dies.

440
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,520
That actually made me sad.

441
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,000
Right.

442
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,720
And that's like, it was so stupid because I want to I want to watch movie to feel good.

443
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,200
Right.

444
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,440
Right.

445
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,280
But you actually you fucked up because it made me sad.

446
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,520
Yeah.

447
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,280
Why did you waste all this time?

448
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,040
What they should have done?

449
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm going to fix it real quick.

450
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,320
Yeah.

451
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:47,120
What it should have done is if Leonardo DiCaprio had been a real dingus the entire time.

452
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,680
Right.

453
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:55,920
Like he kept like, you know, like stuff like stealing Rose's wallet.

454
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,160
Yeah.

455
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,160
She wasn't paying attention and putting taking your dog and like your dog overboard.

456
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,720
Yeah.

457
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,320
Just kicking Kathy Bates every time she's on like just walking out.

458
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,160
Yes, I love that.

459
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,240
Exactly. Yeah, exactly.

460
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,160
Like putting out lit cigarettes and Billy Zane's bald head and he even did all this shit.

461
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:21,440
And then that would have kicked ass because when she shoved him off the door,

462
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,320
you would have been like, fuck, yes, get him.

463
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,480
And then she could have said something cool like, you know what?

464
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,160
We're breaking up and shoved him off the door.

465
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,560
Yeah.

466
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,680
Or how about this, Travis?

467
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,480
How about this?

468
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,440
How about when she's like, hey, you're dumped.

469
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,160
And then as he sank into the ocean and it's like, you'd feel good.

470
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,840
You would feel good if they did that.

471
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,840
And can I make one more note?

472
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,040
Can I make one more note?

473
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,280
I'd love to keep fixing Titanic for sure.

474
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,560
They're steering the boat, the captain's steering and he's doing a great job.

475
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,040
I think driving the boat is the actual proper.

476
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,520
But he's like, I'm going to steer it right next to this big iceberg

477
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
so everyone can get a good look at the iceberg.

478
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,400
And then maybe there's like a clumsy crewman who like, whoa, and he bumps the wheel.

479
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,200
And that's what makes it go into it.

480
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,960
So it's like, oh, this was like completely avoidable if it wasn't for like clumsy Steve

481
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,520
and like clumsy Steve like runs into the wheel.

482
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,400
And then, so it's kind of funny for a second.

483
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,000
And it's like a big like, whoa.

484
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,360
That could be really good.

485
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,760
Do you know what would be like fucking cooler?

486
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,360
I want to fix it more, okay?

487
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,680
Yeah.

488
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,760
What if you cut down the stuff with Jack and Rose to about five minutes of the movie?

489
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:36,880
And I think, and I think we all know which five minutes.

490
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,000
As long as they're there, by the way.

491
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,440
Then when he was done drawing her, he should have said, now draw me.

492
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,800
His dick and his balls.

493
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,760
Three, okay, so five minutes of it is that.

494
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,240
And the other three hours and 10 minutes is you animate the iceberg

495
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,440
and give it like, make it talk about all its hopes and dreams and shit.

496
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,080
And then when the boat comes, you're like, oh, fuck no.

497
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,600
No, not the iceberg.

498
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,880
I see the iceberg.

499
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,400
He's about to get hit by a boat.

500
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,840
Get out of the way, Icy.

501
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,600
And you'll just be screaming about that.

502
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,640
Those people will keep going.

503
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,240
You won't give a fuck about that.

504
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,760
They can all think for all you care.

505
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,000
All you care about is like, is Icy okay?

506
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,360
And here's the thing about this version.

507
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,400
He is.

508
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,760
Oh, okay.

509
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,480
He's fine.

510
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,280
He's cool.

511
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,040
Maybe he doesn't even notice.

512
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,400
You feel happy about it.

513
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,440
You like that.

514
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,520
Can I give one more note?

515
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,320
Well, let me do one because I haven't gotten to tell a joke in a while.

516
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,820
Okay.

517
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,560
They also could have done, they could have had their cake and eat it too

518
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,360
where Jack's sinking into the bottom of the ocean and dying.

519
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,520
And all of us are like, wait a minute.

520
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
This movie is making me feel pretty bad right now.

521
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,720
But then he wakes up on the boat still not broken.

522
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,600
And it was a dream and looks over and him and Rose just finished like hooking up again.

523
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:56,160
Yeah, and they get married and like, she looks at him and is like, what's wrong, my love?

524
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,600
It seems like you're having a bad dream.

525
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,840
He was like, I was, but now it's over.

526
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,480
And guess what?

527
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,600
And he holds up the big blue diamond necklace.

528
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,120
He says, I got the treasure.

529
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,840
And then that's the end of the movie.

530
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,840
And then, you know, like he got the treasure and gets like, they're going to have a lot of money

531
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,760
whenever they get off the boat and they're going to have a cool ride.

532
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,240
And they'll return in Titanic 2, Teutonic.

533
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,280
But in the Titanic we got, which now I'm thinking about it is a shit flick.

534
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,080
It sucks.

535
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,840
The more we pick at some of the loose threads, I don't even feel like the cinema sins on this one

536
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,640
went far enough because it's like, there's some really bad ones.

537
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,400
We start out with Brock fuck it.

538
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,200
And he's like, I'm going to find the big treasure to get lots of money.

539
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,280
And you're like, oh, that would be fucking cool.

540
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,160
I can't wait to watch this.

541
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,720
I love movies about like finding cool treasures.

542
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,760
And then you watch this whole movie thinking like, when is the treasure going to come into play?

543
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,600
And then they like tease at it a few times.

544
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,520
And then she is wearing it in the nudity sequence.

545
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,800
And then like at the, and then at the, and the whole time, all these people die.

546
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,840
And you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

547
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,080
But like, is Brock going to get the cool treasure or not?

548
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,240
And then at the very end, she throws it in the water.

549
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,360
No, thank you.

550
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,120
What's the point of this movie?

551
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,520
I would like to add a little bit to that scene to fix it.

552
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,560
Well, not to fix it, but just to kind of highlight it for a moment.

553
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,440
Because I think she should, well, she shouldn't drop it in the ocean.

554
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,280
But if she does drop it in the ocean, her daughter, who is also there,

555
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,080
should walk out and say, hey, did you just throw that priceless gem in the ocean?

556
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,600
You have a family.

557
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,560
You have a family.

558
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,400
You could have given that to me.

559
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,840
And that really would have helped, you know, our financials.

560
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,760
I live in a crude tit that I fashioned together from those drawings of yours

561
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,240
that you gave me of yourself naked.

562
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,240
I have to live in a crude tit made out of naked drawings of you.

563
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,680
Please just sell the neck.

564
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,400
What the fuck?

565
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,000
You've had that this whole time?

566
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,520
When dad needed surgery and we had to do a GoFundMe,

567
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,000
you had a fucking heart of the ocean?

568
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,520
We could have sold?

569
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,040
But then she says, no, no, no, no.

570
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,680
Look down there.

571
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,800
It's a shithead whale.

572
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,000
And you look down and she landed it right in his blowhole and he died.

573
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,760
That's pretty good.

574
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,680
I named him Jack after another shithead I knew that died also.

575
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,200
Can I get one more note?

576
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,760
He's been Mad Dog in our boat here this whole time.

577
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,720
But don't worry, I took care of it.

578
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,600
I have one more note.

579
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,880
I have one more note.

580
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,680
Yeah, please.

581
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,680
I think they should have hooked up in a cooler car.

582
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,360
Yeah, that old busted joint that they hooked up in.

583
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,800
That raggedy old car that they had was absolutely embarrassing.

584
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,280
Picture this, a sick, like, firebird.

585
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
Like, oh, yeah.

586
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,680
Like, oh, with the top down.

587
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,920
And maybe they're blasting, like, some Eagles music while they're, like, doing it.

588
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,600
Travis, look out above.

589
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,440
Fucking Oscars are falling off of you.

590
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,560
Oh my god.

591
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,320
And what would be dope is, like, when the hand comes up and, like, slaps the window

592
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,840
and wipes some of the steam off the window of the Bugatti that they're shagging in,

593
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,840
you see now through the cleared window, Kathy Bates is just, like, looking in there like,

594
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,540
great.

595
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,440
Oh my god, I just got a fax from Jimmy.

596
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,960
He said, Justin would love for you to walk through the beats on Av2.

597
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,920
Yeah, all right.

598
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,800
See, make sure.

599
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,600
I'm thinking about delaying it just so I can really crack this nut.

600
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,040
What if Avatar 2 was just a sequel, like, a backdoor sequel to Titanic,

601
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,120
where they got in there and it was, like, a VR session?

602
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,600
Stop it.

603
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,200
Avatar is a perfect film.

604
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,520
Never seen it.

605
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,440
It's not a piece of shit like Titanic.

606
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,640
Avatar is perfect.

607
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,960
Yeah, because it's bad.

608
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,880
They have badass fights and it makes you feel good at the end of it.

609
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,360
It's weird.

610
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,200
I think it's time for a Titanic reboot.

611
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:40,800
The good news is, because of our incredible fortune in becoming Jimmy's sort of dudes behind

612
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:46,960
the scenes pulling all the strings, we no longer require the money from our advertisers.

613
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,400
That's wonderful news for us.

614
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:48,960
Yes.

615
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,680
And it's also wonderful news for this week's charity that we've selected.

616
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,640
Yeah, this week we are donating our ad revenue to the Foundation for Black Women's Wellness,

617
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,560
which is all about supporting and advocating for black women and their families during,

618
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,240
well, especially right now during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it's all about, you know,

619
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,200
supporting those families and keeping them safe and healthy all the time.

620
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,640
So you can read about it.

621
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,320
We'll have a link to that in the episode description.

622
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,720
Perfect.

623
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:29,360
Let's go to the Money Zone.

624
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,440
I want to talk about Honey.

625
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,320
I love the stuff.

626
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,200
Comes from bees.

627
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,280
Don't get people confused.

628
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:43,200
Honey is an online service that you plug into your web browser and when you're shopping online,

629
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,640
you're about to check out, there's a little Honey pops up and it's like, hey, can I save

630
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,520
you some money real quick?

631
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,080
And you're like, sure, I guess.

632
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,880
And that's Honey for you.

633
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,920
Are you reading?

634
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,320
This ad copy is out of control.

635
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,040
I'm reading the ad copy now and that's what threw me?

636
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,560
Okay, so this is the fucking ad copy for Honey.

637
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,360
In case you, okay, it saves you a lot of money when you're shopping online.

638
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,920
You should absolutely get Honey.

639
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,120
But listen to this.

640
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,440
This is the ad copy that they sent to us.

641
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,840
Only one sponsor could properly ring in 20 Honey.

642
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:24,000
Honey, the free online shopping tool packed back by PayPal that gets straight to business

643
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,840
by automatically finding the best promo codes when you shop online.

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,720
Just download Honey, shop like normal, click apply coupons and watch the prices drop.

645
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,280
Outstanding.

646
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,560
Outstanding.

647
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,880
Thank you for your inspiring work, Honey.

648
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,760
I don't like direct addressing Honey.

649
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,080
It makes me feel like a sleazy boss from the 60s.

650
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:52,480
But anyway, I have had to buy a few tools lately when I have been checking out.

651
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,320
I've used Honey and I've saved like 50 bucks just this week via Honey.

652
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,640
You're just losing money if you don't use it.

653
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,760
It's free.

654
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,880
It installs in seconds.

655
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,480
It's super easy to use.

656
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,720
Just go to joinhoney.com slash brother.

657
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,680
That's joinhoney.com slash brother.

658
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,480
Give it a try.

659
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,880
You will not be sad that you did.

660
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,720
You'll be happy.

661
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,320
The opposite, happy you did.

662
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,240
Well, I don't want to get, you know what I mean?

663
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,000
Listen, you live in now, you won't be happy, but you won't be sad.

664
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,480
How's that?

665
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,880
Uh, hey, stamps.com is going to get you stamps without you needing to go to the post office.

666
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,800
And that's like, that's let's just put the tiger on the table and yell at it.

667
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,560
You don't need to go to the post office to get stamps for, you know, your letters or

668
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,560
packages or whatever, because stamps.com brings all the services of the US Postal Service right

669
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,560
to your own home or your office or wherever you're, you're laid up right now.

670
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,800
Stamps.com has all the services, the US Postal Service, except it's in your computer.

671
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,000
And so that's pretty cool.

672
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,080
Uh, use your computer and like on reboot.

673
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,600
Yeah, basically like reboot.

674
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,400
So you have all kinds of mail carriers that live in there and

675
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,320
they play all your video games for you.

676
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,040
Uh, stamps.com will help you print official US postage for any letter, any package, any

677
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,720
class of mail, anywhere you want to send it 24 seven, no questions asked.

678
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,400
I don't know that last part.

679
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,480
They may ask a couple of questions to make sure the mail gets to the right place.

680
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,840
But anyway, once it's ready, you just leave your mail for the mail carrier and you, or

681
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,560
you schedule a free package pickup or you drop it in a mailbox.

682
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,000
You don't have to touch anybody, which is great.

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,040

All one word that's stamps.com.

690
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,240
Enter my brother.

691
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,680
Stay safe, my friends.

692
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,040
Listen, I'm going to talk about Warby Parker in a second.

693
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,000
But first, do you guys ever think about the mythology that Reboot was building that was

694
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,680
every time you played a game on your computer, you were putting the residents of your computer

695
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,160
at risk?

696
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,400
Every time.

697
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:08,720
Okay.

698
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,640
That's a weird thing.

699
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,080
Oh, you want to play that cool racing game?

700
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,720
Murderer.

701
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,520
Yeah.

702
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,320
Now, back to Warby Parker.

703
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,720
Warby Parker was founded with the goal to create boutique quality eyewear at

704
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,120
revolutionary price points.

705
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,680
And they did it.

706
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,120
I, this is not a joke, am wearing Warby Parkers right now.

707
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,720
And if you're like me and Griffin and not Justin-

708
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,160
Why would that be a joke?

709
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,880
What?

710
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,440
Why would that be a joke?

711
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,840
That would be a really shitty, not funny joke.

712
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,280
If I said like no bullshit.

713
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,040
Listen, this is a no bullshit zone.

714
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,320
I'm wearing Warby Parkers.

715
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
They probably don't love the cursing and stuff.

716
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,520
No bullcorn.

717
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,120
It's a family company, Travis.

718
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,360
The Warby Parker's on my face right now.

719
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,160
They're adorning my nose and improving my vision.

720
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,400
And Griffin wears glasses too, and Justin does not.

721
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,320
And the end of Travis' book report on who wears glasses.

722
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,280
My favorite thing is Warby Parker doesn't just offer glasses.

723
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,080
They also offer sunglasses, which I require to see when it is bright outside.

724
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,320
They also have contact lenses and eye exams.

725
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,480
They're committed to providing exceptional vision care online and in stores.

726
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,040
We have a Warby Parker store here in Cincinnati.

727
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,280
So I love them.

728
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,040
They're comfortable and they have sizes big enough to fit my giant head,

729
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,800
which I really appreciate.

730
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,080
And they're stylish and cool.

731
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,560
Warby Parker is committed to providing exceptional vision care online and in stores.

732
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,480
The glasses start at $95.

733

It includes prescription lenses.

734
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,040

Oliver Wong and Morgan Rhodes.

743
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,160
Go ahead, caller.

744
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,160
Hey, I'm looking for a music podcast that's insightful and thoughtful,

745
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,760
but like also helps me discover artists and albums that I've never heard of.

746
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,240
Yeah, man.

747
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,640
It sounds like you need to listen to Heat Rocks every week.

748
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,080
Myself and I'm Morgan Rhodes and my co-host here, Oliver Wong,

749
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,360
talk to influential guests about a canonical album that has changed their lives.

750
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,600
Guests like Moby, Open Mic Eagle,

751
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,440
talk about albums by Prince, Joni Mitchell, and so much more.

752
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,440
Yo, what's that show called again?

753
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,240
Heat Rocks, deep dives into hot records.

754
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,240
Every Thursday on Maximum Fund.

755
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,320
So a brief story before we move on.

756
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,440
Last month, which seems like 100,000 years ago,

757
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:03,440
we recorded a brief interview with our dear friend, Dr. James Buffett,

758
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,760
about life and how to stay calm in the face of calamity.

759
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,920
Home summer vibes.

760
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah, summer vibes and a little bit about his new album,

761
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,480
Life on the Flipside, that came out last month.

762
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,600
And then in the face of the Black Lives Matter protests

763
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,520
and just everything going on,

764
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,680
it didn't seem like a great time to be encouraging people to relax.

765
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,760
To live in island time, necessarily.

766
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,720
Yes, exactly.

767
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,520
And I would argue that it is still not that,

768
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,960
but we still think it's important to take a little bit of time to breathe

769
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,320
just so you can get back out there.

770
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,240
And when you need a second to breathe,

771
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,160
there's nobody better than Jimmy Buffett to help you do that.

772
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,280
So let's check in with Jimmy.

773
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,640
We're joined by, for an update on progress of coronavirus research,

774
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,200
we're joined by lead researcher, Dr. James Buffett.

775
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,160
Dr. Buffett, how is work going on the antidote for coronavirus?

776
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,840
Have you almost got this thing figured out?

777
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,480
Uh, yes, I do.

778
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,040
It's, uh, it's jellyfish.

779
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,240
Jellyfish?

780
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,840
Where we least expected it.

781
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,080
The venom of the jellyfish,

782
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,520
or is it part of like a diet, a sort of dietary situation?

783
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,120
I think that it's the venom.

784
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,040
I'm not supposed to say.

785
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,640
Oh, okay, yeah, you want to keep it out.

786
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,160
You know what's going to happen now,

787
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,720
they're going to say,

788
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,080
Jimmy Buffett's found it.

789
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,360
Why did y'all open this?

790
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,560
And I actually responded to that question.

791
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,160
I'm just guessing here, Jimmy,

792
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,640
and this is Jessica, this is related to nothing,

793
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,760
but have you been awarded any honorary doctorates

794
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,960
from any universities?

795
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,800
Are you Dr. Jimmy Buffett yet?

796
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,760
I am, I am.

797
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,960
Yes, I knew it.

798
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,160
Wait, I got one in here.

799
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,360
Maybe it's in the room.

800
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,880
Just got him lying around.

801
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,160
Just like, reach out.

802
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,520
It's a pile of honorary doctorates.

803
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,520
I swear to God, it might be.

804
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,000
He's got one under a wobbly table leg somewhere.

805
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,760
No, no, oh no.

806
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,200
That's the CMA award for, uh, where was it?

807
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,720
Country Music Association Musical of the Year.

808
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,720
I don't know what the fuck that is.

809
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,220
Okay.

810
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,720
No, but I do.

811
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,560
I have a doctorate of music from the University of Miami.

812
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:14,960
Nice.

813
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,360
All right.

814
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,640
They don't disown something.

815
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,760
Dr. Jimmy Buffett says, Jellyfish, uh, how are you, uh,

816
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
how are you handling it?

817
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,720
How are you, how are you dealing with it?

818
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,000
You know, it's funny.

819
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,800
No matter how good things are in my life,

820
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,040
I usually have the thought,

821
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,120
well, I bet Jimmy Buffett's probably having more fun

822
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,400
than I am right now.

823
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,200
And I feel like this period is the one shot I have

824
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,440
where maybe at any given moment,

825
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,840
I might be having more fun than you are.

826
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,960
Just in, in one moment, one, no, you're shaking your head.

827
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,160
No, no.

828
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,520
I bet you've been in just like some boring place.

829
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,680
You're probably in Cleveland or something.

830
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,600
You're stuck, landlocked in Cleveland.

831
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,040
Malibu.

832
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,680
Dang it.

833
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,800
Dang it, Jimmy.

834
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,600
This is my chance.

835
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,880
Stuck in Malibu.

836
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,680
Now I have heard Cleveland referred to as the Malibu of Ohio.

837
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,760
Listen, I couldn't agree more.

838
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,560
Listen, I'm very, you know, they've been very,

839
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,560
very good to me in the state of Ohio.

840
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,600
Yeah.

841
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,840
For a couple of days there, I was climbing the walls,

842
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,760
but I'll tell you what it was.

843
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,680
Uh, I read this article early on.

844
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,600
You know who Scott Kelly is?

845
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,880
You know, the astronaut?

846
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,040
No.

847
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,640
He's an astronaut, right?

848
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,840
He's that astronaut.

849
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,400
Thank you.

850
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,280
Thanks, Travis.

851
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,520
He was, he is the man that has spent the longest,

852
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,920
the human that has spent the longest time in space.

853
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,440
Look at us all out here now.

854
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,360
It could be pretty like locked in,

855
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,600
but when you're on the space station.

856
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,880
Right.

857
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,520
The interesting thing was the common sense things

858
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,520
he put out there kind of calmed me down

859
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,320
and it made me think of long sailing voyages that I did.

860
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,680
And that's exactly what I did,

861
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,880
because like when I used to do long trips,

862
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,400
you know, you know, thousand miles or so down from Newport

863
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,680
to British Virgin Islands or to St. Barts or from Lauderdale,

864
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,720
still a long trip, you know, and you're on your own out there.

865
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,560
So the way it usually started out was a party at the dock

866
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,080
and you got a little drunk and you were hungover when you left

867
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,120
and they go, and it pretty much never,

868
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:28,160
uh, never ceased to fail that something major on your boat would break

869
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,800
or a huge storm would hit you in the first day or two

870
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,800
while you're still trying to get over your hangover.

871
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,080
And there are times probably I was weeping to myself,

872
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,000
but I should be back on shore eating eggs,

873
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,880
vented into the force.

874
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,720
He said, why am I out here?

875
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,240
Then you have to kind of slap yourself in the face and go,

876
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,920
hey, get it together and get in the groove.

877
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,200
And you do.

878
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,400
I just want to say, Dr. Buffett,

879
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,720
this might go completely against your entire ethos,

880
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,080
but the idea of being hungover on a boat during a storm

881
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,200
sounds like the worst thing in the world to me.

882
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,120
This is the worst thing I can imagine.

883
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,800
No, there's something worse.

884
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,200
Hungover on stage in front of 10,000 people.

885
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,280
I don't do that anymore.

886
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,760
Listen, that was one of the, please, baby Jesus,

887
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,080
if you let the adrenaline get in here and let me get through this,

888
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,320
I swear to God, I will never do this again.

889
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,200
That happened at about 50, and I haven't done it since.

890
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,120
So we have a few more, like a decade and a half of good,

891
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,040
hard living ahead of us before we have to.

892
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,040
Yeah, don't go there yet.

893
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,560
I'm not saying stop today.

894
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,680
Hey, it has been seven years since you've released a studio record.

895
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,280
I think Songs for Sale Somewhere was the last one.

896
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,840
Why, and now you are back with Life on the Flip side.

897
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,560
How do you know when it's time for you to put out a record?

898
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,320
Do you wait till you have enough songs, you decide,

899
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,960
yeah, I got to sit down and focus on this long enough to do one?

900
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,680
You know what, Justin, it's a little bit of both because,

901
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,400
you know, I was having a lot of fun being Jimmy,

902
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,280
but in the meantime, there was work going on,

903
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,880
which was the musical that took a lot of time.

904
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,120
And that was the first four months of the year and then touring.

905
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,120
And then we were immediately into preparing it for the road.

906
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,600
So between that and then all of a sudden jumping into the Kygo world

907
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:36,880
and becoming what they anointed me, the godfather of Tropical House,

908
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,480
I enjoyed playing around in there.

909
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,080
So I was kind of, you know, my creative stuff is going in those directions.

910
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,600
And, you know, before that, other things were doing it.

911
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:53,200
And then it's the time flies, then you went, damn, it's been seven years.

912
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,840
And we were starting to write and I had some pretty good songs.

913
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,480
And we, you know, it was a great thing.

914
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,200
But the Coral River Band, we loved being in the studio.

915
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,320
I mean, some of the best times I ever played music was in that studio with my band

916
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,880
because we built that little studio in Key West.

917
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,800
And that's kind of our little magic spot.

918
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,960
And so we went, hell yeah, let's concentrate for the rest of the time on writing

919
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,280
and go in in January and do a record.

920
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,400
Let's see what it does.

921
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:28,080
You know, we've always, when we made an album, it wasn't trying to get famous or get successful.

922
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,280
Thank God that's happened.

923
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,120
So I don't have anything to prove out there.

924
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,680
But we just wanted to make a record that, you know, if you liked what we do,

925
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,200
you can add this to your collection.

926
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,080
So that was the driving force. And when we got into it, we, you know,

927
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:46,160
as you do something like that, I wasn't working on any other things

928
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,040
and I concentrated for the last seven months on writing songs.

929
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,280
We don't have like a specific like question from the audience

930
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,400
like we usually do for these guest segments.

931
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,920
Is anybody listening?

932
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,400
There's a small diehard contingent of fans.

933
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,760
You can't keep a fan base with quality music.

934
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,000
You can't keep a fan base with quarantine.

935
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,320
Well, they've all realized they could be baking bread

936
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,760
instead of listening to our show.

937
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,360
And they're like, wait, this is more interesting.

938
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,760
Yeah, they've all picked up new hobbies and left us behind.

939
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,280
But that kind of goes into the question.

940
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,640
We also had Liz Gilbert on the show during this quarantine

941
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,920
and sort of talked to her about the same thing.

942
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,040
And I'm curious your thoughts like how you remain creative,

943
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,440
like how you are sort of fostering that part of yourself in the midst of all of this.

944
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,960
Because I know there's like a lot of our listeners

945
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,160
who have all this time in their hands

946
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,160
and feel like they should be using it to make something,

947
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:42,000
but don't really are finding it tough to sort of get up the guts to actually do it.

948
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,560
You know, I've missed a few days, but I've been pretty true to it.

949
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:53,840
And that is the first thing is, you know, to look at how we can keep our fan base,

950
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,440
which already was up there like looking at our Wednesday and Saturday shows.

951
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,280
You know, we were a little bit ahead of the curve there

952
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,720
with Margaritaville TV and Radio Margaritaville

953
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,880
because we, you know, we can't go out.

954
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,560
Everybody kind of gathered there.

955
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,880
And so we had a locked in audience.

956
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,400
And so we wanted to entertain them.

957
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,000
So we've been, that was one thing.

958
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,360
And we're still doing that.

959
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:22,160
And the other thing was I started playing guitar more and going over jazz chords.

960
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,400
Oh, really?

961
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,200
Yeah.

962
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,120
And I got, well, I got this guitar.

963
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:27,920
I don't have it here.

964
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,960
But the people at Benedetto that make these beautiful jazz guitars.

965
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,760
You know, they started in Italy, but they're made in Savannah, Georgia.

966
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,360
And they were going to make me one.

967
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,720
And the factory shut down.

968
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,920
And I had a loaner.

969
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,880
So I still got it.

970
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,160
And it's this beautiful guitar.

971
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,880
So I had this great Benedetto jazz guitar.

972
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,360
Thank you, Howard Paul, who's the CEO.

973
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,840
And, you know, they're waiting to go back to work too.

974
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,040
So I've got this beautiful jazz guitar.

975
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,240
And, you know, I'm not a big jazz player.

976
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,520
But I love listening to it.

977
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,920
So I started playing a little, looking for some little augmented sevenths and chords

978
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,720
as I was writing.

979
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,680
I had this guitar.

980
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:11,440
So I'm doing like an hour a day of just playing guitar and also an hour a day of French.

981
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,360
Because, you know, I speak fairly good French.

982
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,400
But this is a good time.

983
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,120
And I'm doing better now because I'm doing it a lot.

984
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,040
I go up on a podcast and talk to people.

985
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,440
And I'm reading The Little Prince in French.

986
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,720
Have you thought about releasing a French jazz album?

987
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,520
There you go.

988
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,800
Really alienate everybody.

989
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,560
How did that not cross my mind?

990
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,280
I don't.

991
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,880
Listen, I would buy it.

992
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,160
You call it James Buffay Presents.

993
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:40,880
And then you make it.

994
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,440
I mean, I would listen to the hell out of that.

995
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:49,440
Jimmy, as someone who's been to several of your concerts and has heard people just sing

996
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,640
along with every word, I would fucking adore one night to hear you be like, hey, everybody,

997
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,200
I'm just going to groove for the next 30 minutes.

998
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,560
I'm just going to sit here and just kind of noodle on some of this.

999
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,000
You all know French, right?

1000
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,440
OK, just follow along.

1001
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,560
You know French and jazz, Gordon.

1002
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,120
You want to see an audience move out quick, you know?

1003
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,120
Concessions and merch sales are going to spike.

1004
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,240
Just inject some of that into your most beloved songs.

1005
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,800
Just start singing a chorus of Margaritaville in French.

1006
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,440
It's like, what?

1007
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,200
Let's see.

1008
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,440
Wasted Away would be Nippon Tancourt.

1009
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,880
It'd be, who cares?

1010
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,760
Nippon Tancourt and Margaritaville.

1011
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,560
That's good.

1012
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,200
I like that.

1013
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,160
Yeah.

1014
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,600
Je besoin une grande vase de sel.

1015
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,520
All right.

1016
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,400
Yeah, I love it.

1017
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:50,080
Quelque chose en dite en femme, c'est moi en faute.

1018
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:50,880
There you go.

1019
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,800
You can just cut that out by Spotify.

1020
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,160
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1021
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,520
We've got something here.

1022
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,320
Oh, here we go.

1023
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:56,880
Oh, here we go.

1024
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,680
Lay it down, OK.

1025
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,080
All right, jazz cards.

1026
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:00,800
OK, let's do it.

1027
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,040
OK.

1028
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:11,360
OK, where's my song?

1029
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,520
This is great.

1030
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,480
This is good, though.

1031
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,440
This sounds really good.

1032
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,000
That hit Jimmy Buffett's single, Where's My Song.

1033
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,600
18,000 people out quick.

1034
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,600
OK.

1035
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,400
Listen, you might have to start in much smaller clubs for a while.

1036
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,680
Yeah, you got to build back up.

1037
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,640
Oh, James Buffett could be your Chris Gaines.

1038
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,200
What do you think?

1039
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,240
Oh, my god.

1040
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,240
Don't even talk about Chris Gaines.

1041
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,320
I know.

1042
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,000
Finally, somebody speak it out.

1043
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,720
You were such a fan and so heartbroken when that phase of his career was so short lived.

1044
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,400
I'll never forget when Jimmy Buffett found out that it was just Garth Brooks the whole time.

1045
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,680
He was crushed.

1046
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,520
Hey, before we let you go, Jimmy, one last thing.

1047
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,320
Justin, I think of you as we've talked about your heart rate before in detail.

1048
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,960
This can be a stressful time.

1049
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,240
We've talked about keeping busy.

1050
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,360
What would be your advice for people that are feeling stressed,

1051
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,840
feeling kind of pent up and losing it?

1052
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,240
How do you how do you how do people keep calm?

1053
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,960
Well, you know, I think that keep a little bit busy, but do something, you know,

1054
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,760
and do something, you know, like reading to me.

1055
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,240
I mean, if you start there and you don't have the ability to get out or do anything else,

1056
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:35,600
read good books, you know, and if you're not a reader, start reading because it can take you there.

1057
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,320
It really can.

1058
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,160
We all know that, you know, to me, great writers read and listen, you know,

1059
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,680
and that's where I start first at reading.

1060
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:49,520
I mean, if that was basic, you know, and then if you got room, get a paper,

1061
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,600
get a room, get a ping pong table.

1062
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,500
Okay.

1063
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,800
Jimmy, this is the second time you've recommended reading on our show,

1064
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,200
and I'm so I can't I'm so fed up.

1065
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,280
It's the it's the least you want to read.

1066
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:03,600
Okay.

1067
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,000
Okay.

1068
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,880
Forget reading.

1069
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,200
I'm going to cut that out and make my ring tone just now.

1070
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:09,920
I'll tell you what.

1071
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,440
Let's get back to the ping pong table.

1072
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:11,680
Okay.

1073
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,120
Thank you.

1074
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,520
The Buffett family are all ping pong players, except my wife.

1075
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,560
My kids and I, and even my dogs can chase the ball, right?

1076
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,280
My dogs are here.

1077
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:21,840
You want to see them?

1078
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:22,800
Yes.

1079
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,400
Watch this.

1080
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,520
Let me see if this will work.

1081
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,480
Wait, let's see.

1082
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,800
Hey, Gracielola, beach.

1083
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,520
Want to go to the beach?

1084
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,200
They're unmoved.

1085
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,320
Nothing's happened, Jimmy.

1086
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,040
How about this?

1087
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:37,920
Tree, tree.

1088
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,520
I think they're asleep, Jimmy.

1089
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,520
Wait, Jimmy, those are stuffed dogs, pal.

1090
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,920
You've been in, you've been locked up for too long.

1091
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,800
Oh, they are stuffed dog.

1092
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,360
I forgot.

1093
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,400
No, no, no.

1094
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:52,720
No.

1095
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,040
Okay.

1096
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,720
The other, yeah, but they make little.

1097
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,840
My son has one in his apartment here and he showed it to me, but it's a little

1098
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:05,760
ping pong table that's got to be maybe four feet by three feet that also pops

1099
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,320
open and it has little pool cues hitting and you can shoot pool on it.

1100
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,680
They don't cost much either.

1101
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,000
Yeah.

1102
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,640
I know something that people could do to help with their anxiety.

1103
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,000
And that is to pick up a life on the flip side.

1104
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,920
The new studio album by Jimmy Buffett.

1105
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,640
I was about to say in stores.

1106
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,520
Don't do that.

1107
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:29,520
It's just, you know, buy it on, on, on the internet, wherever fine albums are sold.

1108
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,640
Where's that these days?

1109
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:33,440
Yeah.

1110
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:33,840
Okay.

1111
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,640
Well, fair enough.

1112
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,200
I don't know.

1113
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,480
I'm a podcast guy, Jimmy.

1114
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,040
I don't know.

1115
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,160
We give our stuff out for free.

1116
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,760
But thank you so much for joining us as, as always.

1117
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,840
It is, is a treat and a delight.

1118
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:47,360
Yeah.

1119
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:47,840
Well, thanks.

1120
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,360
I'll just stay in touch with you guys.

1121
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:49,920
And always.

1122
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,840
I love listening to the show and best everybody out there.

1123
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,040
And, uh, hopefully you'll get back on the road too.

1124
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,640
When you do, it'll be a big, big, they'll be ready for you.

1125
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,480
Co-headliners, the tour America's been waiting for.

1126
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,840
You can open, you can open for us anytime.

1127
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:08,960
Yeah.

1128
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,720
I was going to say the same to you, Jimmy.

1129
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:10,880
Yeah.

1130
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,840
Let's not, let's not worry about the building.

1131
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,400
It'll be a competition between that and, and your, uh,

1132
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,120
French jazz to see who can clear the place out the quickest.

1133
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,920
You're the one that made me do that.

1134
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,480
You guys.

1135
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:22,960
Yeah.

1136
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,440
Y'all are.

1137
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,240
You did great.

1138
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,720
I liked yours.

1139
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,440
All right.

1140
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,400
Thanks, Jimmy.

1141
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:28,880
Fins up.

1142
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,120
All right.

1143
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:29,840
Thanks guys.

1144
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,640
Always great.

1145
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,600
Great to see you.

1146
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,480
Stay safe.

1147
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:32,800
Bye.

1148
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,040
Here is a question.

1149
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,120
I'm in the process of writing a fairly serious fantasy novel set in classic olden times.

1150
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:41,520
Yeah.

1151
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,480
My problem is this.

1152
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,760
What is the best word to use when referring to a character's butt?

1153
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,200
This is a fairly serious scene.

1154
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,520
So I don't want to sound anachronistic or suggestive at the same time.

1155
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,720
I don't want to sound stuffy or puritanical.

1156
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,320
So what's my best option?

1157
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,800
That's from chasing tail words in Chattanooga.

1158
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,880
Clef.

1159
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,800
First off, I will say congratulations on being what I assume is the only fantasy

1160
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,400
author in Chattanooga.

1161
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,280
You're doing that's that's I don't even know.

1162
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,440
I don't even know how to begin diagnosing what that was a slam on what that was.

1163
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:19,520
Just didn't seem like you hear about a lot of a lot of fantasy authors from Chattanooga.

1164
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,120
I mean, there's probably not a lot.

1165
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,840
Why would you even why would you even say that?

1166
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,800
Just killing time.

1167
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,040
Okay.

1168
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,120
It's fucking mean though to Chattanooga.

1169
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,080
It's not mean.

1170
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:28,880
How is it mean?

1171
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,920
It's not even judgmental.

1172
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,440
It's mean to Chattanooga and the people who are writing fantasy.

1173
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,120
Why is it mean to Chattanooga to say that I don't think there's a lot of fantasy authors?

1174
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:41,600
I mean, it's maybe a mild burn, but you didn't even need to say it.

1175
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,440
You didn't even you didn't even need to.

1176
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,200
What's blowing me away is you didn't even need to be mean to Chattanooga.

1177
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,640
And I'm not being mean to Chattanooga to say there's not a lot of fantasy.

1178
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,480
Like, there's not a lot of serial killers from Huntington.

1179
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,880
Did you do your own census in Chattanooga done just by Justin McElroy?

1180
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,960
Juice, I hope it was before COVID because that's a lot of human exposure that you did

1181
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,760
when you went door to door asking who was fantasy novelist in Chattanooga.

1182
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,120
I'm not helping with this anymore.

1183
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,560
You guys come up with butt names on your own.

1184
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,440
I'm muting here.

1185
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,280
So I've got some synonyms for butt here.

1186
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,080
Yeah.

1187
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:15,920
Backside.

1188
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,080
Backside.

1189
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,720
Okay, but let's set the terminology here.

1190
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,760
Justin, please come back.

1191
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,080
It's not my fault you were mean to Chattanooga.

1192
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,640
So you can't take this out on both of us because you realize how

1193
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,080
shitty you are being to Chattanooga.

1194
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,440
Travis and Griffin, as usual.

1195
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:30,640
It's not a beat.

1196
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,840
I've muted myself out.

1197
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,600
It's not a problem, but it's just fucking Travis and, you know, the classic stuff.

1198
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,760
Yeah, I was dunking on Chattanooga.

1199
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,240
This is the usual shit.

1200
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,120
Yeah, I hate it too.

1201
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,600
Who do you think he's talking to Griffin?

1202
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,800
It's a shit ball talent no fantasy authors go to.

1203
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,680
All right.

1204
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,480
That's why I'm surprised there's not more fantasy authors

1205
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,640
just so they can pretend to be anywhere else.

1206
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,160
He probably called John Scalzi.

1207
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,400
John Scalzi.

1208
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:57,920
I didn't hear.

1209
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,440
No, nobody's talking about John Scalzi.

1210
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,000
Why would you-

1211
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,440
Sweetheart, why would you say John Scalzi?

1212
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,720
There's nobody talking about John Scalzi.

1213
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,440
Yeah, Old Man Swore is dope though.

1214
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,160
You're right.

1215
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,040
Dairy Error.

1216
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,280
Dairy Error is funny.

1217
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,160
I mean, that's the thing.

1218
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:12,640
Are you trying-

1219
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,320
When you're doing this serious sexual fantasy novel, are you trying to-

1220
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,440
Is it like a funny scene?

1221
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,920
They said it's a fairly serious scene.

1222
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:25,120
So that probably rules out Tushy, which the thesaurus.com recommended.

1223
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,720
Now let me throw this out.

1224
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,640
Haunches.

1225
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,040
Fuck.

1226
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,560
See, I should have stayed muted because I was going to use haunches.

1227
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,920
That was my haunch.

1228
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,800
Like, he showed his haunch to them in a serious way.

1229
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,560
What about his cleft?

1230
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,080
Which I said earlier, I understand why.

1231
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,120
His bottom cleft.

1232
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,760
I want to know what is the scene, okay.

1233
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,000
What is the scene that's not funny and it's not suggestive,

1234
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,680
it's just a regular serious scene about butts?

1235
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,640
Yeah.

1236
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,680
Oh, it's sexual, like he takes off his pants and-

1237
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,000
No, does not want them to be suggestive.

1238
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,280
So it's not sexual.

1239
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,240
This is fairly serious.

1240
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:14,160
Oh, so like he is being stripped nude to be brought before the King's Court Council.

1241
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,680
The official butt.

1242
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,880
Oh, then it's keister.

1243
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,640
His keister, no.

1244
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:19,920
No, that's not-

1245
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,880
I'm the KBI, I'm the King's Butt Inspector.

1246
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,760
Fanny?

1247
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,560
I'm the FBI, the fiefdom butt inspector.

1248
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:29,440
Is it-

1249
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:35,280
The problem is, the only thing that I'm seeing that I think like is fairly serious is like bottom.

1250
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,400
But that just sounds like so infantile.

1251
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,200
What about, ooh, posterior?

1252
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,160
No.

1253
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:42,480
No.

1254
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,200
What's wrong with that?

1255
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:43,760
Sounds like a grandpa.

1256
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,120
Overly clinical.

1257
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:50,800
A big thing that authors like to do whenever they're talking about somebody's privates

1258
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:56,560
or back privates is they will say, they will use like metaphor and be like, his big pumpkin.

1259
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,360
Yeah, yeah.

1260
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,400
And it like, if I were to-

1261
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,120
They do that all the-

1262
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,360
You're right, Griffin, all the time, I'm seeing that.

1263
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:10,800
The King's Counselor stripped the bad night of his clothes and exposed his wormy and his big

1264
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,680
pumpkin.

1265
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,920
Then I think people would know which one is the penis and which one is the butt, right?

1266
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,200
Yeah.

1267
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,640
Hey guys, we're all adults here.

1268
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,960
We all know what the big pumpkin is.

1269
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,400
Yeah, it's what Linus worships.

1270
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,920
Now let me throw this out.

1271
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:32,800
You need to maybe add a gerund in there that will make it seem more serious and fantasy

1272
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,120
and stuff.

1273
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:38,240
So if you say like, exposing his quivering cheeks, right?

1274
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,920
Now it's like, ooh, that's some writing.

1275
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,160
You can't just say, exposing his butt.

1276
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,120
That's nothing, right?

1277
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:51,360
That's just, that's first draft, exposing his, all I can come up with is quivering cheeks.

1278
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,960
I mean, you could just say his big fat ass.

1279
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,200
His juicy dumper.

1280
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,440
No, no, not his juicy dumper.

1281
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,200
Dumper is not the right vibe.

1282
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:13,200
I think just saying like, he takes off his pants before the king's council and reveals

1283
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,720
his big, his fat ass.

1284
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,880
Then people are going to read that and like, it may catch him off guard, but they'll be

1285
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,280
like, oh, this is a character development trait I didn't know about.

1286
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,120
But now when I think about them, I am going to think about-

1287
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,200
Explains a lot of their choices.

1288
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,240
It explains a lot.

1289
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,600
And like that fight scene that I envisioned earlier when I was reading the words and like

1290
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,200
trying to figure out what it looked like in my mind.

1291
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:35,840
Now that I know that he's packing heat in them Jordashes, like then it's going to change

1292
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,840
a lot of what that fight looks like.

1293
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:41,360
It makes so much sense because the entire book, they've been carrying themselves like

1294
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,880
someone with a fat ass.

1295
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,440
And I never imagined it.

1296
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,200
I thought he was just kind of full of himself and a little bit of a bragger, but it turns

1297
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,120
out, no, he got that fat ass.

1298
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,800
When he kills a dragon with a spear and you know that he's got some heave and Levi's

1299
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:56,960
in there, then you are going to think about the fight in a different way is all I'm saying.

1300
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,760
And you know, and I know what you're saying question, I was like, I don't want it to be

1301
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,080
funny.

1302
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,160
So let me give you this suggestion.

1303
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,880
A lot of the times as a reader, I don't know if something is supposed to be like what the

1304
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,960
tone is to see until someone else responds to it.

1305
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,720
So here's what I suggest.

1306
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:18,080
He removed his pantaloons before the inspector revealing his fat ass.

1307
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,840
And then you have the inspector say, well, this is very serious.

1308
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,560
That's a serious ass.

1309
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,520
Well, I see.

1310
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,080
This is a serious chunk of back meat.

1311
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,760
Nothing funny about that ass.

1312
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,000
Just a regular fat ass.

1313
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,240
Those are two serious butt cheeks.

1314
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,560
Well, witcher, this is a very serious ass you've brought before us.

1315
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:42,400
I must speak with the council to decide how to deal with that ass.

1316
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,420
Witcher!

1317
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,400
Witcher!

1318
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,360
Well, bounce a coin off your witcher's ass.

1319
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,320
O Valley of Plenty.

1320
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:53,680

Try again.

1334
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:27,440
I'm saying Jordan and Jesse Go, Bubble, which, you know, there's not like new episodes or

1335
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,640
anything, but it's still great.

1336
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,680
Still worth a listen.

1337
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,560
Why are you so bad at talking about the other shows on the Maximum Fun Network?

1338

01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,040
You ever listen to Heat Rocks?

1344
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,440

01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,480
Yeah.

1355
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,160
Did we thank John Roderick in The Long Winters?

1356
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,440
No, because-

1357
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,560
For the use of the Zoom time off, it's a departure off the album within a day.

1358
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,840
The one and the same.

1359
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,440
Thanks, John in The Long Winters.

1360
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,880
Do y'all want that final?

1361
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:21,760
Yes, please.

1362
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,480
Yeah, absolutely.

1363
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,400
Well, let me fucking find it.

1364
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:25,280
Okay.

1365
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,840
Hold the fucking phone.

1366
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,000
Here's another Emma Cant Joint to close us out.

1367
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:32,800
Thank you, Emma.

1368
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,200
It's from Yahoo Answers user Samantha, who asks,

1369
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:42,720
can you get a tongue piercing if your tongue isn't healthy?

1370
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,000
Oh, boy.

1371
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:45,920
Oh, boy.

1372
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,560
Oh, boy.

1373
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:49,760
My name is Justin McElroy.

1374
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,680
I'm Travis McElroy.

1375
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,400
I'm Griffin Mac.

1376
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,120
Is that too gross?

1377
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,160
Should I do a different one?

1378
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,360
No, you already said it.

1379
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,560
This has been my brother and me.

1380
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,080
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

1381
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,080
Kiss your dad square on the lips.
