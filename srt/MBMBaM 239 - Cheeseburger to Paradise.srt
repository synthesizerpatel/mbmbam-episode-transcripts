1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,560
Welcome, my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:57,040
On this week's episode, we have a gigantic palette, but there's only one hue that is represented.

7
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:05,840
And that's right, it's 50 Shades of Grey. Watch, 2015.

8
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,440
Step into my office, said the spider to the guy.

9
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,880
We gotta be. Let me check your references.

10
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,120
At least like you've got a lot of experience. What would you say to 50,000 a year?

11
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:32,400
50,000 Shades of Grey is more gray than your human mind and your human eyeball cones can possibly even conceive.

12
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,600
Curious about our health benefits?

13
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,400
Here's one benefit, that boner.

14
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Here, let me describe to you one 50,000th of these shades. I'm gonna punch your butt.

15
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Don't punch it, it's so good.

16
00:01:52,400 --> 00:02:00,400
It's a book so nasty that people in the black section of Sherwin-Williams get looks like, oh, you nasty.

17
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Oh, you nasty motherfuckers.

18
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
I'm just looking at all the different shades of gray.

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,400
This used to be a nice Christian community, Sherwin-Williams.

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
And you made that one dirty section.

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Made a dirty, dirty color.

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,400
It's enough to make you turn to your wife and say, let's just go with mauve.

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:26,400
If it sounds like my recordings coming to you exclusively in the right channel of your headphones,

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,400
it's because I'm favoring that butt cheek because my other one's so tender and sore from punching.

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Mr. Gray, remember last night when you punched my butt?

26
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Yeah, I'm suing you for sexual harassment.

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,400
No, you can't check the contract, section B for butts.

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:56,400
That's how I keep it categorized, B section, all butt stuff, including indices J through K, punching.

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
My inner casual Friday.

30
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:06,400
My inner goddess awoke to punch his butt, and then he was punching my butt, and then we punched each other's butts back and forth.

31
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,400
You done butt punched the cum right out me.

32
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Sorry, Debra.

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Debra, I laughed.

34
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Let me try that take again.

35
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,400
You done butt punched the cum right out me.

36
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,400
We ADR'd in all of Christian Gray's lines, so the real guy doesn't do anything.

37
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
It's just the three of us taking turns.

38
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Yeah.

39
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Oh, man.

40
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,400
How many times in the novel does he or she give the other one purple nurples?

41
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
How purple are their nurples?

42
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,400
I am the oldest master of your sexual destiny, Justin McElroy.

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,400
I'm your middle-est HR representative, Travis McElroy.

44
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
I'm Griffin McElroy, the emperor of piss.

45
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Oh, man, I don't know a goddamn thing about this film or book.

46
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
I think we are nailing it.

47
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
I think we're doing pretty good.

48
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
A lot of people described it, they said it was just like pornography.

49
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,400
I don't think those people have seen pornography.

50
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Do they have wet butts?

51
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Because if not, then it's not like the pornography I've seen.

52
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,400
As my wife pointed out, it's probably just a bunch of butts, right?

53
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Butts for days.

54
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Butts on butts on butts.

55
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,400
I made this point to my wife, Rachel.

56
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,400
I feel like when I say the words I'm about to say to you, the audience,

57
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
she maybe loves me a little bit less.

58
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
I shave a little bit off of the reservoir there.

59
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,400
But that movie can't show penetration.

60
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
It just can't show penetration.

61
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
It cannot show penetration.

62
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
This is the nastiest book ever,

63
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,400
but the movie can't even show a penetration scene.

64
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Any object in any orifice.

65
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,400
At best, it's a softcore, late night, HBO, Cinemax kind of movie.

66
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
At worst.

67
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Even that can show the bottom of a ball as it penetrates, possibly.

68
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,400
But just a ball, left or right.

69
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
And only the bottom quarter of it.

70
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
And I'm saying we're not even going to get that.

71
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
So it's a God's damn point.

72
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Just read a book.

73
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Well, don't read that book.

74
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Use your imagination.

75
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Read any other book, honestly.

76
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Watch the pornography of your mind.

77
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
I think there's ropes and chains, right?

78
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Slinging hands.

79
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Who's your daddy? Yes, I am.

80
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
And a gross misrepresentation of the whole BDSM lifestyle.

81
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
But other than that,

82
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,400
one minor thing upon which the entire book is built.

83
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
It's a fine read. A breezy read.

84
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Do you think that the BDSM community

85
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
reads Fifty Shades of Grey in anger

86
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,400
the way the Wiccan community reads Harry Potter?

87
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Um, yeah.

88
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
There's no butt-punching in BDSM.

89
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
What are you even saying, Fifty Shades of Grey?

90
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
What?

91
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Now all the first-timers are going to come in

92
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
and just start punching butts day one.

93
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
That's a professional move.

94
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Let's see here.

95
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
Hey, Mistress Jasmine,

96
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
could you step into my office for a minute?

97
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
We've had a lot of complaints.

98
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
We're going to have to let you go from the BDSM club.

99
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Yeah.

100
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
Why? I punched one butt?

101
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Yeah, but we have a zero-butt-punch strike policy.

102
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
I walked into the fuck prison

103
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
and just shouted whale on my pee-pee.

104
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
That's not allowed?

105
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Okay.

106
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
No, that was okay.

107
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
I don't think that was the problem.

108
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
I can't help myself. I see those cheeks.

109
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
They look like little speed bags.

110
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
I'm training for the fight.

111
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
I got a fight coming up.

112
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
Uh, Mike's son is about to lose his first tooth.

113
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Oh, on this show, it's like questions and stuff.

114
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
My son is about to lose his first tooth.

115
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
His best friend received $100 goddamn dollars

116
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
from the tooth fairy,

117
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
and my son seems to think that amount is normal.

118
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
How do I manage his expectations

119
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
without losing the magic?

120
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
And that's from Dentally Injured

121
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
in Delaware.

122
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Here's the point I'll make,

123
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
and I know I'm coming at this from an adult

124
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
who is, at best, tooth fairy agnostic.

125
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Mm-hmm.

126
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
I'm not tooth fairy theistic.

127
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
I think the truth is out there somewhere.

128
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
But I'm just not willing to commit

129
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
one way or the other.

130
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
If I had to choose

131
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
between losing a tooth

132
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
or paying $100,

133
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
I would pay $100 every time.

134
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
It's not even a question.

135
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Each of my teeth,

136
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
I have currently in my head,

137
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
let me do some quick math,

138
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
probably $3,000 worth of teeth

139
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
going for me.

140
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
This seems about right.

141
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
I got about 30 teeth up in there.

142
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
That sounds right.

143
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Let me count them real quick.

144
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
That would be real good radio.

145
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
I have about $3,000 worth of beautiful enamel

146
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
in my mouth,

147
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
and I'm not willing to trade any of that for $100.

148
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Now, I'm doing fairly well for myself these days.

149
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
If I was in Hot Dog's era,

150
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
I would have gone to the tooth bank

151
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
and just started swapping those bad boys out.

152
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Griffin, you know that the deal with the tooth fairy

153
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
isn't that you're buying the teeth from the child, right?

154
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
You're not saying,

155
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
hey, Tim, pull it out.

156
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
No, I'm just saying if we're looking for a way

157
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
to establish value, all right.

158
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Losing your teeth is the worst.

159
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
It's the nightmare I have most commonly

160
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
is the tooth losing nightmare.

161
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
I think a lot of people can relate to that.

162
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
How much money would you spend

163
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
on leaving your mouth?

164
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Yeah, that's a toughie, right?

165
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
I don't know what that figure,

166
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
I don't know what that's worth.

167
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
It's definitely more than $1,500

168
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
to replace a tooth in my mouth.

169
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Yeah, now we're talking,

170
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
if we're going into the medical community,

171
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
each tooth could arguably be worth

172
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
anywhere between $800 to $20,000.

173
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
I feel like we're ignoring

174
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
something about this question,

175
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
and that is that

176
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
kids

177
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
lie all the time constantly.

178
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
They're never not lying.

179
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
They're 100% lying forever.

180
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,400
No question.

181
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Call this kid's family.

182
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Guarantee they didn't even know he lost a tooth.

183
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Let me pitch this scenario

184
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
to you though, Justin.

185
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Hey, Debra,

186
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
you grabbed that tooth from under Timmy's pillow,

187
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
and you put a dollar.

188
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Yeah, I just grabbed a dollar out of your wallet,

189
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
but I didn't have any dollars in my wallet.

190
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
I just hit the bank.

191
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Oh, shit.

192
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Actually, I just saw one,

193
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
and I was like, let's just go with it.

194
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
I just grabbed a bill,

195
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
because who keeps $100 bills in their wallet, Steve?

196
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
This is why we have money troubles.

197
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Justin, this is something that you're going to run into

198
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
eventually with your spawn,

199
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
your brood.

200
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
I think $1 for a tooth,

201
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
even a child's tiny,

202
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
insignificant, bullshit tooth

203
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
that can't do much chewing of anything in any way,

204
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
I think $1 is garbage.

205
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
First of all,

206
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
inflation, crazy.

207
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Inflation would be crazy right now, you guys.

208
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
$1 isn't going to buy you anything.

209
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
It's not even going to buy you an issue of Us Weekly.

210
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
I think you're making a fair point.

211
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
I don't really see that it's up to me,

212
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
but I think it's a fine point you're making.

213
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
I'm just saying,

214
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
at the very least, $5,

215
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
and then at least the child...

216
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
But how would I weigh into that decision?

217
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
How would I weigh into that decision at all?

218
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
The tooth fairy comes to you and says,

219
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
what denomination of currency?

220
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Where are you at economically?

221
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
They want to make sure

222
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
they just keep it within...

223
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
They don't want to make the kid richer than me

224
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
at that particular moment.

225
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Yeah, because then they become the parent.

226
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
That's the law!

227
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Why do you think that Britney Spears' parents

228
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
just fucking robbed her blind?

229
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
Justin Bieber just got robbed blind?

230
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
It's because none of these parents

231
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
want to be the children.

232
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Right, and that's what happens.

233
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
That's what that Head Start thing you hear so much about?

234
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
That's what it is.

235
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
It's a parental swap-a-rooney.

236
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
It's a freaky Friday,

237
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
but it's been codified into a business.

238
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
I have a suggestion for the question asker.

239
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Go.

240
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Instead of money,

241
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
swap it for some kind of good,

242
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
like maybe a new Xbox game

243
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
that costs less than $100.

244
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
That's awesome.

245
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
But in a child's mind...

246
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
It might as well cost $10,000.

247
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Yeah, like, oh, I got something.

248
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
That's way better.

249
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
That's a really good idea.

250
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
$60 for a new AAA video game

251
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
is still a crazy amount of money to spend.

252
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
But I'm saying you could pick up

253
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
a certified pre-owned game.

254
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Oh, great.

255
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Thanks, Madden 96

256
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,400
for the original PlayStation.

257
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Oh, this is great.

258
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
I love how it has eight different stickers on it.

259
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Thanks, GameStop.

260
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
You're a really good company.

261
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Oh, and it smells like weed, and that's fun.

262
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Madden 96, who was even playing football back there?

263
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Is that Deon Sanders on the cover?

264
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Is that Deon?

265
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Okay, I mean, I guess I wasn't alive

266
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
when Deon Sanders existed,

267
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
but that's totally...

268
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Why does it say on the back

269
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Bow Nose Tackling Fidelity?

270
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
I don't understand.

271
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
How old would you say is the average kid

272
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
who's losing teeth and swapping them with the tooth fairy?

273
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Like seven?

274
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
I should learn this.

275
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Is that like seven?

276
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
I feel like five to ten is really the sweet spot

277
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
where all the goddamn teeth fall out of your head.

278
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Childhood is the worst.

279
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Because I feel like

280
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
maybe he's going to lose sight of the fact

281
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
that his friend got 100 bucks

282
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
by the time he gets like a 20.

283
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Yeah, or he'll lose sight of it

284
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
when the parents of the $100 child

285
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
go completely broke.

286
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
They could go completely bankrupt.

287
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Because they're going to spend $30,000.

288
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Well, $3,600 if they keep it up.

289
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
I would like to suggest

290
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
that if you are leaving $100,

291
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
there is no amount of like being rich

292
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
where you would think that is a good idea.

293
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
I would like to suggest

294
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
that if you are leaving $100

295
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
under a child's pillow

296
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
for a tooth,

297
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
there is only one logical reason

298
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
that you are leaving $100

299
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
and that is only one logical reason

300
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
that would be happening

301
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,400
and that is money laundering.

302
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
You are trying to launder a large sum of money

303
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
through your child's mouth

304
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
so the federales can't get their grow units on it.

305
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
It's also,

306
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
I would pitch another scenario

307
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
that this kid's parents

308
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
forgot to swap the tooth

309
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
like the last three times.

310
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Oh, I see.

311
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
We got to do something big for this one

312
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
or he's going to stop believing.

313
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Well,

314
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,400
I'm glad we could talk about that

315
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
instead of my thing.

316
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
I was saying that they are equally likely.

317
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
I thought they were honestly,

318
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
I mean, if I was running

319
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
a chuckle school, I would say

320
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
the concept of

321
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
forgetful parents versus money laundering.

322
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,400
Money laundering.

323
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Maybe more comedy.

324
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Oh, you want to interrupt to get that?

325
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
Yeah, cool. Like what do you got now?

326
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,400
What do you got now, Keratop?

327
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
I got your chocolate and my peanut butter.

328
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
I got my peanut butter and your chocolate.

329
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
They're forgetful money laundering parents.

330
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Did we launder that money?

331
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Ah, we're in jail. Fuck.

332
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
We were supposed to launder $10 each time.

333
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
We'll just do $100. No one will notice.

334
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
Surely he won't tell the kids at school.

335
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
Where do we put the books we've been keeping

336
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
for the mob? I don't even know.

337
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Fuck.

338
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Which mob are we in?

339
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
I'm so shitty at this.

340
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Are we in your mob?

341
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Sorry, sorry. I know this is awkward.

342
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
Are we in the Scarface mob

343
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
or the Japanese mob?

344
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Are we Yakuza?

345
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Honey, are we Yakuza?

346
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Are we supposed to be putting Yakuza money

347
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
in Dylan's mouth?

348
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Is this ornate dragon on my back

349
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
a gang thing?

350
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
I just love dragons.

351
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Is there a rumble tonight or is that tomorrow?

352
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Did we miss it?

353
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Honey, I just broke a pool cue

354
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
over my knee and God help me

355
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
if I could remember what I was going to do with it.

356
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
That was our last good pool cue.

357
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
The other ones are all warped and bent.

358
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
If only we hadn't spent all that money

359
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
laundering it for our child

360
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,400
and the two fairies.

361
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
Honey, you put the actual money in the laundry.

362
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
No.

363
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
This is bad.

364
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Now this is like the Amelia Bedelia school

365
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
of mafioso life.

366
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
You're such a scatterbrained mafioso.

367
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
You're supposed to put dates in the pudding

368
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
so you cut up a calendar.

369
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
You're Amelia Bedelia.

370
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
Amelia Bedelia Corleone.

371
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
You don't know nothing about money laundering.

372
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
You dummy.

373
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Y'all want a yahoo?

374
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Let's just take a quick moment

375
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
and take our game and recognize

376
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
the game of Rachel Sperling.

377
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Thank you Rachel Sperling.

378
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Rachel Sperling who was at the

379
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
San Francisco live show.

380
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
It was basically a celebrity.

381
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
We got a bunch of emails and tweets

382
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
from Rachel Sperling.

383
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
And Davenport was there.

384
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
My boy D. Big D.

385
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
They fought.

386
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
The ground shook.

387
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
And San Francisco's not there anymore.

388
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Just because there was a flurry of blows

389
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
exchanged between them.

390
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
Thank you Rachel Sperling.

391
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,400
It's by yahoo answers user Jacob who asks

392
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
how can you dominate

393
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
each zodiac sign?

394
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
What is every zodiac's weakness?

395
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
I just want to know

396
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
how can you dominate very zodiac sign

397
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
in a friendship type of way?

398
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
How do you become dominant in a relationship

399
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
with any zodiac, especially

400
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Geminis? I would also

401
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
like to know what every zodiac sign's

402
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
weakness is emotionally and

403
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,400
mentally.

404
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Here's some Fifty Shades shit

405
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
isn't it? Okay so

406
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
wait hold on. Is this dude looking

407
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
for something that's like oh if you make eye

408
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
contact with a Scorpio they're yours forever.

409
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
And that's right Travis. If you make

410
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
eye contact with a Scorpio usually it's hard

411
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
to do because Scorpios are trained to just

412
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
sort of look into the

413
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
middle distance.

414
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
They will look intently

415
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
at a chin or nose but never in the eyes.

416
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
But if you can trick one of them into doing it

417
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
their soul is

418
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
legally your property.

419
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
So that's what Scorpios are all about. That was very

420
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
astute Travis and I didn't know that you were

421
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
a student of the stars.

422
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
I only know one other one.

423
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
What's that? It's Aquarius.

424
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
If you squeeze their right pinky finger

425
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
short squeeze, short squeeze, long

426
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
squeeze, short squeeze, short squeeze,

427
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
short squeeze. Just bang out the Konami

428
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
code on their digits

429
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
and then what does that do?

430
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
That means

431
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
that they owe you five dollars every day

432
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
for the rest of their lives. And you do that

433
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
to enough Aquarii.

434
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
You got a little cottage industry.

435
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Yeah you're set. You're good to go.

436
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
Cancers they actually

437
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
have a glowing weak point on their belly.

438
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
That one's easy.

439
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
If you punch that then they void their

440
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
bowels.

441
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
And you've got that on them.

442
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
You punch that it flips them over.

443
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
They kind of lie there on their back like

444
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
and then you want to use a

445
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Deku nut. If you use the Deku

446
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
nut it stuns them.

447
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Right.

448
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Taurus.

449
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
I mean just stop

450
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
giving it gas I guess.

451
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
Low MPG.

452
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
It should put a stop to it.

453
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Uh huh.

454
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Also if you just sort of take grab their

455
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
horns then you can just like fucking

456
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
flip them right over. They can't do anything.

457
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
It's like grabbing a cat by the scruff

458
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
of its neck. And then there's

459
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
the monkey. No.

460
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
They're weak against fire.

461
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
No. No. No.

462
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Bulbasaur

463
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
is weak against fire and

464
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
bird types.

465
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
So.

466
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
God you're being

467
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
such a. You're acting like a real Bulbasaur

468
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
right now.

469
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
I know you're a Taurus but um

470
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
I'm in Aries and

471
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
as far as I know I don't really have any

472
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
weaknesses.

473
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
If that's your weakness you're hubris.

474
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Yeah I guess that's true. If there's a movie with a robot in it

475
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
and something bad happens to the robot

476
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
I'll cry for three and a half

477
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
weeks. That's a big issue.

478
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
That's a big one for me. Hey Griffin

479
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
are you going to go see Big Hero 6? I don't think I will.

480
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Thank you because I have plans next

481
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
Friday.

482
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
I don't want to still be crying. I don't want to still be crying

483
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
about Big Hero 6.

484
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Pisces. Their weak point

485
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
is the heart. You gotta stab them in it.

486
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Oh God.

487
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Okay well I think that would work for most of them.

488
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Not so much an emotional mental weakness.

489
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
I'm pretty sure everyone's weak in their heart.

490
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
No but Pisces

491
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
are especially weak.

492
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
Like here on your sexual contract you've written

493
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
down don't stab my heart.

494
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
And I have to be honest I wasn't planning on

495
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
doing that but I guess it's good to have a balance.

496
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
But now super curious.

497
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
I just want to say that I love the

498
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
context of this question more than anything.

499
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
I love it.

500
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
I love that there's a guy sitting there going like

501
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
I just want to be friends with everyone.

502
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
So how can I dominate them?

503
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Well you can't. You know what demands

504
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
you can't be friends with somebody

505
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
until they're just fucking

506
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
terrified of you.

507
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
It's called the Biff School

508
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
of making friends.

509
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
You really have to terrorize them

510
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
into being your buddy.

511
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Justin you have just broken my heart in twain.

512
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
This idea

513
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
that the plot of

514
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Back to the Future is really about

515
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
lonely lonely Biff.

516
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
McFly!

517
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
McFly what are you a cancer?

518
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
Come here. I'm gonna punch your tummy.

519
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
You find that

520
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
weak point. What if in the

521
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
moment when George McFly stood up to Biff

522
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Biff was just heartbroken like

523
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
but I thought we were friends.

524
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
This is just us right?

525
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
I give you a hard time

526
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
and you're kind of a dork but like

527
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Geminis of course their only weak point is being covered

528
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
in manure. It's the only way to kill

529
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
one. It

530
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
nullifies their regenerative

531
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
process.

532
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Cause there's two of them.

533
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
And also if you kill

534
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
one with manure it ripples back

535
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
through their bloodline and kills

536
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
all of the past versions of them with

537
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
manure as well.

538
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
If you wanted to do it scientifically

539
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
you could kill the past one and it would ripple forward.

540
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
That's a much easier chronic.

541
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
Makes a lot more sense.

542
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
Man.

543
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Just now thinking about that.

544
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
If Marty McFly had just sort of

545
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
murdered

546
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
what's his face? Mad Bill Hickok.

547
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
What was it? Mad Dog Tannen.

548
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Mad Dog Tannen shot him

549
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
right in the dome.

550
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Or covered him in

551
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
manure and then shot him.

552
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Or else there's no fucking.

553
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Well it's the only way.

554
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
It's the only way to ensure that the job gets done.

555
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Covered him in manure and shoot him.

556
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
And then that pretty much takes care of

557
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
well just about everything huh?

558
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
That wraps

559
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
up the series I guess.

560
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Do you guys want to do?

561
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
Should we do Future 4? I don't think we can.

562
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Because there is no

563
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
friction there. We murdered

564
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
all BIFs. Past, Present and Future.

565
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
The BIFpocalypse.

566
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
What if the fourth one is

567
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
they realized they needed at least one BIF

568
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
to like save the world.

569
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
And you have to go dig

570
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
back. Dig BIF out of

571
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
the poop before it gets shot.

572
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
If it gets shot it's fine. Don't worry about it.

573
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
No you have to go shoot yourself

574
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
before you shoot BIF.

575
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
You are the gunman on the grassy

576
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
noble. You are the third

577
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
man. You are the one

578
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
who has to bring yourself down before you shoot.

579
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Back into the future.

580
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Back into the future.

581
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Solid.

582
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Thank you. Thank you. Delicious.

583
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Next question.

584
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Let's see. We got one here.

585
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
I'm going with my wife

586
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
and a part of her family on a rather expensive

587
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
trip to Ful which has been

588
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
planned. Florida.

589
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Florida.

590
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Which has been planned for several months.

591
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
We are now very close to the trip

592
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
and a 50 something year old sister

593
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
who originally declined invite is

594
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
interested. However she doesn't want to pay

595
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
and wants to sleep on a cot with her boyfriend

596
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
in our beach front homes and closed

597
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
patio.

598
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
How should we handle this? That's from Jim City

599
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Slacker. Oh it's easy. Tell him

600
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
to fuck off. What are you even talking

601
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
about? We don't

602
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
want to pay so you're not going to get any money

603
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
out of us and we're also going to make you feel super bad

604
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
by sleeping on the ground.

605
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Is that okay? Is that an equitable

606
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
solution? We don't want to pay and we

607
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
want to have sex on your patio. We're not

608
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
only going to not contribute we're going to

609
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
make you feel shitty the whole time you're there. Is that

610
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
okay? Does that sound like do I am I a

611
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
good vacay buddy? So like

612
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
if you want to if you if you want to

613
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
take them and have them not pay

614
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
because times are tight but they

615
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
want to like hang out with you that's fine. Do

616
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
that. But don't like

617
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
this. I fucking

618
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
hate that. I'm not going to pay so

619
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
I'll just like live in poverty while you guys

620
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
do it up sleep in your

621
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
like you know thousand thread count

622
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
sheets while I huddle

623
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
up on the floor underneath some

624
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Us Weeklys. If you have any

625
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
bread crusts or any

626
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
rinds. Are you guys going

627
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
out to a nice dinner again? Well

628
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
don't forget the doggy bags I guess.

629
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Right that sucks. And then feed us like dogs.

630
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Just leave

631
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
leave your leftovers in a

632
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
pile on the floor

633
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
outside the mud room and we'll

634
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
me and Dan will just get to them. Don't

635
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
forget to slop your in-laws.

636
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Go ahead and put in a garbage bag if you

637
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
want. We'll just tear open the garbage bag and

638
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
then sleep in it later. We'll use it as a

639
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
blanket. We'll use it like

640
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
a little food womb.

641
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Just sleep

642
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
in your trash.

643
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
Now that sucks. Don't put any

644
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
chicken bones in there though. You know how we

645
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400
get. Dan choked on the last one.

646
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
He's dead now. I crawled inside

647
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
him for warmth. You thought

648
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
he smelled bad on the outside.

649
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
Well we haven't bathed in three

650
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
weeks. We don't have a

651
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
fancy shower like you people.

652
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
No I think that Griffin is

653
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
right and if it's like a matter of like they always

654
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
wanted to go but like they couldn't

655
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
afford it and now it's like hey would it be cool

656
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
if we went like that's

657
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
different than like hey sure

658
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
fuck it we'll go with you. I'm not gonna

659
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
pay because you already paid for everything right.

660
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
So like there's nothing to pay for. That's

661
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
shitty. Yeah that sucks.

662
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
I mean I'm not even saying that.

663
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
I'm saying if they want to go and not pay and you're fine

664
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
with it because you want to spend time with them and they

665
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
don't have the money right now and you

666
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
feel bad for excluding them and then your family and you

667
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
want to chill cool then have them along.

668
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
But the I mean

669
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
this is more advice for them than it is for you

670
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
I guess but just this act of like

671
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
we don't have money

672
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
so we're gonna

673
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
live like poppers

674
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
while you guys do up the high life like

675
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
that sucks. Can you imagine

676
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
being the

677
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
boyfriend and asking off

678
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
for work like

679
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
hey I'm gonna need this week

680
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
in July off

681
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
I am going to

682
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
stay with my girlfriend's

683
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
family on the patio

684
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
for free

685
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
for a week. I don't know why you would be

686
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
so specific with your time off

687
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
request. I think I'll eat a sandwich

688
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
on Thursday and maybe

689
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
see a movie on Friday.

690
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
I just think this is the ultimate expression

691
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
of beach life. I'm pretty sure

692
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
this is how Jimmy Buffett was born.

693
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
Like he realized he couldn't come back.

694
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
He was conceived on a patio. He was like

695
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
well once you stay for free

696
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
in somebody's enclosed patio

697
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
of your girlfriend's family

698
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
you really don't get to come back from that level

699
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
of chill. You can't

700
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
rebuild a normal life with your societal

701
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
bounds. Right.

702
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
What is this tie? It's a noose is what it is.

703
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Cause I once had the ultimate freedom

704
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
of sleeping in a

705
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
cot in an enclosed patio

706
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
with my girlfriend's family. I made love on a cat.

707
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
What?

708
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
On a cot on a patio.

709
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
I know freedom.

710
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
You said I made love on a cat on a

711
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
patio. Well that was my favorite

712
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
Jimmy Buffett song. Stay.

713
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
And my favorite scene from Garfield's

714
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Two Kitties.

715
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Stay put Fluffy. Dad's almost

716
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,400
done.

717
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Do you think that's what cheeseburger in paradise

718
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
that song is about? Is that

719
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Jimmy Buffett was starving to death on a family

720
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
vacation he didn't pay for and then a miracle

721
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
burger just appeared on his naked chest.

722
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Just floating. Floating

723
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
in the air. He had to chase it down the beach.

724
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
It's not your time James.

725
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Cheeseburger to paradise.

726
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
Cheeseburger I found in the trash

727
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
with my in-laws. Leftovers

728
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
half of a burger.

729
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Some old french fries and half

730
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,400
of a cake. It's just a cheeseburger

731
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
I found in the trash.

732
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,400
Cheeseburger or else

733
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
I'll die.

734
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
I like mine before the maggots get

735
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
to it. Next to the ketchup

736
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
but not the cheeseburger.

737
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Next to the ketchup but not

738
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
next to tampons.

739
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
None of that is in the garbage.

740
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Cheese tampon in paradise.

741
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Can't be too picky when you're close to

742
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:32,400
the edge.

743
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,400
Jimmy I don't think we can

744
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
release this song.

745
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Use your imagination to just

746
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
get it down.

747
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Hey Jimmy could you come to my

748
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
office real quick? I want to talk to you about your latest

749
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
single. Yeah it's just sandwiches

750
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
there. They're probably not

751
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
going to be good. Yeah it turns out it's the most popular

752
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
song ever.

753
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
We can't have it on the shelves.

754
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
It's uniting the world like

755
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
mild stallions.

756
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
He had to travel 800

757
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
years to the future to pin cheese

758
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
tampons in paradise.

759
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
How about a money

760
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
zone? Yeah.

761
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,400
We've talked about this before and we'll say it again

762
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
90 percent that's the amount

763
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
of time that you are in underpants.

764
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
Not sure.

765
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Get old fast.

766
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,400
No listen I don't want to like cause a stink with

767
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
the bullet points that Meandis has provided us but I

768
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,400
would say that number is much much much much

769
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,400
much much higher for me.

770
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
When was the last time you weren't wearing underwear Griffin?

771
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
I mean there's a

772
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
like an eight second period. No not even

773
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,400
that I would say about I would say there's about

774
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
a four second period there when I switch between

775
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
pairs of Meandis and

776
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
that's about all that you can get out of me

777
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
vis a vis my ding dong being exposed

778
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
to the world. Well

779
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
not everybody has those sorts

780
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
of

781
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
restrictions I think. Oh they

782
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
are not restrictive at all. They are

783
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,400
breathable and soft and I need them on me

784
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,400
at all times.

785
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
I am technically

786
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
speaking wearing Meandis right now

787
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,400
if you guys have to know the truth.

788
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Wait what do you mean technically like

789
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
you're wearing one on your head?

790
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,400
He's turned them into he's fashioned them into a sharp

791
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
bangle. I'm legally

792
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,400
wearing Meandis right now.

793
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
They're contractual Meandis.

794
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
I'm wearing contractual Meandis.

795
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,400
We call them Meandis by the way.

796
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,400
At this point I just

797
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,400
assume that everyone's does like

798
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
made the switch but if you haven't

799
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
Meandis is a great fitting

800
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
pair of underwear that's two times softer than

801
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,400
cotton and that is no BS.

802
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,400
100% true. They are lovely.

803
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,400
If you go to Meandis.com

804
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400

805
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
and different looks for both men and women.

00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
If you're you know it's

807
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
a little late because you've done Miss Valentine's Day

808
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
but let me just throw out matching underpants.

809
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
It's a good look. It's

810
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
Presidents Day right? Today is Presidents

811
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
Day when you're listening to this. Sure.

812
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Yeah. God it's going to be hard because

813
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
they have to ship them and stuff.

814
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
If you can go to the the Meandis

815
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
factory and get them hot off the

816
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
tap and then just like throw those

817
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,400
on your tip and then you're going to have

818
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
a Presidents Day style

819
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
that your partner or

820
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,400
your future partner that maybe you haven't even met yet

821
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
is just going to go a ga ga for.

822
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
And the Meandis fabric

823
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
is it's awesome. It fits great. Doesn't

824
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
ride up and it literally

825
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
pulls moisture away from your skin so you're cool

826
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
all day long. You're so comfortable

828
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400

00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
with these like my whole life. Let me

838
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
ask you two a question.

839
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
Hit me. Let me ask you two a science question.

840
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Okay.

841
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
You put the Meandis on

842
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
and then it draws the moisture

843
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,400
away from your zone.

844
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Uh huh. That is that

845
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,400
was that's what we've been told by corporate overlords.

846
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
And I've been told. Like a Fremen suit.

847
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
Yeah. I've been told that yes it's a Fremen

848
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
suit. You put it on and

849
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
I've also been told this just sort of by

850
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
my zone because it knows what it likes

851
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
and it likes dryness. And

852
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
it's Bluetooth compatible. It pulls

853
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
away your gooch juice

854
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,400
and it pulls it all away and it keeps

855
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
it super dry and it removes the moisture.

856
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
But it doesn't get very

857
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
soggy. Is it teleporting?

858
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Your gooch juice

859
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,400
away? Is it like a wizard?

860
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,400
Where is the juice going?

861
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
I don't know. The juice is loose.

862
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
The juice is loose but is it being fucking

863
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,400
procedurally atomized?

864
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
What's going on?

865
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Is it vaping my juice?

866
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Have you seen Willy Wonka in the Chocolate Factory?

867
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
And you know Mike TV? Yeah.

868
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Okay. Every time you wear Meandis

869
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
someone on your television gets wet underpants.

870
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Okay. That's cool.

871
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
That makes perfect sense. Anyway go to Meandis.com

872
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
slash my brother and try those

873
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
out. You're going to love them.

874
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Who else we got?

875
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Well we've got like

876
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
old school friend of the show.

877
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
Oh man. Classic. Nature

878
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
box. Classic

879
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
pals at nature box. I'm trying to think

880
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
of like how do you not already know about nature

881
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
box at this point? I just

882
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
assume that everybody at this point is wearing

883
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
Meandis and snacking on nature

884
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,400
box which are whole. I mean

885
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
you're going to snack right? Everybody's

886
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,400
going to snack. Everybody knows that. But

887
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,400
what nature box affords you is an opportunity

888
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,400
to do it in a healthy style.

889
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
Healthy. Not just healthy but like

890
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
with a rotation of like brand

891
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
new snacks every time you receive a box.

892
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
Like you're not going to. There's so many

893
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
options. So many different choices. You can choose

894
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
the same ones if you're like oh my god I

895
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,400
love those pistachio power clusters.

896
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
I never want to not have those. Great.

897
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,400
You can get those and then try like three or

898
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
four new ones that month. You know what I mean?

899
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
And you're like okay now I love this. We just

900
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
did garlic plantain chips.

901
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Whoa that sounds good.

902
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
They're insane. They're so

903
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
good. I have to make sure I don't just

904
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
keep eating them because then

905
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
all I will taste for the next three days

906
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,400
is garlic. But they're so good.

907
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
And tiny bananas. That's

908
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
what a plantain is.

909
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
A plantain is like a little baby banana. It's so

910
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,400
cute. But yeah there's like you can also

911
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,400
there's stuff like dried berries and like

912
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
some dried pineapple slices that are so

913
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,400
good. So basically any kind of

914
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
snack that you like whether it's savory, sweet,

915
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
spicy, whatever.

916
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Umami. You're going to find

917
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
something at Nature Box that you're like

918
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
okay yeah that sounds incredible.

919
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
And then you know you mix and match a couple

920
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
new snacks. And they have zero

921
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
artificial flavors, colors, or sweeteners.

922
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
Zero grams trans fat and

923
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
no high fructose corn syrup. So it's like

924
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
the best. And here's the best thing about

925
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
it in case you didn't already know.

926
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
You have the chance to try Nature Box for

927
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400

featuring five of their most popular snacks.

929
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
It's making me angry

930
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
now that you're lying. I am not

931
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
lying Justin. I am 100% telling the truth. There's no way

932
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,400
any deal could be this good.

933
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
It is that good Justin. And you know why?

934
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
Because we love our listeners. Nature Box

935
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
was like I don't know about these free snacks guys. And we put our

936
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
foot down and we dominated them. We stared

937
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
them in the eye and we said give them free

938
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
snacks. And they said okay please don't punch us in the

939
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
butt again. And they said but

940
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
you have to go to their house and hand deliver it and then

941
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
mouth feed it to them like a baby bird.

942
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
And I said that's fine. And that's

943
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
the only, listen, it's not ideal.

944
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
You're gonna wish

945
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
that you were eating these delicious

946
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,400
sriracha roasted cashews

947
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
without us having to chew them up and spit them

948
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
in your mouth like a baby bird. Well an adult bird.

949
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
But that's just

950
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
the way the cookie crumbles. But it won't

951
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
cost you anything. And we're very

952
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
discreet. We come in an unmarked brown

953
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
box.

954
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400

go? We eat them in here because we

959
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
had a very long journey in the postal service

960
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400

demonstrably better.

That word is so great isn't it?

967
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Demonstrably.

968
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Cause it's got demon in there.

969
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
And monster. Yeah. You can make

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400

demon monsters. But better

972
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
what is. What the hell is this thing you're telling me

973
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
about? Tell me what it is. Robocopter

974
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
Ski Patrol. I want you to when you hear those

975
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
words Robocopter Ski Patrol

976
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
first I want you to just sort of

977
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
smile. I got my wallet out. Just like

978
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
you saying it I got my wallet out.

979
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
Think Doctor Who crossed with

980
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Archer and a little bit of high grade alcohol

981
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
consumption. Does that sound awesome?

982
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Then you want Robocopter

983
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Ski Patrol. The best way to buy someone's

984
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
love especially the authors

985
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
and you know you want that.

986
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
This is a book written

987
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
by Aaron Seacross

988
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
that you can get on Amazon.

989
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
They have it on paperback or Kindle

990
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
if you like digi stuff.

991
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
And it is about a group of

992
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
quote idiots and perverts

993
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
and an international

994
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
conspiracy and there's

995
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
a great drawing on the front of the book

996
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
of the Robocopter in question

997
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
that looks like maybe I did it

998
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
when I was seven years old.

999
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
It kind of reminds me of the album art

1000
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
or the cover art for Grant Andrews

1001
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Kid Cop which is

1002
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
my classic book coming soon to Amazon.

1003
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
It looks great. So that's on

1004
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Amazon now. Think about

1005
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,400
it. Look inside your heart.

1006
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Just decide that you need Robocopter Ski

1007
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,400
Patrol in your life. And then

1008
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
just buy it. Don't think about it anymore.

1009
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
I have a message for Kevin.

1010
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Riptide Ruiz. I think

1011
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,400
I fucked that up. And it's from

1012
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
Ginny Rampage Hernandez

1013
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
and Sean Bandana Mitchell.

1014
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
Ginny or sorry

1015
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Rampage and Bandana say to Riptide

1016
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
The starry eyed

1017
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
angler gnashes through spinal

1018
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
caps left by spinal taps and constant

1019
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
lashes and knickknacks fallen

1020
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
around her tummy sack. Lay your

1021
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
head on the supple breasts of the mayor smoking

1022
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
crack. That laugh that was bathed

1023
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
in ichor comes from playing

1024
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
like a matador has us rolling on the floor.

1025
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Did I ever tell you your mother

1026
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
is a whore? Woof.

1027
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Woofa doofa. Hoofy doofy.

1028
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Rampage Bandana you're better than that.

1029
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
What happened?

1030
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
What did I just read?

1031
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
What was any of that?

1032
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
I think you're a slam poet now.

1033
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
I think I might be. Did I not slam

1034
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
that hard enough? The starry eyed

1035
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
angler

1036
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
gnashes through

1037
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,400
spinal caps.

1038
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
Hold on. I'm going to decipher this real quick.

1039
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
Oh Riptide

1040
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400

We're very proud of you.

1043
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400

1044
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,400
Farm wisdom. It's back.

1090
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
Griffin read the first one.

1091
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
This one is from Hannah who says

1092
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
donkeys hate canines.

1093
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
To protect your sheep from coyotes

1094
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
you should get a couple of donkeys.

1095
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,400
They get lonesome if they are only

1096
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
one. Ain't that the truth. Be

1097
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
very careful. They will sometimes

1098
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
kick and kill pet dogs.

1099
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
Man.

1100
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
You gotta really hate

1101
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
dogs. Yeah.

1102
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
You know that movie Must Love Dogs?

1103
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
Don't try to set

1104
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
a donkey up with Jenny Garofalo.

1105
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
I don't know what I just said.

1106
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
No that was

1107
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
what that movie was about. Was she in it

1108
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
or was that true about cats? Nope.

1109
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
Oh fuck. Okay.

1110
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
So now I know that. Also

1111
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,400
about coyotes. They love to

1112
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,400
hunt domesticated dogs.

1113
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,400
The way they do it is to send one

1114
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,400
coyote of the pack to play with the dog

1115
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
and lure it back to the pack where they will kill

1116
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
it and eat it. They don't eat

1117
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,400
the paws though. So if you see

1118
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,400
your dog playing with a coyote get it

1119
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
away fast. What the

1120
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
fuck coyotes?

1121
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
They're all honeypotting

1122
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
all over the place. They're setting up these

1123
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
irresistible honeypot play

1124
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,400
pin traps. This is some

1125
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
fucking garbage.

1126
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
I can't believe

1127
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
that coyotes weren't

1128
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
any better

1129
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,400
than this. You'd think they would have a little more

1130
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,400
respect for their superiors.

1131
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,400
Why do

1132
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,400
you think they consume all the

1133
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,400
coyote but they draw the line or the

1134
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
dog but they draw the line at the paws?

1135
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,400
Because that's the part that's been on a

1136
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,400
human floor.

1137
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
It's too prim and

1138
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,400
proper, you know what I mean?

1139
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,400
This is fucked up. Hey, you like

1140
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
to play? Hey, check out

1141
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
this butt. You want to sniff it? Yeah, let's do a

1142
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,400
butt sniff. Hey, you know where we can find a lot

1143
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,400
of other butts? We can just sort of slam

1144
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
jam on and just sort of

1145
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,400
sniff all day until the sun comes down.

1146
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,400
I can tell you back in my

1147
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,400
coyote house. Come back to my coyote house. I got

1148
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
about six or seven butts there and we can go sniff them

1149
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
together and you'll come home with your paws intact.

1150
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,400
I promise you're going to have a great time.

1151
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
Don't mind all the paws laying around. We got piles

1152
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
of paws, piles of paws. Don't worry about those.

1153
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
Those are from other dogs but they're not

1154
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,400
as special as you. I'm sure you'll pass through our coyote

1155
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400
gauntlet just fine. Unmarred.

1156
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
Just come on through, come on through.

1157
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Butts are just a little bit further, a little bit further

1158
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
and chomp.

1159
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
I also want to say

1160
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
Hannah, thank you so much for sending these in.

1161
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
But I can honestly say even without this

1162
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
little snippet of farm wisdom, if I looked

1163
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,400
out my window and saw my dog playing

1164
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,400
with a coyote, I wouldn't just be like

1165
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,400
aww how cute.

1166
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
That's sweet. I'll tell you what else I

1167
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,400
wouldn't do though. Get

1168
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
in the middle of that

1169
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
because clearly coyotes

1170
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
like to eat dogs very very much

1171
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,400
and I don't want to

1172
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,400
I don't want to be the one

1173
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
who is saying please don't do this.

1174
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,400
Oh you don't want to take that away from

1175
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,400
the coyote? Well no

1176
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,400
I don't want to take me into

1177
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,400
the coyote. I don't want to be

1178
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,400
eaten by a coyote.

1179
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,400
If Justin had his

1180
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,400
I love dogs. I love dogs.

1181
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
I know where they sell them.

1182
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
He loves coyotes but

1183
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
the outside of them. Not the inside.

1184
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
Not the inside. I don't need a better look there.

1185
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,400
I love dogs.

1186
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
I know where they sell dogs.

1187
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
Yeah. Do you guys want a yahoo?

1188
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
Sure, yeah.

1189
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,400
This yahoo was sent in by

1190
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
level 14,000 Yajur Shaman

1191
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
Drew Davenport. Thank you Drew.

1192
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,400
It's by Yajur Answers user

1193
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,400
Ricardus who asks

1194
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,400
Scientists

1195
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,400
try to dim the sun

1196
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,400
witches pray

1197
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,400
so that the sun doesn't shine.

1198
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
The result will be

1199
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,400
famine. What needs to be

1200
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
done about this?

1201
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
Okay, so

1202
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
run it back.

1203
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,400
The question asker is

1204
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
just stating the fact

1205
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,400
that scientists

1206
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
All facts here, baby.

1207
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
Okay, scientists are trying to dim the sun.

1208
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,400
Fact. Correct.

1209
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
While simultaneously

1210
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,400
on the other end of the spectrum

1211
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,400
witches are trying to stop the sun

1212
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,400
from shining. Oops, both

1213
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,400
worked. Now we got famine.

1214
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,400
Yeah.

1215
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,400
If we need witches and scientists to agree

1216
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,400
that just one of them is going to keep

1217
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,400
the sun in check. Because right now

1218
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,400
there's a little bit too much

1219
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,400
between the science and the prayers.

1220
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,400
Sounds getting a little too dark for my

1221
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,400
taste, thank you.

1222
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,400
Did the scientists go to

1223
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,400
the witches as like

1224
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,400
one option for

1225
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,400
keeping the sun in check? Like listen, our science

1226
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,400
isn't getting it. We have

1227
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,400
one other scientific solution, witches.

1228
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,400
Please, please, just

1229
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,400
dim it down. Keep it down. See, I

1230
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,400
was thinking that it was more of a circumstance

1231
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,400
in which the two sides just forgot

1232
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,400
to communicate with each other. Yeah, that's what I

1233
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,400
think is happening. Oh no, it was an off week.

1234
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,400
Science was supposed to keep the sun

1235
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,400
not burning the planet up.

1236
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,400
And they're like, no, because last week

1237
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
wait, hold on, was it an odd numbered week?

1238
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Oh no, we scienced and magicked.

1239
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,400
We scienced and magicked too dark.

1240
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,400
Science had the week off.

1241
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,400
It's so vitally important that

1242
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,400
at least one of these two organizations is

1243
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,400
doing something about the goddamn sun now.

1244
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
Or else what's up, day after

1245
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,400
tomorrow, solar flares,

1246
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,400
Golden Gate Bridge, that's gone.

1247
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,400
The sun got melted by the sun's extreme heat.

1248
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,400
Why?

1249
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,400
Okay. Ionosphere?

1250
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,400
Witches did that, so you have

1251
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,400
them to thank for the ionosphere.

1252
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,400
No, here's the one thing I will say

1253
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,400
to Justin's point. I love

1254
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,400
anyone who poses a question

1255
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,400
and then ends it, like, poses a hypothetical

1256
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,400
and it's like, what can we do to stop it?

1257
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,400
It's like, but you, but you,

1258
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,400
that's like saying, like, what if demons

1259
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,400
attacked, demons and monsters

1260
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,400
attacked Earth? What could be done?

1261
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,400
This is, this is, Travis, this is fucking

1262
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,400
Debate Club 101.

1263
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,400
If you even open up

1264
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,400
your, uh,

1265
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,400
if you even open up your statement

1266
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,400
to be

1267
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,400
possibly disproven, if you

1268
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,400
show even a fraction of a shadow of doubt

1269
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,400
in your own mind, then your enemy

1270
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,400
debater is gonna come at you with a

1271
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,400
hearty riposte, and he's gonna tear

1272
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
your shit apart. This is why

1273
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,400
just like a coyote

1274
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,400
does with a dog.

1275
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,400
I appreciate this question

1276
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,400
asked here. Doesn't want to get hung up too

1277
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,400
much on the will they, won't

1278
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,400
they of witches and

1279
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,400
science. Will those two kids ever get

1280
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,400
together?

1281
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,400
This person has left right

1282
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,400
to, let's get, of course

1283
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,400
it's going to happen. Let's work on

1284
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,400
solutions together, internet.

1285
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,400
Let's get a plan together

1286
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,400
for when this does happen. Okay, we're gonna have

1287
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,400
to get the daughter of the Witch King to

1288
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,400
fall in love with the son of the lead

1289
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,400
scientist, right? And it's like

1290
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,400
what science and magic together

1291
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,400
this couldn't possibly be. But then

1292
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,400
they really hit it off, and they're like

1293
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,400
man, love would be great if we weren't so hungry

1294
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,400
because of this blasted famine.

1295
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,400
Oh, solutions.

1296
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,400
She'll fill his belly

1297
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,400
with her magical

1298
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,400
spawn, and when

1299
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,400
that baby comes out of his body,

1300
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,400
fully formed man,

1301
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,400
he will be the

1302
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,400
solar lord. Please tell me

1303
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,400
Travis, there is at least one

1304
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,400
or Griffin, please tell me there's at least

1305
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,400
one response to this.

1306
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,400
A question from someone saying

1307
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,400
okay, I'm picking up what you're laying down

1308
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,400
let me uh, fly my pen. Finally someone had the

1309
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,400
balls to say it. Well, we're

1310
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,400
all thinking. Uh,

1311
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,400
well, first off, let me hit you with

1312
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,400
Saucy's response. My fucking voice

1313
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,400
Saucy is in the comments.

1314
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,400
You know when he's got something to say, you can't fucking

1315
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,400
keep Saucy down. And

1316
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
Saucy said, damn some

1317
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,400
does sound good right now.

1318
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
Nice.

1319
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,400
Whoa, Saucy,

1320
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,400
you completely, you just intentionally

1321
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,400
misinterpreted dim sun. And he

1322
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,400
did it. That's classic. That's fucking classic

1323
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,400
Saucy. And he just, oh my,

1324
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,400
someone call an ambulance because my gut just

1325
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,400
fucking busted. Now I'm septic.

1326
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,400
Um,

1327
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,400
Witness of Jesus, uh,

1328
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,400
has a pretty level headed, um,

1329
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,400
response that has nothing to do with the Rothschild

1330
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,400
banking cartels. Oops, no wait.

1331
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,400
Uh, ultimately, we need

1332
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,400
to put climate changers in jail for

1333
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,400
fraud and embezzlement of taxes.

1334
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,400
We need to get rid of the United Nations

1335
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,400
and all treaties, and we need to

1336
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,400
put the last ten presidents in jail

1337
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,400
for treason with the Rockefellers and the

1338
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,400
Rothschilds for being enemies of

1339
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,400
American citizens. Witches need to

1340
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,400
repent, no doubt. Everything

1341
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,400
thinks their own versions of

1342
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,400
sin and idolatry are okay. Not so.

1343
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,400
Everything that offends will be destroyed.

1344
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,400
And to me, the true definition of a witch

1345
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,400
is one who poisons.

1346
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,400
So just like everything.

1347
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,400
All of it.

1348
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,400
I love a comment that

1349
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,400
even the question asker who asked about

1350
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,400
witches and scientists did me something like,

1351
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,400
whoa, calm down, crazy person. Guys,

1352
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,400
chemtrails are obviously a

1353
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,400
direct result of President Obama

1354
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,400
through Carter's

1355
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,400
witch sin. What?

1356
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,400
We need to put the last ten presidents in jail, even the

1357
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,400
dead ones. We gotta put

1358
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,400
them. We need to

1359
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,400
exhume Reagan, and it's the only

1360
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,400
way we're gonna get rid of these god damn

1361
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,400
chemtrails.

1362
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,400
Fuck me.

1363
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,400
Jesus. And a witch is just

1364
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,400
someone who poisons.

1365
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,400
No, a witch is

1366
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,400
not that. No, that's just unfair

1367
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,400
because you're gonna lump a lot of just regular

1368
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,400
poisoners in with witches.

1369
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,400
I just want one question that is just

1370
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,400
gonna be relaxing to answer.

1371
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,400
I don't think that's so much to ask.

1372
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,400
I just want one soothing

1373
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,400
question. Yeah.

1374
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,400
You mean it's not soothing thinking about the witch

1375
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,400
led solar death of the universe?

1376
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,400
Yeah. What is your opinion

1377
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,400
on returning food if your order

1378
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,400
is incorrect? There we go. This is nice.

1379
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,400
And does your opinion alter

1380
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,400
if the food is takeout rather than

1381
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,400
dine in? Recently I ordered

1382
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,400
a calzone from a local pizza- okay,

1383
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,400
listen, you know what? I don't

1384
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,400
need this whole story. They got your calzone

1385
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,400
wrong, right?

1386
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,400
Well, no, okay, the fuck up that they did

1387
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,400
is, in my mind,

1388
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,400
treasonous.

1389
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,400
I think they should be hanged from the

1390
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,400
neck until dead for what they did

1391
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,400
to this man's calzone. I ordered a calzone from a local

1392
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,400
pizzeria in which the filling I received was ham

1393
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,400
rather than pepperoni. Hang from the neck

1394
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,400
until dead.

1395
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,400
Dead in the street.

1396
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,400
This is high treason. High

1397
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,400
calzone treason. Drag

1398
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,400
them away. With a calzone,

1399
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,400
you didn't know till you bit into

1400
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,400
it. You couldn't look and say like,

1401
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,400
oh, you had to take a bite and be like,

1402
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,400
oh, oh.

1403
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,400
You went from having pizza

1404
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,400
simulcrum to this

1405
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,400
weird chicken cordon

1406
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,400
bleu with no chicken mess.

1407
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,400
You've hammed me, sir. You've hammed

1408
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,400
me.

1409
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,400
God, I hate ham. I've been John Hammed.

1410
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,400
Ham, you are so close to being him.

1411
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,400
Are you suggesting that John Ham

1412
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,400
earned his nom de plume

1413
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,400
earned his nom de plume

1414
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,400
by going to calzone-serving

1415
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,400
restaurants and hiding

1416
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,400
his horrible namesake

1417
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,400
inside of those sacred pockets of

1418
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,400
dough? He's like Johnny Appleseed of

1419
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,400
ham.

1420
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,400
Oh, Christ.

1421
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,400
Johnny Hampleseed.

1422
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,400
I totally get it.

1423
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,400
This is a tough, tough thing because if you're

1424
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,400
in the building...

1425
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,400
I'm sorry, I'm still thinking about

1426
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,400
getting ham. I'm angry.

1427
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,400
When I thought I was getting pepperoni. I'm sorry,

1428
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,400
Travis. Go ahead. No, I was just going to say if you're in the

1429
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,400
building and it's brought to your table,

1430
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,400
it's so easy to be like, oh, I

1431
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,400
ordered ham, but

1432
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,400
I ordered pepperoni. Even then,

1433
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,400
I was with my friend the other day. He ordered

1434
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,400
some boneless chicken wings, got bone-in chicken

1435
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,400
wings, and the look

1436
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,400
on the face of the server when he was like,

1437
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,400
oh, they were supposed to be boneless, and you could

1438
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,400
clearly see this process of like, oh, I don't

1439
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,400
know what to do with these then.

1440
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,400
I can't unbone them.

1441
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,400
Eventually, he was just like, no,

1442
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,400
it's fine. Don't worry about it.

1443
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,400
It's fine.

1444
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,400
When I started reading this question, I was thinking

1445
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,400
almost... I can't

1446
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,400
imagine a scenario where I wouldn't just

1447
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,400
grin and bear it because for me, the

1448
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,400
social discomfort that I would be

1449
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,400
causing myself and this person

1450
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,400
by sending it back

1451
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,400
would be too extreme to stomach.

1452
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,400
But not more extreme

1453
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,400
to stomach than fucking calzone

1454
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,400
ham. That is, I guess,

1455
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,400
a bridge too far for this guy.

1456
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,400
The bigger concern for me

1457
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,400
is not the

1458
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,400
awkwardness of the initial exchange.

1459
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,400
It's the, okay,

1460
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,400
everybody who also got their

1461
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,400
food just now, go ahead and eat,

1462
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,400
and I'll watch you, and then later,

1463
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,400
you'll watch me eat a pepperoni calzone

1464
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,400
from dream of

1465
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,400
my hamless future.

1466
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,400
Now, I will say this.

1467
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,400
Even if I didn't send it back,

1468
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,400
I would still...

1469
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,400
If I was in the restaurant,

1470
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,400
if I was dining in, I would still say something.

1471
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,400
Because at the very least, my meal should

1472
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,400
be discounted because you fucking got it

1473
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,400
wrong. But

1474
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,400
it's so much tougher with delivery

1475
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,400
because unless you open the

1476
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,400
box, take a bite of the fucking

1477
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,400
hamzone, and drive back

1478
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,400
to the... And that is not a good look

1479
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,400
to tell the delivery person, like, wait,

1480
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,400
one second. Let me taste this first.

1481
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,400
You take a bite first.

1482
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,400
You take a bite of the king's calzone.

1483
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,400
John Ham got me last time.

1484
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,400
No, but, like, that idea of, like, if the drivers

1485
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,400
are, like, your only option is, like, to drive

1486
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,400
to the place.

1487
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,400
Chasing him down the street.

1488
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,400
Stop, stop! There's been a ham mistake!

1489
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,400
Charlton!

1490
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,400
Come back! You've stolen my dignity!

1491
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,400
Christopher, there's been a ham,

1492
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,400
a terrible ham mistake!

1493
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,400
You must stop

1494
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,400
your vehicle.

1495
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,400
Someone summon a ambulance!

1496
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,400
On the subject

1497
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,400
of

1498
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,400
getting the meal discounted

1499
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,400
because they made a ham mistake

1500
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,400
inside my dough,

1501
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,400
I would not worry so much about

1502
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,400
immediate fiducial restitution

1503
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,400
because I would

1504
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,400
sue that establishment for every

1505
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,400
goddamn penny that they have.

1506
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,400
Walk into the court with, like, a neck

1507
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,400
brace on.

1508
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,400
I would fucking

1509
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,400
take Papa John.

1510
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,400
I think that, um,

1511
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,400
one of the things that bothers me about

1512
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,400
getting the wrong item is when I correct

1513
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,400
them, and then they take

1514
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,400
the wrong item back.

1515
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,400
Like, no, that's mine now.

1516
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,400
You put it in

1517
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,400
front of—we were at that coffee shop

1518
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,400
this weekend across

1519
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,400
from the Hotel Kabuki. They gave me the

1520
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,400
wrong drink, and I had to

1521
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,400
correct them, and then they took that wrong drink

1522
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,400
back, and it's like, hold on a second.

1523
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,400
This is mine now. I'm gonna

1524
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,400
decide what to do with this. You focus on

1525
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,400
your thing. I'm gonna decide how I distribute

1526
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,400
this. Maybe I wanna split it. I don't

1527
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,400
know. You've created an impossible

1528
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,400
minefield, but I do think I can eat

1529
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,400
around the ham.

1530
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,400
It's gonna take me a while.

1531
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,400
I might have wanted to cut the crust off and turn it

1532
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,400
into breadsticks. You're not the boss of me.

1533
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,400
I've actually brought my pet

1534
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,400
crow here for this very reason. He

1535
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,400
digs into the calzone and

1536
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,400
removes the ham so I can enjoy a

1537
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,400
ham-free experience. He's my

1538
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,400
ham man. He's my ham crow.

1539
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,400
If you eat it, you have

1540
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,400
just, like, entered into

1541
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,400
the situation, the possibility of impropriety,

1542
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,400
in that you are creating

1543
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,400
ham calzones

1544
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,400
with the intent of eating them,

1545
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,400
in which case that means

1546
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,400
you like ham. Get

1547
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,400
outta here. You disgust me. You like secret ham.

1548
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,400
You'll never know how much ham will be

1549
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,400
in that bite. Enjoy. Secret dirty

1550
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,400
free ham. You fucking

1551
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,400
monster. You put in the, you're hungry

1552
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,400
and you put in the one ingredient you know no one

1553
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,400
would ever eat, and that's

1554
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,400
ham. And it

1555
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,400
all would've worked out if it wasn't

1556
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,400
for the one guy who ran down the

1557
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,400
street chasing the delivery driver

1558
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,400
and unraveled your dastardly ham

1559
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,400
plans, John Ham.

1560
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,400
Do you think the first person

1561
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,400
that fucking, the

1562
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,400
calzone guy, everyone was like, well,

1563
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,400
we did it. We perfected food. And

1564
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,400
then the first person was like, I

1565
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,400
can ruin that. Some fucking

1566
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,400
gnarled fucking necromancer

1567
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,400
was like, I know what to do.

1568
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,400
You all seem to be enjoying

1569
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,400
your precious calzones.

1570
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,400
I think it is a good point

1571
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,400
that I think the difference, so like, the difference

1572
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,400
between the boneless versus bone-in wings

1573
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,400
and this is that

1574
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,400
that is just form version

1575
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,400
different. This is like content

1576
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,400
version different. Where it's like

1577
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,400
if you ordered a steak sandwich and they

1578
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,400
brought you a chicken sandwich, like

1579
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,400
that's a fucking thing. Well, no, because

1580
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,400
ham and pepperoni are still technically

1581
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,400
cut from the same

1582
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,400
delicious cloth. But you understand what I'm saying, this idea of like, I

1583
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,400
asked for a specific, this is like

1584
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,400
if you ordered buffalo wings and

1585
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,400
they brought you teriyaki wings, like

1586
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,400
that's a problem.

1587
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,400
Like they just got it 100%

1588
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,400
wrong. What if, if you got a ham

1589
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,400
calzone, could you not just

1590
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,400
sort of sit the ham out

1591
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,400
and wait for it to turn into pepperoni?

1592
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,400
Just

1593
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,400
age it in the sun.

1594
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,400
The, the inclusion of bones

1595
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,400
in the wings is a, makes it a much

1596
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,400
is a much bigger jump

1597
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,400
I think than pepperoni to

1598
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,400
ham. Cause the inclusion of bones in the wings is

1599
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,400
ruining the illusion

1600
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,400
that I have that

1601
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,400
meat just comes from the store.

1602
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,400
Right. And that's as much as I have to think about

1603
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,400
it. Meat, this meat comes from the store.

1604
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,400
See, I hate

1605
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,400
the bones cause it slows down my consumption

1606
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,400
process.

1607
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,400
I gotta work around something.

1608
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,400
Not as much as ham slows

1609
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,400
down my calzone consumption process

1610
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,400
which is to say absolutely.

1611
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,400
It absolutely terminates

1612
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,400
the process. Absolutely ham zero.

1613
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,400
No one's seen Griffin for 40 years.

1614
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,400
He took a bite of a ham calzone

1615
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,400
and had to retreat into the mountains

1616
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,400
to really think about things. He turned into

1617
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,400
a jade statuette.

1618
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,400
Remember when Griffin

1619
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,400
ate that ham accidentally and turned

1620
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,400
into a jade statuette

1621
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,400
because he didn't want to be alive anymore?

1622
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,400
All the best folk stories

1623
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,400
start with Griffin eating a ham calzone.

1624
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,400
I miss Griffin.

1625
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,400
I miss Griffin. Not as much as

1626
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,400
I would have liked to share his pepperoni

1627
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,400
calzone though. Goddamn.

1628
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,400
We were gonna split that. He jumped on that

1629
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,400
grenade for me and he turned into a jade

1630
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,400
statue. Well if you want to wipe the taste

1631
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,400
of ham out of your mouth, go to naturebox.com

1632
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,400
We want to thank again

1633
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,400
for being a sponsor on the show and you can get something like

1634
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,400
barbecue kettle kernels to wash that

1635
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,400
terrible, terrible ham taste out of your mouth.

1636
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,400
No, no ham guarantee at

1637
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,400
naturebox.com slash my brother.

1638
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,400
If you want to pretend that your ham is a little

1639
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,400
person, go to meonies.com slash my brother

1640
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,400
and buy some underwear to put on it.

1641
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,400
You get 20% off your

1642
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,400
first order and right now you get free shipping

1643
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,400
for your ham underwear.

1644
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,400
The perfect size for your ham.

1645
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,400
Oh Christ. This ham is

1646
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,400
really fucking dry. Yeah, I know.

1647
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,400
I've been storing it in meonies

1648
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,400
and it has moisture wicking properties.

1649
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,400
I'm trying to turn it into pepperoni.

1650
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,400
Thank you to everybody who came to our

1651
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,400
live shows.

1652
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,400
In San Francisco and L.A. we had

1653
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,400
a real hoot I would say.

1654
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,400
It was a hoot nanny if I may be so bold.

1655
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,400
Thank you to the folks at

1656
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,400
COBS and

1657
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,400
the Hollywood Fairfax Cemetery.

1658
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,400
Everybody was super, super nice

1659
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,400
and really helped us to

1660
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,400
get those shows off the ground for you.

1661
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,400
And also Sketchfest people were amazing.

1662
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,400
If you're going to go into Sketchfest,

1663
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,400
you need to go next year because it's incredible.

1664
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,400
We will

1665
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,400
probably be posting the San Francisco

1666
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,400
live show in, I don't know,

1667
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,400
in a few weeks. We're kind of keeping it in the chamber

1668
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,400
because Justin's about to move

1669
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,400
and we'll probably be disconnected

1670
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,400
from the web for a while.

1671
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,400
We are going to publish that one,

1672
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,400
but it may be a little while.

1673
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,400
We got

1674
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,400
PO Boxes. Mine's 54.

1675
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,400
PO Box 54,

1676
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,400
100 West Virginia 25706.

1677
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,400
Mine is 173469

1678
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,400
Los Angeles, California

1679
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,400
90034.

1680
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,400
There are still

1681
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,400
tickets available for Chicago and Milwaukee

1682
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,400
shows coming up.

1683
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,400
I think it's bit.ly forward slash

1684
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,400
mbmbam Chicago and bit.ly forward slash

1685
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,400
mbmbam what Travis?

1686
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,400
M-I-L.

1687
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,400
So go there. They are very

1688
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,400
close to

1689
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,400
sold out.

1690
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,400
I know that Minneapolis is

1691
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,400
already sold out

1692
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,400
and I'm checking the most recent count

1693
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,400
right now. It looks like we are

1694
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,400
89% sold out in

1695
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,400
Milwaukee and 76%

1696
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,400
sold out in Chicago. So

1697
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,400
if you've been thinking about getting tickets to that,

1698
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,400
do not sleep on that any longer.

1699
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,400
It is time.

1700
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,400
We've received a lot of great questions already,

1701
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,400
but we've got an upcoming episode with Paul

1702
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,400
Scheer as our guestpert.

1703
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,400
If you would like him to answer one of your

1704
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,400
requests for advice, email us

1705
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,400
mbmbam at gmail.com

1706
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,400
or mbmbam at maximumfun.org

1707
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,400
and those questions

1708
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,400
should be about Jason Statham movies,

1709
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,400
thank you notes, or weird

1710
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,400
collectibles. Just make sure to put guestpert

1711
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
in the subject line so it's easy for me to

1712
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,400
find and that should be

1713
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,400
coming up soon.

1714
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,400
Max Fun Drive is coming up. That is

1715
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,400
the Maximum Fun Network's annual

1716
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,400
two week long

1717
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,400
fundraiser thing.

1718
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,400
I don't know what to call it. But it's a lot of fun.

1719
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,400
We have some bonus length

1720
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,400
episodes. We have a

1721
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,400
extra donor

1722
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,400
only episode.

1723
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,400
And you won't want to miss

1724
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,400
this year's donor only episode

1725
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,400
because it's very special.

1726
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,400
That's all I'll say about it. But yeah, that's

1727
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,400
coming up. What are the dates

1728
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,400
for that? I believe it's the 6th.

1729
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,400
It starts March 16th.

1730
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,400
Okay, starts March 16th and goes for two

1731
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,400
weeks. So it'll be a very special

1732
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,400
time if you're a donor.

1733
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,400
Thank you very much. If you

1734
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,400
have not given to the show and you want to support

1735
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,400
the show, it's a great time to do it. See, it's cool stuff.

1736
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,400
If you've ever tried other shows on the

1737
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,400
network, it's a really great time to check those out

1738
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,400
because everyone's going to be bringing their A game shows

1739
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,400
like Oh No, Ross and Carrie,

1740
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,400
Lady to Lady,

1741
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,400
The Goose Down,

1742
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,400
Flop House, all kinds of wonderful

1743
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,400
shows, including Saw Bones with

1744
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,400
Justin McElroy and Sydney McElroy.

1745
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,400
It's a marital tour of Misguided Medicine.

1746
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,400
It's hilarious. It's Teresa's favorite show on the

1747
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,400
network and one of the few that I am not

1748
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,400
on. So that's cool.

1749
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,400
Okay.

1750
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,400
Yeah, thank you all very, very

1751
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,400
much. And also thanks to John Roderick

1752
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,400
and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, Is a Departure

1753

Off the Album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1754
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,400
Are we done?

1755
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,400
I think we're done. Is that it?

1756
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,400
All right, Griffin, one more question. We're going to grow on.

1757

Did you, the listener, like that?

1779
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,400
You were just swept up in a world

1780
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,400
of high fantasy and magic where anything can

1781
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,400
happen and anything is possible.
