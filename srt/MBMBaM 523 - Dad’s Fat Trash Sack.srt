1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,760
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,080
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Justin

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,120
McElroy. I'm Travis. Did you guys hear that? I actually didn't. Did you guys hear that?

8
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,400
I didn't mean to sigh. Okay, it threw me off so bad I said your name.

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:12,240
Are you okay? I'm fine. Okay, I'm Travis McElroy, your middle-est brother. Do you have a show in

10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:21,440
you today, Justin? Are you cool? There is gonna be a show. You have an show inside of you that's

11
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:30,880
waiting. Do you know what's strange? I didn't know how I felt. This show is my therapy. This is my

12
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,360
time to unpack everything, and I went into this recording not knowing how I felt today, and then

13
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:46,320
when I was trying to put on, as we say in French, le masque, the show. The masque of the host,

14
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,880
the entertainer, the funny man, whisk us away, Pagliacci. I've discovered a sort of unease.

15
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,440
You reached in to the depths to pull out the comedy that is at the base of the sorrow in

16
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,120
your soul, but you found only sorrow. There's just sorrow in there, yeah.

17
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:13,200
What I found is if I dig deep enough, the comedy's in there. Maybe that's what I was trying to get

18
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:25,600
out was sort of in the parlance of Aristotle, the expurgation of pity and fear, the great art.

19
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,000
So this is My Brother, My Brother, Me. It's an advice show. So what this means is the people

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,680
you have heard in the past couple of minutes are going to tell you what to do in a fun twist.

21
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,160
Yeah. Now I want to start off, and this is not normally how we do it, and I'm going to admit

22
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,760
this is a special occasion, but to start off the episode, we got an email from Rose, and it was

23
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,200
about a topic that we discussed last episode or a couple episodes ago, and it goes like this.

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,440
And Rose, I want to say thank you for the powerful start to this question. There was no lead-in. It

25
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,320
just started like this. How I heard it is that Ray Bradbury actually asked his local fire department

26
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,840
what temperature books burned at, and they went and lit a book on fire and measured the temperature

27
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,400
while they were still on the phone with him and reported back that the temperature was Fahrenheit

28
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,960
451. No idea if that's true or not. Rose. I wish I could have been there when they were like,

29
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:35,440
Bradbury wants us to burn a book, and they're like, which book? We got to pick a book to burn.

30
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,640
Well, let's see. It's a fire station, so what we have here is the phone book and a book about how

31
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:50,720
to fight fires and the Bible. Hey, Jimmy, weren't you reading Nadine Kootz earlier?

32
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,720
Yeah, but I haven't finished it. It's Ray Bradbury, dude. All right.

33
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,680
On the phone. Scorch that, Koontz. You burned my Koontz.

34
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,600
Is it among the services that the fire department offers that if you call them,

35
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,880
you can ask any object and they will burn it for you?

36
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,120
Yes. Also, hey, also,

37
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,560
why does the fire department even possess the implements? The one place you don't want there

38
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,360
to be a fire is in the fire station, because that's where you have all your shit for fighting

39
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,800
it, right? Why do they even have the implements for starting a fire?

40
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, to train, Justin, obviously, because you don't want the first time you fight a fire to

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,600
be live out in the real world. There's not a training fire, it's fire.

42
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,360
But you put a fire, a control fire, you put a fire in the waste paper basket,

43
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,040
so first aid John can put it out and feel like a powerful firefighter.

44
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Hey, I want all our rangers, all our park service people to get at me on this one.

45
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:06,640
Reminder, my Twitter handle is at a plus K. A control burn is a fucking lie.

46
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,200
If anybody says that there's a control burn, they're lying to you. It's fire, baby.

47
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,480
Justin. It's going to do,

48
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,680
it's a thing. I'm not saying that a fire

49
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,280
lit in a waste paper basket is a control burn. No, I'm saying the idea of control burns,

50
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,560
and please get at me, people who do manage forests for a living, A plus K.

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,800
It's not a control burn, baby. It's a fire. It's going to do what it's going to do.

52
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,440
That has got to be the worst moment of your day if you're like,

53
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,560
it's a controlled burn, and then you notice that one tree.

54
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,720
A little tinder. Oh no, that was one of the good trees.

55
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,560
Then you got to start like, oh yeah, I did want to get that one too.

56
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,080
I can just run over there with a can of spray paint, just put an X on that one real quick.

57
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,720
It's all part of the plan. Yeah, it's all under control.

58
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,320
Somebody needs to write a sci-fi novel called Control Burn, but it's C-T-R-L Burn.

59
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,360
Ooh, Travis. Ooh, that's good. Yeah, think about that.

60
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,480
Anyways, I like that we could call the fire department and just be like,

61
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,520
hey, at what temperature does a classic Teddy Ruxpin burn?

62
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,040
And they would have to do it, or else I guess I don't pay their salaries anymore.

63
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,160
Do you know what's fucked up? It's 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

64
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,480
Oh no. Such a dangerous little toy.

65
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,120
I mean, that tape deck in there, it's its own internal combustion engine. It's not great.

66
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,760
So they have tools to measure how hot a fire is at the fire department, and I believe that.

67
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,360
But then I also wonder, does that mean they're going to measure the heat of a fire when they

68
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,520
get to a house fire? And they're like, that's too hot.

69
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,960
Or that they roll up to a house fire, point their thermometer at it, and they're like,

70
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,680
it's okay, guys. It's a cold fire. It's only 200 degrees in there.

71
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,280
Fuck it, we don't need our suits. This is a baby fire.

72
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,080
I've got a thick sweater on. This is a cold ass fire. In and out, no problem.

73
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,520
Can we do a question that's not about Ray Bradbury?

74
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,200
I want to talk more about Ray Bradbury.

75
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,160
No, it's fine. I'll do one. We'll do one for them, one for us.

76
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,400
Okay.

77
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,640
I heard that he called a tattoo parlor and said,

78
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
how many tattoos could you put on a man?

79
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,680
Before he's illustrated.

80
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,720
Before he's illustrated.

81
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,520
I was on the way out the door to walk our dog, Cooper, nice.

82
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,400
Wow.

83
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,200
Wow. When I realized I was without a plastic bag-

84
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,160
Hold on real quick. Did you say that because you're assuming that this person

85
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,920
named their dog after your second daughter?

86
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,120
Well, they didn't name them. I'm assuming they named them after,

87
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,640
but maybe they named them before, in which case-

88
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,200
You took a dog.

89
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,760
Okay, fine.

90
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,640
Yeah. And now you've named your daughter after their dog.

91
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,120
Well, I named a dog Indiana.

92
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,160
Classic. Love him.

93
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,800
Classic.

94
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,200
I love him.

95
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,240
Love Iron Man.

96
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,600
...the movies. When I realized I was without a plastic bag for his poop,

97
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,400
my wife ran to our kitchen for me and pulled one from the recycling

98
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,920
before sending me on my way.

99
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,520
I'm now blocks from the house. He's pooping.

100
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,160
I realized she handed me a dramatically oversized baggie,

101
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,120
the ones from Goodwill that fit coats and bedding and stuff.

102
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,520
It seems wasteful to use such an enormous amount of plastic for a single duty.

103
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,560
What do I do?

104
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,280
Do I pick up after him in this ludicrously big bag or do I search for a plan B?

105
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,720
That's from superfluously sized shit bag in Greensboro.

106
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,160
I mean, think about your poor dog who sees the size of the duty bag

107
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,880
and is like, damn, Jeremy, are you sure?

108
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
I'll do my best, but fuck, bud.

109
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,920
I'm gonna disappoint you, buddy. I'm so sorry.

110
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,880
I don't know what you have planned for the day, but is that for both of us?

111
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,480
Yeah, I mean, oh God.

112
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,080
I mean, it's important that you clean up the duty.

113
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,040
That's just, that's one on one. Leaving the duty there is-

114
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,840
I mean, it is.

115
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,640
No, listen, I'm a dog owner. I pick up my dog's shit.

116
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,280
You want a fucking trophy?

117
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,360
I also think that it is interesting that we have a society of like,

118
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,960
all other animals shit outside and there's dirt there and mud and stuff.

119
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,640
But my dog shit, I have to, with a like microscopically thin bag,

120
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,160
put it in my hand while you watch to make sure I do it, Mr. Jones next door.

121
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,240
This is a weird character trap.

122
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,280
I've never stepped in like squirrel shit and had it ruin my day.

123
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,880
Let me actually check my history.

124
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,360
Yep, it's always dogs that I step in.

125
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,880
I'm not saying we shouldn't do it.

126
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
I'm saying I don't like doing it.

127
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,960
Yeah, okay. Nobody likes it.

128
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,440
Nobody's like, all right, little brown treasure.

129
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,760
Neither of you are dog owners.

130
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,360
So let me tell you the most awkward thing in being a dog owner

131
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,320
is after you've picked up your dog's shit

132
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,560
and you're carrying it around in an old Kroger bag

133
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,360
and like you're walking back home

134
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,040
and like another car from your neighborhood drives by

135
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,800
and you kind of awkwardly wave with the hand holding the bag of shit.

136
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,480
Yeah, now imagine this, but it's a mattress bag.

137
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,520
It's a big fucking steamer trunk size.

138
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,400
It's a big boy.

139
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,360
I mean, you have to do it.

140
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,920
Can you pick up a bunch of different stuff?

141
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,720
Yeah, there's gotta be some other poop lying around.

142
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,920
Not even, it doesn't even have to be poop.

143
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,680
You find a cool pine cone or glitter.

144
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,320
Yeah, I mean, you know, non-bioorganic litter.

145
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh, I thought you said glitter.

146
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,800
No, litter.

147
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,280
Because if you do just have the one poop in this huge, huge bag,

148
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,880
you're gonna look like some sort of like off-brand Johnny Appleseed dude.

149
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,240
This is my last one.

150
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,520
Nearing the end of his journey.

151
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,120
Could you keep reusing the bag until it's full?

152
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,920
Where are you gonna store that, Trapp?

153
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,600
Between uses.

154
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,920
Right inside the door so it's there next time you need it.

155
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,840
We're gonna need a mud room for this, specifically for the bag.

156
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,480
Justin, it sounds like you're not having fun.

157
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,240
I take trash bags really seriously.

158
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,440
And I'm gonna think about how I'm out of my big trash bags that I treasure.

159
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,800
Sometimes, you know what I do sometimes?

160
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,280
What do you do?

161
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,920
This is embarrassing, but like I'll get,

162
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,880
you know, I like the big, big ass contractor trash.

163
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,600
Yeah, baby.

164
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,400
Yeah, yeah.

165
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,120
You know, baby.

166
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,320
The ones that make me feel like I could throw anything away.

167
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:26,800
Don't even.

168
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,120
Yeah, you could throw like hunks of concrete in there.

169
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,320
It'll stretch around it.

170
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,400
Sometimes I get a mind to do some cleaning and figure out like,

171
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,680
oh man, I've only filled up half of this amazing trash bag.

172
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,480
Yeah.

173
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,120
And so I'll just leave the trash bag.

174
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,720
You guys ever do this?

175
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,200
Just leave the trash bag centrally located.

176
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,040
And then if somebody tries to throw trash in the regular trash can,

177
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,280
I'm like, hold on, I got this big one over here.

178
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,680
Don't fill up the smaller cans with that trash.

179
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,520
Come put it in this big boy I got.

180
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,760
This is my big centrally located trash.

181
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,040
I'm trying to fill her up.

182
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,640
Justin, you have just maybe described like the clearest example

183
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,360
of dad idiosyncrasy since we started making this show.

184
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,480
Like that is such like a-

185
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,520
Do you mean Clint and the evil McElroy or dad in general?

186
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,160
Like you are a dad because you do this thing I've never heard of before.

187
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,280
Don't you guys get me-

188
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,800
Okay, okay, okay.

189
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,360
When people in your household, and I know that, I mean-

190
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,680
The kids today.

191
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,280
When people in your household throw away trash

192
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,440
that takes up half of the trash can,

193
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,320
does that not drive you fucking batshit?

194
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,760
Let me ask you a follow up question.

195
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,640
Did they use my special big garbage bag?

196
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,200
The one that I saved just for big boy Josh?

197
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,240
Special centrally located dad bag?

198
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,320
Is that when I fill up, I buy myself a little treat?

199
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,000
Because I've earned it,

200
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,480
and no one appreciates the hard work I do around here?

201
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,120
Dad, you know-

202
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,560
I just like to watch one episode of a car show

203
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,320
without somebody interrupting me while I fill up my special big boy bag.

204
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,160
It's just dad's central sack for fat trash.

205
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,560
I'm spiraling here.

206
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,800
I just need to know if there's-

207
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,680
If you have a-

208
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,600
I have a kitchen trash can.

209
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,400
Uh-huh, yeah.

210
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,800
If someone has a large piece of trash,

211
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,680
and I keep saying somewhat when I mean my wife,

212
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,960
my kids don't throw away shit.

213
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:44,000
When my wife throws away the large bag of trash,

214
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,400
a large piece of trash in the kitchen trash can

215
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,040
that fills up a lot of the trash can,

216
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,200
I get very frustrated,

217
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,000
and I ask that we take larger pieces of trash directly out to the cans

218
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,600
instead of sullying the trash bag with-

219
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,080
It does sound like you've introduced a middleman though.

220
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,680
A middle option, a middle-

221
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,760
A third path that isn't-

222
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,000
That's a perfectly good half-filled bag right there.

223
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,520
And it's a fat sack.

224
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,000
It's a fat sack.

225
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,120
That's only when the sack is not in play.

226
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,480
When the sack's in play, everything goes in the sack.

227
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,640
If the kids leave toys out too long,

228
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,480
and I don't think that they treasure it,

229
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,840
it goes right in the sack.

230
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,920
The sack's right there.

231
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,400
Hey, can I do a Yahoo-

232
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,000
Sometimes I just want to put all my worries and troubles in that sack.

233
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,880
You know what I mean?

234
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,440
I just want to take, oh, I got a lot weighing on me.

235
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,680
What if I just put them all in my big boy sack

236
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,120
and threw it right away, you know?

237
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,180
Yeah.

238
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,520
I got a Yahoo here that was sent in by several people.

239
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:41,840
Thank you.

240
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,040
It's by Yahoo Answers user James who asks,

241
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,480
can I bring in some of my own ingredients

242
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,400
for them to put on my Subway sub?

243
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,600
Oh, such a good question, James.

244
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,400
It's a, this is a fast food restaurant

245
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,240
where they make sandwiches and they do have,

246
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,720
they've got a little, it's weird, huh?

247
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,440
They've got like a buffet, but just for them.

248
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,520
Yeah, how greedy.

249
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,800
You ever think about that?

250
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,680
You should, if there was no sneeze guard there,

251
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,280
which in the current sort of climate would be unthinkable,

252
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,040
but if there was no sneeze guard there,

253
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,640
you could just do it yourself

254
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,120
and you wouldn't need them to necessarily be a part of that process.

255
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,240
But if you could do it yourself, if there was no sneeze guard,

256
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,720
if we could democratize the Subway process,

257
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,280
then there would be nothing stopping you

258
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,720
from like slopping in your own homemade horseradish on there or whatever.

259
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,560
I'll tell you what I have always really enjoyed at Subway

260
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,280
is their candor, their honesty.

261
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,600
Sure.

262
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,320
Because one, you get to watch them make the sandwich right there

263
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,120
so you can watch them fuck up the way you want your cheese to go.

264
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,720
It's great because like, no, I said, okay.

265
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,640
But also that they're just straight up like vegetables are worth nothing to us.

266
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,040
We will put as many of those on there as you want.

267
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,400
The cheese and the meat, that's where the money is, baby.

268
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,560
You want more of that, we're gonna charge you.

269
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,400
But you want more spinach?

270
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,960
Fuck it.

271
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,760
Yeah, dude.

272
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,080
Yeah, dude.

273
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,680
I will load that thing down with spinach till we can't close it.

274
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,160
Spinach comes from trees.

275
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,840
There's infinite of those.

276
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,600
I could find spinach outside right now if you want more.

277
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,240
Where am I supposed to get cheese at this time of day?

278
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,240
But this comes from cows and there's only so many of them.

279
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,200
This is what I'm saying.

280
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,440
I measure how much sort of gas I have in the tank

281
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,640
by whether or not I'm willing to ask for green peppers

282
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:43,680
because I don't want the specificity of green pepper amount

283
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,960
that I need to produce a satisfying sandwich

284
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,280
is such that I don't always want to take that journey

285
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,360
because I don't want to always break down with them like,

286
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,240
you don't understand how little green pepper I want.

287
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,920
You're gonna think that I don't want it.

288
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,480
You're gonna think that I don't actually want the green pepper,

289
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,240
but I do, I just want such a specific amount of green pepper.

290
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,800
You want them to take some slices of green pepper

291
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,280
and just kind of wiggle them over the sandwich

292
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,560
like they're burning sage, but not actually let them touch.

293
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,760
If you could hide it in there so I definitely get all the benefits

294
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,000
but I'm not, maybe wrap it in cheese.

295
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,720
So like, it's later I think,

296
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,120
was there a green pepper on that sandwich?

297
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,480
That's the ideal amount.

298
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,960
Sometimes when I'm feeling really froggy,

299
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,120
I'll do that with mayo, but I'm even more particular about that.

300
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,840
I actually kind of mispronounce mayo

301
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,520
because I want them to put an amount of mayonnaise on the sandwich

302
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,000
where they're not actually sure if I want mayonnaise.

303
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,800
Yes.

304
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,440
That is the exact amount of mayonnaise that I want on the sandwich

305
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,360
where they have plausible mayonnaise deniability.

306
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,880
That's just meat leave-ins.

307
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,480
There's no mayo on this.

308
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,160
No, sir, that was just wet bread.

309
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,880
Nope, you just got a wet slice there, pal.

310
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,800
But can you bring in your, okay, let's take it one step.

311
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,240
Can you bring in your own bread?

312
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,960
I don't think so.

313
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,040
Okay, what if I brought in an ingredient,

314
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,640
they finish the sandwich and then while still standing at the register,

315
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,560
I unwrap it, open the sandwich, put my ingredient in,

316
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,080
close the bread, re-wrap it, all while maintaining eye contact.

317
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,840
That's great.

318
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,280
They're gonna charge you for it.

319
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,200
You could bring in your own slice of ham.

320
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,320
Charge me a corking fee.

321
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,160
Oh, well, a porking fee.

322
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,240
That was good.

323
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,800
Very good.

324
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,280
Yeah, I think you should be able,

325
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,760
is that, is ham what you guys would really bring?

326
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,560
Okay, Subway opens, Subway, they're like,

327
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,480
we got $5 footlong and people love that,

328
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,240
but now we have a new jingle and it's,

329
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,080
bring in your own meat now.

330
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,080
And you can bring in your own, it says,

331
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,680
bring in your own meat now, but you can bring in whatever,

332
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,360
but you can only bring in one thing.

333
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,400
So like, what's the, and this is great,

334
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,200
because then there's a line of people standing six feet apart,

335
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,600
all of them holding their sort of comfort item.

336
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,440
Yes, that they're excited.

337
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,520
I'll bring a toothbrush and a picture of my wife.

338
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,480
Nope, you can do one.

339
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,120
I'm winning that hands on a hard body truck.

340
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,200
Wait, that's not, sorry, that's not what's happening.

341
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,760
Oh man, everybody's gonna be holding bacon,

342
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,240
like a kid who's just won a bunch of tickets at like an arcade

343
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,560
and they're like waving these strings of tickets around,

344
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,000
except it'll be bacon.

345
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,840
No, too much work, too much work.

346
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,080
I don't think you're gonna make it a bacon item.

347
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,960
I think Travis is coming at this from an economic standpoint.

348
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,800
I'm trying to think of like special things

349
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,840
I have in this house that I've always

350
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
wanted to eat on a Subway sandwich.

351
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,480
My own sort of Pinsky salami situation, if you will.

352
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,760
Of course, the best looking meat I've never had.

353
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,120
What, Griffin, what's something that you would not,

354
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,680
I feel like the host of Family Feud,

355
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,560
what's something that you would not normally have on a sandwich

356
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,080
that you find yourself craving?

357
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,360
Uh, it's, uh, um, my willy-weenus.

358
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,240
My prince, my prince pee-pee.

359
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,280
I'm trying to think of what they would say on Family Feud.

360
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,560
They would say prince pee-pee?

361
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,000
Doo-doo, doo-doo juice.

362
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
They say like wild shit.

363
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,520
Yeah, show me doo-doo juice.

364
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,320
Yeah.

365
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,920
Oh, it's up there, it's number one.

366
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,760
Wow.

367
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,360
Making whoopee.

368
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,160
100% of people said doo-doo juice.

369
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,660
Whoa.

370
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,940
Oh, wow, we asked a million people

371
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,500
and 100% of them said doo-doo juice.

372
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,700
Probably CBD, right?

373
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,460
Oh, that'd be great.

374
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,260
They're not gonna sell that to you at Subway.

375
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,860
No, they could.

376
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,460
That's how you know things are done.

377
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,260
They could.

378
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:44,820
They could.

379
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,300
They won't.

380
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,780
They could.

381
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,900
We have CB, we have CBD pepperoncini.

382
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,260
A CBD LT.

383
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:55,960
Yes.

384
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,460
Well, that's it.

385
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,220
That's the end of that bit.

386
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,180
That's the end of that bit.

387
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,740
Put it to bed.

388
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,340
That's the end of that bit.

389
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,420
I recently discovered that my boyfriend's dad drives.

390
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,300
We should do that more.

391
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,460
Didn't that feel really clean to me?

392
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,340
I really like that sort of laugh-in style,

393
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,260
like hee-haw transition.

394
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:14,760
Okay.

395
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,620
Well, I'll put that on a donkey.

396
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:34,500
I recently discovered that my boyfriend's dad

397
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,220
drives Lyft on the side to pick up Semester Cache.

398
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,140
The problem with this is that I use Lyft.

399
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,380
My boyfriend and I have been dating for four years.

400
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,380
I consider myself to be close to the parts of his family,

401
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,580
just not his dad.

402
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,020
He's really nice-seeming.

403
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,060
We just haven't had many chances to interact.

404
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,220
If I were to call Lyft and his dad was the driver,

405
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,260
would I have to sit in the front

406
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,620
and try to make small talk with him?

407
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,620
Or would it be okay for me to sit quietly in the back

408
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,580
like I normally would?

409
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:58,980
Oh, boy.

410
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,060
Wow, this is fraught.

411
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,860
Until I read this question,

412
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,060
the idea of calling a Lyft and having it be someone I knew driving

413
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,420
had never occurred to me.

414
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,860
Yeah, because the question of where to sit.

415
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:19,140
And I feel like you do have the built-in excuse right now

416
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,540
of social distancing.

417
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,220
So it's like, I got to sit catty corner.

418
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,340
Oh, that's good.

419
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:24,980
Yeah.

420
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,940
I mean, it's not just good.

421
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,060
It's the truth.

422
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,300
If you're doing anything other than catty corner,

423
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,060
then you're part of the problem.

424
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,540
You could always sketch on the back.

425
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,780
Sketching on the back is cool.

426
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,780
You definitely can't treat it like a regular Lyft.

427
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,620
I mean, unless-

428
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:47,300
Unless you're going to do the mask thing.

429
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,800
Yeah.

430
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,060
You guys been doing the mask thing?

431
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,780
You mean wearing a mask to keep other people alive?

432
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,820
Yes, Justin, I have.

433
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,420
Well, good, Travis.

434
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:56,740
That's good.

435
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,340
Everybody should be doing that, obviously.

436
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,840
But-

437
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,820
No, Justin just said like the mask thing,

438
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,900
like it was a cool life hack, keep it out.

439
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,660
Travis cleans up after his dog

440
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,820
and doesn't spread a pandemic and he's like,

441
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,460
you know what?

442
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,740
I do want a parade.

443
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,500
I want a parade and a trophy that says,

444
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,180
Travis McRoy, bare minimum.

445
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,540
Bare minimum.

446
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,340
But it's B-E-A-R

447
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,100
and there's a little bear on top of the trophy.

448
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,980
You wear the mask and you're at the store

449
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,060
and you see someone you definitely know

450
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,140
and you just absolutely play it off

451
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,020
because it's like, no, you're not going to get me this time.

452
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,500
I have plausible deniability.

453
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,700
I mean, especially if you wear one of the plastic shield masks

454
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,220
and a hat, you are a ghost, my friends.

455
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,700
When you asked if we were doing the mask thing, Justin,

456
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,900
I thought you were talking about when the cops,

457
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,340
when there's a bunch of cops

458
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,620
and they're about to arrest you,

459
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,300
but then you're like,

460
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,740
they call me Cuban Pete,

461
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,060
I'm the king of the Rumblebee

462
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,980
and you do a dance and then-

463
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,500
There are very few social problems.

464
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,220
I mean, to be fair,

465
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,140
the mask would fix this problem with the lift

466
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,180
because it would turn into like a huge stretch limo

467
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:10,820
and your boyfriend's dad would be like a cool wolf or something.

468
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,420
Yeah, man, that'd be badass.

469
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,300
That'd be pretty cool

470
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,100
and you roll up to the coconut club or whatever

471
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,460
and there's Cameron Diaz

472
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,540
and I guess you seduce her with your cool dancing?

473
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,980
Wouldn't it be cool to have a mask mask

474
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,820
and you could just put it on and act a fool?

475
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,660
Not with his zany powers, you're saying.

476
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,220
You're just wearing a mask off the mask.

477
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,260
You pretend that you have his zany powers.

478
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,100
I think everybody would get a big kick out of that.

479
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Oh yeah, I think everyone in this day and age,

480
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,860
everyone needs that kind of levity.

481
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,420
You know what I mean?

482
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,020
That's what the world is missing,

483
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,260
more mask-based humor.

484
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,260
Well then maybe everybody's uncles and aunts

485
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,620
who are still really up in arms

486
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,620
about the whole pandemic mask thing,

487
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,100
maybe we can get them on board

488
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,660
because everybody loves Jim Carries the Mask.

489
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,940
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

490
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,820
So like you have that

491
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,540
and then you can also say like this will nullify

492
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,260
certain social expectations when you wear this

493
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,740
and you can do a funny like rumba dance

494
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,820
and rob a bank.

495
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,980
It would be funny to put on a surgical mask

496
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,620
and then put on the mask mask over that mask

497
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,740
and so people would think you're just acting a fool

498
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,540
and being silly but actually you're being very conscientious

499
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,460
and then when you get in and people are like,

500
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,420
what are you doing?

501
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:32,180
You're like, I guess I misunderstood, sorry.

502
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,620
P-A-R-T-Y, there's a pandemic on

503
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,180
and let me show you some literature about it.

504
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,660
What if you did surgical mask?

505
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,940
Somebody shop me.

506
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,100
I can't do my shopping for myself

507
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,380
because I wore a mask mask.

508
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,700
Okay, you wear a surgical mask underneath,

509
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,140
then you wear the mask over it

510
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,380
and then you wear a surgical mask over that

511
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,740
so people will see it and like,

512
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,660
oh, he's a whimsical party man

513
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,660
but he still understands the importance

514
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,580
of controlling the pandemic.

515
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,340
I respect him for that.

516
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,460
Man, the mask is funny.

517
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,780
Man, it's fucking funny as shit.

518
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,060
It's both funny, it's weird, it's funny to watch

519
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,420
but also funny to talk about.

520
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,900
Yeah, you remember when the dog pees all over that guy

521
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,020
because he's wearing the mask

522
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,700
and it's like a fucking waterfall.

523
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,980
That's a good one

524
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,940
and when he eats the bomb and it explodes in his tummy,

525
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,580
he goes, that's a spicy meatball.

526
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,860
Travis, do eight more mask jokes

527
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,140
to get us to around 10.

528
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:36,660
Do you remember when he's there with Ben Stein

529
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,900
and he tries to put the mask on but it doesn't work

530
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,580
so Jim Carrey in his classic rubber face style

531
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,820
just throws himself around for a while.

532
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,620
That's one.

533
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,300
There's another one

534
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,940
where the clock is bouncing around the hallway

535
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,300
and he's trying to smash it with a hammer.

536
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,580
That's two, Jesse, he's gonna do it.

537
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,620
That's a good one.

538
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,300
He's gonna do it, that's two, Travis.

539
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,180
Six more, six more, six more, bud.

540
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,660
He says, love is but a red, red rose

541
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,220
and I am a little thorny and that's pretty good.

542
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,580
Oh yeah, Trav, oh yeah, bud.

543
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,820
There's another part where the cops are frisking him

544
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,260
and they're reaching in his pockets

545
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,860
and he's like a little to the left

546
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,020
and makes a joke like it's his penis.

547
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,060
That's four more, baby.

548
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,340
Travis, you're halfway home, come on.

549
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,540
And then there's the part where the old lady comes out,

550
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,260
like his landlady comes out of her apartment

551
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,420
and she has like a green face mask on

552
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,460
and he's wearing a green mask

553
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,860
and they scream at each other and that's pretty good.

554
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,540
She's gonna do it, Jesse's gonna do it.

555
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,260
There's another part where he's kind of spinning around

556
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,540
and he's turning into the mask

557
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,460
and then he stops and he catches the feather

558
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,340
and he says, somebody stop me.

559
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,060
Okay.

560
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,140
But he says it in like a really funny way.

561
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,900
Yeah, okay, we'll give it to you.

562
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,660
Two more, Trav, come on, you can do this.

563
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,220
There's a part where the cops come

564
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,460
and he tries to run away and they say freeze

565
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,540
and he turns to ice in midair and they say,

566
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,860
put your hands up and he says, but you told me to freeze.

567
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,860
Now listen, back in episode 406, Travis got to nine

568
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,300
and this is where he shipped the bag.

569
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,180
So Travis, we really wanna see if you can land the plane.

570
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,180
Is there anything?

571
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,060
You gotta have at least a little bit more juice in the tank.

572
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,340
Come on, bud, get us there.

573
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,980
There's a part where the two guys who like-

574
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,220
Uh-huh.

575
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,940
Tried to charge Stanley extra for fixing the car.

576
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,660
Yeah.

577
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,380
And then the mask shoves the mufflers up their butts.

578
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,380
Yes!

579
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,100
Yes!

580
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,060
He did it, ladies and gentlemen, he did it!

581
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,460
Amazing, amazing.

582
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,260
Travis, I just re-watched it last night.

583
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:56,020
Let's take a break, we're gonna head on over to the money section.

584
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,220
Do either one of you nerds wanna take this first one?

585
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,740
Okay, yes, I wanna tell you about Warby Parker.

586
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,300
They make glasses.

587
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,500
I know what you're thinking.

588
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,780
A lot of people make glasses.

589
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,900
I make glasses.

590
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,540
But do you make boutique quality eyewear

591
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,460
at a revolutionary price point?

592
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,580
You don't, so shut up and let me finish this ad.

593
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,460
Warby Parker offers eyeglasses, sunglasses,

594
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,620
contact lenses, and eye exams.

595
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,020
They're committed to providing exceptional vision care

596
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,940
online and in stores.

597
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,620
I wear Warby Parker glasses.

598
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,140
I love Warby Parker glasses.

599
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,380
My favorite part is the home try-on program

600
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,380
where they will send, like you pick out the frames

601
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,380
you wanna try on, they send them to you,

602
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,140
you try them on, and here's the thing, folks,

603
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,020
this is news to no one, I have a gigantic head,

604
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,260
and so I'm always wary of buying glasses online.

605
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,900
But Warby Parker sends me, I try them on,

606
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,380
I go, oh, these actually fit, this is incredible.

607
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,460
Or, nope, my melon's still too big

608
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,980
and I have to send some back,

609
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,620
and I don't pay for the ones I don't keep.

610
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,300
It's a great deal.

611
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,140
And Warby Parker is committed to providing

612
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,860

00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,820
If you are wanting to take a break from the outside world,

625
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:37,300
wanting to isolate even deeper into your own subconscious,

626
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,340
and who can blame you,

627
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,660
then reach for a pair of Raycon earbuds.

628
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,300
You don't have to spend hundreds of bucks

629
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:50,020
on a pair of wireless earbuds to get a great sound.

630
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,100
You can just go with Raycon.

631
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,620
Their newest model, the Everyday E25 earbuds,

632
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,540
seamlessly pair with via Bluetooth.

633
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,860
They got nice amount of bass and more compact design.

634
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,580
It gives you a nice noise-isolating fit.

635
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,780
I got a pair and really liked them.

636
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,500
They're very easy to pair.

637
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,780
They sync right up.

638
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,580
And they're delicious.

639
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,460
And they are delicious.

640
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,500
They go down smooth.

641
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,140
You know what I mean?

642
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,940

00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,820
I should say our lawyer is sitting right next to me.

649
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,820
They just handed me a piece of paper that says,

650
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,380
I have to tell you, don't eat earbuds.

651
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,380
Now my skateboard lawyers are sitting next to me

652
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,820
and they're giving me a big thumbs up

653
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,180
and they're shaking their head yes.

654
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,740
So I don't know if that means you can eat earbuds.

655
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,580
They're doing it again.

656
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,540
God, these guys, man, they're such bad lawyers.

657
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,820
Why did we get these terrible lawyers?

658
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,180
My lawyer is good.

659
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,380
My lawyer.

660
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:01,700
Fuck.

661
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,460
One, two, one, two, three, four.

662
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,020
Hi, everybody.

663
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,140
My name is Justin McElroy.

664
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:07,940
I'm Sydney McElroy.

665
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,380
We're both doctors and-

666
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,180
Nope, just me.

667
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,220
Okay, well Sydney's a doctor and I'm a medical enthusiast

668
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,740
and we create Sawbones, a marital tour of misguided medicine.

669
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,300
Every week I dig through the annals of medical history

670
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:24,660
to bring you the wildest, grossest, sometimes dumbest tales

671
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,980
of ways we've tried to treat people throughout history.

672
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,700
Lately we do a lot of modern fake medicine

673
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,620
because everything's a disaster,

674
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,340
but it's slightly less of a disaster every Friday

675
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,700
right here on MaximumFun.org

676
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,660
as we bring you Sawbones,

677
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,580
a marital tour of misguided medicine.

678
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,300
And remember-

679
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,380
Don't drill a hole in your head.

680
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,700
You want a Yahoo?

681
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,460
Yeah, I'd like that.

682
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:47,860
Okay.

683
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,740
This Yahoo was sent in by Molly

684
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,180
and I guess you're not gonna interrupt me.

685
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,220
That feels good.

686
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:53,700
Thanks, Molly.

687
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,900
It's by Yahoo Answers user Copperman asks-

688
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,500
Oh, I get it.

689
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,100
It's like Iron Man, but okay.

690
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,380
That's funny, I didn't think about that.

691
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:01,880
Very good.

692
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,460
And this-

693
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:03,940
I'm liking this.

694
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,140
I'm liking it already.

695
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,820
And this seems like something

696
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,540
that the bad boy Tony Stark himself would say,

697
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,820
which is why are plungers handle rods so short?

698
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:14,920
Right?

699
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,620
I feel like I'm already elbow deep in there.

700
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,260
Regular plungers consist of an elastic suction cup

701
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,580
and a wooden handle rod that is attached to it.

702
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,180
The wooden hand, if you have never plunged,

703
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,380
do you think that's possible?

704
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,100
I mean, maybe some people only have narrow shits.

705
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,020
Perfect, Duke.

706
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,660
I guess so.

707
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,180
It's our third time talking about poop in this episode.

708
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,540
Stinky snakes every time.

709
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,540
The wooden handle rod is intended to be held

710
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,780
and used by the plunger operator to forcefully compress

711
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,980
and decompress the suction cup

712
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,580
and its contents by pushing and pulling.

713
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,660
All right, Bill Nye, we fucking get it.

714
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,380
Another commonality among many regular plungers

715
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,980
is that the wooden rod is rather short,

716
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,140
forcing your wrists and forearms to be rather close

717
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,940
to the suction cup and what's below it.

718
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,940
So I ask, why are the wooden rods as short as they usually are?

719
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,940
Shouldn't they be longer to allow for some action

720
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,020
at greater distance to the whirling toilet water

721
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,580
and whatever happens to be part of said whirling waters?

722
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,460
I've always wanted them to be broom handle length.

723
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,060
So I can stand on top of the counter right next to it

724
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,340
and jump off and really get some good action going.

725
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,220
You know what I mean?

726
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,180
Because sometimes just the like two feet that they give me

727
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,060
isn't enough to get the torque I need

728
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,820
to get the clog out of there.

729
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,540
You know what I mean?

730
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,420
I need to really get in there.

731
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:35,220
Yeah, and you like it when it's a sort of Darth Maul

732
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,620
double-bladed plunger saber situation

733
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,420
where it's a long stick and on one side is the normal plunger

734
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,020
and but then on the other side is like an almost comedically

735
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,140
large, the mask-sized plunger cup.

736
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:50,580
And that one goes that one goes over the whole toilet

737
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,060
and Travis likes to do that and yell for people to come in.

738
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,340
Like guys, get in here, get in here.

739
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,620
You got to see this, you got to see this.

740
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,060
You'll never believe what I'm doing.

741
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,020
But people are always like-

742
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,140
I plunge and I pull up and there's Jimmy Hoffa's body, right?

743
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,220
It's great, everyone loves it.

744
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,340
And people laugh and they're like,

745
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,500
you're doing the big plunger trick again, aren't you?

746
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,980
We don't have to come in, we have seen it.

747
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,780
Yeah, I've lost a lot of friends.

748
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,020
It's a very good tiny plunger card trick

749
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,780
and you can order the tiny plunger

750
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,220
and they'll send you a DVD with it

751
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,460
that says how to do the tiny plunger card trick.

752
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,980
Hey, it's 2020.

753
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,300
How has plunger technology not evolved?

754
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,300
Have we not moved beyond we put a big duke in there,

755
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,740
clog the whole thing up.

756
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,340
Here's like a suction cup and a wooden stick, go to work.

757
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,540
I think it has evolved because there's some

758
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:41,380
where there's kind of a flange at the bottom where it flanges in

759
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,500
and then there's just the regular Mario ones.

760
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,140
But.

761
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,980
And I do, it does concern me

762
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,900
because if we figured out the flange is better,

763
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,980
we should have thrown all those other ones away, right?

764
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:00,020
We wanna do this job once and we wanna do it right.

765
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,980
No, you know what?

766
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,900
I've talked about it before, I'm a disruptor.

767
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,100
I'm gonna disrupt the whole thing.

768
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,420
Fucking big plungers out here taking your money.

769
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,180
Hey, everybody, here's a news flash,

770
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,460
invest in my company, biggerpipes.com.

771
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:13,700
Yeah.

772
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,620
Wait, no, don't go to biggerpipes.com.

773
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,580
No, let's do it.

774
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,780
No, no, oh shit.

775
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,460
Here's the thing, if we still need plungers,

776
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,700
maybe the problem isn't our dukes,

777
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,900
maybe it's that the toilet pipes is too dang small.

778
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,980
Why haven't we made bigger toilet pipes at this point, right?

779
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,020
Yeah, you are talking about Mario size pipes

780
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,620
that you could go on an adventure down.

781
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,660
I'm just saying that I think the only reason

782
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,220
toilet pipes are so small, and I'm sorry, plumbers,

783
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,420
I'm sorry you have to hear me say this and blow up your spot like this,

784
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,620
but it's because big plumbers is keeping them small

785
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,740
so that they're in a job.

786
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,660
I'm saying, give me a big old powerful pipe

787
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,140
that I can send whatever size duke I make down

788
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,300
without having to worry about it, you know what I mean?

789
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,180
Why are you holding me hostage in my latrine?

790
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,460
Now, Travis, when he says big plumbers,

791
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,100
he is not talking about the plumbing industry.

792
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,540
He is talking about the eight and a half foot tall

793
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,420
sort of monster man that does come to his house

794
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,340
whenever they have a plumbing emergency.

795
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,900
Well, he lives in my house technically at this point.

796
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,820
Would terrorize Travis be a fair verb to use

797
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,660
for what the big plumber does to you?

798
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,180
Yeah, and you know what?

799
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,580
Not just physically, but emotionally.

800
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,660
Oh, but physically, wicked physically,

801
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,420
like he hurts you a lot.

802
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,220
But he also says mean things about how big my duke was

803
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,940
and how I should be embarrassed and like, this is all my fault

804
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,020
and I've let down everyone.

805
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,700
Yeah, I remember one time he said you had thick pee

806
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,020
and you were like, dang, that stinks.

807
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,700
And then he hurt you, your body.

808
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,380
Yeah, and then he hurt me real bad.

809
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,500
Then also that.

810
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,660
Then he also said that I use toilet paper

811
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,260
like a baby in a cartoon.

812
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:52,760
Yeah.

813
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,500
And that is true, but it still hurts.

814
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,940
I hate the big plumber.

815
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,700
I think the big plumber sucks.

816
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,580
But you know what?

817
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,660
Also, he pays his rent on time.

818
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,500
No, he does fine, yeah.

819
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,420
I've never had any problems with him

820
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,020
doing his chores on the chore wheel.

821
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,180
So like, there's that, I mean,

822
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,500
he's not the worst roommate I've ever had.

823
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,700
Can I hit you guys with this?

824
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,940
Please don't, I've been hurt so much.

825
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,220
No, okay, but this is different.

826
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,780
This is a, I'm gonna hit you with this idea.

827
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,380
It'll be light, like a cloud.

828
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:24,100
A stick that is the chore's stick.

829
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,340
And every house has a chore's stick.

830
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,620
And then you have a sort of tackle box

831
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:33,140
or perhaps a sort of like wheel that goes in your pantry

832
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,260
that has plunger end.

833
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,220
Multiple size plunger ends for Travis

834
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:43,300
when he needs a special one for his special waste.

835
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,500
But then there can also be broom, mop, swiffer,

836
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:52,020
fucking angled broom for cleaning off the top of your fan blades.

837
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,820
Which folks, you don't, nobody's gonna look up there.

838
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,300
You're okay.

839
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,780
You could also just get compressed air

840
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,540
for like half the jobs in your house, folks.

841
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,140
Yeah, it's okay.

842
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,220
Or you could just get chore's stick.

843
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,540
Careful about blowing that into your face though, folks.

844
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,260
Compressed air?

845
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,180
Yeah, don't.

846
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:08,820
Why not?

847
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,380
Don't do it.

848
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,380
It's not good for you, it's dangerous.

849
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,180
It's too cold.

850
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,340
Give yourself a fucking embolism, it's no good.

851
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:18,340
But chore's stick is safe and it's efficient.

852
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,980
Okay, so we got chore's stick, we got big pipes.

853
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,580
Justin, what have you got to solve this?

854
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,300
Moving.

855
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,140
Oh, this is a new house.

856
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:32,100
So you clog the toilet and you just pack up, move it on.

857
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,780
Pack your bags and move away, exactly.

858
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,060
It's been a long time.

859
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:40,100
Wouldn't that hurt the resale value of the befouled house?

860
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,340
Keep that door locked.

861
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,260
Tell them somebody died.

862
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,300
Yeah, that you break, cat, that it's the Duke of Amontillado.

863
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,100
You just fucking cover it up.

864
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,380
Don't, we don't go in there.

865
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,900
There's no, there used to be a, there did not.

866
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,020
I thought you said this was two and a half bath.

867
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,900
It's two bath.

868
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,940
Now let's move on.

869
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,740
Now let's move on.

870
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,980
It's two and a quarter bath, because I drew in the toilet.

871
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,660
Did you brick up your toilet?

872
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,380
I sure did.

873
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,460
It's a pee-pee one.

874
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,060
So it's two and a quarter, two and a quarter bath.

875
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,260
Just pee-pee in there and leave.

876
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,260
Don't ask a lot of questions.

877
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,860
You could pay, you could maybe, this toilet is permanently clogged,

878
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,500
but you could probably pee-pee it at 12 more times.

879
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:30,420
So please choose wisely while you're living in that home.

880
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,180
Hey man, is it cool if I use your bathroom?

881
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:32,900
No, not that one.

882
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,740
Well, I got four left that I'm saving up.

883
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,580
I got four left.

884
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,180
It's like that Eddie Murphy movie.

885
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,100
Pluto Nash?

886
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:40,660
The Clumps.

887
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,300
Pluto Nash.

888
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:41,860
The Clumps.

889
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,140
Pluto Nash.

890
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:53,220
I'd like to welcome everyone to a new segment Munch Squad Investigates.

891
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,420
That was terrifying.

892
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,980
That was really scary.

893
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,820
There's been a burger murder.

894
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,500
In this one, we're gonna find them and we're gonna put them on blast.

895
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,820
This is a new public service that we're doing on the Munch Squad.

896
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,620
We're gonna find secret restaurants and we're gonna unearth-

897
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,120
Wait.

898
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,540
How secret?

899
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,020
I have-

900
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,520
How?

901
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,260
Secret.

902
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,620
Secret because they are pretending to be a different restaurant than they are.

903
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,260
And I am going to help you unearth this.

904
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,460
I encountered this in my own life with It's Just Wings,

905
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,900
which popped up on DoorDash.

906
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,500
And I was like, ah damn, I would love some wings right now.

907
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,220
And Sydney looked at the menu and I said, what's on the menu?

908
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:39,860
And she she scrolled through and she said, um, It's Just Wings.

909
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,300
I was like, that can't be right.

910
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,980
Everybody's got to have some add-ons.

911
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,820
Turns out they also had curly fries in this heaven menu.

912
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,260
That did a little digging.

913
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:48,760
Yeah.

914
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,940
It's Chili's.

915
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,440
Wait.

916
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,200
What?

917
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,740
Yeah, yeah.

918
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,580
This restaurant that they pretended was another restaurant is actually-

919
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,620
It's Just Wings?

920
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,820
It's not Just Wings.

921
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,860
It's Just Chili's.

922
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,460
So it's Just Wings.

923
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,180
Just Wings.

924
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:11,540
So Chili said, we got a lot of extra wings here that we need to get rid of.

925
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:17,780
We're going to create a second DoorDash, like, landing page

926
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,460
where we just sell our wings and curly fries?

927
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,620
It's just they pretend it's a new restaurant.

928
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:29,380
A new delicious restaurant where it's just wings.

929
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,340
But why?

930
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,380
But it's not just wings.

931
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,260
It's just Chili's.

932
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,380
Don't try to fool me.

933
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,180
I have another one.

934
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,220
This is coming in hot.

935
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,140
I need everybody to be aware of this.

936
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:41,540
Fazzoli's is serving up deep fried wings at their first ghost kitchen in Atlanta,

937
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,740
which is a wild sentence now that I say it out loud.

938
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,700
Hachi machi.

939
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,940
Fazzoli's set up a secret ghost restaurant in Atlanta

940
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,460
to just try to figure out how to do wings good and they'll deliver them to you.

941
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,060
It's no big deal.

942
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,260
It's not the restaurants.

943
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:00,580
It's just Fazzoli's opened up a wing restaurant run by ghosts.

944
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,700
It's just a ghost kitchen.

945
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,900
And I'm actually kind of proud of them for that, if I'm being honest.

946
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:09,060
I don't like the treachery, but I do appreciate them being like,

947
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:13,540
we want to do wings, but we're too nervous to fuck it up in our real stores.

948
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:17,380
We're going to set up a whole fake front just so we can get good at wings

949
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,380
and then bring them to you, Travis.

950
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,100
The markup on wings must be wild because I got another one for you.

951
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,780
Neighborhood wings.

952
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,260
Okay.

953
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,620
There's neighborhood wings.

954
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:31,300
You can get them in Folsom, Pennsylvania, Columbus, Indiana,

955
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,500
Yonkers, New York.

956
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,140
Enjoy some neighborhood wings.

957
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,420
No, where do you?

958
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,820
I'm going to give you all this turned into a game.

959
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,180
Who makes neighborhood wings?

960
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:40,820
Applebee's.

961
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,580
That's right.

962
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,380
We got them.

963
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,140
Applebee's is neighborhood wings.

964
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,900
Stop lying.

965
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,300
Also, Boston Market is secretly rotisserie roast.

966
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,260
I'm not even going to play the sound effect because you could have guessed that one.

967
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:56,760
Why?

968
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,860
I'm still caught up in the psychology of this.

969
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,580
Why is Applebee's like, we need to move our wings?

970
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,220
I'll tell you why.

971
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:04,500
Okay.

972
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,620
This is legit.

973
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:11,780
Like, Chili's and Applebee's, like, Millennials, Gin's, Zoomers,

974
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:17,620
they're not going to Applebee's and Chili's because of the shame associated with them.

975
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,500
But those wings don't lie.

976
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,220
Like, the wings are their wings.

977
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,980
And so if they can call them something cool,

978
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,700
like Tony Hawk's extreme wings or something like that,

979
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:34,500
like something that Zoomers love, then it's, then, you know, you can do a trick on them.

980
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:41,140
So you're telling me they looked at what Chuck E. Cheese did and they said, that was great.

981
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,100
That's a great idea.

982
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,140
We're just going to do that.

983
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:43,640
Yeah.

984
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,660
We all know Chuck E. Cheese's Pasquale's Pizza and wings, right?

985
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,460
If you see a Pasquale's Pizza, you know that's Chuck E. Cheese.

986
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,740
I do also want to warn everyone.

987
00:44:52,740 --> 00:45:00,420
Bucca di Beppo did a pizza one that's called P.Za, which I do have to give it up for.

988
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:00,980
I like that.

989
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,420
That's very good.

990
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,460
That's very good.

991
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,340
And one more.

992
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:12,740
Hooters open up one called Hootie's Burger Bar, which you could do better than that.

993
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,540
That was not a very good-

994
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,100
But that's a primo example.

995
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,180
Lesson is to tie in with Darius Rucker.

996
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,140
There's no Darius Rucker.

997
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,860
That's a primo example, though, of,

998
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:27,620
I've never been to a Hooters because of the sort of it's whole steez.

999
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:33,380
But maybe the food is phenomenal and now I can go to Hootie's

1000
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,780
and it can be whatever I need it to be.

1001
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,940
A little more formal, a little more refined.

1002
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,180
I mean, you have to think the food is good at Hooters.

1003
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,620
Why else would people go there?

1004
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,220
Okay.

1005
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,140
I don't actually want to talk about Hooters.

1006
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,380
I'm sorry.

1007
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:57,300
I do want to say, though, I haven't much about Junior, too.

1008
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,860
If I could just tack this on real quick, because in these corona times,

1009
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:07,380
I think that we're all sort of reeling and figuring out how to deal with it.

1010
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:12,900
And the way that the Sour Patch Kids pop-up store in New York City is dealing with it

1011
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,420
is to be open for you to go to.

1012
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:20,340
Have you ever opened a bag of Sour Patch Kids candy only to think,

1013
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:24,340
what if I could live in this incredible Sour Then Sweet experience?

1014
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,700
Well, think no longer.

1015
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,940
The Sour Patch Kids store is here.

1016
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:32,100
That's right, wall-to-wall Sour Then Sweet awesomeness

1017
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,340
right in the heart of New York City.

1018
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:38,980
Express your inner Sour Patch Kids style with our new merchandise.

1019
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:42,340

with your favorite Sour Patch Kids varieties.

00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,540
And then kill your grandma.

1023
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,380
I'm sorry, I misread.

1024
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,780
But then it'll do something real sweet.

1025
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,860
You'll be like, we did give you coronavirus at our candy store

1026
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,740
that killed your grandma, but here's 10 bucks.

1027
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,420
The kids may like pranks, but they know visitor safety is no joke.

1028
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:11,460
Visitors to the Sour Patch Kids store will be required to wear face covering

1029
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,020
at all times and maintain social distancing.

1030
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,020
It does, there is, if you say you have,

1031
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,660
if you're gonna be in the Sour Patch Kids New York City store,

1032
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,300
you have to wear a face mask.

1033
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:30,100
What you are saying then is by coming into the Sour Patch Kids store,

1034
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:35,140
you're introducing some level of danger into your life, right?

1035
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:35,380
Right.

1036
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,260
What level of danger?

1037
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:42,260
How much do you have to fucking love Sour Patch Kids?

1038
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,660
Because for me, the amount of danger that is worth

1039
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,940
going to the Sour Patch Kids store in New York City is zero.

1040
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:52,580
It is absolute no risk to my safety or my nannies, right?

1041
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,420
That's the absolute bare minimum.

1042
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:57,940
Well, maybe it's that you've already done something else dangerous

1043
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:01,300
that was worth it to you, and then you see the Sour Patch Kids store

1044
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,660
and you're like, might as well.

1045
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,180
I'm already out.

1046
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:07,940
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

1047
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,900
Yes.

1048
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,180
This one was sent in by Graham Robuck.

1049
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,660
Thank you, Graham Robuck, who answers user Servants who asks,

1050
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:17,620
what would you do if you had a friend that went with you everywhere

1051
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,220
and kept saying, you're the man.

1052
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,100
Yeah, you're the man.

1053
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,100
You're the man over and over.

1054
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:25,780
You know?

1055
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,660
It'd be cool for...

1056
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,780
How long would it be cool for?

1057
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,580
I think a couple days.

1058
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,060
Oh, I think up to a week.

1059
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,140
Went everywhere with me.

1060
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:38,180
Yeah, I mean, I guess that is the fine print

1061
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:42,020
is that they would accompany you to the bathroom,

1062
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,460
to the bedroom, to the changing room.

1063
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,300
What about when I sleep?

1064
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,340
Yeah, you're the man.

1065
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,300
Can I still sleep?

1066
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,180
You're the man, you're the man, you're the man.

1067
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,380
You're sleeping so good.

1068
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,180
I'm gonna give you some ASMR.

1069
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,460
You're the man, Tingles.

1070
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,740
You're sleeping so good.

1071
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,780
I'm so proud of you.

1072
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,420
I think it would be cool for a while.

1073
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,700
I think it'd be cool for a while.

1074
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,060
It would actually be not cool instantly for the three of us

1075
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,220
because of how it would taint our audio.

1076
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,540
Yeah, that would be a problem.

1077
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:16,020
If we did have on this show the three of us,

1078
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,700
but then three strangers in the background

1079
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,380
all saying you're the man, yeah, you're the man,

1080
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,460
you're the man over and over,

1081
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,860
I think that would get grating after like half an episode.

1082
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,420
You know what, I feel like I worry that it would

1083
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,580
after a while become disingenuous

1084
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,500
where he's saying you're the man.

1085
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,180
How much are we paying this person?

1086
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,100
Yeah, and you're like, I'm not the man.

1087
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,300
So what I propose five days a week,

1088
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,820
you're the man, you're the man, you're the man.

1089
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,420
On the sixth day, you suck, you're terrible,

1090
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,620
you're a piece of shit.

1091
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,620
On the seventh day, nothing.

1092
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,500
Nothing.

1093
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,220
And then he's back from Monday through Friday.

1094
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:56,820
You have a day of stewing on, I'm a real,

1095
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,940
I'm a fucking stinker.

1096
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,660
Right, and then he comes back and he's like,

1097
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,820
no, don't listen to what that other guy said.

1098
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,420
You're great.

1099
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,140
But it's the same guy.

1100
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,180
Maybe it's a different person.

1101
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,500
Maybe it's a different person in the second episode.

1102
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,860
Oh, you throw him away.

1103
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,420
Yeah, and then the next week it's like,

1104
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,540
or maybe, and you know what,

1105
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,460
maybe it's just a different hat or like mustache

1106
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,740
or whatever, I don't know.

1107
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,980
And he's just like, that last guy was a liar.

1108
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:19,620
You're great.

1109
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:25,220
I feel like it would negate when other people

1110
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,380
in my life tell me I'm the man.

1111
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:28,980
Oh, I see.

1112
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,940
It would be kind of less impactful.

1113
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,100
It would take away your ability to appreciate

1114
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,660
being the man, you know?

1115
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,460
Then how about maybe, let's tweak it a bit.

1116
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,900
They're just asking you, are you the man?

1117
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,140
And it's up to you to answer.

1118
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,140
So it's building your own self-confidence.

1119
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,300
And eventually he's going to say,

1120
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,260
now you're the man and he'll leave, right?

1121
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:52,740
Forever?

1122
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,740
Yeah, you don't need him anymore.

1123
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:57,140
The power's in you because he's asked enough.

1124
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,140
He doesn't say you're the man now.

1125
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,660
He says, now you're the man.

1126
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:05,380
That keeps us out of finding Forester trademark territory,

1127
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,380
which I do appreciate from a legal perspective.

1128
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,220
But instead, it's just asking you

1129
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,980
until you find the confidence with him

1130
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,060
that you don't need him there anymore.

1131
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,420
And then he leaves and moves on.

1132
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,620
And maybe he just moves on to your next door neighbor.

1133
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,660
He doesn't have far to go.

1134
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,700
There's only one of him.

1135
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:24,820
And he has to kind of cover the whole world.

1136
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,900
So he can really only give you like a week.

1137
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,060
So you need to get your shit together.

1138
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:33,300
I do, I mean, we're talking about someone who-

1139
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,380
Wait, hey, can we jump back to earlier in the episode

1140
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,860
when you were talking about a dog bag full of dookie

1141
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:38,980
and it's Johnny Appleseed

1142
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,820
and pretend that I said Johnny Crappleseed?

1143
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,140
No, actually.

1144
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:43,780
Fuck, fuck.

1145
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:44,980
Too far away.

1146
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,020
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1147
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,260
I'm thinking about it.

1148
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:52,020
And like a friend that goes with you everywhere you go,

1149
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,860
who's like, you're not the man yet.

1150
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:54,820
You're not the man.

1151
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,940
No, you're not the man.

1152
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,980
And I do kind of already have that.

1153
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,700
But the friend is inside me.

1154
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,180
The friend's just my brain.

1155
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:07,320
Yes.

1156
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,260
Now see, I have the opposite.

1157
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,100
Yeah, you do have this friend.

1158
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,180
I don't like how gendered it is though.

1159
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:14,500
Okay.

1160
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,780
Yeah, I do.

1161
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,860
Maybe if we had a little bit more specific,

1162
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:21,140
like you're the man, which man?

1163
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,140
The man with the power.

1164
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,020
This is inevitable.

1165
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,580
What about just like, you're the best?

1166
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,340
No, that's too-

1167
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,500
Well, yeah, because man is the best, Travis.

1168
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,860
I'm glad we're finally fucking drawing a line in the sand.

1169
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,980
You're doctor shit.

1170
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:41,860
Or that something?

1171
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:42,100
Yeah.

1172
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,100
Because doctor is gender neutral.

1173
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,580
You're the best rapper in the world.

1174
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,700
You're doctor cool.

1175
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:54,020
You're the esteemed professor shit with tenure.

1176
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,100
You're professor shit emeritus.

1177
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:00,660
I think it would be more useful to me in my day-to-day life

1178
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,420
to have someone who follows me around

1179
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,340
and tells other people that I'm the man.

1180
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:04,900
Yeah.

1181
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,220
Get a load of this guy, he's the man.

1182
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,340
This guy's doctor shit.

1183
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,300
This guy's doctor shit, look at him.

1184
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,260
Fuck yeah, dude.

1185
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,460
Hey, are you getting pumped for this guy?

1186
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,140
This guy's doctor shit.

1187
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:20,260
He went to shit medical school for seven years for this.

1188
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:25,540
Get out of the way, here comes Judge Cool.

1189
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,060
Hey, everyone, it's me, Judge Cool.

1190
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:31,460
I would love to have that in my marriage, just like,

1191
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,860
hey, Sydney, are you getting a load of this fucking guy?

1192
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,780
Look how much broccoli he's eating.

1193
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,980
I'm going wild over here.

1194
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,220
I can't believe you're missing this

1195
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,580
to pay attention to your kids.

1196
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,340
Look at this guy, he's putting it away.

1197
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,540
This is the thing, right?

1198
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:47,780
That we're all jealous of 90s hip-hop artists for, right?

1199
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:48,980
The hype man.

1200
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:51,700
None of it, you can't have a hype man in day-to-day life.

1201
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,700
I can't be walking around and someone's like,

1202
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,540
Travis, rocking them jeans.

1203
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,820
Like, I can't do that.

1204
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,540
I want that, we all want that.

1205
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,420
We all want it.

1206
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,020
We all want a hype man whose entire existence

1207
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:08,020
is just about like that they are revolving around us

1208
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:13,300
and they are the more eel to our great white shirt.

1209
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,820
We all want that.

1210
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,060
A sort of emotional pilot fish, if you will.

1211
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:17,560
Yes.

1212
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,180
I'm not sure we all want that.

1213
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,940
No, I wicked don't want that.

1214
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,460
You don't want a hype person?

1215
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,460
I want silence sometimes.

1216
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,660
Right now, for instance, is a good time.

1217
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,260
Well, I can give that to you, Griffin,

1218
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,660
by way of saying that thank you for listening to our podcast,

1219
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:33,620
my brother, my mother and me.

1220
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,900
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1221
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,660
We are so happy that you made a little time to hang out with us.

1222
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,700
It's been a delight, as always.

1223
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,700
And thank you.

1224
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,540
I was just going to say, you know,

1225
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,580
but I'm just going to say get out there and register to vote.

1226
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,700
If you're not registered to vote,

1227
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,780
get out there and register to vote.

1228
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:56,020
And I'm going to say don't vote for Donald Trump in the 2020 election.

1229
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,540
I'm just going to say that to you.

1230
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,780
Yeah, that would be actually a very bad thing to do.

1231
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,740
And don't do that.

1232
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:01,780
Don't do that.

1233
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:05,940
So register your vote and then maybe use that vote

1234
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,460
to oppose the candidate that might actually win again.

1235
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,300
Or no, use that vote.

1236
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:11,860
Here he goes.

1237
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:15,380
To vote for the candidate that might actually win against Donald Trump

1238
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,780
so that Donald Trump does not continue to be president.

1239
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,260
Wow, fit that on a sign, folks.

1240
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,220
I'm fucking motivated.

1241
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:24,980
Yeah, so register to vote and use that vote against Donald Trump.

1242
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,660
Also, make sure you're signed up for mail-in ballot

1243
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:32,420
because that's going to be the best, safest way to do it this time.

1244
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:35,060
Thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1245
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,060
Thank you also to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1246
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,500
for using our theme song, It's a Departure,

1247
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,100
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1248
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,140
It shreds, rips, slaps.

1249
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,100
It's so fucking good.

1250
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,820
And I think that's it.

1251
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,260
Y'all want that final?

1252
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,060
Oh, oh, oh.

1253
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:49,540
Absolutely.

1254
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:53,220
We wrote a book about podcasting that you can pre-order up beyond January

1255
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,980
and go to the macroypodcastingbook.com.

1256
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,700
It's called Everybody Has a Podcast Except You.

1257
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,260
It's good and you'll enjoy it

1258
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,420
and it'll teach you how to make a podcast you're proud of.

1259
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,020
It's got jokes and lessons.

1260
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,580
This is finally Yahoo sent in by the prospector Merritt Palmer.

1261
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,220

Diana, who asks,

1264
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:22,180
what is the best vintage children's book about horses that's not well known?

1265
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,260
My name is Justin McElroy.

I'm Griffin McElroy.

1268

It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1269
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,540
Kiss your dad.

1270
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:43,620
Square on the lips.
