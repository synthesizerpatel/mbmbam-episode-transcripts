1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
Ah, it's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,660
My life

7
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,660
Ah, ah, ah, ah

8
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,660
It's better, it's better with you

9
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,660
This is true

10
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,660
Ah, ah, ah, ah

11
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,660
It's better, it's better with you

12
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,660
My life

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,660
Ah, ah, ah, ah

14
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,660
Ah, ah, ah, ah

15
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,660
It's better with you

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,660
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,660
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy

18
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,660
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,660
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy

20
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,660
Took too long

21
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,660
Oh Griffin

22
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,660
We were trying to do like a you're 1995 Chicago Bulls kind of stuff

23
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,660
Travis wasn't on that trick

24
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,660
McElroy, you are in

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,660
England

26
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,660
Oh, yeah

27
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,660
And I think it sounds a little something like this

28
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,660
Go ahead, Justin

29
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,660
Go ahead, Justin, what does England sound like?

30
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,660
Around him?

31
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,660
Yeah, do like what England sounds like

32
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,660
Here's the horse clomps

33
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,660
This is like a village

34
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,660
Yeah

35
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,660
Your sconebread's ready, guv

36
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,660
That's good, cool

37
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,660
That's what it'll be like there. Travis, it's so weird that you're in England right now

38
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,660
I mean, not while you're recording this

39
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,660
But like, when you're listening to this, probably, you're in London

40
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,660
Oh, wait, when I'm listening to it?

41
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,660
Justin, I don't listen to our own

42
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,660
You're in England

43
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,660
You're in England, dude, how lucky

44
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,660
How are you preparing?

45
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,660
Okay, this is the thing about us

46
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,660
A lot of people, we don't talk about it enough

47
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,660
No, we don't talk about Bruno

48
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,660
It's like Bruno

49
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,660
We don't talk about it enough

50
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,660
We all work out of our houses

51
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,660
Our houses are not acclimated to, like, outside play

52
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,660
Outside our house

53
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,660
Or the sun

54
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,660
So we have to have extremely specific nigh on hermetic conditions

55
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,660
Correct

56
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,660
That just sort of follow us around

57
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,660
If we are to perform in the way to which people have become accustomed

58
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,660
Travis, you are like, you're leaving the bubble in such a major way right now

59
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,660
I've done a couple things

60
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,660
You know how you're compensating

61
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,660
I've done a couple things to prepare

62
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,660
You can't, you're

63
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,660
Travis

64
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,660
I don't want to get too worked up about this, but you're going into a situation

65
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,660
Where if you were

66
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,660
In discomfort or inconvenience

67
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,660
President Joseph

68
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,660
Gordon Biden himself

69
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,660
Could not intercede

70
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,660
On your behalf

71
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,660
Well, I have diplomatic immunity

72
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,660
You're risking major political repercussions

73
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,660
I moved to DC

74
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,660
So I could be closer

75
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,660
To the support of daddy

76
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,660
I mean, Joseph Gordon-Biden

77
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,660
By the president

78
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,660
So that if I get hurt or uncomfortable

79
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,660
Daddy would be

80
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,660
I mean, Joseph Gordon-Biden would be right there for me

81
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,660
Yeah, no, J.G. Biden gave me diplomatic immunity when I get over there

82
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,660
So that's going to help a lot

83
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,660
That's going to help a lot

84
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,660
Also, I learned

85
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,660
I don't know if you guys know this

86
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,660
Every McDonald's in the U.K. operates as an American embassy

87
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,660
So if I go there

88
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,660
That's good

89
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,660
So the two things that I've done to prepare

90
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,660
Is one, I got those

91
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,660
Those shoes

92
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,660
That are like rubberized

93
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,660
And they're like toe socks, but they're like rubberized shoes

94
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,660
And that's going to help me walk on the cobblestones

95
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,660
Well

96
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,660
Did you really get the sock shoes?

97
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,660
Well, I got it adjusted for the cobblestones

98
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,660
For the cobblestones

99
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,660
It helps with the grip

100
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,660
Did you see Free Solo?

101
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,660
So fucking funny

102
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,660
I really expanded the canon a lot

103
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,660
Now, the second thing I've done

104
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,660
Did you ever read that children's book

105
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,660
Where the man sells hats by stacking all the hats on top of his head?

106
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,660
Yes

107
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,660
I think it's called Come Get These Hats

108
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,660
I've done that, but with masks

109
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,660
So what I'm going to do is

110
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,660
I've got a stack of masks

111
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,660
About ten masks deep

112
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,660
That I wear on my face

113
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,660
Each one more powerful than the next

114
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,660
And did you say Sticky Ricky hat stack shoes?

115
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,660
Is the name of that book?

116
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,660
Yeah

117
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,660
Then the monkeys come and Sticky Ricky is like

118
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,660
You took my hat stack, I don't want it to do now

119
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,660
To God that I had just said Sticky Ricky hat stack

120
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,660
Into oblivion

121
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,660
My track could be lowered at that point

122
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,660
So I was no longer on it

123
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,660
We're going to have Rachel raise it up and lower it

124
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,660
By the way, Tricky Ricky hat stack

125
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,660
Oh, Sticky Ricky hat stack

126
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,660
Is the sequel

127
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,660
That makes a lot more sense

128
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,660
That's the vivid entertainment version of it

129
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,660
It sucks that me and Justin are just stuck here in stupid old America

130
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,660
That's okay, you can hold it down

131
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,660
We've been here for so long

132
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,660
And haven't gotten a break like you're about to get

133
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,660
Hey, I also just days ago

134
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,660
Just two days ago

135
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,660
Remembered that I needed to dig out my power adapter for the plugs

136
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,660
Can we get this shit together? It's 2022

137
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,660
Can we figure this out guys? It's metal and electricity

138
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,660
I'm not saying it has to all be the shape of America's plug

139
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:55,660
I'm saying how can we not as a planet universally decide on a plug shape

140
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,660
Let's talk about it

141
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,660
Let's get into this

142
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,660
Countries get electricity at different times

143
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,660
There's a chart I'm sure

144
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,660
At night you don't need it

145
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,660
Can none of them

146
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,660
Are they so horny for electricity

147
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,660
That they can't wait to ask the next country

148
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,660
How did you guys do this?

149
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,660
What was your plan?

150
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,660
You meant they get it at different times throughout history

151
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,660
Not that everybody takes turns using electricity throughout the day

152
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,660
There is someone who did it first and then there's someone who did it second

153
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:37,660
And the person who did it second looked at the country that did it first

154
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,660
And was like, fuck that

155
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,660
We can do a better plug

156
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,660
But that's not how science works

157
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,660
That's not how tech works

158
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,660
Where you do one thing and then you rock with it

159
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,660
Although that is how we've done plugs

160
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,660
I think it sucks

161
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,660
Every place has their own plugs

162
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,660
And sometimes it's easy to get them twisted up

163
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,660
Because there's different shapes of prongs

164
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,660
I want just one big prong

165
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,660
One big prong

166
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,660
One big hole

167
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,660
Not, I guess, big enough for a kid finger

168
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,660
But like

169
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,660
You're going to the promised land because the UK just made a rule

170
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,660
Every plug's got to be USB-C

171
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,660
No more lightning over there

172
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,660
They don't got lightning in England

173
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,660
Bring plugs

174
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,660
They threw away all the lightning cords

175
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,660
You have to

176
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,660
That's the weird thing

177
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,660
King Charles did it

178
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,660
And then the only thing

179
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,660
Then he abdicated and handed it to William

180
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,660
That one thing was bugging me a lot

181
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,660
What people don't realize is that

182
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,660
Queen Elizabeth

183
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,660
Made a law that it all had to be

184
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,660
Micro-USB

185
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,660
And actually it was

186
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,660
Initially mini-USB

187
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,660
It was mini-USB, the really chunky boy

188
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,660
And Charles would sit behind her like

189
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,660
Mom, please

190
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,660
Mom, this sucks

191
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,660
I can't charge my Nintendo DS

192
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,660
Mom

193
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,660
Please make it so that it's here

194
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,660
The first thing he did when he's king, he's like, what's up?

195
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,660
Give me all your lightning plugs

196
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,660
They're going on a bonfire

197
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,660
And what is your second proclamation?

198
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,660
I didn't think beyond this

199
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,660
I didn't have a lot of time to think about it

200
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,660
Just like the last 70 years

201
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,660
But I've decided

202
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,660
I'm done now

203
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,660
William, take it home

204
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,660
The crown owns all the USB-C cords

205
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,660
So

206
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,660
Those are all owned by the king

207
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,660
By the TV show The Crown

208
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,660
Okay, bye

209
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,660
The king

210
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,660
Now owns all the swans

211
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,660
In England, right? You know this thing

212
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,660
That owns all the swans

213
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,660
Now the king owns all the swans

214
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,660
What?

215
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,660
The queen

216
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,660
The monarchy of England

217
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,660
The queen of England

218
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,660
She owned all the swans

219
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,660
They legally belong to her

220
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,660
Correct

221
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,660
If you fuck with any swan in England

222
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,660
The queen could come to you and be like

223
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,660
That's my swan

224
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,660
That sucks

225
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,660
As long as we're on this note

226
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,660
As long as someone whose job is like

227
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,660
I take care of the ravens

228
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,660
And that's his deal

229
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,660
That's fine

230
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,660
That's one bird keeper is fine

231
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,660
Did the swans sign off on this?

232
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,660
She also owns all the whales

233
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,660
People don't talk about that as much

234
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,660
It doesn't come up as often

235
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,660
She owns all the whales

236
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,660
It's rare, Justin, that you're driving too fast

237
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,660
Down the motorway and hit a whale

238
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,660
She's not as worried about those

239
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,660
Well, she's not as worried about anything anymore

240
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,660
Do you think

241
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,660
She's dead, Griffin

242
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,660
It's time that you accept it and move on

243
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,660
Do you think when King Charles got the crown

244
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,660
He found some swans that he had had particularly bad interactions with

245
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,660
And was like

246
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,660
What's up now?

247
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,660
What's up now?

248
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,660
Now who owns you?

249
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,660
Justin, I actually think what happened is he got the crown and he went to sleep

250
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,660
Heavy head, by the way, let's establish

251
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,660
And then he was awoken in the middle of the night

252
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,660
That was a bit of a fall

253
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,660
But this crown is quite heavy

254
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,660
And he was woken by a tick on his nose

255
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,660
And there was just like a crowd of swans around

256
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,660
And we're like, all right

257
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,660
Now that she's gone, we've got some demands

258
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,660
We want to make sure that you're looking out

259
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,660
For our whole deal

260
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,660
If you could bring back long necks as a beautiful thing

261
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,660
I think that that is gone

262
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,660
There's a narrative that is spreading

263
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,660
That you're not supposed to give bread to birds

264
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,660
And we hate that

265
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,660
We don't like that

266
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,660
So if you could bring

267
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,660
Bread and also

268
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,660
Peanut butter M&Ms in there

269
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,660
We love peanut butter M&Ms

270
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,660
And we never get to eat those

271
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,660
And we've wanted to declare war on geese for a while

272
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,660
And if you could like back us up on that

273
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,660
If we could form some kind of alliance

274
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,660
Of Britain and swans

275
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,660
V. geese

276
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,660
That would be really huge

277
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,660
They all have a straight face for a long time

278
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,660
And they all bust up like, ah, just kidding

279
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,660
Geese and swan are the same birds

280
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,660
One of us is pretty and one of us is ugly

281
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,660
But that's just like humans, right?

282
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,660
Some of you are prettier than others, right?

283
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,660
Anyway, where's mom?

284
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,660
What? What happened?

285
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,660
Anyway

286
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,660
That was, I think, actually the most

287
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,660
Moving part of her state funeral

288
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,660
Is when all the swans

289
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660
In England showed up to pay their respects

290
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,660
It was really beautiful

291
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,660
But Travis, you're in

292
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,660
England. I hope you're having a good time

293
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,660
I hope you're enjoying yourself. I hope I am too, Justin

294
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,660
It's the future me

295
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,660
Do you think you'll come back with an accent?

296
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,660
I actually think I'll come back with

297
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,660
Less of an accent than I have now

298
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,660
Oh, okay. And what's that

299
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,660
Going to sound like, Travis?

300
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,660
Hello, I am Travis

301
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,660
This is Travis and I am doggy

302
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,660
Yeah, that's less

303
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,660
British. Is this more pleasant for you,

304
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,660
Griffin?

305
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,660
Kinda, actually

306
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,660
When Travis leaves the country

307
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,660
Griffin and I become functionally unemployed

308
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,660
This is true

309
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,660
And such, we have had to record

310
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,660
A lot of content in the past week

311
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
True

312
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,660
And I, honestly, I'm feeling

313
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,660
Sometimes that goes one way

314
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,660
Where it's like, I have nothing, I've never been funny

315
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,660
Reddit's right

316
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,660
And then

317
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,660
Reddit's right about everything

318
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,660
Sometimes it goes the other way where I just start feeling

319
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,660
Loose. I feel like this is my default state

320
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,660
The juice is loose, for sure

321
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,660
The juice is loose on this one

322
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,660
It's an advice show

323
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,660
We're gonna read advice

324
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,660
We're gonna do more than two questions this week

325
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,660
Let's go. We only did one last week

326
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,660
Only did one last week

327
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,660
That's a huge, that's a

328
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,660
I mean, 100%, can't be 100%

329
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,660
Well,

330
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,660
I believe the conversion rate, Justin, is one

331
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,660
American question to 1.2

332
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,660
British questions. I've been

333
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,660
Setting up for a little bit

334
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,660
By the way, though, I will say

335
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,660
Exchange rate, you're going at a real

336
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,660
Real choice, baby

337
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,660
I don't acknowledge the

338
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,660
Importance of money, so I guess

339
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,660
That just doesn't matter to me. One currency

340
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,660
One prong. One prong

341
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,660
For all. Uniting us

342
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,660
Thank you. Earth dollars

343
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,660
Earth prongs. That's what I've always said

344
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,660
Bit prong. Bit prong

345
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,660
There's one prong for the

346
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,660
Blockchain. Okay

347
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,660
Um, I work the

348
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,660
Graveyard shift at the chain grocery store

349
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,660
Typically my job is to put things on shelves

350
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,660
And make said things on shelves look nice

351
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,660
Use a planet gram

352
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,660
Do some merchandising. Oh yeah, planet

353
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,660
Gram. Just love that. Oh god, what I wouldn't

354
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,660
Do for a nice planet gram right now. However

355
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,660
I also

356
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,660
Find myself bringing

357
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,660
Damaged goods to the damaged goods pile

358
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,660
Choice, so another guy

359
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,660
Can scan it and the store can get that

360
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,660
Money back. Most of the

361
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,660
Time, these are things like

362
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,660
Dented or leaking cans, crunched up boxes

363
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,660
And exploded jello cups. However, sometimes

364
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,660
I will find an open box

365
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,660
Of granola bars in the back of the shelf with a few

366
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,660
Missing. Probably because someone decided

367
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,660
Just stealing one or two would be easier

368
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Than stealing the whole box. My question is

369
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,660
Would it be morally okay for me

370
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,660
To also take a granola bar

371
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,660
From that box. Yes, get the fucking granola

372
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,660
It's not like they can go back on the shelf and the scanning guy

373
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,660
Just needs to do the box itself, but also

374
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,660
Like, it is stealing. That's from

375
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,660
Conflicted in Colorado. Okay, okay

376
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,660
Okay, Griffin is right. Here's the thing

377
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,660
What you are asking is the wrong

378
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,660
Question, question asker. Is it

379
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,660
Morally okay? Yes, absolutely

380
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,660
Might you get in trouble if you get caught?

381
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,660
Yes. That is because

382
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,660
Business practices

383
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,660
Rarely line up with morality

384
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,660
Listen

385
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,660
Listen

386
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,660
They expect you

387
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,660
They almost want you to steal the granola bars

388
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,660
And I'm not even going to say the word

389
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,660
Verb steal anymore. It's

390
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,660
Your labor

391
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,660
Has value

392
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,660
And you understand that, and your employer

393
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,660
Understands that, and I can almost guarantee

394
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,660
That you are not being

395
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,660
You are not receiving fair compensation

396
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,660
For that. But they can't tell you

397
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,660
Like, you're

398
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,660
Going to be paid $11.50

399
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,660
An hour, which is like

400
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,660
Not enough money for anything

401
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,660
And also

402
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,660
If you want to swipe

403
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,660
If you want to take

404
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,660
Also we offer vacation

405
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,660
We offer vacation time to the

406
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,660
Nature valley

407
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,660
Quink, quink, quink, quink

408
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,660
And where you'll have a

409
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,660
Crunchy time

410
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,660
They can't

411
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,660
Say that. You need to take the granola bars

412
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,660
You need to compensate

413
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,660
Yourself with everything that you possibly can

414
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,660
Okay

415
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,660
Food dates, expiration dates

416
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,660
They're made up. So we waste lots of

417
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,660
Food that way. In Montana

418
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,660
In Montana, they made a rule

419
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,660
To protect the dairy industry there

420
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,660
That you have to throw milk

421
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,660
Out 12 days after pasteurization

422
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,660
Which is a massive

423
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,660
Incredible waste. That's ridiculous

424
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,660
You can't even turn the stuff into cheese

425
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,660
Anymore, because the processing plants

426
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,660
Those that moved out of Montana, it's such a

427
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,660
Ginormous waste. And the people

428
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,660
Who, they were talking to a grocer

429
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,660
On plant money, who's in the system

430
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,660
And it's illegal for him to donate the milk to homeless

431
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,660
Shelters. Illegal!

432
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,660
For him to donate the milk

433
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,660
But he

434
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,660
You know what he does? He doesn't

435
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,660
Donates the milk, because it's the right

436
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,660
Thing to do. And the right thing

437
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,660
For you to do, is to not let these

438
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,660
Bars end up in a landfill

439
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,660
Unless that landfill is called

440
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
Reggie's tummy

441
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,660
And your name is Reggie, and your body's a landfill

442
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,660
Reggie! And then just like, take all

443
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,660
Of them, eat one of them, hand out

444
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,660
The rest to people you see who need some

445
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,660
Who need a granola bar. And can I tell

446
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,660
You something? That's

447
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,660
Pretty much anyone could eat

448
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,660
A granola bar at any time. That's why

449
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,660
If it exists, no one's ever like

450
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,660
I'm starving, I can't wait to get

451
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,660
Home and eat a granola bar

452
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,660
You have the granola bar with you, because that's

453
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,660
Your moment to be like, I'm not hungry, but maybe

454
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,660
I could be hungry in the future

455
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,660
That is the tagline of granola bars

456
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,660
Absolutely, it's like

457
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,660
You don't want to eat this, but if you don't

458
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,660
Eat something, you're gonna throw up

459
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,660
So reach for Nature Valley

460
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,660
Nature Valley, it's literally

461
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,660
Better than nothing

462
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,660
Um, hey

463
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,660
Do you all want to go

464
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,660
On over to

465
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,660
Visit my friend

466
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,660
And yours, the wizard? I feel like

467
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,660
We were just there. Okay

468
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,660
Well, we were just there, we do this every week

469
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,660
Summer sent this in, thank you

470
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,660
It's just like I see

471
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,660
The wizard more than I see our dad

472
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,660
And I don't know how I feel about that

473
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,660
I feel, I mean our dad doesn't have

474
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,660
Magic wisdom

475
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,660
Not magic wisdom, but I mean

476
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,660
He's seen a lot of shit

477
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,660
He went through World War II, I think

478
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,660
Yeah, he definitely did one of them, right?

479
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,660
Our dad did at least one war

480
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,660
He was in one of them, did he do

481
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,660
Wait, hold on

482
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,660
Is our dad a draft dodger?

483
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,660
No, dad's not a draft dodger

484
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,660
He would

485
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,660
He was extremely close to being

486
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,660
Drafted, and then

487
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,660
The war ended, so he didn't

488
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,660
Get it

489
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,660
Drafted. How convenient

490
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,660
As a result of this

491
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,660
As a result of this

492
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,660
Specific one only thing

493
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,660
Dad used to extol the virtues

494
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,660
Of Richard Nixon as a president

495
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,660
Because whatever actions

496
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,660
He did take

497
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,660
Didn't prevent dad from going to Vietnam

498
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,660
Whatever else

499
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,660
Richard Nixon did the shit thing right

500
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,660
One of our worst presidents

501
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,660
Save for our daddy

502
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,660
Okay

503
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,660
As a beneficiary

504
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,660
There's a very good chance the three of us

505
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,660
Either wouldn't have been here or might have

506
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,660
Been raised by a very different man

507
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,660
A different Clint McElroy

508
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,660
Oh god

509
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,660
You okay? You hit your elbow?

510
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,660
No, I'm having

511
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,660
The idea of our dad on a battlefield

512
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,660
Is giving your son

513
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,660
His bud rimshot voice

514
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,660
As he's getting shot at

515
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,660
Stop, stop

516
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,660
Oh man, in at least one of the

517
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,660
Planes, Clint McElroy has probably been

518
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,660
Anyway, our dad's not

519
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,660
A good soldier, this is

520
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,660
SummerSent this in, it's WikiHow

521
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,660
How to take care of a

522
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,660
Monster High doll

523
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,660
If you have a Monster High doll

524
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,660
But you don't know how to take care of it, this article can help

525
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,660
Do you all have any of these in your house?

526
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,660
Yes, I have Monster High dolls

527
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,660
No, I don't allow representations of

528
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,660
Demonic figures into my home

529
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,660
Okay

530
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,660
We just watched the Monster High movie

531
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,660
There's this thing now with Kids Entertainment

532
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,660
Where they turn cartoons

533
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,660
Into real people

534
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,660
Like, The Really Loud House

535
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,660
You know that

536
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,660
Uncanny Valley real people

537
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,660
As the cartoon characters, Loud House Christmas

538
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,660
That's a series now

539
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,660
Why do we need to bring cartoons to life with real people?

540
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,660
It's very upsetting to me

541
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,660
See, I thought you meant like, where they were like

542
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,660
You know how you love My Little Pony Friendship is Magic?

543
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,660
Let's make them into more people

544
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,660
Now they're called Equestria Girls

545
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,660
And it's like, we're just gonna ignore the fact

546
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,660
That they were once horses

547
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,660
And are now people, it's normal, it's fine

548
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,660
Don't worry about it

549
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,660
I saw one of Hey Arnold, but it was

550
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,660
It's the equivalent of looking at Deviant Art

551
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,660
And like, taking one strap off the shoulder

552
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,660
Like, is this what you want?

553
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,660
Okay, well

554
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,660
We'll make it more human-like, I guess

555
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,660
Anyway, I was gonna make a great

556
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,660
Hey Arnold joke, but that time has passed

557
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,660
Now we're gonna learn how to take care of a Monster High doll

558
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,660
Tending to your doll, comfort the doll

559
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,660
Make sure she's not shy or afraid

560
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,660
Close your eyes when something scary is happening

561
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,660
And read about her online to make sure she is comfortable

562
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,660
With any activity you might do with her

563
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,660
Wait, wait

564
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,660
That last bit? Yeah

565
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,660
Whoa, that

566
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,660
Hey, start to finish

567
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,660
Sometimes there's a rollercoaster of emotions in a thing

568
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,660
This was like a rollercoaster of like, questionable

569
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,660
Except it just kept going down

570
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,660
Further and further

571
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,660
If there's necessary

572
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,660
Care steps

573
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,660
To the toy I've purchased

574
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,660
At Target for $15

575
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,660
I expect that documentation to be provided

576
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,660
Alongside the toy

577
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,660
It's not like in

578
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,660
Fucking gremlins, they're like, look at this little

579
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,660
Cutie pie, real cute

580
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,660
You gotta take good care of him

581
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,660
Get online, call the helpline, check the forums

582
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,660
You'll get there

583
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,660
Not that it would've fucking mattered

584
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,660
Yeah, that kid

585
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,660
He had three fucking rules, dude

586
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,660
Three rules, not hard

587
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,660
Hey, you know what? I own a dog

588
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,660
Way more rules about keeping that damn thing alive

589
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,660
It's like a billion rules

590
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,660
Don't give it grapes, you know what I haven't done yet?

591
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,660
Giving my dog grapes

592
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,660
Yeah, you're crushing him

593
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,660
You couldn't keep track of the fucking time

594
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,660
To not feed them after goddamn midnight

595
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,660
You loser

596
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,660
I know, I know

597
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,660
Change the doll's clothes

598
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,660
Here's the thing that I don't like

599
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,660
Griffin, I want to acknowledge something in that

600
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Go ahead

601
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,660
Make sure your doll isn't scared of things

602
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,660
But also cover their eyes when something scary happens

603
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,660
And that just seems to me like

604
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,660
I'm teaching the doll to be afraid

605
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,660
And also, aren't they monsters?

606
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,660
Yeah, they're Frankensteins and Dracula's and mummies

607
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,660
Why, they're not scared?

608
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,660
Yeah, famously

609
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,660
Frankenstein's famously not afraid of

610
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,660
Anything

611
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,660
Except fire

612
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,660
And a little girl one time

613
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,660
And water and a

614
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,660
Shadow and a bug

615
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,660
Is a werewolf afraid of the moon?

616
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,660
Or silver bullets or

617
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,660
Does a werewolf acknowledge that those things are scary?

618
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,660
It's afraid of how much it loves the moon

619
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,660
It's like, oh, there's that thing again, I need it

620
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,660
I need it

621
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,660
Change the doll's clothes

622
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,660
You don't want to be in the same outfit for two days and neither does she

623
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,660
That's two assumptions you've just made there that are both

624
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,660
Equally incorrect

625
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,660
Buy her new clothes at a toy store or other shops

626
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,660
You could also use other doll clothes that fit

627
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,660
You can even try to make your own

628
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,660
Also have a container or such to keep her clothes in

629
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,660
You don't want to lose them

630
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,660
As a parent

631
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,660
That last bit is actually clutch

632
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,660
They should listen to that, get a container, folks

633
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,660
Get a container and make sure you keep all the clothes

634
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,660
In the container

635
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,660
Somehow my children have like

636
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,660
Sort of shorts

637
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,660
Dead drops all around the house

638
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,660
So that if they

639
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,660
If things go wrong

640
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,660
And we need to bug

641
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,660
Out

642
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,660
They have options

643
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,660
Shorts?

644
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,660
Shorts with in-reach

645
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,660
I will say that

646
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,660
One of the things that I was not expecting as a parent

647
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,660
Is how many

648
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,660
Different spaces you need throughout your home

649
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,660
For Barbie shoes

650
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,660
Every room

651
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,660
It's like a fire extinguisher

652
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,660
Except for Barbie feet

653
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,660
Which is like, well yeah

654
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,660
In case there ends up being a Barbie within six inches

655
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,660
Of any place, make sure that there's at least

656
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,660
One pair of shoes in there

657
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,660
At least according to my children, that's the deal

658
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,660
For some reason chapstick has to be fucking everywhere

659
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,660
Kids love this shit

660
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,660
You guys heard about this?

661
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,660
Kids love chapstick and acorns

662
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,660
I mean what if, you know

663
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,660
If we can make acorn flavored chapstick or chapstick shaped like acorns

664
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,660
Richmond

665
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,660
Cause what if Skipper drops a glass

666
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,660
And it shatters

667
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,660
And now all of a sudden Barbie don't want to get cuts on her feet

668
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,660
And you need shoes everywhere

669
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,660
Take her outside, they need fresh air like we do

670
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,660
They don't

671
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,660
If you bring Draculaura outside, make sure she has a toy umbrella

672
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,660
Or sunscreen

673
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,660
So she doesn't burn

674
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,660
If you bring Laguna, make her weight in water

675
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,660
If you bring Laguna, make her weight in water

676
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,660
If you bring Laguna, make her weight in water

677
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,660
Make sure you always keep an eye on your doll

678
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,660
As not not lose it during your excursions

679
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,660
As not not lose it during your excursions

680
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,660
That's true because if you're not careful

681
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,660
Hawks who's down picks it right up

682
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,660
Hawks who's down will eat Draculaura whole

683
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,660
I don't

684
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,660
It's fucked up that in the same paragraph

685
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,660
Is like, they need to go outside

686
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,660
But Draculaura will die outside

687
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,660
It's a high risk game for Draculaura

688
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,660
It's a high risk game for Draculaura

689
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,660
She needs it, but she will die if you do it wrong

690
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,660
She'll burst into flames

691
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,660
And that'll be on you

692
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,660
The wet one must stay wet

693
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,660
The wet one must stay wet

694
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,660
It's a spooky season, right?

695
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,660
I feel that more and more these days

696
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,660
Vampire lore is getting pretty loose

697
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,660
With the ability to go outside

698
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,660
If I could take an umbrella out

699
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,660
It's not that restrictive as a vampire

700
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,660
If that's covering it

701
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,660
Then it's just like, oh, I guess I'm fine now

702
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,660
Then it's just like, oh, I guess I'm fine now

703
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,660
I can wear a big hat and some

704
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,660
I believe the word was sunscreen

705
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,660
Never once in Vampirina

706
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,660
Never once in Vampirina

707
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,660
Do we ever see her feast on human flesh

708
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,660
And I know that seems like a big jump

709
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,660
But it's something I've been thinking about a lot lately

710
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,660
And now my only six-year-old daughter

711
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,660
Started to question like, she's a vampire, right?

712
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,660
So she drinks blood

713
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,660
And I don't know how to answer that

714
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,660
But on the other side

715
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,660
Dracula won't get her

716
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,660
Like, that's why we love summertime

717
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,660
Treat the doll like a child

718
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,660
You are her mom

719
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,660
So you need to take care of her

720
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,660
Give her food, baths, and basically follow these instructions

721
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,660
To make sure she is a happy doll

722
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,660
Keep the doll safe

723
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,660
Keep the doll safe

724
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,660
She might get broken if you don't

725
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,660
Or worse, what's worse?

726
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,660
Dead

727
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,660
Yeah, Lotso Love Bear

728
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,660
You might throw her into a big fiery pit

729
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,660
With all of your childhood toys

730
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,660
Down a grate

731
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,660
Where you can see her

732
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,660
But you can't get to her

733
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,660
Oh, that would be the worst

734
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,660
Oh, that's bad

735
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,660
Yeah, feed her to a Pennywise

736
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,660
Pennywise eats your doll right up

737
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,660
Another kid takes her

738
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,660
From your hand to the playground

739
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,660
Because the kid's bigger and stronger than you are

740
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,660
But they don't know

741
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,660
To go to wiki how to find out

742
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,660
That Draculaura is alive

743
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,660
So that's a fake

744
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,660
Then you don't keep her grades up

745
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,660
Undress the doll in a private place

746
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,660
Like a bathroom or closet

747
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,660
Or she might get upset that other Monster High dolls saw her naked

748
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,660
Thank you

749
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,660
That's based on decency

750
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,660
You actually should not be there either

751
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,660
You should leave the doll on the floor

752
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,660
And then leave the room

753
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,660
You need to use tools

754
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
That mechanics use to get into your car

755
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,660
When you lock your keys in the car

756
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,660
And you close from under the crack of the door

757
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,660
Now I think though

758
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,660
There should be a step above that

759
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,660
Where she's like, ask your Monster High doll

760
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,660
Does she want the other Monster High dolls to see her naked

761
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,660
Because maybe she's just like

762
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,660
I love this

763
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,660
I'm proud of everything that Monster God gave me

764
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,660
Thank you, Monster God

765
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,660
Thank you, Monster God

766
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,660
For my rockin' bod

767
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,660
That's what I say every day when I wake up

768
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,660
I step out of the shower and I loudly announce

769
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,660
Thank you, Monster God, for my rockin' bod

770
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,660
And then I lotion up

771
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,660
This is me talking, by the way

772
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,660
Not a Monster High doll

773
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,660
That would be weird

774
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,660
No, this is important, that's Travis saying

775
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,660
How he does his moisturization

776
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,660
Create a humbly and proudly

777
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,660
And devoutly

778
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,660
And resoundingly

779
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,660
And resoundingly

780
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,660
It's kind of like the opening scene

781
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,660
Praise Monster God for my rockin' bod

782
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,660
And then I flagellate myself in private

783
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,660
Then I apply the lotion

784
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,660
It's basically like the opening to American Psycho

785
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,660
Except there's like a swamp blob outside

786
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,660
Like, yes, my child

787
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,660
Yes, my child

788
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,660
Good, good, good

789
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,660
Anything else? Pancakes?

790
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,660
Create a home

791
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,660
Where is home for your doll?

792
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,660
In your drawers? Under your bed?

793
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,660
Well, imagine this

794
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,660
A nice house for your doll to sleep in at night

795
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,660
A place to have parties with friends

796
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,660
Or just eat pizza

797
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,660
I'm not gonna

798
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,660
This is such a big part

799
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,660
This paragraph is way too big for me to read

800
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,660
And have it be funny

801
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,660
But basically, if it's a water doll

802
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,660
Make it look like water

803
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,660
If it's a wolf, do woman

804
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,660
Oh, in the home? In the home, yeah

805
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,660
And then make sure the doll likes her home

806
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,660
Fill it with furniture and make sure there's a bathroom

807
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,660
You may also choose to give it a theme

808
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,660
If you had Draculaura

809
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,660
You can make the walls black slash pink

810
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,660
And make sure she doesn't have any windows

811
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,660
Design the house depending on what the doll is like

812
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,660
I'm worried about

813
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,660
What you're doing to the resale value

814
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,660
What you're doing to your equity

815
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,660
In the home

816
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,660
If you remove the windows

817
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,660
So that your vampire doll

818
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,660
Doesn't die

819
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,660
You're assuring at that point

820
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,660
The house will only be sold to other Draculauras

821
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,660
Which is, you're really limiting yourself

822
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,660
It's a much limited market

823
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,660
Are they talking about like

824
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,660
In your actual home?

825
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,660
No, there's a guy like a shoe box

826
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,660
They got like a shoe box

827
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,660
And they've taped up

828
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,660
Some pictures of scary stuff inside the box

829
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,660
Which is basically

830
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,660
Oh yeah, they love that

831
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,660
But not too scary

832
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,660
Give your Draculaura

833
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,660
Gallons of blood

834
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,660
Pour it right over her

835
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,660
She'll love it

836
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,660
I'm gonna shoot through this next section real fast

837
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,660
Brush the doll's hair, style it

838
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,660
Matches her outfits, give the doll a bath

839
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,660
Remove grime

840
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,660
With nail varnish slash polish remover

841
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,660
And get some q-tips, do be careful with that

842
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,660
Because you might also remove

843
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,660
Eye and

844
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,660
Mouth and face

845
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,660
Parts of it

846
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,660
Change the clothes, we already did that, thank you

847
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,660
Clean the doll's

848
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,660
Clothes routinely and clean the doll's hair

849
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,660
Just one more time, gonna get in there and make sure that

850
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,660
That hair is very very clean

851
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,660
Um

852
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,660
This is a baby

853
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,660
This is a

854
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,660
Baby

855
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,660
Oh, what you're doing is taking care of a baby, is that what you're saying?

856
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,660
Yes

857
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,660
This is a baby

858
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,660
And maybe there's something to that

859
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,660
Because that's part of the simulation

860
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,660
And that's what's cool, but also the baby

861
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,660
Can turn into

862
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,660
Some sort of

863
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,660
Lich or something

864
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,660
Also, I just want to say

865
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,660
We're all three parents

866
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,660
If one of the girls in Monster High could turn into a lich

867
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,660
What would her name be?

868
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,660
Um

869
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,660
Yeah, this is a good one

870
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,660
I don't know

871
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,660
The naming conventions of Monster High

872
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,660
Lichina?

873
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,660
Sounds great

874
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,660
Well, I'll come back to it

875
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,660
The author of this WikiHow article, we're all three kids

876
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,660
We're all three parents at this point, we got kids

877
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,660
And the author

878
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,660
Of this WikiHow article is assuming that

879
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,660
What children love most about toys

880
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,660
Is the amount of restriction and responsibility

881
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,660
That come with them

882
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,660
I don't think that's the case

883
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,660
My daughters both like having dolls

884
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,660
And baby dolls, and then they mostly spend a lot

885
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,660
Of time swinging those around

886
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,660
And dropping them off stuff

887
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,660
And just really kind of fucking them up

888
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,660
In a way that I don't think they're like

889
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,660
Better be careful of the sun

890
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,660
Oh, gotta make sure I bathe these things

891
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,660
So much as they're like, look at this slide

892
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,660
And then drop them from like four feet off the ground

893
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,660
This article

894
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,660
Is so much longer, the next segment

895
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,660
Is all about individual tips for each

896
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,660
Monster High doll, so maybe

897
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,660
We'll just like

898
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,660
Shoot through, if you're playing with Rochelle Goyle

899
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,660
Make sure you give her a good

900
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,660
Pet

901
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,660
I assume that means

902
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,660
Like a familiar or a creature

903
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,660
And not to like

904
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,660
Pet the doll hard or something

905
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,660
Like that

906
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,660
With Frankie Stein

907
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,660
This is an important one, and don't get these

908
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,660
Switched up, if you play with Frankie Stein

909
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,660
You can give her a boyfriend

910
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,660
If you want

911
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,660
But if you're playing with

912
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,660
Abby Bominable

913
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,660
If you're playing with Abby Bominable

914
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,660
Don't make Abby flirt with

915
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,660
Any boys she says is not

916
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,660
Honorable, that's

917
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,660
Abby Bominable

918
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,660
Says is not honorable?

919
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,660
Or don't make her flirt with any

920
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,660
Boys that she says is not honorable

921
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,660
Like that boy's not honorable

922
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,660
Like this boy

923
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,660
This trash bag

924
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,660
This trash bag over here

925
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,660
Leave that one for Frankie Stein

926
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,660
Who will eat up the trash, cause she will date

927
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,660
Whatever

928
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,660
If you're gonna give Frankie Stein a boyfriend

929
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,660
You should make it out of spare parts of other

930
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,660
Kins or something, right?

931
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,660
I think she'd really appreciate that

932
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
That feels like a thing Frankie Stein would be into

933
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,660
Make me a boyfriend

934
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,660
This is a huge one, if you are playing with Claudine Wolf

935
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,660
Make sure that when you turn off

936
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,660
The light, Claudine goes crazy

937
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,660
And you may be wondering

938
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,660
How do I do

939
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,660
How would I go about accomplishing that?

940
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,660
And the answer is

941
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,660
I guess you tape her to a Roomba

942
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,660
A light sensitive

943
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,660
Roomba?

944
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,660
And then you shout the command word

945
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,660
That makes the Roomba go just like fucking

946
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,660
Ballistic

947
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,660
Just absolutely ape shit

948
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,660
I mean if you're playing with Claudine

949
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,660
Justin, speaking of Roombas

950
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,660
I just watched Hocus Pocus 2

951
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,660
You did not tell me what a significant plot

952
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,660
Importance

953
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,660
Roombas have in that movie

954
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,660
Yeah, Roombas are a huge part of the plot

955
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,660
If you are playing

956
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,660
If I told you

957
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,660
That

958
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,660
In Hocus Pocus

959
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,660
At one point, Kathy the Jimmy

960
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,660
Can't find a broom

961
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,660
So she duct tapes two

962
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,660
Magical Roombas to her feet

963
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,660
Like a hoverboard

964
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,660
Did you think that I was making that up as a joke

965
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,660
For our show or that I'm saying

966
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,660
Apart from the movie Hocus Pocus 2

967
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,660
That's good and a good joke

968
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,660
And I bet you, can I say something?

969
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,660
I bet you Kathy fucking

970
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,660
Sold it. I bet you she made you bust up with that

971
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,660
Oh, she's having the time of her life

972
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,660
Yeah, and so are you

973
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,660
There is one prolonged shot

974
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,660
In the movie as the

975
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,660
Characters on screen are very minimal

976
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,660
In the foreground and mostly the focus of the shot

977
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,660
Is just a glowing Walgreens

978
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,660
And it is a Walgreens

979
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,660
And it lingers on it for

980
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,660
What feels like 30 solid seconds

981
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,660
And then Walgreens is

982
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,660
Referenced, there are multiple

983
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,660
Scenes in a Walgreens

984
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,660
Walgreens once again plays a

985
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,660
Pivotal role in Hocus Pocus 2

986
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,660
And every shot is framed as like

987
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,660
Kathy the Jimmy, Bette Midler

988
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,660
And a huge red W in between them

989
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,660
Always separated and framed

990
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,660
By Walgreens logo. They replaced Sarah

991
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,660
Jessica Parker with the Walgreens logo?

992
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,660
Yeah

993
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,660
Hey guys, if you're playing with Cleo Denial

994
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,660
Feed her grapes and

995
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,660
It may seem like she can't

996
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,660
But if you push the

997
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,660
Grapes into the

998
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,660
Into her face hard enough

999
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,660
You can make pretend

1000
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,660
Anything. They will go away. They will go away

1001
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,660
Eventually

1002
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,660
Um, if you're playing

1003
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,660
With Toralei sometimes she might scratch the furniture

1004
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,660
That's it. Like you know that that's what

1005
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,660
You're gonna go with. If you're playing with

1006
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,660
Ghoulia Yelps, this one's

1007
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,660
This one's great cause if you are playing with Ghoulia Yelps this will be

1008
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,660
My last tip for this

1009
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,660
Halloween segment. You gotta feed her

1010
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,660
Brains and fast food

1011
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,660
Kill

1012
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,660
Kill

1013
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,660
Living things

1014
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,660
That have a brain

1015
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,660
In it to give to your

1016
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,660
Doll and or

1017
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,660
Hit up Barbies

1018
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,660
If

1019
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,660
Arby's sold brain

1020
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,660
If Arby's sold brain meat, which

1021
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,660
Their motto would make you

1022
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,660
Think that they do. They got the meat

1023
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,660
Yeah, you'd think

1024
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,660
You should be able to go into Arby's

1025
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,660
And be like, for me, I would like

1026
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,660
A big Cheddar Boy

1027
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,660
A number 16 Cheddar

1028
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,660
Boy combo meal

1029
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,660
And for this one, Ghoulia Yelps

1030
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,660
And you put her up on the counter and you say, you know what to do

1031
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,660
With her. You take her back

1032
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,660
To the back where you keep the

1033
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,660
The bad meats

1034
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,660
The meats that you maybe don't want people

1035
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,660
To know that you do have on offer

1036
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,660
And you make sure she is sated

1037
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,660
Yeah. Thank you

1038
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,660
Of course. Thank you. She'll die without it

1039
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,660
And she's my best friend

1040
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,660
What about Cauliflower?

1041
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,660
The doll Cauliflower

1042
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,660
The brains? Fuck off

1043
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,660
Oh, I thought you were saying there's a Monster High doll called

1044
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,660
Cauliflower. That's awesome

1045
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,660
All the other dolls are like

1046
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,660
It could be Griffin, it would be Carla Flower

1047
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,660
Thank you very much

1048
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,660
But what would that be referencing, Charles?

1049
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,660
What great monster is that?

1050
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,660
That's fun if there was one of them that was just like

1051
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,660
Vegetables. Yeah

1052
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,660
It could be anything just

1053
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,660
It could be Swamp Thing. It could be Man Thing

1054
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,660
It could be Audrey 2 from Little Swamp of course

1055
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,660
It could be, there are man eating plants

1056
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,660
All over the fucking place. Read a book

1057
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,660
Charlie got these toys for her

1058
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,660
For her birthday

1059
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,660
Riley got Charlie

1060
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,660
This stuffed

1061
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,660
Guinea Pig in a cage

1062
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,660
And the thing about it is that

1063
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,660
It's pregnant

1064
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,660
With other smaller

1065
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,660
Baby Guinea Pigs. Oh, cool. Great

1066
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,660
But the birthing happens

1067
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,660
Automatically

1068
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,660
Huh? So

1069
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,660
On a certain timer

1070
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,660
You turn it on and eventually

1071
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,660
The first baby

1072
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,660
Well, what it does is it pops out of the top

1073
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,660
And just kind of lands on the mom

1074
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,660
Guinea Pig and rolls off and then she had a baby

1075
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,660
And the mom eats it. Yeah, normal

1076
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,660
No, mom does, you know, you open that and it's like a surprise

1077
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,660
Toy, right? You see what kind of Guinea Pig

1078
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,660
Just like real life

1079
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,660
And it's set to do this over a 24

1080
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,660
Hour period

1081
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,660
Where periodically, over this 24 hours

1082
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,660
This thing will just give

1083
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,660
Birth. Does it at least make a noise?

1084
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,660
Can you set it in the corner and tell

1085
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,660
You hear it go like

1086
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,660
And then you know like, oh honey

1087
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,660
Yeah, there's noises. Not again!

1088
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,660
There's 100% birthing noises, 100%

1089
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,660
But if you bought this gift

1090
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,660
For somebody who does not have that

1091
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,660
Kind of attention span, like say

1092
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,660
A child

1093
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,660
There is a switch on it

1094
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,660
That's basically like

1095
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,660
Turbo mode

1096
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,660
It's like it gets

1097
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,660
Here we go

1098
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,660
You like

1099
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,660
Flip this switch to make this

1100
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,660
Guinea Pig just go into like

1101
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,660
Turbo child birthing

1102
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,660
And it's probably the

1103
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,660
Wildest option that

1104
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,660
I have seen on a toy is like, let's just kick

1105
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,660
This birth cycle into overdrive

1106
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,660
And crank it up

1107
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,660
Let's go to Money Zone. I think it's Money Zone time

1108
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,660
Yeah, let's go to Money Zone

1109
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,660
It's better with you

1110
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,660
It's better with you

1111
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,660
It's better with you

1112
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,660
You know guys, with my international travel

1113
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,660
I have been studying up a lot

1114
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,660
Using Babbel and I

1115
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,660
Have been studying

1116
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,660
English. So I now say

1117
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,660
Yeah, I've learned how to say like bangers

1118
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,660
And lift and

1119
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,660
I say like biscuits and flat

1120
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,660
How did you pull this off

1121
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,660
I know that you don't really apply yourself

1122
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,660
To stuff. Well, I already said Justin

1123
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,660
I used Babbel

1124
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,660
I guess I was going to

1125
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,660
Drill down on like maybe what even

1126
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,660
Is that at all? Oh, okay

1127
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,660
Well, it's like an app

1128
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,660
It's a language learning app

1129
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,660
That sold like more than 10 million

1130
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,660
Subscriptions and it's not just English I should point out

1131
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,660
You can also do like Spanish or German or Italian

1132
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,660
Or French or Portuguese or Swedish or Turkish or

1133
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,660
Dutch, Polish, Indonesian

1134
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,660
Norwegian, Danish

1135
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,660
Russian, and yes, English

1136
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,660
We need to get the Animaniacs at this point

1137
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,660
There's too many. They gotta come up with like a fucking

1138
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,660
I mean I just said, okay, with Babbel

1139
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,660
You only need 10 minutes to complete one of their

1140
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,660
Bite-sized lessons so that

1141
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,660
You can start having real life conversations

1142
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,660
In a new language in as little as 3 weeks

1143
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,660
Now this is a problem because I did just start

1144
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,660
Learning English

1145
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,660
Two days ago

1146
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,660
Right. So, but by the time

1147
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,660
I get back, now other

1148
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,660
Language apps use AI

1149
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,660
The movie for their

1150
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,660
Lesson plans, but Babbel lessons

1151
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,660
Were created by over 150 language

1152
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,660
Experts. Those are human beings

1153
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,660
Not some phony-blowny computer

1154
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,660
Brains. Yeah

1155
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,660
Fucking Jude Law over here

1156
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,660
Just like repeat after Jude

1157
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,660
Law. Yeah

1158
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,660
You know how Jude Law went around

1159
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,660
Telling lonely ladies about language

1160
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,660
And stuff? Yeah, man

1161
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,660
And it's voiced by real native speakers

1162
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,660
Not computers. Who needs them?

1163
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,660
With Babbel you can choose from 14

1164
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,660

Her Majesty

1175

Served Great Britain

1176
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,660
And the Commonwealth

1177
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,660
Loyally for over

1178
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,660
70 years

1179
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,660
And while, of course, we feel

1180
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,660
A profound sadness

1181
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,660
We must remember

1182
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,660
She lived a long life

1183
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,660
And died in such a way that I think

1184
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,660
Many of us would want for ourselves

1185
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,660
She was at home

1186
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,660
Surrounded by her

1187
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,660
Family

1188
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,660
And, of course, she was listening

1189
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,660
To the Beef and Dairy Network

1190
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,660
Podcast

1191
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,660

1195
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,660
You're in a theatre, the lights go down

1196
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,660
You're about to get swept up by

1197
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,660
The characters and all their little details

1198
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,660
And interpersonal dramas

1199
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,660
You look at them and think, that person is so obviously

1200
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,660
In love with their best friend

1201
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,660
Wait, am I in love with my best friend?

1202
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,660
That character's mom is so overbearing

1203
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,660
Why doesn't she just stand up to her? Oh God, do I need

1204
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,660
To stand up to my own mother?

1205
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,660
If you've ever recognized yourself in a movie, then join me

Feeling Seen

1208
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,660
We've talked to author Susan Orlean on realizing

1209
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,660
Her own marriage was falling apart after watching

1210
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,660
Adaptation, an adaptation of

1211
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,660
Her own work, and comedian

1212
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,660
Hari Kondabolu on why Harold and Kumar

1213
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,660
Was a depressingly important movie

1214
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,660
For Southeast Asians

1215
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,660
So join me every Thursday for the Feeling

1216
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,660
Seen podcast here on Maximum

1217
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,660
Fun

1218
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,660
Dun dun dun dun

1219
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,660
I really thought we were going to do a second question

1220
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,660
That's okay, we'll get there maybe one day

1221
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,660
No, I'm doing

1222
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,660
The second question now

1223
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,660
Oh, that's how it is?

1224
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,660
Just a little flourish for it? Nope

1225
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,660
Now we're doing the second question

1226
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,660
Maybe I'll change my mind

1227
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,660
Now I have to think about it

1228
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,660
My six year old son recently discovered Pokemon

1229
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,660
Hell he is

1230
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,660
And is obsessed

1231
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,660
My husband and I know nothing about the cards, the game

1232
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,660
Or the universe

1233
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,660
The headspace, the experience

1234
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,660
The lifestyle

1235
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,660
The lifestyle

1236
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,660
The agenda

1237
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,660
If I may be so bold

1238
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,660
Recently my son got a

1239
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,660
Mewtwo

1240
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,660
Griffin

1241
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,660
Mewtwo

1242
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,660
V-star

1243
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,660
Rainbow

1244
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,660
In a pack

1245
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,660
Oh, fuck

1246
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,660
Oh, man

1247
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,660
Our Googling says it's a pretty valuable card

1248
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,660
Yeah, that's putting it lightly

1249
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,660
It's

1250
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,660
Powered chart, sir

1251
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,660
The thing is, he's six and he's mostly

1252
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,660
Into the game for the trades

1253
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,660
If we let him keep this card, he will trade it

1254
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,660
For Lord knows what

1255
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,660
What's the protocol here? Let him make his deals

1256
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,660
Protect him from older

1257
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,660
Kids taking advantage

1258
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,660
Sell the card now and buy him a bunch of other packs

1259
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,660
Of cards with the proceeds

1260
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,660
That's from Poké Perplexed in Pittsburgh

1261
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,660
You've come to the right place

1262
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,660
Indeed

1263
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,660
The economy

1264
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,660
Is fueled

1265
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,660
By

1266
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,660
Suckers

1267
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,660
And it's that there's a circle of life

1268
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,660
Around this whole thing

1269
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,660
You are correct

1270
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,660
In that if you do not intervene

1271
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,660
One day, your son's gonna leave

1272
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,660
The house with a Mewtwo

1273
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,660
V-star Rainbow worth

1274
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,660
Now Hawkeye's gonna swoop down, take it

1275
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,660
Put it in its nest

1276
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,660
Put it in its nest

1277
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,660
According to the

1278
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,660
I mean, the recent

1279
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,660
Sort of like

1280
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,660
Pokemon trades that I've

1281
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,660
Been reading, it values that one

1282
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,660
At about $5500

1283
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,660
If he leaves the house with it

1284
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,660
He's gonna come back with a fucking scratched up

1285
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,660
Moldy ass Dewgong

1286
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,660
With a fucking bent ass

1287
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,660
Corners and people have written

1288
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,660
Like custom attacks with marker

1289
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,660
On it, like one water

1290
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,660
Energy, 150 damage

1291
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,660
And this always hits, like

1292
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,660
Fucking like

1293
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,660
Your nev- your dumbass

1294
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,660
Friend's nephew Kyle

1295
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,660
Is just gonna like walk away

1296
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,660
Whistling $5500 richer

1297
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,660
I congratulate you

1298
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,660
On having the clarity of mind

1299
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,660
As a parent to look at your 6 year old

1300
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,660
Child and say like, hey this kid's

1301
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,660
A rube, I mean look at this kid

1302
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,660
He's 100%, he's got mark written

1303
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,660
All over him, I did my best

1304
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,660
But I raised an absolute maroon

1305
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,660
This guy's absolute

1306
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,660
And listen, I love that he's so wide eyed

1307
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,660
And open to the world, but this kid's gonna get

1308
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,660
Taken to the fucking cleaners

1309
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,660
And Kyle's gonna

1310
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,660
Have a little

1311
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,660
Little nice day for himself, you know what I mean?

1312
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,660
Like it's a service that your

1313
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,660
Son is providing to Kyle

1314
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,660
I was the

1315
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,660
I both gave away

1316
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,660
Some real beauties

1317
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,660
And also benefited

1318
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,660
From some real

1319
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,660
Some real dummies, and that's

1320
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,660
But that's the way of things, isn't it?

1321
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,660
Griff's been the Kyle, and he's been

1322
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,660
Your child. I've been the Kyle, I've been

1323
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,660
Your child, I've been all over this

1324
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,660
Great world of ours. But he's never been

1325
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,660
To me. That's the

1326
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,660
I've never been, I've never visited

1327
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,660
It, Justin. Even once.

1328
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,660
No, Griffin, he's never been

1329
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,660
To Maine.

1330
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,660
You've never been to Maine.

1331
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,660
I have never been to Maine. No, we

1332
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,660
Went to Maine, didn't we? Doesn't it feel like

1333
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,660
We should've gone to Maine by now? Foxwood, is it Foxwood?

1334
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,660
No, Foxwood's not Maine. Foxwood's somewhere else.

1335
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,660
No, no, no, it's Massachusetts, I think.

1336
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,660
So...

1337
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,660
The answer's simple, you let him make the trade

1338
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,660
To shitty Kyle, and then

1339
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,660
You bump into Kyle as he walks away

1340
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,660
And he's like, ha, another great deal

1341
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,660
Just to check his pockets. What? The card's gone.

1342
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,660
That's right. You got it.

1343
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,660
Because you've been taking pickpocket classes at the Y.

1344
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,660
Yeah, and child

1345
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,660
Child pockets are the toughest ones

1346
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,660
To pick. So little. So tiny.

1347
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,660
So little. So you did have to, you had to study for a couple

1348
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,660
Years to get good at it. Luckily

1349
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,660
You saw this coming a mile away because of

1350
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,660
Your son's

1351
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,660
Easygoing demeanor. And you looked

1352
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,660
At him when he was three, and you were like, someday

1353
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,660
This kid's gonna get taken to the cleaners, so I better start

1354
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,660
Pickpocketing now? Long con.

1355
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,660
I think. Oh, wow.

1356
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,660
Hold on, wait, let's hear Justin out.

1357
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,660
No, I just meant, it's the long grif.

1358
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,660
Like, you've been planning for a long time

1359
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,660
To rob this kid. Yeah.

1360
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,660
Whenever Kyle, whoever Kyle ended up being

1361
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,660
Yeah. The deck was stacked against you

1362
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,660
From the beginning. Yeah.

1363
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,660
Kyle thought he was in charge? No, no, no.

1364
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,660
No, no, no. You're the director of this little play.

1365
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,660
Now, I was... Kyle is

1366
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,660
Really your puppet. Yes.

1367
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,660
And this is all to teach

1368
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,660
You are just so,

1369
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,660
So naive son of last night.

1370
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,660
I think, you know,

1371
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,660
My kid's almost six, and if I said

1372
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,660
If you give me this, I can

1373
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,660
Then turn it into a lot more

1374
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,660
Of the things you like.

1375
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,660
That feels like a slam dunk explanation.

1376
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,660
Okay. Right? That if I say

1377
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,660
This one card,

1378
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,660
I could use this to buy you many, many

1379
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,660
Packs of cards.

1380
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,660
Wow. Right? Like, that feels like something that kid

1381
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,660
Would be way into. Right?

1382
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,660
Yeah, you can also just take a picture

1383
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,660
Of the card, and let him carry the picture around.

1384
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,660
There you go.

1385
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,660
Cut it out.

1386
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,660
You can have a bunch of those, you know what I mean?

1387
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,660
You can just trade those to Kyle.

1388
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,660
Sell the card, buy a laminator,

1389
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,660
Print it out, make a new card.

1390
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,660
You know, there's nothing illegal about making

1391
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,660
Your own fake Pokemon cards and selling them.

1392
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,660
Yeah. It's not illegal.

1393
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,660
There's no one, it's not legal fucking Tinder.

1394
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,660
It's not money, yeah.

1395
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,660
What are they gonna get you on?

1396
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,660
Counterfeiting? Come on.

1397
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,660
Take their granola bars,

1398
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,660
Sell the fake cards.

1399
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,660
This is America, baby.

1400
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,660
Cause that's good, cause sometimes you have an idea

1401
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,660
Like, what if there was an even smaller Pikachu

1402
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,660
Named Squeakachoo, and then you can

1403
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,660
Make him. You can make him

1404
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,660
Be real with a printer

1405
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,660
And a laminator.

1406
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,660
And he's got

1407
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,660
An attack that costs no energy.

1408
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,660
It does 300 damage.

1409
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,660
And ruin someone's credit score.

1410
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,660
And if it's a

1411
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,660
A card game, then it's not fan fiction.

1412
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,660
It's a mod.

1413
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,660
There you go. Oh, this is DLC.

1414
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,660
This isn't Velma and Shaggy

1415
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,660
Kissing. This is an expansion

1416
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,660
On the

1417
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,660
Velma and Shaggy universe.

1418
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,660
A modification. An upgrade.

1419
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,660
If you will.

1420
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,660
Also, I gave Shaggy

1421
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,660
Big pecs. Cause I love that.

1422
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,660
I like his shaggy pecs.

1423
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,660
Could we do a

1424
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,660
Shirt. Do you think we could sell a shirt

1425
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,660
With a strong Shaggy on it?

1426
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,660
It's like, strong Shaggy?

1427
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,660
No, cause it's like

1428
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,660
I think it's a meme. I think actually

1429
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,660
Strong Shaggy is a meme.

1430
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,660
Like, for whatever reason

1431
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,660
Kids like

1432
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,660
Shaggy if he was really strong.

1433
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,660
I don't know why, but this guy keeps

1434
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,660
Popping up in my YouTube videos. And every time

1435
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,660
I see him being very strong and

1436
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,660
Beating up Huggy Wuggy or any of the other

1437
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,660
Sort of fucking video game

1438
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,660
Degenerates.

1439
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,660
And the kids go crazy. And it's like

1440
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,660
That dude is high

1441
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,660
On drugs. He is

1442
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,660
Casey Kasem. He has no friends.

1443
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,660
He eats dog food. Steals people's

1444
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,660
Sandwiches. Steals people's sandwiches. Please

1445
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,660
Do not aspire to be this man.

1446
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,660
He has wasted his potential.

1447
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,660
What if we made a t-shirt that was just

1448
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,660
A series of pictures of like

1449
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,660
Shaggy on a sofa. Shaggy on a

1450
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,660
Counter. Shaggy in the

1451
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,660
Shower. Shaggy being caught on

1452
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,660
Camera. What do you think?

1453
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,660
In the shower? Yeah.

1454
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,660
But we saw him in the

1455
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,660
Shower. It wasn't me.

1456
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,660
Oh, okay.

1457
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,660
Because he's Shaggy, right? But he's on the sofa.

1458
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,660
No, I get the joke now.

1459
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,660
I guess in my mind when I heard

1460
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,660
You say let's do a t-shirt

1461
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,660
With a nude cartoon

1462
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,660
Character license. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1463
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,660
And I should note this isn't like a joke. This is a separate

1464
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,660
Business I want to start where we are selling these

1465
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,660
Like a hot topic or something. I think that these

1466
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,660
Would actually do really well in that market.

1467
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,660
Not as like a McElroy Brothers joke

1468
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,660
Thing, but to like branch out into

1469
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,660
Actual like more like memetic

1470
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,660
T-shirts. You couldn't sell it at

1471
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,660
A hot topic. You could sell it at

1472
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,660
A kiosk outside

1473
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,660
Of the hot topic because as far as I can

1474
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,660
Tell from mall kiosks

1475
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,660
Anything fucking goes.

1476
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,660
Anything goes. You can have Shaggy's

1477
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,660
Dong fully on display in the shower.

1478
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,660
You fully, fully can.

1479
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,660
It's like international waters if you're in the

1480
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,660
Mall hallways. Yeah, we've got

1481
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,660
Shaggy nude on t-shirts

1482
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,660
And Pelotons. Come on in.

1483
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,660
This just says Pelican-ton.

1484
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,660
Yeah, it's my version of it

1485
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,660
Where you're riding the bike and there's a

1486
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,660
Video behind you of a Pelican

1487
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,660
Chasing you. It's an

1488
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,660
Expansion to the Peloton.

1489
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,660
It's not a rip-off. It's an expansion.

1490
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,660
I trademarked it myself. I wrote

1491
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,660
The idea on a piece of paper and I mailed it to myself

1492
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,660
And I haven't opened it. So see you in court.

1493
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,660
This is legally binding.

1494
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,660
My neighbor recently removed the hedge on their side of the fence

1495
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,660
Between our properties. This fence

1496
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,660
Is around two feet from my house and it's not very

1497
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,660
Tall. This means that the neighbors now have

1498
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:55,660
An unobstructed view through my window into

1499
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,660
My bed. Even though I keep the blinds

1500
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,660
Low, I still prefer to keep a fan in the window.

1501
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,660
Which requires them to be

1502
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,660
Open far enough that I'm certain my neighbors

1503
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,660
Will have a line of sight from their windows straight to my

1504
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,660
Junk. Am I

1505
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,660
Still good to sleep in the nude?

1506
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,660
Should I let their

1507
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,660
Decisions to remove the privacy hedge decide

1508
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,660
How I dress at night? Or do I give

1509
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,660
This provenly nosy

1510
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,660
Neighbor an eyeful in hopes she

1511
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,660
Plants a new privacy bush?

1512
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,660
That's from bedtime

1513
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,660
Bush in Bremerton.

1514
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,660
You

1515
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,660
Chose to use the word bush.

1516
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,660
You chose it. You chose

1517
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:33,660
It. You could have said something else.

1518
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,660
But you didn't.

1519
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,660
This feels tricky

1520
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,660
To me. Oh, it does?

1521
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,660
Feels fraught. Travis,

1522
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,660
Don't just- Travis, tell me what they should

1523
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,660
Do and don't just say, plant another

1524
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,660
Taller bush next to their bush.

1525
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,660
No, it just- it strikes me as like

1526
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,660
Um, I

1527
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,660
If you are not bothered

1528
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,660
By it, right? If you're not like,

1529
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,660
Oh no, what do I do now? If it's

1530
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,660
Just like, well, you made some decisions

1531
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,660
And this is where your choices

1532
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,660
Have brought you, I will

1533
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,660
Continue on my momentum

1534
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,660
Like, unless

1535
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,660
Acted upon by an outside force.

1536
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,660
You know what I mean?

1537
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,660
There are two different kinds of naked.

1538
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,660
You don't have clothes on

1539
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,660
And you're worried there's

1540
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,660
Any chance on

1541
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,660
Earth someone might see you.

1542
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,660
Or, there's the

1543
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,660
Times when you're naked and you're just like

1544
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,660
You. That's who you are.

1545
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,660
You're in your body.

1546
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,660
You're feeling you're sexy.

1547
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you're saying

1548
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,660
Thank you, monster god, for my rock and bod.

1549
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,660
Thank you, monster god, for my rock and bod.

1550
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,660
And, this

1551
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,660
Person is never going to be able

1552
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,660
To get into that second head

1553
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,660
Space. Right. Because

1554
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,660
There's always the possibility

1555
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,660
That you could be being perused.

1556
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,660
It's not about the neighbor, it's about

1557
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,660
You. You need to be able to be

1558
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,660
Not just nude, but indescribably

1559
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,660
Perfectly nude.

1560
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,660
Deeply. A nude soul

1561
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,660
As well, if you will. Yes.

1562
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,660
Emotionally nude.

1563
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,660
Okay.

1564
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,660
So what do you do then, Justin?

1565
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,660
You plan a second taller

1566
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,660
Book. Okay, now hold on. I was explicitly told

1567
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,660
I just didn't want you

1568
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,660
To take mine. Oh, okay.

1569
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,660
I didn't

1570
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,660
Know we could do that. We've been doing this show for over

1571
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,660
A decade. I know. I didn't know we could say like

1572
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,660
And I called dibs on this answer.

1573
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,660
I just came up with it. I was like, I don't

1574
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,660
Want to interrupt him. I'll just put a bookmark

1575
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,660
In so he doesn't take mine.

1576
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,660
So good, dude.

1577
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,660
If I was going to invent that rule

1578
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,660
I wish I had done it for

1579
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,660
I was about to say better joke, but like odd joke.

1580
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,660
You know what I mean?

1581
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,660
The idea you get.

1582
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,660
Are any of us truly nude in the dark?

1583
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,660
Huh.

1584
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,660
If you're in the dark, in the darkness, and no one can

1585
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,660
See your privacy

1586
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,660
Are you

1587
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,660
Even nude?

1588
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,660
Huh.

1589
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,660
Do you think when the darkness

1590
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,660
Is in the green room, anyone ever leaned

1591
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,660
In and just like shut off the lights

1592
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,660
Real quick and slammed the door and the

1593
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,660
Band's like, oh, here we go again.

1594
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,660
Yeah, sure.

1595
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,660
So there's always a joker. Is it there?

1596
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,660
Yeah, for sure.

1597
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,660
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

1598
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,660
I'm sorry

1599
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,660
That my brothers denied you that

1600
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,660
Wonderful Munch

1601
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,660
Squad. I was definitely really, really

1602
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,660
Going to do. Save it.

1603
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,660
Do two next time.

1604
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,660
But, you know, I hope you had fun regardless.

1605
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,660
That's all we, that's all we ever

1606
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,660
Hope for you. Enjoy yourself.

1607
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,660
Is that all?

1608
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,660
Wait, is that all we ever hope for?

1609
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,660
That's all we ever hope for.

1610
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,660
Oh, man. Okay. I'm learning so much on this episode.

1611
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,660
Maybe would it kill you to buy a shirt from time to time.

1612
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,660
You know what I mean?

1613
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,660
There we go. There it is.

1614
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,660
Maybe a deluxe blanket.

1615
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,660
Speaking of that, Justin, it's so funny you should make that.

1616
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,660
What?

1617
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,660
We have a Garrow blanket on sale in the merch store

1618
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,660
For the very, very esque

1619
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,660
Garrow blanket over at MacroMerch.com

1620
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,660
We've also got our Candle Nights wrapping paper back

1621
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,660
Designed by Justin Gray

1622
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,660
And 10% of all merch proceeds this month

1623
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,660
Go to Fair Elections Center

1624
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,660
And listen, it's not just that. It's all the other merch there.

1625
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,660
And it's time to start thinking about that

1626
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,660
Holiday season.

1627
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,660
It's creeping in. I feel it.

1628
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,660
I feel that creep.

1629
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:19,660
My children have now each gotten a Garrow.

1630
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,660
The Garrow stuffy. Same.

1631
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,660
They are really enjoying talking

1632
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,660
To each other

1633
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,660
And then constantly forgetting

1634
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,660
That he's a Binocorn, which is fun.

1635
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,660
They keep calling him a Rhinocorn

1636
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,660
Which I enjoy immensely.

1637
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,660
Let's explore that.

1638
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,660
I mean, a Rhino is already kind of a Rhinocorn.

1639
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,660
Exactly.

1640
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,660
But imagine if you said, this is a unicorn

1641
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,660
Except it looks like a Rhino.

1642
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,660
Yeah, sure.

1643
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,660
This is going to be a thanks from Montaigne.

1644
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:49,660
Thanks, Montaigne, for the use of our theme song

1645
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,660
My life is better with you.

1646
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,660
It makes you stronger to cure it.

1647
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,660
That's true.

1648
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,660
And if you have fear

1649
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,660
Any fear, any weakness

1650
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,660
The song makes it go away.

1651
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,660
Oh.

1652
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,660
Yeah, in the scariest times

1653
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,660
The song makes you strong enough to face it.

1654
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,660
Wow. That's cool.

1655
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,660
How do they do that?

1656
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,660
Is it like a binaural?

1657
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,660
Or like a subconscious thing?

1658
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,660
Yes, both of them.

1659
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,660
That's amazing.

1660
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,660

Everybody stick to your guns.

1697
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,660
I'll do it. I feel like I didn't contribute much this week.

1698
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:37,660
Stick to your guns.

1699
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,660
No, that's not what we went with. We had something different.

1700
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,660
What was our new thing?

1701
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,660
I think it was whoever didn't contribute the most tested.

1702
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:45,660
We just rolled that out fairly wisely.

1703
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,660
Then we had a new thing.

1704
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:49,660
I don't know.

1705
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,660
I don't know but it's also from a future episode for the Halloween special.

1706
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,660
I don't think people have heard yet.

1707
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,660
Okay, well then I'll just say that

1708
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,660
Let me do it anyway.

1709
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,660
Okay.

1710
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,660
Because I have to go in 30 seconds.

1711
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,660
Don't ever compromise.

1712
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,660
