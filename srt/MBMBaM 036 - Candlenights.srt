1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down. If you're all alone, when a pretty bird shows up.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If I need you back, I'm gonna be best, and it ain't no problem.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:18,000
If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down. If you got no place to go, when a pretty bird shows up.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I think if you have to say at the beginning, like, sorry that we're not gonna use a bunch of dirty words, that's enough of a heads up, I think.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Now we fucking will.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So we're going with a post-holiday theme for this episode and not an end of 2010 theme? Or can we do both?

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I mean, I guess, yeah. It always seems like such a weird gray area. It feels like the two should be back to back.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What's gonna happen in this week? Nothing. Fun. Except, one thing that I can think of, my brother and my brother and me, it's an advice show for the modern era.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We're gonna close 2010 out big.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Killing Zolo.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Killing Zolo. We miss him. Let's do the rest of him upright.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hey brother, it's Mack Roy. I was wondering if you could give me some advice on a mature way to deal with my ex. He broke up with me, but since we broke up, he's been a huge douche. Doing things like saying he'll drop off some of my stuff, but leaving rotting food instead.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's a pretty good one, though.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He got you. Pretty good. Is there a way I can let him know it isn't acceptable, but get back at him at the same time without being immature? Or would it be better just to ignore it all? Thanks, MBMBAM.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's from Iona Grace from Gmail.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I think, I think Iona, you just have to take the moral victory.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You gotta take the high ground and not rise to the bait, because that's gonna irritate him more than anything. Trust me.

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If you just pretend like he is nothing to you, and whatever he's doing is not getting to you, and it really can't, you just gotta shut it out. You're done with him.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I think the shittiest part about the whole situation is he broke up with you, and he's being a douche. Like, that's just not cool. So, this is going to be a story you get to tell in 10 years, and I think you need to look at it that way.

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Because you didn't do anything wrong, so there's nothing to feel bad about, there's nothing to... So just you get to be the better person. Congratulations.

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah.

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Unless...

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Unless...

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Why don't you escalate this shit?

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Why don't you escalate it to a level he is no longer comfortable responding to?

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So, you ask... He says he'll drop off some stuff, but instead leaves rotting fruit. What if you say you're gonna drop off some rotting fruit, but instead you burn his house down?

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You burn his house... I was about to say burn his house down, yeah.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Leave some slices of bologna on his car, and then it'll take the paint off.

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh, this is good. It's like a callback episode.

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Maybe kill an elderly relative. I mean, so it's not like a big deal, because they're old anyways.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah, like an extended one.

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, so no one's going to make a big deal out of it to begin with, because they were old.

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You're saying if you... What's the bar that you can clear there where killing an old person isn't a crime? Is it like 85?

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
85 is not a crime.

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No, with modern science these days, I would put it at least 96. People are living to like 120, 122 now.

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No way.

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You're practically doing my favor at that point.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's what I'm saying.

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
My rule is 95, you shouldn't be alive. So after that, you're just setting the world back to balance.

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah.

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm sorry if anybody's bubby is that old, by the way.

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Another good one is get his email address, and I know you got it. Get his email address and sign him up for every...

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Every spam.

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Haggard mailing list you can find, because that's brutal. Somebody did that to me. Thanks, whoever that was.

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And he's been annoying forever.

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You can do that in conjunction with burning his house down too, which is the best part about it. It's a cheap and easy way.

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You really shouldn't do any of these things. Just write it out. You won.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You got two options though. We'll give you some flexibility, something to play with.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Ride or die.

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Ride or die.

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'll give you this one. Letting him know it isn't acceptable, but at the same time get back at him. Tell his mom what he did.

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let his mom know he left some rotting food on your front porch.

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's kind of fun. I like it.

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, and it's kind of like third grade-y.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah, it is.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's my favorite part about it.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Hey, Moobinbam. I want to know the best way to deal with the awkwardness of apologizing for something you aren't really sorry about.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Ooh, Ryan from Gmail.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Is that awkward?

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Is that awkward?

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I do that at least 20 times a day, and it doesn't bother me too much.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Practice may be the answer.

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I always started off with, I'm sorry you got upset.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
No, that's the worst.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No, no, no.

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That just makes me angrier than the thing they did originally.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Well, that's the thing. If you're not sorry for it, then it doesn't bother me because I'm not sorry for it.

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Maybe you need to take a long look in that deep, dark, truthful mirror and figure out why you're not sorry about the thing you did, Ryan.

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh, yeah.

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You obviously hurt them.

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You obviously cut them so deep.

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah, Ryan, I don't know, and maybe this has to do with just who we are and maybe it's the area of the country we were raised in or whatever, but I say sorry all the time about shit I don't feel sorry about.

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:32,000
By and large, I've learned to be in a perpetual state of asking people for forgiveness for my actions, and that's just a price to do with this modern day America, my friend.

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's like a super intense form of humility, right?

81
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If you're not constantly shooting rainbows out of your ass, you should be apologetic for just not being awesome all the time.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I've gotten to a point where it's just a knee-jerk reaction where someone's like, oh, man, I got stuck in traffic, and I'm like, I'm sorry.

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I had nothing to do with that traffic, but I feel bad that they got stuck in traffic.

84
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I apologize for shit that I could never have any control over ever.

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm sorry that this episode isn't very good so far.

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Or what else? Anything else you feel bad about?

87
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm sorry that I'm sure not all of our listeners had a great Christmas. I'm sorry for that.

88
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm sorry for assuming that all of our listeners are Christians, good Christian soldiers. I'm sorry about that.

89
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It saddens us to think of living in heaven for eternity without you guys, without all of you.

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah, I'm sorry that you won't be kicking it in heaven with me, JC, and Stevie Ray Vaughn. Is he dead?

91
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Man, how good is that jam band gonna be?

92
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah, everybody just-

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll be on the recorder.

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Who's that? You're playing recorder.

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
SRV is on the Geetbox, obviously, and Jesus on the ones and twos.

96
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Can I be- I want Stevie Ray Vaughn to have a double neck guitar and I'll be on the bottom neck.

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And he'll be like, Justin, I can't do it alone. Please.

98
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Would it be kind of romantic? There would be some contact.

99
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If we tear into Texas Flood, I'm gonna be swaying.

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Would it be cool if also his ten gallon hat was big enough for both your heads to fit inside it?

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I think if it's heaven and we don't have rules, then I think that my head could fit.

102
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What if it is only big enough for one person and you try and get your head in there and it doesn't fit

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and you start getting kind of bummed out, which isn't allowed in heaven.

104
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So Jesus points his finger at the hat and it doubles in size.

105
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Or he points his finger at me and sends me to hell.

106
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Hey guys, I stepped out of the room to grab a cup of tea. What are you guys talking about?

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We're talking about Jesus's hat-expanding powers in heaven with Stevie Ray Vaughn and a jam band.

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Again?

109
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah, we went way off track really fast.

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm sorry about all that. I'm sorry that we went so far.

111
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
2011, a year of apologizing.

112
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And I'm sorry to Stevie Ray Vaughn.

113
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, I'm sorry to his ghost. His little ghost.

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Play Texas Flood for me once, Stevie. That's my one song of yours that I know.

115
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay, four days ago I went on a blind date. He was very polite and seemed normal. Since then, I received no fewer than 35 texts, IMs, calls.

116
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What's a nice way to say you're creepy and desperate and I'm relieved you don't know where I live?

117
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I mean, oh, Brooke Keele from Spring.

118
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm sorry that I'm probably that guy.

119
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm sorry that that is Griffin.

120
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm sorry that that is me.

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I think the best thing to do is, honestly, it sucks for you, but you gotta be direct.

122
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Because this is one of those situations where we talked about before, guys don't take hints very well.

123
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And if you're like, oh no, you gotta be like, straight up, it was a good blind date, it's not going anywhere, I would like you to leave me alone, please.

124
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I mean, it's what you gotta do.

125
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Right? The date seemed to go well, he seemed polite and normal, which is really, in this day and age, the only two qualities you can ask for in a person.

126
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, maybe you're a little too demanding, Brooke.

127
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I mean, I don't know.

128
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Well, no, because she got 35 messages she didn't want.

129
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
In four days.

130
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You know he's interested.

131
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You know that book, He's Just Not That Into You?

132
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He's far, far too into you.

133
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He's a little bit too into me. Into you.

134
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, that's a weird, like, 35.

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
How do you not know that's too much?

136
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Honestly, I bet it's like a snake eating its own tail kind of thing where he did one and she didn't respond and he went, oh, now I need to cover up for that one that I did.

137
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh shit, now I've done too many.

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And all of a sudden he's doing like 40 a day.

139
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, that's a lonely, lonely tango you do not want to be a part of.

140
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You just gotta cut your losses at some point.

141
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah, but man, we've all been there, right? You haven't had a GF for a while and then you get one and it's like, ugh.

142
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's like water.

143
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Water to a thirsty, thirsty man.

144
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You just don't know when to say enough's enough and your belly expands because you keep gulping it down.

145
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
All the feminine attention.

146
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And in this, the year of our Lord 2010, electronic communication is so easy.

147
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I've sent eight text messages since we started recording the show.

148
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Which again, I'm sorry, that's probably why we haven't been so focused like our usual laser like intensity on helping people.

149
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So that's what it's about.

150
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You can get carried away.

151
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You can send like you can think you've only sent four text messages over the course of a week.

152
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But oops, it was actually 35.

153
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's like eating corn chips, you know, Brooklyn, you don't want to do is ignore him because it's just going to make him want to try to get a hold of you more because clearly this guy doesn't know when to stop doing that.

154
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So you need to just let him know that it's not going to happen and it would be best if he just stopped contacting you.

155
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Sure.

156
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah.

157
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah.

158
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You do have to put your proverbial foot down and it sounds like if he's polite and seem normal, this is going to go one of two ways.

159
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Either he's going to back down and problem solved or he is going to try to put you into a bag.

160
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, he's definitely a psycho killer.

161
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Like you've got to watch your back on this guy.

162
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You've got to get armed and then then get strict and say no more of this.

163
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No more calls.

164
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And if you come to my house, I'll shoot you with a rifle that I bought.

165
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Twenty eleven is going to be the best year probably since nineteen eighty seven.

166
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So I want you to be alive.

167
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I want you to I want you to cross that finish line and single through solo alive and single.

168
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I think that's pretty.

169
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And not carved up like a roast beast.

170
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
My best friend wants to get a good job but doesn't want to go through the hassle of college.

171
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
How do I convince him that it isn't the 90s, 1980s anymore?

172
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
He really needs to get a sheet of paper before anyone will take him seriously lost in Baltimore.

173
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Holy shit.

174
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You are in Goodwill Hunting.

175
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You are living in Goodwill Hunting.

176
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's like Baltimore Goodwill Hunting.

177
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's like the wire beats Goodwill Hunting.

178
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I haven't seen I haven't seen Goodwill Hunting.

179
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What's it about?

180
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's about two friends taking Hollywood by storm.

181
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:27,000
OK, enlisting the help of a wizard named Patch Adams, a wizard of comedy named Patch Adams and going on to Oscar Gold.

182
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It sounds like a fucking tight movie.

183
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It is fucking badass.

184
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Is that on Netflix?

185
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And what they do, they hunt Patch Adams throughout the course of the movie.

186
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's pretty badass actually.

187
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
This movie sounds incredible.

188
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Every time they catch him, he gives them some Hollywood wisdom like, oh, like that.

189
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Please tell me that was your Robin Williams.

190
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Carve me off another slice of that, please.

191
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
My Robin Williams is basically my dead knight.

192
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Just FYI.

193
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh, daddy.

194
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
A little fancy, daddy.

195
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's my dead knight.

196
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Here's my Robin Williams.

197
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Oh, oh.

198
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Mr. Hammer.

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's not bad.

200
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's kind of like Artie meets dead knight.

201
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Now, can you do Robin Williams doing one of Robin Williams' trademark voices?

202
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Can you give me one of those?

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah.

204
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh, did I?

205
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Daddy.

206
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What's up, daddy?

207
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Who's Danny?

208
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Right back into dead knight from Daddy Shaq.

209
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
OK.

210
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It kind of vacillates.

211
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Man.

212
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Sorry.

213
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So this is what Good Will Hunting is about.

214
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
OK.

215
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
OK, it's two friends from Boston.

216
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But in our case, it's two friends in Baltimore.

217
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And through this story, I will give our writers some advice.

218
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Two friends in Baltimore.

219
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
OK.

220
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And they are learning about each other as adults and not just the young men they've

221
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
always been.

222
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
One full of potential, like our writer's friend.

223
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And one who's a little slow on the uptake but still a sweetheart, like the person who

224
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
wrote us this email.

225
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Is that who Robin Williams plays?

226
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
No, he plays the wizard.

227
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And a few months later, they start working on a script for a movie about their own lives.

228
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And they meet a wizard who teaches them the ways of Hollywood.

229
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's Robin Williams.

230
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
OK.

231
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And then they go into Oscar Gold.

232
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Like that's the whole flick.

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I feel like there was a bleeding just now.

234
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I feel like maybe we glazed over some advice in there.

235
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah.

236
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No, that was all the advice I had.

237
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So find a wizard.

238
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Find a wizard who is Robin Williams.

239
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
He's like a metaphorical wizard but also a liberal wizard.

240
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You know what I mean?

241
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Like he knows the secrets.

242
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Now for our writer, the person who wrote us this email, who I don't think is slow on the

243
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
uptake.

244
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I think he has just as much potential.

245
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Numbers.

246
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You've got to get statistical on him.

247
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You've got to say, listen, if you go to college, study show, you will earn a million dollars

248
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
more over your lifetime.

249
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Or maybe he doesn't need to go to college for the job path he wants.

250
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What does he want to do?

251
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Does he want to swallow swords?

252
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
There's good money in that.

253
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Well, I mean, do you think people just know how to swallow swords?

254
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
No.

255
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
They have to go to some form of higher educational institution and get that training, get that

256
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
on the job training.

257
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Is that more of an apprenticeship though?

258
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Because if you have really good grades in high school, what's great about sword swallowing

259
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
is if you have good grades and you get like, I think it's like a 30 on an ACT and around

260
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:46,000
like a 1300 on the SAT, most colleges will afford you a full swallow ship.

261
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah.

262
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Wow.

263
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's a long way around.

264
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The bad news is that if your friend is worried about the quote unquote hassle of college,

265
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
chances are he's not going to farewell in the collegiate atmosphere.

266
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
College is like the most fun.

267
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's the best four years of your life.

268
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It really is.

269
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Or five years if you're me, but maybe some years it'll be the best of them.

270
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I wish I could go back.

271
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
If nothing else, let him know that it's another four years without having to do real things.

272
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's awesome.

273
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah, the state will basically pick up the tab for you to go slack off for four years.

274
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yes, please.

275
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Now I know we have collegiate listeners right now who are like, what?

276
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
No.

277
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Trust me.

278
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Trust me.

279
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Okay.

280
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah.

281
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It sucks balls.

282
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I have no idea.

283
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You throw that hat in the air and when it comes back down to your hand, you are a different

284
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
person.

285
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
If I have it in the air, it gets razors and comes down and slices your hand off.

286
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's life.

287
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's the metaphor.

288
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And for some literal, don't go to that college.

289
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
How about in 2011, everyone just goes to college?

290
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Let's just all go to college or let's all agree to not go.

291
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
One way or the other.

292
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
One way or the other.

293
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yeah.

294
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
We can't split it like this.

295
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo answer?

296
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I have a few.

297
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I would say I have a modest handful.

298
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Okay.

299
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Give me a sliver of one.

300
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
People were busy opening gifts and I get that.

301
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I get that.

302
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But we all drop the ball.

303
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
We'll get it next year.

304
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
We've all been there.

305
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
This one was sent in by Action Allen though, our good Christmas soldier.

306
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Thank you Action Allen.

307
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Mia who asks, how to clear negative evil energies from your

308
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
home?

309
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
My aunt has just left a very charming and alluring yet destructive relationship.

310
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
She truly believes that Satan has been trying to get at her through the man she was seeing.

311
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
She has now cut ties with this man and constantly wears her blessed cross, but she wants to

312
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
clear her home of the negative energies that he brought with him.

313
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What are some simple DIY methods of clearing her home of his nasty energy?

314
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Wow.

315
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
There's a lot of different concepts in that question.

316
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
There's about eight or nine different theological ideas floating around in that query.

317
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Jesus.

318
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah.

319
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
A lot of ideas.

320
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
A lot of thoughts.

321
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
A lot of philosophies, both Eastern, Western, and Central.

322
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Mm-hmm.

323
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Wow.

324
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Are there any answers?

325
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Wow.

326
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't think you can...

327
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I definitely think you can answer without offending somebody.

328
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Well, I don't know because there is a...

329
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Somebody elected a best answer.

330
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Okay.

331
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's a little lengthy, so stick with me.

332
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Burn sage.

333
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Definitely.

334
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Oh, this is by Jennifer B.

335
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Go to Wild Oats Whole Foods, and there are these smudging sticks.

336
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
They can be like lavender or anything, but in ingredients, look for sage.

337
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Burn incense.

338
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And, well, I don't know if your aunt's religious or not, but my cousin and me do this all the

339
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
time.

340
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
But if you say the Saint Michael the Archangel prayer, it works for him all the time.

341
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Here it is.

342
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle, be our protection against the wickedness

343
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and snares of the devil.

344
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and do thou, oh prince of the heavenly host, by the

345
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
divine power of God, cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who roam throughout

346
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
the world seeking the ruin of souls.

347
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Amen.

348
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Hope I helped, because with my job as a paranormal investigator, I run into negative spirits,

349
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and this has helped tremendously.

350
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
If you have any more questions, please message me.

351
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Thank you, Smiley.

352
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh, I'll message you.

353
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You better believe we're messaging you.

354
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
No joke.

355
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Like, just reading that, like the air seems, I don't know, the air seems brighter around

356
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
me right now.

357
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I think we should all agree that 2011 is going to be the year we finally take down the devil.

358
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm saying that 2010 was the shit, like the shittiest year ever.

359
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I think we can all agree that 2010 sucked.

360
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I had high hopes for it by like January.

361
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Sounds futuristic.

362
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
January 14th, it was like, oh, Zolo's going to be a real bitch.

363
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But I don't know, I feel like I just got rid of some of 2010's funk.

364
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
2010 was a bitch.

365
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
2011, I think, is going to turn it up.

366
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But there was a lot of strife, a lot of, like not a lot of really cool things happening

367
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
in 2010.

368
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Like, I thought it was kind of-

369
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
No, 2010 was full of some bullshit.

370
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
How about that oil spill?

371
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
How's the ocean doing?

372
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Hey, how's your-

373
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
2010, thanks.

374
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Hey, thanks.

375
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Thanks.

376
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
What else happened?

377
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Gay guys are in the military now.

378
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That's ruined.

379
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Oh, thanks.

380
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Robert C. Byrd died.

381
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Robert C. Byrd died.

382
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Oh, he's definitely in my heaven jam band.

383
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
More like millifairy.

384
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
He's on the banjo.

385
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
No, he played the violin.

386
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
He's an expert fiddler.

387
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah, shit.

388
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I knew that.

389
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I have his record.

390
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But let's back up and acknowledge the fact that Travis just said millifairy.

391
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Yeah, that was good, Trav.

392
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Hey, thank you guys.

393
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I worked really hard on that.

394
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yeah, I was handcrafted.

395
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Listen, we all get one this show.

396
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Mine was Swallow Shit, which I stole from Kanye West.

397
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And Travis had millifairy.

398
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Justin, you still have one terrible pun left.

399
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
By the way, just to be clear, I think it's great that gay people are in the military.

400
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Of course it's fucking great.

401
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Why did it take so long, stupid?

402
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Hey, speaking of, not to get political, because I think that this is something anyone could

403
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
appreciate no matter what side of the political aisle.

404
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Tied into Senator Byrd dying is that West Virginia is not represented by Mr. Joe Manchin.

405
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Former governor.

406
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Former governor Joe Manchin, who just didn't-

407
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Didn't feel like it.

408
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Didn't show up that day.

409
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Had a holiday party to attend.

410
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Did you?

411
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Did you have a holiday party?

412
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So he abstains from the Don't Ask, Don't Tell vote.

413
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And then like 20 minutes later he's talking to reporters like, yeah, I done fucked that

414
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
one.

415
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I done fucked that one right up.

416
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I did bad.

417
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Should have gone.

418
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Should have gone.

419
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You know, should have repealed it.

420
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Should have voted for that.

421
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You can't play that way, dawg.

422
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Well, to be fair, he had already bought his white elephant gift, and he didn't have the

423
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
receipt for it anymore.

424
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So he had to go to that holiday party.

425
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
He bought this really funny Snuggie.

426
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
He was like, oh, damn it.

427
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I can't take it back.

428
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What am I supposed to do?

429
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Come on strong.

430
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Out the gate.

431
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Okay.

432
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Vote number one.

433
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
First vote of your career.

434
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Killing it.

435
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Killing it.

436
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
2010 was beef, man.

437
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I hated 2010.

438
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It sucked.

439
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It sucked.

440
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It was so bad.

441
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
2011 I think is going to bring the fire.

442
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's going to be that raw heat.

443
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That raw heat.

444
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I actually had a pretty good year.

445
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Shut the fuck up, Travis.

446
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yeah, really.

447
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
That's fair.

448
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That's fair.

449
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I am gay and out to basically everyone but my parents.

450
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So I was wondering how to make this a memorable and shocking experience for them, Robby.

451
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Oh, I like this.

452
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Yeah, I like this a lot.

453
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Fuck discretion.

454
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Also, fuck a guy named Timmy.

455
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Or go to a really crazy club and meet a guy named Discretion.

456
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm Discretion.

457
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Welcome.

458
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Welcome to Shamanicans.

459
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
My name is Discretion.

460
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Hey, Discretion would actually be a pretty good gay bar name, too.

461
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You want me to go to your parents' house and tongue kiss you in front of your dad?

462
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm happy to.

463
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Contrary to my name.

464
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Having a full-on hedonistic Madonna freakout really is your only option right now.

465
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Just show up with a ball gag.

466
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:31,000
A ball gag, like set up a chair made of boys in the front room of their house and just sit there waiting for them to come home.

467
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
This is my man-servant, Discretion.

468
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah, or show up with blood all over your hands.

469
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Uh-oh.

470
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
All right?

471
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Now wait for it.

472
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Blood all over your hands, sweating shirt untucked for the first time in your entire life.

473
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
If you've ever seen your shirt untucked, you've always been so clean.

474
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Immaculately dry.

475
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Immaculate, really.

476
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You show up with blood everywhere.

477
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Freak it out.

478
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Say, I need somewhere I can hide a body.

479
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I need somewhere I can hide a body.

480
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And then embroil them in 20 minutes of believing they need to help you.

481
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
See if you can get your dad to get you a chainsaw.

482
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And they're on board with this.

483
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
They're going to hide this situation.

484
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And then just as you're about to leave, be like, psych, I'm gay.

485
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
They will be so relieved.

486
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
But what if they aren't?

487
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Whoa.

488
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Can I tell you?

489
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Yeah, that could flip on you.

490
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Whoa, whoa.

491
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Can I tell you something that really scares me?

492
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
What's up?

493
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I was going to almost word for word say the exact same thing.

494
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Oh, my Jesus Christ.

495
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I know.

496
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I think it's the best idea.

497
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
2010 gets one little last stinkaroni in.

498
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah.

499
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
One little last freak out.

500
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Yeah, that's the best way, I think.

501
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I think if two out of the three of us think that that's a good idea, then it probably is, right?

502
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yeah.

503
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I don't know.

504
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I don't know.

505
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Or actually kill a dude.

506
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Just commit to it.

507
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah.

508
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
That's the best.

509
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Good.

510
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yeah.

511
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I think our show only has a few more murder endorsements we can do before some government

512
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
agency shuts us down.

513
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You think?

514
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Well, yeah.

515
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I think we should maybe keep those to a minimum.

516
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
My brother and my brother and me started in 2010.

517
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That was a good year.

518
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But you know what?

519
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That was an equal and opposite reaction.

520
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Yeah.

521
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
2010 had nothing to do with that bullshit.

522
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
That was us.

523
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We had to get...

524
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
No, it was like 2010 was so bad that we needed...

525
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Okay.

526
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
If 2010-11 doesn't need us, what if we...

527
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Excuse me.

528
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Did you say 2010-11?

529
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
2011.

530
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
No.

531
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The year 200 and...

532
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I can't do all that.

533
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
No.

534
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I have too much math for this early in the morning.

535
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I think it was the Somali pirates that set us off.

536
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yeah.

537
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
That was earlier in the year, right?

538
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
The Somali pirates happened.

539
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
We were like...

540
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
The Somali pirates was bad.

541
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That was a bad start.

542
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
We were like, fuck this.

543
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
This year is going to be a real shit storm.

544
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
We need to compensate with laughter and advice.

545
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And I feel like...

546
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I don't know.

547
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I feel like we're doing the Lord's work over here.

548
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And I feel like we helped in some small measure, at least for ourselves.

549
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
We have to have helped somebody, right?

550
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I don't know if we actually helped anybody, but...

551
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Maybe helped people get a few chuckles.

552
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Griffin.

553
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
What?

554
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I was thinking, you know, we...

555
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It's Christmas.

556
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's after Christmas.

557
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
We shouldn't be stingy with the Yahoo Answers.

558
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Let's just put another ladle of them on.

559
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You want to dip my brain ladle into the punch bowl of idiocy

560
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and scoop out a refreshing glass of Yahoo?

561
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yeah.

562
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I can do all of that.

563
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
This one was also sent in by Action Alan.

564
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Thank you, Action Alan.

565
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Betty, who asks,

566
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What are some ideas for a divorce party?

567
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
What kinds of themes, music, party favors, etc. would be good?

568
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
A boo?

569
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
What?

570
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Is this a thing?

571
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Excuse me?

572
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I mean, apparently it's a thing.

573
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Somebody on the internet is asking about it.

574
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
A divorce party?

575
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Is that like the worst surprise party ever?

576
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It will be a surprise for somebody.

577
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Oh, honey, all of our friends and family are here.

578
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
What's the occasion?

579
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Oh, I'm leaving you.

580
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's not working out.

581
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm going to stay with my sister for a while.

582
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
She's here to pick me up.

583
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You have your family around to support you.

584
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Bye.

585
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That's a very nice way to do it, because even if you get divorced,

586
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
it's like, well, I'm already at this party.

587
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
There's Chex Mix, so that helps.

588
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Maybe I'll meet somebody nice.

589
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Chex Mix, you can fit into pretty much any theme party.

590
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,000
A baby shower, a wake, a bar mitzvah, a bris.

591
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
What's a bris?

592
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I think it's a party that Jewish people throw when the circumcision happens.

593
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Oh, so it's a party for getting your wiener cut off,

594
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
which is actually, ironically, the exact opposite of a divorce party.

595
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Or the same, am I right, women.

596
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
That's what I was going for, but...

597
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I didn't...

598
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You got it?

599
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Because she's leaving you, so it's like you're going to put it back on.

600
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You're getting the hood of your penis put back on?

601
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You know, on King and Queens.

602
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Can they do that?

603
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Did you ever see that one on King and Queens?

604
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Wait, excuse me.

605
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Are you saying that there was an episode of King and Queen

606
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
in which Kevin James had his wiener chopped off and then sewn back on?

607
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Had his circumcision...

608
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Well, it was an arc.

609
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I mean, it wasn't all repaired.

610
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
How many episodes was that arc?

611
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Was that sweets?

612
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It was like a 2F arc.

613
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It was like a season ender to be continued.

614
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Do you guys remember that ad campaign between the third and fourth season

615
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
when there was a bunch of billboards with Kevin James with his penis stump exposed?

616
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And saying, what will happen?

617
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And then, like, I don't know, George Costanza's dad was looking disapprovingly like,

618
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
ah, not again.

619
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And then Leah Remini was like, ah, get it back.

620
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So who in this situation cut off his wiener?

621
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Was it a mystery?

622
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Yeah, it was like...

623
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
That was what provided the suspense at the button of the end of the first half of the arc.

624
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Turned out it was Maggie Simpson.

625
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Guys, this is the weirdest fucking episode we've ever done.

626
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Yeah, that's saying something.

627
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's 2010, man.

628
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
We're shaking out all the wretchedness,

629
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
and then we're gonna be back in 2011 with, like, the fire.

630
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Is that what it is?

631
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Yeah.

632
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I gotta say, it's a super shit episode.

633
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I think it's great.

634
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I think we're getting rid of it.

635
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I think we're burning some sage.

636
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah, this is like the sage burning episode.

637
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Getting our smudgy sticks out.

638
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Yeah.

639
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Metaphorical smudgy sticks.

640
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
We're gonna shake off all this evil, this sin.

641
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
This 2010, like, just garbage.

642
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And then we'll be back, you know, and here's the other problem.

643
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Those post-Christmas blues, man.

644
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Who doesn't have those?

645
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Oh my god.

646
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Tell me about it.

647
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You show up.

648
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Santa came.

649
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Next day, nothing.

650
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
What if we just stretched out Christmas?

651
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I was thinking about this.

652
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Till eight days.

653
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Eight days.

654
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Okay, this is good.

655
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
This is good.

656
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Eight days seems like a pretty good length.

657
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
In fact, what if we made it not about Jesus at all,

658
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and said about some oil?

659
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
What if it was like a...

660
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Of course, if it was more like Hanukkah,

661
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
that would be better for everybody.

662
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
More like what?

663
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
More like...

664
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Excuse me?

665
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Huh?

666
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You know what I like?

667
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Tops.

668
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Tops.

669
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
What if we integrated more tops into it?

670
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And flat potato-based foods.

671
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Yes.

672
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Okay.

673
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm excited now.

674
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
We can name them after that character on Taxi, Locke.

675
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You know what I like?

676
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Tell me.

677
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
The music of Adam Sandler.

678
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Okay, I'd do like that.

679
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Maybe we could get him to write the legal national theme song

680
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
for our holiday.

681
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
To do this holiday we're inventing?

682
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
This is all good so far.

683
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
What should we...

684
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Christmas...

685
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Christmas...

686
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Christmas 2?

687
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Is that...

688
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
See, that seems a little on the nose for me.

689
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
What if we...

690
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Okay, hold on.

691
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
What if we got a multi-pronged candle?

692
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Okay.

693
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Just to like represent like an iconic thing, right?

694
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And we put the gifts under that instead.

695
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And we call it Candle Nights.

696
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Candle Nights.

697
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
That sounds like an awesome holiday.

698
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It sounds like the best holiday ever, right?

699
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I would rather go to that holiday and burn in hell for all eternity

700
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
than have one day of that and get to go to heaven.

701
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
But what if Candle Nights is the correct one?

702
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
What?

703
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We don't know.

704
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
We don't know.

705
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Whoa.

706
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Whoa, you're saying that God has been upset about us celebrating the birth of his son

707
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
for so long and what he really wanted us to do.

708
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
God, this is really spiraling.

709
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yeah.

710
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I don't want to lose the love of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ

711
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
by celebrating the wrong party every December.

712
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
If someone could just tell me the right party to celebrate.

713
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm telling you what the right fucking party is.

714
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It's Candle Nights.

715
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Candle Nights 2011.

716
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Candle Nights doesn't celebrate anything.

717
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's just like...

718
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
You can celebrate whatever you want.

719
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm celebrating...

720
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Candle Nights doesn't discriminate.

721
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm celebrating Jesus' birth.

722
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I'm celebrating the discography of lamb.

723
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You can do whatever you want on Candle Nights.

724
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I'm celebrating this sweet-ass Ninja Turtles watch.

725
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Hey.

726
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Hey.

727
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Candle Nights says yes.

728
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It has Donatello's face and it pops open and it's just got a little digital readout.

729
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
That's nice.

730
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Did you get that?

731
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Does Santa still come?

732
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Santa comes on Candle Night number six.

733
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Why then?

734
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Because he can't be...

735
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
The last two presents are obviously from your parents.

736
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And they're usually the bigger ones.

737
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Candle Night number six, you usually get a surplus.

738
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You usually get about nine or ten different presents.

739
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
But they're not very...

740
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
They're usually not very good.

741
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
What kind of things are you talking about?

742
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I'm talking about...

743
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
One of them's a bris.

744
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I'm talking about...

745
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yeah.

746
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Well, the bris is on...

747
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
The bris is on Candle Nights one.

748
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Like right out the...

749
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Just to really, really get that out of the way.

750
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
From the jump.

751
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It's all uphill from here.

752
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Every candle night though.

753
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You gotta pay your dues if you're gonna do the rest of Candle Nights.

754
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So day one is bris.

755
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Day two is bris iced tea.

756
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Crying.

757
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Uh-huh.

758
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Because you need some refreshment.

759
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
You need to replenish your fluids after getting your...

760
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Your Kevin Janes.

761
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And if you...

762
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You actually have to get a little bit sliced off every year, which is right.

763
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Really old men celebrating Candle Nights actually have a cavity

764
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
in which they can store quarters up there.

765
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
They just...

766
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
That's the worst mental energy ever conjured up.

767
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Hold on a sec.

768
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
How much is it?

769
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You need some gum?

770
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
No problem.

771
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Hold on.

772
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
See, I don't want to celebrate this holiday anymore.

773
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Did I ruin it for you?

774
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I mean, if it's gonna require periodic brises, like...

775
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
No, annual.

776
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's not like you're gonna sneak up on me.

777
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's not a random bris.

778
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You can prepare for it.

779
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Oh, but what if it was a random bris?

780
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I feel like the cost would go up way, way more.

781
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Like, mid-July, if your dad, like...

782
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Hey, good morning.

783
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Come here.

784
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Come here!

785
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Hey.

786
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Your dad shows up looking like Sweetie Todd.

787
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Do you want gifts this year or not?

788
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Do you want that Brisk Ice tea?

789
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Get over here.

790
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
What year?

791
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's 2010.

792
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
That means...

793
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I thought it was more of a party game for night one.

794
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Like, people just... everybody shows up, everybody gets a razor.

795
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Good luck.

796
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
What if on the...

797
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I pictured it more with one of those cigar cutters.

798
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

799
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
That would be ideal.

800
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Is this racist?

801
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I can't tell.

802
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I can't tell either, but I...

803
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
That's what 2010 has robbed from me, is the ability to tell things are racist.

804
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
That's why we're getting it all out now and then leaving it in 2010.

805
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Gotta leave it.

806
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Gotta leave it behind.

807
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I think that should be everyone's motto for, like, the next three days.

808
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Leave it in 2010.

809
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Just get it all out.

810
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Leave it in 2010, everybody.

811
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
If you have a bad podcast in you and you just...

812
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
You just fucking leave that shit right in 2010.

813
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Leave it in 2010.

814
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Don't... like, if you got a guy who's texted you 35 times, leave it in 2010.

815
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
If you're pretending you've never heard of Hanukkah before, just, like, wrap it up, put it under the tree, and burn that tree down.

816
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Leave it in 2010.

817
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Leave it in 2010.

818
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Leave it.

819
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Hey, Somali pirates, fuck you guys.

820
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Fucking leave it.

821
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Fuck you.

822
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You're in 2010 now.

823
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Oil spill?

824
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Not anymore.

825
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Not in 2011.

826
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Do you guys remember 2010?

827
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I don't.

828
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I purged it from my memory.

829
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Yeah.

830
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I love it.

831
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I love it, too.

832
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I love it, too.

833
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You...

834
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Your parents don't know you're gay?

835
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
They will in 2010.

836
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Leave it.

837
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Leave it behind.

838
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Leave it in 2010.

839
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Pronounce it in 2010, and then in 2011, you'll be straight.

840
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
That's how it works.

841
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
That's not how...

842
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
That's...

843
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah, that's...

844
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
These are all behind.

845
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
That's not exactly how it works.

846
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Those fucking Somali pirates.

847
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Discretion.

848
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
They thought they had it.

849
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Leave discretion in 2010, please.

850
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Leave it there.

851
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
That's where he belongs.

852
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
He is not a good friend to you.

853
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
He's not a good friend to you.

854
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
He's using you for your body.

855
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So, I want to hear Griffin's last question, but a few housekeeping tips.

856
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
If you want some more of this, it's at mbnbam.com.

857
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
If you want to ask this question, all the methods are there.

858
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Please subscribe in iTunes, or if the spirit leads you, unsubscribe.

859
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I can see how that would be a viable option.

860
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I'd like to thank everyone who's either emailed us or posted on Twitter pictures of their Christmas wreath treats.

861
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Yeah.

862
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
They all look beautiful.

863
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And your mbnbam gear.

864
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Everybody got it for Christmas.

865
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Everybody did.

866
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It was like the Turbo Man of shit.

867
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
People loved it.

868
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
People were getting it.

869
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Like, did you see Arnold Schwarzenegger banged on my window at three o'clock on the morning Christmas Eve?

870
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You got to have more t-shirts.

871
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Please, my son wants a brown t-shirt.

872
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And then in the other window, it was like, ooh, ooh, ooh, dinner.

873
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Could we remake Jingle All the Way with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Robin Williams,

874
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
only instead of Christmas, it's for Candle Nights?

875
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Robin Williams takes the Sinbad role like he can afford that.

876
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Like, that poor guy can afford to miss out on the work.

877
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
The movie would be eight times longer.

878
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I would watch that.

879
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It would be like two of the Lord of the Rings special editions back to back.

880
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Ken Burns presents Candle Nights.

881
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I feel like we could come up with a better title than just Candle Nights, though.

882
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I don't think there is a better one.

883
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Give me Wic.

884
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
God, 2010, you bitch.

885
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
God damn it, Zolo.

886
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I fucking hate you, Zolo, so much.

887
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Can we just end the show and end the year?

888
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Can I just go to bed for the next four days until it's the next year?

889
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I know.

890
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It's over.

891
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Griffin, something.

892
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Get that, like, just the worst one you got.

893
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Let's shake it off.

894
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Get it out.

895
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
The worst one I have?

896
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Yeah, the worst, like, least funny one.

897
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
We're going to shake out 2010 the right way by failing.

898
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
What if I just load up the front page of Yahoo Answers and read the first one?

899
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Do it.

900
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Sure.

901
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Do it.

902
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Fucking do it.

903
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:13,000
This one is by Yahoo Answers user Carrie, who asks,

904
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
How long have you used Yahoo Answers?

905
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm Justin McElroy.

906
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I'm Travis McElroy.

907
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

908
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm so sorry.

909
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

910
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Kiss your dad and squirt on the lips and leave it to 2010.

911
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Keep your heart, three stacks.

912
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Keep your heart.

913
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Hey, keep your heart, three stacks.

914
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Keep your heart.

915
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Man, these girls are smart.

916
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Three stacks, these girls are smart.

917
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Play your part.
