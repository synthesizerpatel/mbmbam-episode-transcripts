1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,160
Hello and welcome to the McElroy Brothers brand expansion quarterly report.

6
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,600
I am your oldest chief financial officer, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,960
I'm your middlest head of HR, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:07,840
And I am digital profit, Shingy. I go by Shingy now, because I'm a digital profit.

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:17,440
Gosh, what an exciting Q4 it's been for McElroy Industries. We already had the My Brother,

10
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:25,600
My Brother, Me, and Sawbones franchises under the tent pole, big tent pole business, as I say.

11
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,000
And we welcome three new franchises into the umbrella that we think-

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,360
Closing the gap.

13
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:41,440
Closing the gap, opening the kimono, and just checking out the profits on our new properties.

14
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,760
We're going to go to Travis. We'll get to your calls in just a second. We're going to go to

15
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,760
Travis. First off, tell us about the project he's leading, just a quick-

16
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:59,120
I'm very excited. Bunker Buddies, the survival comedy podcast. It's looking great. Product

17
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,000
integration is through the roof. I'm talking about rice primarily. We have a lot of rice backers.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,360
How's your dividends?

19
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,840
The dividends are great. My partner, Andy, and I are just rolling in dividends,

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,000
swimming in dividends like Scrooge McDuck. We're very excited about all the dividends.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,120
Do you get any bonds?

22
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,000
We've got bonds and dividends.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,280
How are your options?

24
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,040
Options, we have them.

25
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,480
How's your bond options?

26
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,240
Our bond options, we're going to go see Spectre. All the bond options are there.

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,720
Travis, that's a podcast about surviving the apocalypse, a comedy show about the end of the

28
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:28,880
world.

29
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,520
That is correct.

30
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,800
Great. I want to just real quick weigh in on a brand I'm representing here. It's the three of us

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,320
on this call plus our sweet daddy playing Dungeons and Dragons. It's called the Adventure Zone. That

32
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,600
hot property was just launched on Thursday.

33
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,280
Big dividends on that one.

34
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
Big dividends.

35
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,000
Huge dividends. Number one comedy podcast on iTunes. Suck it, Miss Williams. I guess I did

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,880
do something.

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,000
Number one dadcast on the net.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,040
Number one cast with our daddy ever in history. That's been big. Then, Griffin, you had a brand

39
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,120
to talk to us about.

40
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:18,880
I had a whole new brand launching on Guytoons, which is a deep web iTunes application. Not a

41
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,880
lot of people have access to-

42
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,760
You can only get it with the Guypod.

43
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:31,680
You have to have the first generation Guypod circa 1998 to listen to it. Despite those

44
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:42,080
limitations, the dividends on this podcast, which I have titled my Vore and Japanese Electronica

45
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:51,760
podcast about Vore, which I have titled Big Gulp.

46
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,360
Griffin, let me say right off the bat, congratulations on getting the rights to use the 7-Eleven

47
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,760
logo with that. Congratulations.

48
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,600
I was going to get Justin Russo, one of our lead artistic brand managers, or Justin Gray,

49
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,000
artistic brand manager for the Adventure Zone on this one, but you know what I said? Fuck

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,880
it. Fuck it. 7-Eleven already did the work. I'm going to put them on, slap them on the

51
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,240
Big Gulp lunch boxes and on the cups that I sell Slurpees out of. It's going to get

52
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,520
really fucking confusing.

53
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,640
Now, Griffin, is there anywhere-

54
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,680
Can I just- But the dividends though.

55
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,840
Is there anywhere anyone can find Big Gulp?

56
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:39,280
Yeah, you have to have a good RSSS reader. You're going to plug-

57
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,200
What are the S's stands for sex?

58
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:48,560
You're going to plug this into your favorite RSSS application of your choosing, the following

59
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,480
URL. P.

60
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,280
One more time, Griffin. Can we get that one more time?

61
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,080
P. That's it.

62
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,960
Just P? So that is-

63
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,760
There's not a lot of shit in the PSSSS system, so I locked down P.

64
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,560
Big Gulp, Bunker Buddies, a lot of huge growth, and I think we can go ahead and just try-

65
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,000
I guess we have to keep recording the flagship here.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,680
I'm honestly- I think we've about run into the ground, but the dividends-

67
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,480
The dividends.

68
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,080
The dividends, though.

69
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,880
Damn it. Damn.

70
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,360
Check out damn dividends, though.

71
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,880
We're all- We're three Gordon Ramseys.

72
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,160
Mm-hmm.

73
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,040
We're three chunkier versions of Gordon Ramsey, not British.

74
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,160
A few months ago, I started dating my best friend. Oh, this is my brother and my brother

75
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,720
made some advice show for the modern era.

76
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,520
You probably heard-

77
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,280
It's our Adventure Zone fan cast.

78
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,800
You will always- You will always be our first baby, and we will always love you the most.

79
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Let me just- Quick message to all my big gulpers out there.

80
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,280
We might not talk about Vore on this show, so it might not be- It might be a little unexpected.

81
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,800
That's how I talk.

82
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,600
I hope this is somebody's first fucking my brother.

83
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,320
Fuck off.

84
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Can you fucking even imagine what sort- You said this was funny.

85
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,560
This was funny. David. David. David. It's Brian.

86
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,880
You said this was funny, and it's just guys talking about their brand?

87
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:36,160
I recognize one of the guys from Losing the Sheen, but it's not about Charlie Sheen at all, is it?

88
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,320
And I recognize Griffin from a pod- You know what? I shouldn't- Forget I said anything.

89
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't want to mention-

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,400
I'm going to go back to listening to In Case of Emergency.

91
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,360
I love cereal.

92
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,680
This line of goofing that we've been bringing on has really brought up how bad we are at

93
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,960
keeping podcasts going.

94
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,880
Listen, I guarantee- So enjoy Bunker Buddies and Adventure Zone

95
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,320
and Big Gulp while they last.

96
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,560
Yeah, and My Brother, My Brother and Me, for that matter.

97
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,640
Nothing gold can- No gold dividends can stay.

98
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,760
I'll never stop doing My Brother, My Brother and Me.

99
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,600
No, fuck you. I don't care what I do without you two.

100
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,840
Probably the goofs are my cold dead hands.

101
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,920
I'll bring in Ashton Kutcher. I don't care.

102
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,000
So this is an advice show if this is the first time you're listening,

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,760
and this is where the show starts.

104
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,120
This is the part of the show.

105
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,080
The thing about My Brother, My Brother and Me, kind of a running gag,

106
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,160
is the first five minutes of every episode of this program ever are un-listenable.

107
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,120
It's barf garbage.

108
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,760
It's how we lure in new listeners.

109
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,280
Set the expectations low.

110
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,120
That's our motto here at My Brother, My Brother and Me Institute.

111
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,840
The only podcast brave enough to begin with hazing.

112
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,760
Mm-hmm. And that's a premium swallow.

113
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,560
Oh, sorry. Hold on. No, that's a big gulp.

114
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:55,360
That's how I end every episode of Big Gulp.

115
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,200
I have to fucking do it now.

116
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,960
Now I have to fucking do a podcast.

117
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,440
I'm gonna have to learn how to set up an RSS feed,

118
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,920
and I'm gonna have to fucking create a podcast called Big Gulp.

119
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,720
Open submission, I guess, for co-hosts.

120
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,480
Can you have one- I just want one episode of Big Gulp.

121
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,160
I'm not asking for the one, but I want it to like be in iTunes and everything.

122
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,560
Yeah, sure.

123
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,640
And I want to be number one forever, but I just only want one episode.

124
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,040
Okay.

125
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,680
Yeah.

126
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,960
Big Gulp, the Vore show coming from Griffin McElroy and a co-host to be named later.

127
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,880
And here's our advice to you, the listeners.

128
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
Can we just do this show? This feels right.

129
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,200
Just every once in a while making oblique references to your repugnant Vore show?

130
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,760
I think my favorite episode was the one on what's eating Gilbert Grape.

131
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,120
It was just 45 minutes of Griffin saying me.

132
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,040
Okay, and now we do it.

133
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,840
Now we do the damn thing.

134
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,360
And now we get to the thing that you've been waiting for.

135
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,800
Hopefully.

136
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,440
Dim the lights.

137
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,240
We're about to thump this melon.

138
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,600
And now the starting lineup of my brother, my brother, me.

139
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,120
Do the damn thing.

140
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,040
If we were a sports team, what song would you guys want to come out onto the court with?

141
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,320
He ain't heavy, he's my brother.

142
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,320
Save the best for last.

143
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,880
Being from night court.

144
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,120
A few months ago, I started dating my best friend.

145
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,760
He's the best ever and it's the happiest I've ever been.

146
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,560
Show off.

147
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,920
I'm totally in love with him and I'd like to tell him that.

148
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,720
But this project needs some tweaking.

149
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,320
We're both pretty goofy and the thought of grand romantic moment in which I declare my

150
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,560
love makes me want to vomit.

151
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,520
Sorry, makes me want to actually vomit.

152
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,240
Can you think of a good way for me to tell him I love him that strikes a nice balance?

153
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,400
And that's from ghost octopus.

154
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,240
So I have a question for you guys because I thought about this when I was putting together

155
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,880
the question list.

156
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,400
Is it as simple as starting the sentence with hey?

157
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,440
Hey, I love you.

158
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,520
I mean, does that do it or does that make it seem like you're reminding them about a

159
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,040
dentist appointment they have?

160
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,240
Hey, I love you.

161
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,800
Okay, great.

162
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,280
Cool, cool, cool.

163
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,280
Thank you for that first for the debut of that terminology.

164
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,720
That seems a little cash.

165
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,800
Yeah, seems a little cash right?

166
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,840
I'm not sure about it.

167
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,280
It seems a little.

168
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,280
I if you're like me, you'll say it accidentally and then just try to go with it to like a

169
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,680
banker on the phone.

170
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,120
Thanks.

171
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,080
I love you.

172
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,440
I mean, fuck.

173
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,200
Sorry, teacher.

174
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,920
I mean, fuck.

175
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,840
Yeah, I don't know what you do.

176
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,400
I do feel like you need to strike a little bit of a balance and it doesn't have to be

177
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,480
like you don't have to like paint it on an elephant that you stole for them.

178
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,280
But I do think it needs to be better than what Travis said.

179
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,000
Fair enough.

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,560
Which sounded a little bleak for my taste.

181
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,760
Maybe, maybe you just know, you know what, just do it when you feel it.

182
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,360
You know what?

183
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,360
I you're right, Griffin, because the thing is, like, whatever defines your relationship,

184
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,720
if you guys are goofy together and have a good time, then it will come when you're having

185
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,280
a good time.

186
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,360
It doesn't have to be a grand romantic gesture.

187
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,040
It should be in a moment where it's like, hey, this moment, perfect timing.

188
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,280
This moment perfectly exemplifies why I fell in love with you.

189
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,360
Everything you're doing right now, you're making me laugh till milk shot out of my nose

190
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,760
or we're having a great time doing something that anyone else would think was stupid.

191
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,840
This is the moment when I have to say it.

192
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,120
Say it when you feel it.

193
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,800
Next time you feel that love for that person, let him know.

194
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,240
Let him in.

195
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,640
Let him just know it.

196
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,920
Let him in your heart.

197
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,200
Just let him in your heart.

198
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,640
Just say it when it bubbles up and you can't keep it in anymore.

199
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,080
Just let it all spill out.

200
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:09,120
Can I another stratagem is when you don't feel a toot coming on when you feel like maybe

201
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:17,760
maybe after you just had one and it not immediately after, of course, but maybe give it like a

202
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,960
three minute window.

203
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,880
And if you feel like you're probably going to be cool for another three minutes, because

204
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,640
everybody does it every six minutes, you want to try and split the uprights there and buy

205
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,520
yourself as much breathing room as you can.

206
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,880
So like in a toot window.

207
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,320
Yeah, in the six minute toot window for sure.

208
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,120
Pretty good call.

209
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,600
If you if you're feeling it also in that window, perfect.

210
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,200
The stars have aligned, but that might be too much to ask from your body.

211
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,640
Is it a good way to get out of being caught in a toot?

212
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,440
Like you just farted in front of him for the first time.

213
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,240
I love you.

214
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,960
I love you.

215
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:51,760
What?

216
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,640
Well, now we're talking about this instead of the fart.

217
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,000
Got it.

218
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,360
Oh, I thought you're saying you do it.

219
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,720
And please, can we say toot instead?

220
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,880
I thought you meant like you just say it real loud to disguise.

221
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,320
Oh, to cover the toot.

222
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,880
Yeah, sure.

223
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,280
Have we ruined?

224
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,640
Say it next time you're in trouble.

225
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,920
When you do something wrong or the next time you're in trouble, like you're being attacked.

226
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,760
I love you and hope that it calls to them and they come to your aid like Superman.

227
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,900
Yeah.

228
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,400
I'm not a big fan of sitting on it.

229
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,240
I think now let me ask you guys this.

230
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,840
Do you have to couch it in like it's OK if you don't want to if you're not ready for it?

231
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,040
Oh, it doesn't sound like that's the problem.

232
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,640
That's what I'm saying.

233
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,920
They're already so far ahead of the curve.

234
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,960
Like it doesn't sound like this person is going to get spooked.

235
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,400
But I do understand what you're saying, Justin.

236
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,880
I think just in general, that's like any kind of preface is is.

237
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,560
Because I think that with that, what you're saying is you do actually have to say it back.

238
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,440
I'm saying you don't have to say it back so that, you know, I'm expecting you to.

239
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,640
Here's what I think you should do.

240
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,760
Tell him, like, listen, no matter what I say in the next 30 seconds,

241
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,240
I don't want you to say a fucking word, not a peep out of you.

242
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,320
I don't care what you think or feel.

243
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
I need you to just soak this in and process it.

244
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,360
This moment's about me.

245
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,280
This is about me.

246
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,120
This is my moment to shine.

247
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,920
Let's drink it in.

248
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,720
I want you to sit on this for three minutes and then I'm going to go somewhere.

249
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,880
And then I'll come right back.

250
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,920
I've hired actor John Larquette to tell you that I love you.

251
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,720
Don't say anything.

252
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,800
Don't say a word.

253
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,840
Thank you very much, John.

254
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,200
He was very expensive.

255
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,880
His time is very expensive.

256
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,640
Do you guys want a yahoo?

257
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,160
Please.

258
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,920
Here's a yahoo that was sent in by Matt Estavez.

259
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,960
Thank you, Matt.

260
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,800
It's by yahoo answers user Yoville posted in arts and humanities history.

261
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,960
Yoville asks, what are the ranks in the Illuminati?

262
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,080
Name all of the ranks or anything.

263
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,680
Name all of the ranks or anything they use to describe their self as.

264
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:08,000
Well, there's the Bluebirds and the Cardinals and the Bluebirds are the more advanced Illuminati

265
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,320
and the Cardinals are the ones that need some help.

266
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,600
Is that some red wall shit?

267
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,280
No, it's like a that's like elementary school stuff.

268
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,280
I don't have that.

269
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,760
I think that if anyone answers this question, then they're not Illuminati.

270
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,720
Because they would know better than yeah, because they would know better than to reveal

271
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,360
the secrets.

272
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,200
Let me bounce something that yahoo answers user armor.

273
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,440
We responded with very helpful stuff from our own.

274
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,520
They said the leader of the Earth's Illuminati.

275
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,560
So that's a pretty fucking crazy six words right there.

276
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,440
The leader of the Earth's Illuminati is called the Pindar.

277
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,040
Cool.

278
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,320
The Pindar is a member of one of the 13 ruling Illuminati families and is always male.

279
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,280
That's kind of fucked up.

280
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,160
It's 2014.

281
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,000
But really, there's probably a good reason for that in this next sentence.

282
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,280
The title Pindar is an abbreviated term for pinnacle of the Draco,

283
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,760
also known as the Penis of the Dragon.

284
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,560
I was so hoping that's what it would be.

285
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,360
The Penis of the Dragon is probably my favorite Stephen King book.

286
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,480
He doesn't get a lot of credit, but I'm deeply into it.

287
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,320
All hail me.

288
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,840
The Penis of the Dragon.

289
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,280
Why are you giggling?

290
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,480
Why are you all giggling?

291
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,000
You're the worst Illuminati.

292
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,560
Scott.

293
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,920
Scott Illuminati.

294
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,560
Scott Illuminati, I hear you giggling underneath your innate mask.

295
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,240
It must be so frustrating to be a member of the Illuminati

296
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,880
as everybody is like just spreading out this shit.

297
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,640
And you want to say like, hey, that's not true.

298
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,920
Hey, that's not how it's worked.

299
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,280
It's Gooch of the Dragon.

300
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,360
God, I'm the Goochess.

301
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,480
I am the Goochess of Earth's Illuminati.

302
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,960
Wouldn't it be hard to be the Penis of the Dragon

303
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,640
and then somebody cuts in line in front of you at the Chinese buffet

304
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,600
and you're like, because they want the last of the coconut shrimp

305
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,240
and you're like, hey, you better not do that.

306
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,360
And they look at you, why?

307
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,600
And you just have to stare at the floor.

308
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,880
It's like, oh, I can't try.

309
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,440
Never mind.

310
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,600
But you better not do it.

311
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,640
I'm the Penis of-

312
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,200
I'm the Enos Pei of the Agandre.

313
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,040
Enos Pei.

314
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,440
You just make a triangle with your fingers.

315
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,000
Get it?

316
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,720
Get it.

317
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,680
And then you put that triangle close to your crotch

318
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,440
to make it look like a penis tip

319
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,280
and then you flap your wings like a dragon.

320
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,280
Get it?

321
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,720
The shrimp is yours.

322
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,680
You win.

323
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,240
I'm leaving.

324
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,280
There do have to be like certain levels of Illuminati.

325
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,000
You can't just start as like full-fledged

326
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,160
like on the council Illuminati.

327
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,240
You've got to start as like junior Illuminati, right?

328
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,960
Right?

329
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,080
I think there's a sure-fire-

330
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,200
I don't know how anybody finds out about it,

331
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,160
but I've seen the Yahoos that Drew Davenport sent in.

332
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,040
If that cat has not found how to get into the Illuminati yet,

333
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,880
I don't think anybody ever will.

334
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,280
It seems like he probably would have unearthed it by now.

335
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,080
Well, but how would we know?

336
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,280
Are you suggesting, Travis,

337
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,480
that maybe there's like an Illuminati Awanas program?

338
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,160
Illuminati brownies or something?

339
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,640
Yeah, like you're a Cub Scout Illuminati.

340
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,040
You start, you're making Pinewood Derby first,

341
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,600
and then like 10 years later, you're ruling the world.

342
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,920
You're controlling all the bank cartels and shit.

343
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,760
How do they know?

344
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,000
They're not just gonna like first day Illuminati

345
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,160
hand you the reins to the American government.

346
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,800
They won't even admit that you're in it first.

347
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,840
You gotta be really careful.

348
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,360
They won't admit the Illuminati exists

349
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,800
until you're a couple ranks in.

350
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,480
Sometimes it's just people trying to trick you

351
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,280
out of your rent money.

352
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,280
So wait, am I in the Illuminati or not?

353
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,000
Well, I guess that's up to you.

354
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,840
Are you the real Illuminati?

355
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,040
Six months in, it's like,

356
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,000
hey, you didn't show up to our bowling game on Tuesday.

357
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,600
Oh, so it is a bowling league.

358
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Fuck, I guess wrong again, shit.

359
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,160
Do you think when you start off in the Illuminati,

360
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
they let you like control a student government

361
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,800
and like just see how you do with that first?

362
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,920
The first thing you control is a fantasy football league.

363
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,840
That's where you start in the Illuminati.

364
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,920
But no one can know about it.

365
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,360
My name's Scott Jenkins

366
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,280
and I'm running for Huntington High School's

367
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,280
Tip of the Dragon Penis.

368
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,200
Just a tip please, vote Scott.

369
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,120
I'm gonna sort down the lunch signs on Taco Tuesday.

370
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,040
Vote for me for Dragon Penis.

371
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,640
I seen you run in the halls.

372
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,400
I have cameras everywhere.

373
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,800
Scott.

374
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,480
Scott, the principal comes to him in a robe.

375
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,360
Tell me what to do.

376
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,680
Milkshake machine.

377
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,760
Next question.

378
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,720
My name is Simon.

379
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,240
I'm from England.

380
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,760
You didn't need this.

381
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,160
We knew you were from England based on the name.

382
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,800
Is that fair?

383
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,160
Maybe based on the accent, hold on.

384
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,360
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

385
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,000
I can't.

386
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,920
My name is Simon.

387
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,040
I'm from England.

388
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,760
Okay.

389
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,080
I'm finishing up my final year in a PhD program in the US,

390
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,760
specifically Missouri.

391
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,640
Now switch to a Missouri accent.

392
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,640
During my five years here, I've found the stories about Americans

393
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,840
loving the English accent to be true.

394
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,720
It is nice to be appreciated,

395
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,160
but it also sometimes jarring, even annoying,

396
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,640
when I'm simply getting a coffee and I say, thank you.

397
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,840
Or only to hear, oh my God, I love your accent.

398
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,720
I've even tried to put on a Missouri accent.

399
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,480
That's what I was doing earlier, you see,

400
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,640
at the checkout to avoid this problem.

401
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,760
And Simon, I am sure it is convincing.

402
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,880
My question is two pronged.

403
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,920
You call them prongs.

404
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,320
That's like, that's problem number one.

405
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
My question is two pronged.

406
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,640
Why do Americans love the English accent?

407
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,400
Two, what can I do to be honest about my feelings

408
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,800
that it's just a voice and I didn't work for it

409
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,640
so it doesn't deserve praise?

410
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,000
And that's from Simon.

411
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,200
Oh, poor baby.

412
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,240
Well, for number one.

413
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,360
Oh, I can't imagine.

414
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,000
All the, everybody, all the ladies and all the guys

415
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,960
are throwing themselves at me

416
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,640
because I sound like Benedict Cumberbatch.

417
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,240
It's so hard, Justin.

418
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,400
Please, brothers, please, brothers,

419
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,480
who sound like extras from Dukes of Hazzard.

420
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,040
Please tell me how to navigate this terrible life situation

421
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,160
I find myself in.

422
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,320
Crikey, shrimp on the bar.

423
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,820
Nope.

424
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,680
Wrong.

425
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,480
Did it bad.

426
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,080
I'm so sorry, Simon.

427
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,120
As far as number one goes,

428
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,440
I always imagine that people really like the accent

429
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,000
because like as melting pot as we're supposed to be,

430
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,040
it's pretty homogenous.

431
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,960
Like everybody pretty much sounds the same

432
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,880
from coast to coast.

433
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,280
And so-

434
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
That's 100% not true.

435
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,840
It is.

436
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,640
What are you talking about?

437
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,480
No, I just mean as far as like, if you go to like-

438
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,240
Travis, you've got to, like, you can't just say words.

439
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,040
They have meaning.

440
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,600
Well, hear me out.

441
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,120
What I mean is if you go to like Scotland

442
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,040
or go to England or go to Ireland,

443
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,960
like any other European country,

444
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,760
like there are people coming through there all the time

445
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,000
and you hear different accents constantly

446
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,280
to the point where it kind of loses its effect.

447
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,040
Whereas here, to hear someone with-

448
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,760
You are making this shit up from whole cloth.

449
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,640
I mean, pretty much.

450
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,600
Okay, all right.

451
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,880
He finally admits it.

452
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,280
It only took us 229 episodes.

453
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,600
But wouldn't you admit that it's more unique here

454
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,360
to hear an out of the country accent

455
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,960
than it would be in other countries?

456
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,080
Than an American accent?

457
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,800
Yeah, Trav.

458
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,200
That's just how time and space function.

459
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,760
No, I mean, as compared to other countries,

460
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,200
I imagine that that is the case.

461
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,080
I am basing that off of nothing but my own supposition.

462
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,040
Okay.

463
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,960
I mean, other countries-

464
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
But your supposition has to be based on something

465
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,160
or else you're just making it up.

466
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,600
As opposed to the rest of this show,

467
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,760
which is all based on research and facts.

468
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,160
No, no, no.

469
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,120
Here's what you should have argued.

470
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,160
Thank you, Griffin.

471
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,280
If you were better at this.

472
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,560
An English person comes here

473
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,520
and drops some dope knowledge with their English accent

474
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,320
and everybody gets wet.

475
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,440
And we go to England and everyone dries up,

476
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,640
dries it right up like an old crusty flume.

477
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,800
I literally couldn't have put it better myself.

478
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,920
Yeah, especially the crusty flume shit.

479
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,320
Yeah, you are incapable of painting

480
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,360
those kinds of word pictures.

481
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,280
No, you're right.

482
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
But how is it a problem?

483
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,200
I guess it is a problem if you live with it.

484
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,920
And it's like, I just want to go to the Piggly Wiggly.

485
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,040
Is that what they have in Missouri?

486
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,080
Yeah, that sounds about right.

487
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,360
Anything that's not HEB, I just don't.

488
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,560
I can't comprehend it.

489
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,680
And you just want to get some, I guess,

490
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,440
breakfast teas or something.

491
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,920
I guess I just don't see why,

492
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,160
in what reality would it make more sense to,

493
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,000
like, why would you ever want to like,

494
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,440
rather than just say, oh, thanks,

495
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,800
or, oh, blind me, gov, no, thank you.

496
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,960
Rather than say that,

497
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,320
why would you want to get into like,

498
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,960
it's a pleasantry, man.

499
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,760
It's a pleasantry.

500
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,560
Okay, you're talking a lot of heat right now.

501
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,480
You're really pulling a Travis

502
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,880
because I want you to imagine being at the grocery store

503
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,160
and having to talk to someone.

504
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,320
Okay, I'm imagining it.

505
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,720
It's not great, is it?

506
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,600
No, but like, he, what I'm saying is,

507
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,080
why is he wanting to invite a deeper conversation about this?

508
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,760
Like, he's not, he's asking how to completely avoid it.

509
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,840
No, no, he's not.

510
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,640
Saying, what can I do to be honest about my feelings?

511
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,320
That's not, he's not gonna wear a t-shirt that says-

512
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,760
First of all, welcome to America.

513
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,800
We don't do that here.

514
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,560
We don't do that here.

515
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
What, you, I mean, he's not talking about

516
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,160
wearing t-shirts that says,

517
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,080
just here for the crumpets, but please leave me alone.

518
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,640
He's talking about like, how can he engage with people

519
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,720
to make them more sensitive about his inability

520
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,480
to accept compliments about his accent?

521
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,320
You know, people get compliments

522
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,680
for a lot of things they didn't work for.

523
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,640
I get compliments, Travis gets compliments on his hair.

524
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,140
Correct.

525
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,600
I get compliments on my, my God-given muscles

526
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,440
and I, I didn't work for him.

527
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,520
It just, I'm sculpted that way, carved out of wood.

528
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,400
It's amazing.

529
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,680
What do I, and what do I have?

530
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,400
What do I have?

531
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:26,640
What?

532
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,040
You're beautiful.

533
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,520
What do I have?

534
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,240
Your beautiful teeth that you consume human beings with.

535
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,000
Besides from the most successful VOR podcast on the dark web.

536
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,200
It's just not that, I just don't-

537
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,560
I agree with Justin on this one.

538
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,840
I think that it's, it's, it just like someone saying,

539
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,600
nice weather isn't an invitation

540
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,440
to like actually discuss the weather.

541
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,480
I think that this is just like, great accent, thank you.

542
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,840
I didn't make the weather.

543
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,680
I had nothing to do with the weather, okay?

544
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,840
It's just how it is.

545
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,000
Maybe I like the clouds.

546
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,200
You ever think about that?

547
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,000
You ever think about that?

548
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,200
Shit weather.

549
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,440
Yeah, that's actually a good point, Travis.

550
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,680
It's not as crazy as a comparison as it may seem.

551
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,920
I mean, you didn't do anything to invite this.

552
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,760
They're just like making conversation

553
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,880
and trying to say something nice.

554
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,520
It doesn't require you to, to get up in arms about it.

555
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,560
Just accept the compliment.

556
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,920
Oh, thank you, Governor.

557
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,640
I appreciate it.

558
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,840
Think of it as like, if you wear like a, a great watch

559
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,480
or a great top and they're just looking for an opportunity

560
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,400
to compliment something about you,

561
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,280
to try to like make you feel nice about your day, you know?

562
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,800
And it's like the same as saying like,

563
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,160
oh, I love your shoes.

564
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,440
I love your accent.

565
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,560
You know, it's that idea of like,

566
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,440
they're just saying something nice to be pleasant.

567
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,120
So if you don't want them to say anything

568
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,640
about your accent anymore, you need to get,

569
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,800
and it's amazing how this is the solution

570
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,880
to basically every problem we're pitched.

571
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,800
Just big diesel muscles.

572
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,000
Just huge, huge muscles.

573
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,080
Justin, like Justin's God-given heft muscles.

574
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
One way to get that conversation to stop,

575
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,520
and I don't know how to spread the word that you do this,

576
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,840
but just when somebody compliments you on your accent,

577
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,000
just keep asking for more.

578
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,200
Like, you're really needy.

579
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,080
Like, oh, go on.

580
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,240
What do you like about it best?

581
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,600
What words do you want to hear me say?

582
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,040
I'll say any words.

583
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,640
I'll say all of the words.

584
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,800
Do you want me to call your friend?

585
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,280
Check this out.

586
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,480
And leave a voicemail for him?

587
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:16,880
Check this out.

588
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
This is what it sounds like when I whisper.

589
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,000
God save the queen.

590
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,280
A-S-M-R.

591
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:21,780
Govna.

592
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,280
Govna, Govna.

593
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,760
Govna J. Nixon of Missouri.

594
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,880
Y'all want a Yahoo?

595
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,400
Yeah, sure.

596
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,120
Here's a Yahoo.

597
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,120
Or should I say a Yajuru?

598
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,240
Sent in by Drew Davenport.

599
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,840
Thank you, Yajuru.

600
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,840
It's by Yajuru Answers user Lardell who asks,

601
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,040
yes or no?

602
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,200
The things I'm into are interesting.

603
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,560
So let's just shoot down the list real quick and you guys can weigh in and let me know how

604
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,920
interesting Lardell stuff is.

605
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,400
What are we into your game, Lardell?

606
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,760
Okay, let's see.

607
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,880
Underground hip-hop.

608
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,920
I think we can unanimously put these up and cool.

609
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,800
If you know how to find that, please let me know.

610
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,840
I'm basically just trying to get like surface level hip-hop masters.

611
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,240
Sure.

612
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,480
Thick and sexy women, Lardell.

613
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,280
You frascal.

614
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,360
Faith Evans.

615
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,520
You know what I say, the thicker the woman, the bigger the bite when I swallow her.

616
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,320
Big gulp.

617
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,760
Check out on Guy Toons.

618
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,640
Every Flerzday.

619
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,600
Wax Poetics.

620
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:21,840
Sure.

621
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,960
Is that where he's finding out about his underground hip-hop?

622
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,520
Probably.

623
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,400
Dusty Groove.

624
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,440
Either an underground hip-hop artist or another magazine.

625
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,480
Louisville Cardinals.

626
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,240
Pittsburgh Steelers.

627
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,000
Again, I don't think these are interesting.

628
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Like billions of people like the Louisville Cardinals.

629
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,360
Billions of people like the Steelers.

630
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,280
Music is my drug.

631
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,320
Well, that's just a saying that you sort of did about yourself.

632
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,600
Right?

633
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,800
Not so much an interest?

634
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,640
Not so much a thing that you're interested in.

635
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:53,920
Snickers.

636
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,080
Is this this person's Facebook like collection?

637
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,600
All I can imagine is that this is the scenario we're looking at.

638
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,680
What was this person's name?

639
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,800
Lardell.

640
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,520
Lardell.

641
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,200
Lardell has encountered several people that when he starts to talk about himself,

642
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,000
they go,

643
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,720
Lardell, you're not interesting.

644
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,080
And he said, you are wrong.

645
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,640
You're wrong.

646
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,000
I'll get the internet to prove it.

647
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Some of these things I think are genuinely interesting.

648
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,120
Talk radio.

649
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,640
The fact that you can actually listen to that.

650
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,120
Yes.

651
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,640
Congratulations.

652
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,440
I'm interested.

653
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,600
RIP Biggie Smalls.

654
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,280
I'm interested that that's an interest.

655
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,080
I'm interested about that interest of yours.

656
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,440
I miss Michael Jackson.

657
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,520
I fucking do too, Lardell.

658
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,880
Now you've hooked me.

659
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,680
Bernie Mac.

660
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,320
Sure.

661
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,960
Sure. I'm going to pull a chair beside you and we're going to talk about Bernie Mac for hours.

662
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,520
Fuck yeah.

663
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,200
Fuck yes.

664
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,400
It's weird to me that Snickers rated above those things in his interests.

665
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,800
I'm just sort of popping around here.

666
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,920
I love to draw.

667
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,000
Again, that's sort of just a sentence, isn't it?

668
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,360
Should have just maybe said drawing.

669
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,760
But fine.

670
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,800
Chili cheese dogs.

671
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,480
Lardell, you're hitting a valley, bud.

672
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,320
We just came off of sweet Bernie Mac Peak and now we're in a valley together.

673
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,520
Uncle Sam's Jams.

674
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,840
Oh, you got me back, Lardell.

675
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,360
You got me back.

676
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,000
How are you guys feeling about Lardell right now?

677
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,880
Let's take a quick Lardell break and just tell me how you feel about him as a person vis-a-vis his interests.

678
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,640
I can just imagine this guy with his Faith Hill poster.

679
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,200
Faith Evans.

680
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,600
Listening to Faith Hill.

681
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,480
Oh fuck, did I confuse Faith Evans and Faith Hill?

682
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,840
Okay.

683
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,960
Hold on, let me check this out.

684
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,640
Oh yeah, different person.

685
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,480
Totally different person.

686
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,560
So he's got a picture of somebody on his wall.

687
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,720
He's listening to his underground hip-hop eatin' Snickers.

688
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,640
And just being interested in rest in peace Mickey Smalls.

689
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,480
Just wondering how his situation is.

690
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,680
Maybe somewhere in the distance, Mr. 3000.

691
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,240
His old beaten up laser disk of Mr. 3000 is playing for the umpteenth time.

692
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,760
He seems like a pretty cool dude.

693
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,000
I would say that if Lardell leaned over to me and said like,

694
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,400
hey, do you want to talk about how much we miss Michael Jackson?

695
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,600
Yeah.

696
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,880
A thousand percent do.

697
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,960
If he said, do you like chili cheese dogs?

698
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,000
Yeah, I do.

699
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,320
And then we'd probably start talking about Sonic the Hedgehog.

700
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,040
And then he'd be like, hey, I got an extra Snickers.

701
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,760
Do you want one?

702
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,600
And then we're like best friend city.

703
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:31,920
Yeah.

704
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,160
And he'd be like, hey, I need to repair a drum skin.

705
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,560
Do you want to come with me to Uncle Sam's Jams?

706
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,080
Which is a musical instrument retailer in Louisville, Kentucky.

707
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,720
They're closing soon, according to Google.

708
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,080
Six PM is the time they close.

709
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,640
So make sure you-

710
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:44,960
Oh, okay.

711
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,160
So like closing for the day.

712
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,040
Not like shutting down because Lardell is the only customer.

713
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,960
Uncle Sam's Jams, that's an institution.

714
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,200
Little disappointed it is not a jelly retailer.

715
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,360
But you don't always get what you want.

716
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,040
Knowing Louisville, it should be like a musical instrument

717
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,640
and jam retailer.

718
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,320
Here's my point.

719
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,560
I now know more about Lardell than I do about either of you.

720
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,360
Fair enough.

721
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
I keep it pretty close to the vest.

722
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,960
Maybe it's just that the shit that he is into

723
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,320
is so much more interesting than the shit

724
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,240
that I know that you guys are into.

725
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,080
And Lardell, I got to tell you, buddy,

726
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,880
I think you only need like two or three things.

727
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,160
Oh, maybe that's the problem.

728
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,480
Maybe he's got so many things going

729
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,640
that it makes everything else seem bland.

730
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,440
Whittle it down.

731
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,000
Pick three of the things.

732
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,360
Underground hip hop, thick and sexy women,

733
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,040
Faith Evans, wax products, dusty groove,

734
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,400
Louisville Cardinals, Pittsburgh Steelers,

735
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,000
music is my drug, Snickers, talk radio,

736
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,920
I love to draw, chili cheese dogs.

737
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,480
Oh, I'm sorry.

738
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,360
There's no space in there.

739
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,880
He loves to draw chili cheese dogs.

740
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,720
I would say thick and sexy women, talk radio,

741
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,920
and I love to draw because-

742
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,160
But I mean, you left out Michael Jackson,

743
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,000
you left out Bernie Mac, you left out R.E.P. Biggie Smalls.

744
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,960
But hear me out.

745
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,640
Just by adding a couple words,

746
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,160
by adding a couple words,

747
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,480
I like to draw thick and sexy women

748
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,840
that are on talk radio.

749
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:06,980
Okay.

750
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,160
That's a conversation opener.

751
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,960
I'm starting to worry that I'm not as multifaceted

752
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,760
as I should be.

753
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,880
I'm starting to think that maybe I need to-

754
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,040
Certainly not as multifaceted as Lardell.

755
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,720
I'm starting to think I need to maybe sit down

756
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,800
and write down some of my favorite things.

757
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,440
I bet if you were to pick out your interests,

758
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,800
they would be as varied.

759
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,960
No, I can't even-

760
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,080
No, so you can't even pretend.

761
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,840
The problem is I like a lot of stuff a little.

762
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,280
You could combine like 20 of the things that I love

763
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,400
to equal Lardell's love of R.E.P. Biggie Smalls.

764
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,400
How do you know how deep this goes?

765
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,520
Because he's only listed about 25 things.

766
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,280
And this is it.

767
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,000
This is it.

768
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,560
This is it.

769
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,280
Are you saying to me he has zero cultural awareness

770
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,280
of if I were to be like, hey, what do you think

771
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,600
of the Iron Man franchise?

772
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,160
I have no-

773
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,800
I have no idea.

774
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,000
You know, from Marvel Comics.

775
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,680
I still don't.

776
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,600
That's kind of weird.

777
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,480
Do you watch any TV?

778
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,320
Is that the thing Bill Maher's on?

779
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
Because I know him.

780
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,280
He's one of my interests.

781
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,360
Have you seen any good movies lately?

782
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,160
Not since Bernie Mac died, unfortunately, no.

783
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,920
Hey, it looks like you might have scurvy.

784
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,440
Yeah, it's just all the chili cheese dogs

785
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,640
and Pepsi and Snickers.

786
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,360
I think my-

787
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,840
Are there vitamins in Snickers?

788
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,120
A little bit, I guess.

789
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,760
Maybe some.

790
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,520
Maybe fortified.

791
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,680
Do you want to maybe go out and have a salad?

792
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,720
I'd sal-loud.

793
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,360
Say that word again one more time.

794
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,160
Salad.

795
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:32,720
Salad.

796
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:33,940
Did I-

797
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,140
Salad.

798
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,480
I can't-

799
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,240
Doesn't seem to take.

800
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,320
Speaking of green.

801
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:55,520
L-A-R-D-E-L-L.

802
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:55,760
Yeah.

803
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,520
Because I am trying to find him on Facebook.

804
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,400
Okay.

805
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,480
Pass him around.

806
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,280
Is that why you were so quiet?

807
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,840
Yeah, I was.

808
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,920
I was Facebooking Lardell.

809
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,600
That makes sense.

810
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,000
Great.

811
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,800
The hunt is on.

812
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,560
Everyone, don't hunt Lardell.

813
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,760
Hey, you've probably tried Hulu on your computer.

814
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,040
Just type in a web address and you are there.

815
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,320
But-

816
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,280
Well, the specific Hulu web address don't-

817
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,640
It's not gonna-

818
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:20,880
Yeah.

819
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,600
Hulu Plus is like that, but better.

820
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,440
Hulu Plus is Hulu evolved.

821
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,560
It's the next levolution of Hulu.

822
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,160
It's got all currencies and episodes.

823
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,720
Your favorite shows like Modern Family and The Daily Show with Jonathan Stewart.

824
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,080
And they've got every episode of South Park, which is a Hulu Plus exclusive.

825
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,120
Is it gonna work on my Smart TVs or my Rokus or my Apples?

826
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,360
No.

827
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,200
Just kidding.

828
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,000
Yes.

829
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,040
Good goof.

830
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,680
Got me again.

831
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,320
Another great joke from my brother, my brother, and me family.

832
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:04,080
Yeah, Smart TVs, Rokus, Apple TVs, Xbox, PS4, PS3, PS2, PS1, PS5, whatever you got.

833
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,080
Gaipod first generation.

834
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,960
You got a Talkboy.

835
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,640
Load up Hulu on it.

836
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,720
That you fill the wet bandits into thinking that you're having a party.

837
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,880
You can even watch on your phone or your tablet or your train or your-

838
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,440
Sorry.

839
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,480
I mean, you're on the train.

840
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,680
You can't watch it on a train.

841
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,520
They won't project it on a train.

842
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,280
No, you have to run beside it the whole time.

843
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,560
Did you see this new episode of The Awesome?

844
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,880
And that's the train hitting you.

845
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,440
Because you-

846
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,560
Watch The Awesomes, Griffin.

847
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,240
Oh, that's an original TV show.

848
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,640
It was created by Seth Meyers and Mike Shoemaker.

849
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,760
It's an animated comedy series about a misfit group of superheroes.

850
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,680
You should also check out Hot Wives of Orlando, which is a parody of Real Housewives,

851
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,480
which stars Casey Wilson and Kristen Schaal, which they're just awesome anyways.

852
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,240
Can I make a quick recommendation, a quick for real Hulu recommendation?

853
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,600
And this is selfish because I don't want this show to go anywhere.

854
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,600
There's a show called Marry Me with Casey Wilson and-

855
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,640
Ken Marino.

856
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,440
Ken Marino.

857
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,040
It's so goddamn good.

858
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,760
It's the best new show on television and you should absolutely be watching it.

859
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,200
Oh my God, oh my God.

860
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,800
Can we get Ken Marino as a guestpert?

861
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,040
I don't see why not.

862
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,080
Is that even possible?

863
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,280
I want that so badly.

864
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,280
God, Travis, get Ken Marino.

865
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,720
You're in La La Land.

866
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,520
Go find me a Ken Marino.

867
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,680
He lives next door to me, so I'll just go talk to him.

868
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,680
Go find me a Ken Marino.

869
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,440
I tagged him so we could follow him all over the city.

870
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,200
All the episodes of that amazing show are all on Hulu Plus and we can hook you up

871
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,640
with a two week free trial if you go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

872
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,520
All one word.

873
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,880
That's a whole extra week on top of the usual bonus freebie that they give you.

874
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,480
Go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

875
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,400
All one word, two week free trial, free TV.

876
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:42,880
Go get it.

877
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,520
This week, My Brother, My Brother and Me is also supported by Harries.com,

878
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,560
which we've talked about before.

879
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,680
So by this point, you should know they revolutionize shaving.

880
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,920
They ship shit right to your door so that you don't have to go to the drugstore anymore

881
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,920
and have someone unlock that stupid case and stare at you like you're trying to steal razors

882
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,640
and they just ship it to your door and it's way easier.

883
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,280
The company makes amazing Germany engineered blades.

884
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,920
Justin, you use them, correct?

885
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,640
And you're a big fan.

886
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,080
I do.

887
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:17,760
They actually got me off of, I was using single blade razors and, you know, safety razors.

888
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,960
And they got me off of it.

889
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,080
Because you're an artisanal bartender living in Portland.

890
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,580
Got them.

891
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,600
For just $15, you get a set that includes a handle, three blades and shaving cream.

892
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,440
That's an amazing value if you think about how much you would spend at the store getting that stuff.

893
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,120
$862.

894
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,600
Correct.

895
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,800
The blades are half the price of their competitors.

896
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,720
And they even offer custom engraving if you want to get your initials engraved in the razor,

897
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,120
which is just super high class and really fancy.

898
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,400
So go to harries.com and use the promo code mybrother, all one word,

899
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,520
and Harries will give you $5 off your first purchase for all of our dear sweet listeners.

900
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,120
So you could get that whole set for $10.

901
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,560
Fuck it.

902
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,080
Do it.

903
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,560
Shave it.

904
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,000
Smooth it.

905
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,880
Smooth it out.

906
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,840
I got a message for Mirza Gulchuk.

907
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,640
I fucking crushed it.

908
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,560
I crushed the pronunciation of that name.

909
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,520
I destroyed it.

910
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,520
They did provide a phonetic spelling of it, but I still did a really good job.

911
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,240
And I waded through those choppy waters really well.

912
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,000
The message is from Jameson and I want to say-

913
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,880
Can I get a one like message of congratulations from the two of you?

914
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,600
Yeah, you did great.

915
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,800
I want to say thanks to Jameson for putting the pronunciation.

916
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,760
Very helpful.

917
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,960
Thank you.

918
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,080
This message for Mirza Gulchuk.

919
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,200
From Jameson.

920
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,920
Jameson says, you are now married.

921
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,520
Good job to you and Sarah.

922
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,960
And me, of course.

923
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,720
Now old Unky J is just waiting for you to pick out some baby names.

924
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,680
Here's a hint.

925
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,120
Just flip the open-

926
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,960
Just flip the open-

927
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,240
Guessing missed a word there.

928
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,280
That's okay, Jameson.

929
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,440
Just flip the book open to J and look after James.

930
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,200
My name is suitable for all kinds of kids, but especially smart ones.

931
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,800
Seriously, I will open a trust fund.

932
00:39:59,440 --> 00:39:59,920
There it is.

933
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,720
Now you got to do it.

934
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,040
Now you gots to do it, Mirza Gulchuk.

935
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,160
I hope Mirza and Sarah are actually planning on having a kid.

936
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,760
Otherwise, Jameson just like-

937
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,080
Jameson really, really jumped the gun.

938
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,680
Put a baby in that.

939
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,800
I have to kill my cat.

940
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,280
One sec.

941
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,520
Okay.

942
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,240
This is it.

943
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,760
And this next message is very special for a very special man

944
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,280
who's near and dear to all of us, Drew Davenport.

945
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,720
And it's from, I think it's the hacker group Anonymous.

946
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,080
Oh, great.

947
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,480
Or it might just be someone not giving their name.

948
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,440
It's one of those two things.

949
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,080
Let's go with that.

950
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,240
The message is, yo, Drew, we got your penis.

951
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,160
Yo, Drew, we got all your penis JPEGs.

952
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,400
That'll be five Bitcoins.

953
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,360
I learned that you're an awesome person.

954
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,800
And a great friend, I love hearing y'all Drew's and seeing the LED live show

955
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,000
with you was amazing.

956
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I never knew what to get you for your birthday.

957
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,160
Nor do I actually know when your birthday is.

958
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,560
So I thought a message from the brothers would be appropriate.

959
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,640
Happy birthday, Drew, whenever it happens to be.

960
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,200
Maybe this is probably somebody Drew actually knows.

961
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,280
If not, I mean, if it, regardless, it's going to drive Drew mad.

962
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,720
Him trying to figure it, trying to suss out, trying to ferret this mystery out.

963
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,440
Crack the case.

964
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,720
Somebody gaslighted him.

965
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,520
Probably, he's worth it, I think.

966
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,640
Oh, definitely.

967
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,920
He's definitely worth driving insane slowly over time.

968
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,680
Oh, I'd gaslight his brains out.

969
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,240
Oh yeah.

970
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,040
He's a great guy.

971
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,920
I would gaslight him.

972
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,960
I don't want to gaslight Drew.

973
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,240
Coward.

974
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,520
I already started for all of us.

975
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,080
So welcome to the lady to lady show behind door.

976
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,480
Number one, we have fantastic weekly guests like Aisha Tyler, French Stewart,

977
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,640
Greta and more behind door.

978
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,280
Number two, we have a special guest.

979
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,840
Behind door number two, we have road trip and sleepover games like Would You Rather

980
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,760
and Never Have I Ever, the kind of games that remind you of being a kid.

981
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,280
Door number three brings you fresh hot episodes every Wednesday.

982
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,320
You can find them on iTunes and Maximumfun.org.

983
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,280
Now pick a door.

984
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:57,920
Just kidding.

985
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,000
They're not real because we're a podcast.

986
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,200
You're all winners.

987
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,640
And we didn't really think this through.

988
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,920
Lady to lady.

989
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,760
I smoke a lot of pot, like a ton.

990
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,080
Smoke weed every day.

991
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,640
Every day.

992
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,840
Oh, it actually says, sorry, it actually said every day there.

993
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,640
I should have read ahead.

994
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:16,880
Yes.

995
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,880
I smoke a lot of pot, like a ton, every day.

996
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,800
Probably not a ton every day, but I'm also serious and I think respectable person.

997
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,080
I'm working on my second master's degree.

998
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,040
I've maintained a 4.0 GPA throughout grad school.

999
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,080
A 4.20.

1000
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,320
Okay.

1001
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,960
I see what you did.

1002
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,760
All right there.

1003
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,320
Pipe down.

1004
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,120
Smoke weed every day.

1005
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,240
Pipe down, okay.

1006
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,200
Let's calm down and hash this out.

1007
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:45,680
Stop it.

1008
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:45,920
Go.

1009
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,680
I am in a healthy long-term relationship and I still manage to have a lot of fun most of the time.

1010
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,160
Well, yeah.

1011
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,240
How can I get people?

1012
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,320
That's not it.

1013
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,440
That's not it for debate.

1014
00:42:59,440 --> 00:42:59,680
Yeah.

1015
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,560
How can I get people to take me seriously?

1016
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,080
Even though I am now and have been for a long time and probably always will be a huge pothead.

1017
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,480
That's from Seriously Stone in Memphis.

1018
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,120
I will say this question is riddled with typographical errors.

1019
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,160
I will point that out up front.

1020
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,200
Man, I got a contact high off this email.

1021
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:30,160
In this day and age, in 2014, it's a hugely stigmatized thing.

1022
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,120
I don't give a fuck.

1023
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:37,520
Yeah, especially living in LA now, I know tons of people that smoke weed all the time.

1024
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,200
Did you say astigmatized?

1025
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,600
Like it doesn't have a stigma?

1026
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,360
No, it is a stigmatized thing.

1027
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,520
It is very stigmatized.

1028
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,240
But I don't give a fuck is the thing.

1029
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,240
And I don't think you guys do either.

1030
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,080
And we represent the real America.

1031
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,200
Yeah, but there is obviously, I mean, I don't think that this person would be asking this question

1032
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,000
if there wasn't a still pervasive stigma about people who smoke a lot of weed.

1033
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,040
I think they're paranoid.

1034
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,040
I think they're paranoid about nothing.

1035
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,520
I think if I ran a small or big business and you came in and you're like,

1036
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,960
I'd like a job at Google, smoke weed every day.

1037
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,160
I'd be like, cool, weed.

1038
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,240
So what are your qualifications?

1039
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,120
Would they be blazing it in your office?

1040
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,760
Yeah, they'd be chafing a 420 right there in front of you.

1041
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,960
I would be like, I'd be like, when can you start?

1042
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,400
I don't need a bunch of uptight prudes at Google.

1043
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,920
We're trying to invent the future here.

1044
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,760
I guess that's the question for the question asker is like, is this an actual thing you're encountering?

1045
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,120
Like, are your friends in there going like, hey man, we love you, but you smoke weed too much?

1046
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,160
Or are you just assuming that everyone is thinking that?

1047
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,480
I think that's a good question.

1048
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,400
I mean, how can we be sure?

1049
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,080
How can we be sure?

1050
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,080
How can he even be sure?

1051
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,520
I think that he has enough bona fides as like a grownup

1052
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,400
that he probably should just stop worrying about it.

1053
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,320
Yeah, I mean, until you get a gig where they're gonna start drug screening you,

1054
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,320
what does it matter?

1055
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,840
Why do you have to prove yourself to anybody?

1056
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,000
You have all these other things going for you.

1057
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,920
I just don't, I don't feel like it's holding you back in your day to day life.

1058
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,880
And as such, you shouldn't let other people's perception.

1059
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,240
You know what you should do?

1060
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,160
Be a little more open about it and you can start to change those stigmas.

1061
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,200
Think about that.

1062
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,240
Hey guys, I have a confession to make.

1063
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,280
I just thought of something from dare days that I've never like fact checked.

1064
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,520
And I wonder if you guys, does smoking weed kill brain cells?

1065
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,560
Not the important ones.

1066
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,160
Just like a few old telephone numbers.

1067
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,760
But I got all that shit in my phone now.

1068
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,760
I think that that's probably where that stigma comes from.

1069
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,160
That idea of like people who smoke weed are stupid

1070
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,800
and like kill brain cells and they're all burnouts.

1071
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,920
And it's like, okay, that's not cool.

1072
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,880
That's not true.

1073
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,840
That's garbage. Say fuck you, Jim Henson.

1074
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,280
Go eat an ass.

1075
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,240
You don't know anything.

1076
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,000
Isn't that like saying that everyone who like has a beer

1077
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,320
ends up face down in a gutter, you know, throwing up on themselves?

1078
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,200
Like that's not true.

1079
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,320
That's not true at all.

1080
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:16,240
Steve Jobs drank a lot of beer and he invented the way we listen to music now.

1081
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,200
I think you're paranoid.

1082
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,560
I think you're imagining things.

1083
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,720
I want you to drink this Gatorade

1084
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:26,640
and why don't you go lie down in my room for a little while?

1085
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,760
Uh, y'all want a yahoo?

1086
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,040
Yeah, please.

1087
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,560
I hope we weren't mean.

1088
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,680
I really don't give a fuck.

1089
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,880
And I just like, I don't think anyone gives a fuck.

1090
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,680
Unless they're like 50 or 60 years old, in which case, fuck them.

1091
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,480
Uh, here is a yahoo.

1092
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,240
And it was sent in by Rachel Sperling.

1093
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,280
Thank you, Rachel.

1094
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:45,920
Crushing it.

1095
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,000
It's by yahoo answers user, Mike, who asks,

1096
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,760
how do I convince my girlfriend to stop pooping completely?

1097
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,060
Wait.

1098
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:02,880
I gotta say that I, um, Mike has asked this question before on yahoo.

1099
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,560
He's asked this question, let's just.

1100
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,400
No satisfactory answers, I'm assuming.

1101
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,720
Um, I don't want to be blue, but he's asked this question a fuckload of times.

1102
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,160
Before you clarify,

1103
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,040
I just want you to know, I don't know if he means how do I get my girlfriend to completely stop pooping,

1104
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,640
or how do I get my girlfriend to stop pooping completely?

1105
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,120
She poops all of it.

1106
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,000
You're saying she gets 60% of the way done, and is like.

1107
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
D'yup!

1108
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,120
It's like you barely swallowed me.

1109
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,440
I know there's no way the air don't poop again.

1110
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:42,720
Um, here's a, so Mike, extra details.

1111
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,600
Unfortunately, my girlfriend poops at least 20 times a day.

1112
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:50,080
My girlfriend poops at least once each day, and usually twice every day.

1113
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:50,580
Wait.

1114
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,800
Mike, those are not irrational numbers.

1115
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,520
You know what, guys?

1116
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,680
I think this is a fakey fake bullshit.

1117
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,200
Yeah, I think probably it is.

1118
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,440
Here's a yahoo, a real yahoo.

1119
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,960
Nice try, Rachel Sperling, trying to trick me.

1120
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,960
This one was sent in by Drew Davenport.

1121
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,520
Thank you, Drew.

1122
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,320
Uh, with this legit yahoo.

1123
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,800
Asked by yahoo answers user Thomas, who asks, I want to be born in 400 years.

1124
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,800
I don't like being born in the 1990s.

1125
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,440
I know I get to grow up and play with iPads and cars and stuff, but I want more.

1126
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,480
The people 500 years ago couldn't imagine having microwaves or TV or spaceships.

1127
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,920
I feel like future people will make fun of me for being primitive.

1128
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,160
I want to live in a world where I can visit grandma on Mars and be back by dinner.

1129
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,400
I want to order a hoverboard from eBay and have it delivered via drone.

1130
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,680
I want to choose what color my baby's eyes will be and if it will be a boy or a girl.

1131
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,080
I can imagine those evil bastards up now.

1132
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,520
I can imagine those evil bastards up there right now living in glass domes on the moon,

1133
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,880
looking back at us 2014 earth dwellers and our non-hovering cars and our non-robotic dogs.

1134
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,920
Wait, what?

1135
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,480
I want to be there when they announce that NASA has discovered alien life on another planet

1136
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,520
and broadcast it live on HDTVs in every home.

1137
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,400
Pretty sure they did that already.

1138
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:18,960
I want a goddamn robot hand so at the gym I can bench press 400,000 metric tons of steel,

1139
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,360
then use my jet pack to fly back to my underwater home on Venus.

1140
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,680
But now I just live in a house and go to school.

1141
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:28,720
I don't...

1142
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,200
Okay, what's this question?

1143
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:31,760
Answer his name.

1144
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:33,520
Thomas.

1145
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:42,320
The best idea that Thomas has conceived of is that in 500 years people will get together

1146
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,560
and just be like, fucking Thomas.

1147
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,000
That fool didn't have none of this shit.

1148
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,760
Look at this dip shit.

1149
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,480
Look at him.

1150
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,920
I'm just gonna put my hands on the wheel and steer this car around again.

1151
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,720
Look at this guy.

1152
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,200
If you'll flip in your holobooks to page 136, you'll see a picture of Thomas,

1153
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,440
the worst person in history ever.

1154
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,920
Now I'm looking here at Thomas's dog and it looks like this is once made out of meat.

1155
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,560
How could this be?

1156
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,360
That's correct.

1157
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:09,680
Teacher.

1158
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,120
Thomas didn't have shit.

1159
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,600
Teacher, how could this meat dog be?

1160
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,840
Now if you're gonna ask a question, raise your robot hand.

1161
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,720
Oh fuck, I punched the school part.

1162
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,120
I like that Thomas thinks that if he had a robot hand that could lift a bunch of weight,

1163
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,880
he'd still be going to the gym.

1164
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,380
Yeah.

1165
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,280
What are you doing?

1166
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,000
Are you going to build up the muscles on your robot hand, Thomas?

1167
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,520
I don't think you deserve the future.

1168
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,080
He wants big muscles to impress his Mars grandma.

1169
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,280
You're looking fit, Thomas.

1170
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,480
Thank you, Mars grandma.

1171
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,600
You're still so young and sexy, even though you're 200 Earth years old.

1172
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,040
I wish you hadn't moved to Mars.

1173
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,600
I wish you- Can I say something though, gramps?

1174
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,040
Little inconvenient for me.

1175
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,040
I mean, I do live on Venus.

1176
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,520
I guess it's on the way, but not really.

1177
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,800
It's in the other direction, isn't it?

1178
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,480
Should have thought about that.

1179
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,440
I miss you, ma.

1180
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,040
I miss you so much, Thomas.

1181
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,160
I miss you so much, grandma.

1182
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,840
I miss your sexy tone game.

1183
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,920
It's your super, super sexy legs.

1184
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,600
Robot legs.

1185
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,760
I do miss your meat legs though.

1186
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,200
Anyway, what color do you want my baby's eyes to be?

1187
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,440
We're letting you pick this week.

1188
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,200
We're being really mean to Thomas right now.

1189
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,520
How can we get him to be born in 400 years?

1190
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,640
We sound like a bunch of people from 2400.

1191
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,520
Thomas.

1192
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,320
Thomas.

1193
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,880
How can we get him born in 400 years?

1194
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,600
I was about to harangue Thomas for his inability to visualize a future more robust

1195
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:38,560
than we'll see in next year's Call of Duty game, but I'm having a hard time-

1196
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,640
Call of Duty sexy grandmas.

1197
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,720
Visit them on Venus.

1198
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:43,840
Shoot them.

1199
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,760
But I'm having a hard time visualizing a way to solve this problem for him.

1200
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,760
There's gotta be a way to solve this problem.

1201
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,320
Tar pits?

1202
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,040
A really cold room.

1203
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,120
That might work.

1204
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:01,680
I've slept in a hotel room with Justin before and he treats that thermostat

1205
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,480
like he is suspending himself or trying to turn himself into jerky or something.

1206
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:12,720
I mean, if you could get in a vehicle going fast enough, then time would move

1207
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,240
slower to you relative to the people on Earth and you could wait it out.

1208
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,800
He wants to be born in 400 years.

1209
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,920
Mm, well first you're gonna have to be unborn.

1210
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,480
Damn.

1211
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,120
How's that work?

1212
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,000
Well, it's a pretty intricate process, but basically you just gotta crawl up into a womb.

1213
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,720
What?

1214
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,480
I'm having a hard time finding a womb that can support me.

1215
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,960
Well that, I mean, that's why everyone's not doing it.

1216
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,760
Does it have to be a human womb or a gorilla's womb?

1217
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,240
I could probably find one that will find a suitable silverback.

1218
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,240
Here's the thing, Griffin, it could be a completely manufactured womb.

1219
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,560
Can you get into a blue whale's womb from a blowhole or what's this stuff there?

1220
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,120
Hey blue whale, hey blue whale, what's the story?

1221
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,160
Where does your stuff connect?

1222
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:13,440
Do I have to go through their weird stringy mouth and get fucking plankton and grill all over here?

1223
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,720
I don't want to be born in 400 years covered in plankton.

1224
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,520
Hey blue whale, what's your life expectancy?

1225
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,240
I don't want to have to hop from blue whale to blue whale.

1226
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,480
Do you live for 400 years like a tree?

1227
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,800
Oh man.

1228
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,600
What if that was the original plot of Cocoon?

1229
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,920
So all you have to do to feel revitalized?

1230
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:39,840
And then it's just-

1231
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,280
Hold on, I'm cutting a giant hole in a blue whale with a chainsaw.

1232
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:43,920
It's-

1233
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:49,200
I thought they smelled bad on the outside.

1234
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,480
So much gooshing.

1235
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,480
I thought there would be some gooshing, but this is just-

1236
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,400
This is an unconscionable amount of gooshing.

1237
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,360
And I was never allowed in a sea world again.

1238
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,440
I guess it's time for me to admit, I don't know where the whale's womb is.

1239
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,360
I just want to kill a whale.

1240
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,160
To feel alive again.

1241
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,560
I just want to feel alive, now don't you feel younger?

1242
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,280
Help me kill this whale, Steve Guttenberg.

1243
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,880
Was he in that movie or am I thinking of batteries not included?

1244
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,120
You're thinking exactly of batteries not included.

1245
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,320
We're going to get better at this.

1246
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,920
Give us a few more episodes.

1247
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,960
Give us just a few.

1248
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,600
Listen, you've been, you've stuck around for 229 trial episodes.

1249
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,800
We're going to get it together.

1250
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:42,480
I feel it, the winds, the winds, they are blowing.

1251
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,720
That's going to do it for our comedy show, my brother, my brother, and me.

1252
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:52,320
We hope that you had some salvage, some sort of pleasure from it.

1253
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,440
Just real quick to review our brand expansion.

1254
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,120
The Adventure Zone is on iTunes.

1255
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:03,520
Please go subscribe and rate and review that and tell your friends about it.

1256
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,680
Every other Thursday, we're going to be posting new-

1257
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,120
The launch of any podcast is your best shot at exposure.

1258
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,760
If you can help us spread the word about that, it would be super helpful for us.

1259
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,680
The same for Bunker Buddies.

1260
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,000
I really, really love it.

1261
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,720
I'm very proud of it and I hope you go check it out and then tell everyone.

1262
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,720
Rate, review, word of mouth is the best advertisement we have for any of our shows.

1263
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:31,200
My brother, my brother, and me, The Adventure Zone, Bunker Buddies, and Sawbones too.

1264
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,440
If you're a fan of this show and you've never listened to Sawbones,

1265
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,360
you are a crazy person and you should go check it out.

1266
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,240
My wife and I love it.

1267
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,720
We listen to it every week, Justin and Sidney host a show about all of the medical-

1268
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:42,640
What do you say?

1269
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,160
It's a marital tour of misguided medicine.

1270
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:46,720
There you go.

1271
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,000
Go check it out.

1272
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,640
It's hilarious and informative and it's really, really great.

1273
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,080
And don't forget about Big Gulp.

1274
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:53,840
It's real.

1275
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:59,040
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

1276
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,960
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1277
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:07,040
Go, go just buy that album a few times because at this point we owe them a lot.

1278
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,560
We said we would get them a lot more purchases than we've actually been able to pull off.

1279
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:14,000
So if you could just download it like 10 or 20 times, it would be super helpful.

1280
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,640
We also want to say thanks again to Hulu Plus.

1281
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,000
Hulu Plus, it's an amazing thing and if you haven't gone to check it out,

1282
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,280
then you're probably living-

1283
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,080
Of course you have though.

1284
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:22,640
What do we-

1285
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,680
Yeah, it's like, it's like 400 year from now technology just happening now.

1286
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,280
Just go to huluplus.com slash my brother and you'll get a free extended trial,

1287
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,200
a two week free trial to check out everything awesome on Hulu Plus.

1288
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,000
What are you waiting for?

1289
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,760
Is that going to do for us?

1290
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,560
Also, Candlelight tickets are still on sale.

1291
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,120
Oh, right.

1292
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,720
So go to bit.ly forward slash Candlelight's live.

1293
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,840
Tickets are only $15.

1294
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,800
There's a special deal at the Pullman Hotel where you can get $99 a night.

1295
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,200
It's a special rate, so make sure that when you contact them,

1296
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,920
tell them that you're coming in for the NBNB AM show.

1297
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,880
And if you have any questions, Candlelight related, send them to us.

1298
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,560
Make sure to put Candlelight in the subject.

1299
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,920
And if you're going to be at the show, make sure you put that in the email as well

1300
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,640
and have some questions ready for the show.

1301
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,040
And we'll probably do some audience live questions.

1302
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,680
And as long as you're, as long as you're in the ticket buying mood,

1303
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,640
there are still a few more tickets left from X Fun Con.

1304
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,760
Maybe, I don't know, we're recording this one actually pretty early, so check.

1305
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,880
Yeah, last time I checked, it was at 80% sold out, so.

1306
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,160
And this is Thursday, so God only knows.

1307
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,880
But if there are any available, you should get them because it's super, super, super fun.

1308
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,400
Last I heard from, as far as NBNB AM merch goes,

1309
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,000
if you want to get any for people for Christmas, you should order it like now

1310
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,960
because it's going to get backed up for the holiday season

1311
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,480
and you're going to want that before Christmas.

1312
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,760
So make sure you go to that now.

1313
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,520
You can go to maxfunstore.com and all of the max fun merch is there.

1314
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,400
There's sawbone shirts as well that we've got tote bags.

1315
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,680
We've got t-shirts.

1316
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,000
We've got a bunch of NBNB AM stuff, so go check it out.

1317
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,400
That's going to do us.

1318
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,040
Yeah.

1319
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,080
Final Yah Drew Nights Mystery sent in by Drew Davenport.

1320
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:04,560
Thank you, Drew.

1321
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,040
It's by Yahoo!

1322
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,560
Ancestors user Jamie who asks,

1323
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,000
did Elvis have hairy legs or smooth silky ones?

1324
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,000
I'm Justin McElroy.

1325
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,120
I'm Travis McElroy.

1326
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,240
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1327
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,080
Is Griffin my better, my brother, or me?

1328
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,600
Is Griffin my better, my brother, or me?

1329
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,000
Kiss your dad.

1330
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,160
And that's a premium swallow.

1331
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,000
I'm dead.

1332
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,120
Maximumfun.org.

1333
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,160
Comedy and culture.

1334
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,280
Artist owned.

1335
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,400
Listener supported.

1336
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,680
Hello, I'm Taco.

1337
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,880
The elephant magician.

1338
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,800
Moral High Church here, the master of clerical magic.

1339
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,280
I'm Magnus Burnside, the fighter.

1340
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,320
Did you guys like that?

1341
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,120
Did you, the listener, like that?

1342
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,160
You were just swept up in a world of high fantasy and magic

1343
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,640
where anything can happen and anything is possible.

1344
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,440
Hi, I'm Griffin McElroy, dungeon master for the Adventure Zone,

1345
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,280
a new podcast on Maximum Fun in which magic and mystery intertwine

1346
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:17,040
for a very erotically charged role-playing experience.

1347
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,480
You can catch it every other Thursday here on Maximumfun.org or iTunes.

1348
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:47,360
It's for Dungeons and Dragons, but with family.
