1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you change your mind on the first in line, honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you got no place to go when you're feeling down.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown...

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Give me what I need, what do I need? Give me the turducket, let me think. Turduck, aw yeah.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
One...

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Three, two, one, and turducket.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Turducket. It's my brother, my brother, me.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's an advice show for the modern era. I am Justin McElroy here three days out from Thanksgiving, the giving of thanks.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I am Travis McElroy, the duck in the turducken.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm Griffin McElroy, the salmonella left over in the pan.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
DJ Salmonella would be a good DJ.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It would be. Don't you think?

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So, so this is an advice show for the modern era in case you're a first timer and I know we do have some listening this very week.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So know that you are in the presence of those whose eyes, ears, hearts, mouths and throats are about to be opened to wisdom.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't, I didn't like that at all.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Every orifice open to wisdom.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I like this zero.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't like, what we're saying is we don't have enough prongs between us to fill all the orifices with wisdom.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I do not care for this one bit.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah. Do you have a crevasse that is not being filled with wisdom?

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Can you feel my wisdom inside you?

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
One, question one.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't be itchy. It's just wisdom.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Kit writes, I recently broke up with my boyfriend and I'm in a weird situation.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We dated four years and the thing is he still wants to be friends and I somehow do too.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
After breaking up, I naturally realized all the bad qualities he had.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I finally realized I'm a much better person than he is, but not being friends with him seems like it'll leave a big hole in my life.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What should I do? Is this natural?

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Like I said, this is only my second breakup.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Should I just suck it up and continue to be his friend?

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Says Kit.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, friends after the breakup.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I guess it doesn't really happen.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Here's the thing. If you try to maintain your relationship with him right now, especially right now, you're just going to fall in the same patterns.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You broke up for a reason.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Most of dating is spending time with each other, right?

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Sure.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
In theory, yeah, it works out.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You spend time with people. That's how you become friends.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But I think that you just used a phrase that's very important to this, which is you can't think of the phrase, we should stay friends.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You need to become friends because you're not friends right now.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Too true, and you can't do that right away.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There's a temptation. I get it.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They are going to leave a hole in your life, but you got to remember that that's a boyfriend shaped hole.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's not a him shaped hole.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We've talked about this before.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You don't miss the person, you miss the relationship.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You can't just have that back by being friends.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
When did we ever talk about this before?

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Did one of us write a book called Boyfriend Shaped Hole?

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That sounds like a national bestseller waiting to happen.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It does, right?

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We talked about how people don't miss the person as much as they miss the relationship.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You also need to be careful because being that close with him immediately afterwards can get in the way of you moving on.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It can get in the way of you getting over this breakup because you're seeing him all the time and still hanging out.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
All these feelings are lingering.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Cut ties till you're ready to be friends.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You don't suck it up.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
There's no rush on this.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Time is the most important thing.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You really can't rush back into any kind of relationship with him.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You got to figure out the two of you alone by yourselves and not together before you can really make any sort of dent in a friendship.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If you're a better person than him and that sort of thing, then you probably don't need a friendship with him.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I know that's kind of harsh, but he sucks, right?

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
There are plenty of people on this planet that you can be friends with.

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Like us.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We're your new boyfriend.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Well, I don't know about all that.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm your new boyfriend.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Justin McElroy, half-husband, half-boyfriend, all podcasts.

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So, hopefully that will be very, very helpful to you and I hope that that makes a lot of sense.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Now, we got another question coming from FormSpring.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
FormSpring, do want to remind you though, if you do use FormSpring, go ahead and throw a name in there even if it's a pseudonym.

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Especially if it's a pseudonym.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Especially if it's a clever pseudonym.

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Aside from getting my sexy right, how could I parlay my relationship as the smartest guy in my high school into dating successes?

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Can't.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Can't do it.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Can't do it. Gotta get rich.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Why don't you use your big brain and figure this one out by yourself there, nerdo?

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hey, boy dexter.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Hey, Quentin.

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Why don't you go ahead and use your brain juice?

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Why don't you go ahead and flex that gray matter and get yourself a girlfriend?

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're so smart.

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Nerd, figure it out.

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Brainiac.

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No, you can't though.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You can't do it though.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Can't do it though.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If girls like to be into smart guys, they wouldn't call them lonely smart guys.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Call them baseball players or something.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Unless.

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Unless.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Unless.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Your school has an awesome quiz bowl team and you can take them to state.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Quiz bowl king.

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I love it.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That addendum was unnecessary because such a thing cannot, does not exist.

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You get a quiz bowl letterman's jacket.

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't know.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Going to see the quiz bowl just really gets me quivering in my loins.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah, definitely.

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Just seeing them work it.

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's like youth jeopardy.

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Rock hard.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Rock hard.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Rock hard.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
If you could do a triple crown of quiz bowl champion, spelling bee winner, and mathlete

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
supreme, you've got it.

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Sure.

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Just wear that golden horseshoe around your neck.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yep.

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What's up?

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Now, the problem with this is, of course, you can't be attractive and be smart.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Not at your age.

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Especially not in high school.

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Nope.

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Not in high school.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Now, in college.

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
In college, you will find groups of equally intelligent people that you can mingle with

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and then you're being the leader of the pack will allow you more leverage in that department.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But in high school, that ship sailed off.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah, you are going to be, when you get to college though, you're going to be leather

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
elbow patch deep in vagina right now.

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No.

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Nope.

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The only thing I can recommend right now is to try to start practicing your acerbic

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
wit.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah.

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That way, by the time you get to college, you've got it perfected.

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Where you got withering barbs lined up.

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah.

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's the best way to go.

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Well, wait a minute.

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I mean, maybe things, it's been a while since any of us have been in high school.

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Like maybe things like, you know how you enrolled in high school or been in a high

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
school kind of lurking around enrolled and taking classes in high school.

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Appropriate high school age.

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Young people always, you know, emulate the things that they're cooler, older friends

147
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
or friends of siblings do.

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Right.

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So maybe like high school now is college for us and maybe being a, like a witty smart ass

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
is, is, you know, hot shit now.

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So what you're saying is what you're saying is now that all of us are older, too old for

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
high school, we should go back and act like we're attracted to smart guys.

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So that'll be a new thing.

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yep.

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
In high school.

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's what you're saying.

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,480
You're saying all of us should get really intelligent 17 year old boyfriends.

159
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,560
He's our new boyfriend now, not how we were his new boyfriend and he is in turn our new

160
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
boyfriend.

161
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,560
Is that what you're saying?

162
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,120
I'm having a hard time keeping up.

163
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
No, no.

164
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,120
You're right on it.

165
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
Okay.

166
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
I did understand that correctly.

167
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,440
You think we should start a new craze of being into smart guys.

168
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Yep.

169
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,040
I'm saying keeping the smartest guy in your high school because you're gonna, it's going

170
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,520
to pay dividends way bigger than, you know, awkward high school relationships.

171
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,680
You're going to go to a good college, you're going to learn a lot and you know, you're

172
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,000
just going to have, you're going to enrich yourself.

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,840
And really in the end, I just finished Malcolm Gladwell's outliers like you're just, you're

174
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
going to be the next Bill Gates.

175
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,240
I can tell form spring and you got nothing to worry about.

176
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,440
And I'm going to give just the last, last answer here.

177
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,920
Two words.

178
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,360
Weird science.

179
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
Check it out.

180
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
There it is.

181
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
I'm not going to say anything else.

182
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,680
Just check it out.

183
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
Weird science.

184
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,200
Check it out.

185
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,520
I got a Yahoo.

186
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
Check it off.

187
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,920
I actually have like nine yahoo.

188
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,200
Should we explain yahoo answers is a web service.

189
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,880
We do not solicit these questions, but we do find them kind of.

190
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:09,160
It's like kind of like a, a, um, an airdrop of wisdom that no one requested.

191
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,920
Um, here's one that was sent in by get this Leviticus Sutherland.

192
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
Yes.

193
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,320
Have you ever heard a name cooler than that?

194
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,760
I just choked on water.

195
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Sorry Max Jackman.

196
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,840
You done been bumped.

197
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
You got bumped.

198
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
No, I'm actually cool.

199
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
You're not.

200
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Could you say that name one more time?

201
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Leviticus Sutherland.

202
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Oh Jesus.

203
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
He sounds like an 18th century detective.

204
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
Yeah.

205
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
God, that's hot.

206
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,840
I want to, I want to write a book now so I can have a lead character named that.

207
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:45,520
Um, this question was asked by yahoo answers user Nat Ilf, who asked what is the heaviest

208
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,200
Babby to ever be birthed?

209
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Jesus.

210
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Really?

211
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Again with the Babby?

212
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Again with the Babby.

213
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Um, uh,

214
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,760
fucking cut it out.

215
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,720
Uh, she, she goes on to ask, I am pregnant due on Christmas and the doctors say my Babby

216
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,240
is very heavy.

217
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:08,600
I think they said he was going to be 175 pounds.

218
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,960
Can I do anything to make my Babby smaller?

219
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,880
I am really worried about the labor.

220
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,360
Bitch, you should be.

221
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,720
That's going to be a wicked labor.

222
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,920
Wow.

223
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,240
You will most certainly die.

224
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,920
Your lower section will open up, it will bloom like a flower when you pass that 175 pound

225
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
man.

226
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:34,360
Let's be honest, this guy's wearing her like an inner tube right now.

227
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,560
He's just walking around with his mom around his waist.

228
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Sure.

229
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,940
This is, it's vulgar.

230
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,600
He's already applying for jobs.

231
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
It's pretty awful.

232
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Oh God.

233
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,160
Is this like an early onset, early onset like Jack disease?

234
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,360
You think that's what's going on here?

235
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,680
You think that job market is up right now?

236
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,360
Try going in with your mom with her skin stretched out all around your, your hands and feet.

237
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,840
I see a human face sticking out of your chest, like through the skin.

238
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
What is going on?

239
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
We're both applying.

240
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,060
We're competing.

241
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,480
You hire both of us or you hire neither of us unless it's a very compelling offer.

242
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,560
And then I, I, I will consider a late term abortion.

243
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
You know what?

244
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
You know what conservatives?

245
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,320
That is one area where if you abort a full grown man, I think I can get on board with

246
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,280
you that that should be a crime.

247
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,880
When does consent, when does life begin?

248
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,000
I think once you have stubble, life is officially begun.

249
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
At six.

250
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, sure.

251
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,880
Life begins at six feet.

252
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,200
I mean, what can the, let's, let's, let's apply some, some rationale to this.

253
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Okay.

254
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
For a change.

255
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,140
What, what the fuck kind of like miscommunication has this woman had with her doctor?

256
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,940
Like is there another, like a metric, maybe 175 ounces, but even that, that's a hefty

257
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,940
ass baby.

258
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,940
Right?

259
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,940
And nobody uses numbers like that.

260
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,840
All I can think is like, how much is that?

261
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,240
How much is this car weight?

262
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,120
Like a billion grams in fluid ounces.

263
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,600
How many, how, how big's my babe?

264
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,780
How about this?

265
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:12,880
Maybe she is pregnant, pregnant in the UK and like the doctor's bill was 175 pounds.

266
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
Okay.

267
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,120
I like, I think that that could be possible except everybody in the UK knows how to think

268
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
about baby.

269
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,120
I would imagine.

270
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Oh shit.

271
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,800
Maybe this is a regional thing.

272
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,040
Maybe this is like, you know, in the land of giant hours, like they spell it wrong.

273
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
Right?

274
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
Yeah.

275
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
How bad?

276
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
I don't even care about the miscommunication.

277
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,120
Like how bad have you been at weights your whole life?

278
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,240
You don't like that doesn't immediately like, Whoa, did you say 175?

279
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,460
That sounds like, like a happy person.

280
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,240
You only weigh 130 pounds.

281
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,720
You physically can't, you physically cannot have that in you.

282
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,600
Unless her baby is composed of black matter.

283
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Like this is my baby.

284
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:01,560
Unless your baby, unless your urethra is a TARDIS, there is literally no way.

285
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,240
It's like, no, it's like the genie bottle.

286
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
You see?

287
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,960
And I just said urethra as if that was some kind of body part that's involved in the passing

288
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,520
of babies through humans.

289
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,720
That is in fact like the tube that a man's urine goes out, right?

290
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
Ladies have them.

291
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Don't ladies have them too?

292
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
I don't know.

293
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,720
You may know a doctor.

294
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,800
So the urethra is where your baby is.

295
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,440
You're going to pee out that 175 pound baby through urethra and it's going to be a worst

296
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,440
day of your life.

297
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,440
Yeah.

298
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,440
Enjoy that elf.

299
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
You're a dead woman.

300
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,560
If you want to reduce the size of your 175 pound baby, just go through a narrow doorframe

301
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,960
running really quick.

302
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,080
Should knock something off.

303
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,040
I think it would help.

304
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,740
I'm in love with a girl and I've been thinking about asking her out for a while now.

305
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,320
She is a female human, not a goose.

306
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,880
I'm about 95% sure she loves me.

307
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,160
So I know she'll say yes.

308
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,200
The only problem is my friends dislike her and they think she's ugly and they don't know

309
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,700
why I talk to her.

310
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,720
If I, honesty, so important.

311
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,800
If I date her, all my friends will surely give me hell about it.

312
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,240
Do I ask her out like I want to?

313
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,040
Do I not date her because it would make my friends happy?

314
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,040
Help me brothers.

315
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
Gmail.

316
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
Jamal.

317
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
Yep.

318
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,560
There's, there's some problems I have with this.

319
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,320
Some, some gaps I feel like are in the story that make it hard to give advising.

320
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,560
He's in love with her and yet he's been thinking about asking her out.

321
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,360
Oh, I don't know about love then.

322
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,200
That instantly makes me think that he's like 14.

323
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Maybe eight.

324
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Okay.

325
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Eight years old.

326
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Let's not despair.

327
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
And your friends dislike her because she has cooties.

328
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Yeah.

329
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:55,800
No, I, obviously if you think there's a real chance at love, real chance, then you, you

330
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
gotta take it.

331
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:04,320
It's always, if there's a number one in the, in the NBNBA book of wisdom after packing

332
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,720
bags, it's, it's if there's a chance at love, take it.

333
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,880
But I also think, I think we have an opportunity here where we get those questions where it's

334
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,640
like my friend just started dating a girl.

335
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,800
She's absolutely horrible.

336
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,160
We can't stand her.

337
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,880
Do we like, we have a chance now to look at this from the other side of the coin and say,

338
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:30,640
you know, maybe you're ignoring these things that your friends see and you're focusing

339
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,960
on the good qualities and you need to flash forward to like three months from now where

340
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,840
she ends every sentence with the word what, you know, and it's like, I can't stand you

341
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,840
anymore.

342
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,760
You're getting in on that, you're getting down on that future hypothetical time travel

343
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
train.

344
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
Yep.

345
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
I'm all about that.

346
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,040
You're saying we can stop this problem that will be a problem in the future in the past

347
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,560
as if we were from the future.

348
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,760
No, I have a huge problem with this from a sustainability perspective.

349
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,200
If people don't keep making mistakes, where do we get questions from?

350
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Okay.

351
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,920
We can't, we can't preemptively keep people from ruining their lives.

352
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,160
They got to ruin their lives and then come to us.

353
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
That's fair.

354
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
You're right.

355
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
You're right.

356
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
So do it.

357
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,200
I guess what I'm saying is go for it.

358
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:21,320
I think that you need to realize that you're, you're faced with either you lose this girl

359
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,720
or you lose your friendships because you're going in, you can't not know that your friends

360
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
don't like her.

361
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,440
Like you can't ignore that from here on in.

362
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,440
So anytime you all hang out together, you know, you, you're going to know that they

363
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,080
don't want her there.

364
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,020
But um, I will say that if your friends all dislike her and continue to dislike her after

365
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,360
you date her because they think she's ugly, fuck them.

366
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,360
Yeah.

367
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Yeah.

368
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,360
Fuck them.

369
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,600
But if your friends that's getting their smooch on and that's you going to smooch burg every

370
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,940
weekend night underneath the bleachers and what are your friends doing?

371
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,040
They're all sad reading the new Harry Potter, crying themselves to sleep.

372
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,600
And you're getting your smooch, you're going to smooch, smoochville, getting the smooch

373
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
gone.

374
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Is that what you do in high school?

375
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Yep.

376
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Smooch.

377
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
You smooch all the time.

378
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
You become the mayor of smooch town.

379
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,360
You become the mayor of smooch town and you get your smooch going.

380
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:23,760
So I guess what we're saying is, um, smoocher, yeah, just smoocher, silly smoocher, you goose.

381
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:30,400
Uh, hey brothers, hey, uh, I, I watch a lot of films and there's always someone has to

382
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,160
ruin the experience by asking questions or trying to guess the ending.

383
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,760
It is really annoying.

384
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,160
So what's the best way to shut them up?

385
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,720
God, I hate that.

386
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,680
Oh, it makes me so angry.

387
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,560
I wish I knew.

388
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,280
As fun as growing up, our dad used to do this thing where he didn't guess the ending, but

389
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,320
he would just go, ah, and nod his head about like 15 minutes into the movie.

390
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,880
And like, I knew that he had just figured out what was going to happen 15 minutes in

391
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,640
and I'd be sitting there going, what?

392
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
What did I miss?

393
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
What is it?

394
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
What?

395
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,920
Oh, and then the whole movie, I was just trying to figure out how my dad was so much smarter

396
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
than I was.

397
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
Yeah.

398
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
Hey, it's uncanny.

399
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:16,960
Um, now as far as actually, uh, God, that's so tough because it's hard to not do it and

400
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,200
not look like a, a jerk hole to say like, excuse me, whatever you're saying, this movie

401
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,080
is more important, but I think you have to do it once or else you're going to live your

402
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
life like that.

403
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,680
Well, and also this is really one of those, this is one of those situations that can only

404
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
be fixed.

405
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:39,200
I rarely, if ever condoned this, this approach, but you got to be as passive aggressive as

406
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,280
humanly possible about it.

407
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,080
Because if you come out, then you're a jerk who ruined movie night.

408
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:52,200
Um, but if you, if you sigh like really hard when they ask questions, but not too hard,

409
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
I got it.

410
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
I got it.

411
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
I got it.

412
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
I got it.

413
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Keep the remote control in your hand.

414
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,280
And when, as soon as they start talking, pause it and give them their give them your full

415
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,280
attention.

416
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,360
Because in a movie theater, like this isn't a movie night.

417
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,000
This is like out in public paid for a ticket movie theater.

418
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,760
The power of a withering glance can not be ignored.

419
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,280
Like if they're sitting right behind you, just do a slow burn around, stare them full

420
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,360
in the face and then turn back around.

421
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:27,560
Is there anything more infuriating than, than infractions on, on like movie going etiquette?

422
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
No.

423
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,440
That is the most frustrating thing on the planet.

424
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:37,440
I went to see the new Harry Potter movie yesterday and sat next to, um, this irresponsibly overweight

425
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,440
family that would like, would not budge when I had to go use the restroom.

426
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,920
Cause that movie is four days long.

427
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,680
Like I had to use the restroom because I'm a human and I process fluid and food through

428
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,400
my body and sometimes I have to go through the bathroom and these fuckers like wouldn't

429
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,680
move their legs for me.

430
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:00,100
Like just looked at me, like just kept their big, horrible fat shanks.

431
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,160
Like just sticking out in the aisle, like climb them.

432
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,260
Like I was in fucking football training camp and then like would not stop talking throughout

433
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,160
the movie, but not saying anything insightful.

434
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,660
But like a character would die and they'd be like, really?

435
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,480
What are you adding to my experience?

436
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:23,120
Other than I guess increasing my dexterity by not moving your big stupid trunks, it makes,

437
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,360
I'm still angry about it.

438
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,840
I've been angry about it for 48 hours.

439
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Here's what you do.

440
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,480
You're next to a fat person, shut up, just lean over halfway through the movie and say,

441
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:38,860
if you say one more word, I'm going to slit your throat open and drink your neck, drink

442
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,200
your fucking neck jelly.

443
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
You weirdo.

444
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,760
Oh God, that's irritating.

445
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:51,160
I would rather, I would rather hang out with racists and people who cut line in traffic

446
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,840
than people who talk in movie theater.

447
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,940
It's just so clearly not what you do because it's self-centered.

448
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,680
It's like, it's ignoring everyone else's experience.

449
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
Yep.

450
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,680
Exactly.

451
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
Exactly.

452
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,480
It's convincing yourself that you're the only person on earth having an experience.

453
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Cause you know it's annoying.

454
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,080
Like there's no way you can ignore the fact that you're interrupting everyone else's experience,

455
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,120
but you're just like, fuck it.

456
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,400
I paid for a ticket too.

457
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,920
Yeah, but so did all those people.

458
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,360
You have just ruined like $20 for everyone in the theater.

459
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,920
We're not really helping.

460
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
I know.

461
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Um.

462
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,000
We're commiserating, which is a way of helping.

463
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It is.

464
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,240
Sometimes it's all you need.

465
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
That is annoying.

466
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,240
You know what?

467
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,720
If, if, if someone is talking and you can tell people around you are getting irritated,

468
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,040
stand up and say, shut up.

469
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Yeah.

470
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,440
We're watching a movie and you will be a hero.

471
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,000
Cause the thing is just know that everyone in the theater is thinking the exact same

472
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,640
thing and wishing someone would say something and, but like, everyone's like, I don't know.

473
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
I don't.

474
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,320
And if you say it, you are going to be met with silent applause.

475
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
Yeah.

476
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
Cause they don't want to disrupt the movie.

477
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,320
Yeah.

478
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,700
But then you read those, those things in the newspaper.

479
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,480
It's like, man gets stabbed to death with like trimming, like hedge trimming scissors

480
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,680
in a movie theater because he stood up to the theater bully.

481
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,800
Like it happens because it's dark and anonymous and you could just, you can just stab people

482
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
to death in there.

483
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
And like, it doesn't matter.

484
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
That's why everyone's so afraid.

485
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
That's why nobody speaks up.

486
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,600
Griffin, can I tell you something right now?

487
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
And you know, I love you.

488
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
You're my brother, my blood.

489
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
I love you.

490
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,040
Are you going to make fun of me for saying head shearing trimmer and scissors?

491
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,040
Cause I couldn't think of what they're called.

492
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
No.

493
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,040
I want to tell you later.

494
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Remind me after the show.

495
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
I'll do that.

496
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
Right now.

497
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,760
I need to tell you that you're letting the terrorists win.

498
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,760
Wow.

499
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,960
But it's not terrorists, Justin.

500
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
They aren't.

501
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
No, they're terrorists.

502
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
It's you and me.

503
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
It's, it's you.

504
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
It's not you and me.

505
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,720
Cause obviously we have sense in our goddamn heads, but like it's people like you and me.

506
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,040
It's Americans.

507
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,640
People who talk in a movie theater, someone stands up to them and then they kill them.

508
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,640
They're a terrorist.

509
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,640
That's what they're doing.

510
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:50,160
They're striking fear for all those people who, who, uh, want to talk in movie theaters.

511
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,280
Now they get a free pass cause some dumb ass killed somebody one time.

512
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,280
Yep.

513
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
It's more than you know what?

514
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Oh shit.

515
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,280
Equal and opposite reaction.

516
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,280
You gotta kill somebody.

517
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,040
Somebody for talking in a movie theater.

518
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,840
The fear will balance out the fear.

519
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,840
That's fair.

520
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,840
Yeah.

521
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,880
And I also tell you, if you do a movie night at home and you kill the first person, I guarantee

522
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,400
you won't have that problem anymore.

523
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,800
No more movie nights for you.

524
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Yeah.

525
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,640
See this, this whole thing was panning for gold.

526
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,120
You thought we weren't going to help this person when we did kill them, kill the person

527
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
who talks.

528
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Yeah.

529
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
Yeah.

530
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
Murder time.

531
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
Yeah.

532
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
And nobody talks in jail in movies cause they're in the movies at jail.

533
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
That's a fact.

534
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
Yahoo answers.

535
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
Yahoo answers.

536
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,480
This one was sent in by Clayton A. Yahoo answers user Joe asks best for loco flavor.

537
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,560
I feel like it's time for us to address this.

538
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
Okay.

539
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,800
Uh, Joe asks, so I just darn a cranberry lemonade and then a blue raspberry and then

540
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
a watermelon.

541
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,080
I'm about to drive to the store to get another.

542
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,080
What flavor should I get?

543
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,080
How about hospital flavor?

544
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,080
Dead.

545
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,080
Flavor of what?

546
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,080
Dead.

547
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
Yeah.

548
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
For loco.

549
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,080
Travis, do you not, are you not?

550
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,080
Are you liking a bubble?

551
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
What is that?

552
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,080
Are you a bubble boy?

553
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
Apparently.

554
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,880
For loco is like, um, I don't know, locally we have sparks.

555
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
I don't know if you.

556
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,480
Oh, it's so much worse than that though.

557
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,480
Is it worse than sparks?

558
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
Yeah.

559
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
It's like that.

560
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,860
They just, the FDA just said their for loco is illegal.

561
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,000
People call it a blackout in a can.

562
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Oh.

563
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah.

564
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Um, we make a beverage.

565
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I don't know if we've talked about it on the show before.

566
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,320
The trash, the trash.

567
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
I'm almost afraid.

568
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,320
I'm afraid to talk about it.

569
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
Griffin.

570
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
I'm afraid to unleash.

571
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,840
I feel like we shouldn't, like we almost shouldn't talk about it because we're going

572
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,120
to get imitators and then someone will almost certainly die and then that shit will be on

573
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,120
us.

574
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,960
Um, anyway, hypothetically, but not, not encouraged to do this.

575
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,040
Don't do it at all, but it's really cheap and it gets you real fucked up.

576
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,600
Uh, you take a 40 ounce of malt liquor, drink it to the label, refill it with an energy

577
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
beer and then you drink that whole thing.

578
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,040
You drink the entire production.

579
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,880
It costs you like $6 and six years of your life.

580
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
Yeah.

581
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,320
It, it, I, I imagine it's the same thing as a four loco, but I can't imagine anything

582
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,920
being more, um, I don't know, horrible than a trash monkey.

583
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:11,320
So that's why I don't, I don't buy into this whole four loco fervor.

584
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:17,720
Let me tell you though, that a trash monkey, it sounds gross and it is, um, but I am a

585
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
gentleman with a strong.

586
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
Is it racist?

587
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

588
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
It's beautiful.

589
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,200
Um, I am a man with a strong tolerance.

590
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,440
I can't handle two of them.

591
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,720
Like two of them puts me on my ass.

592
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,000
Like you only need one.

593
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,320
It's the most beautiful drink.

594
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,480
Don't ever drink it.

595
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,480
Don't do it.

596
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,480
Don't ever drink it.

597
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,480
In fact, don't drink four loco.

598
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,540
Don't drink Sparks.

599
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,540
Don't drink.

600
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,520
I've never understood the logic of an energy beer.

601
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,080
Like man, I don't want to get real fucked up and also real coherent.

602
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:55,720
I like the thing about it is that your body has one defense against not drinking itself

603
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,040
to death and that's sleepy time.

604
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:03,720
It's your, it's your body say wrestling you to the ground saying, all right, dummy, we're

605
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
done.

606
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
The night is over.

607
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,760
And four loco like disengages that whole situation.

608
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,040
It's taking the safety off.

609
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
Yeah.

610
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
It's not good.

611
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,640
You know what else disengages that whole situation?

612
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
Cocaine.

613
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,440
Like this, it's six in one half dozen in the other, except one has kind of a fun name.

614
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,440
That's true.

615
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,840
Like cocaine is a fun name.

616
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
It is a fun name.

617
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
It's fun to say.

618
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm going to drink just, I think that you guys need to start taking care of yourselves

619
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,920
and by you guys, I mean anyone's who's ever drank a four loco.

620
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,300
You're better than that.

621
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,300
You're better than that.

622
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:46,080
Like drinking is such a wonderful experience that that is classy and like, I feel like

623
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,720
this is the complete like opposite of classy.

624
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,720
Sometimes things go bad when you're drinking all night and it's like, oh man, that didn't

625
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
go so well.

626
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
Most of them you have a great experience.

627
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:04,920
You have a bad experience, but like four loco is like actively saying like, this is going

628
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
to be a disaster.

629
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
Like this is going to be a wreck.

630
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
This is going to be a bad night.

631
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,560
It seems like the kind of thing that if you were with a friend, they should be honor bound

632
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,560
to smack it out of your hand.

633
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
Yeah.

634
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,960
Don't let your friends, don't let friends drink.

635
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Four loco.

636
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
Four loco.

637
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
They stop them.

638
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Unless they're like party friends.

639
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Unless they want to get down.

640
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,520
Like if you want to get down, if you want to get down, fuck it.

641
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,640
Let's do some whippets and headbutt each other, but like let's not waste money on four loco.

642
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,040
Let's fucking put some football helmets on and hit each other with bowling pins to mix

643
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
it up.

644
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Yeah.

645
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
Chop it out.

646
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,040
And do whippets.

647
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
God damn it.

648
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
I need a whippet right now.

649
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
How about instead of a whippet.

650
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,040
Why do you want a dog?

651
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,160
I can give you a question.

652
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,480
Many of our good friends have been getting engaged recently.

653
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,840
I'm happy for them, but the idea of being engaged right now really freaks me out.

654
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,040
I'm in a relationship and my boyfriend has started talking about us getting engaged.

655
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:02,000
I've explained my commitment phobia, but I fear he will ask soon anyway.

656
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
That's real love.

657
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I love him.

658
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
So I should.

659
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,880
Should I say yes, even though I'm terrified?

660
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
Potential runaway bride.

661
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Gmail.

662
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,000
Oh, that's good.

663
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,400
That's encouraging.

664
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,160
This question confuses me.

665
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
What's that?

666
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Well, just because, like, it seems like she doesn't understand the commitment she's making

667
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,320
while stating she's afraid of commitment.

668
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,480
Like if he asked, should I just say yes, even though I don't really want to know.

669
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,680
It's a pretty big deal to say, yeah, like you fully shouldn't do that.

670
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,080
Like, yeah, definitely not that.

671
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,080
It's not like a placeholder bookmark that you can back out of later, you know, just

672
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,500
like, yes.

673
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,560
She's not saying she doesn't want to, though.

674
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,900
She's saying she's terrified.

675
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,600
You can be terrified of things that are good for you, like the dentist.

676
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,320
I think you need to walk this whole idea back and figure out what it is that's scaring you

677
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,600
so much.

678
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Because you know what?

679
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:05,040
It may be that you just, I'm not going to cast aspersions on your relationship.

680
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,100
This person may be great.

681
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,840
It may be that you're not looking forward to spending a lifetime with them.

682
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,840
That may not be it.

683
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,720
There are many reasons you could be terrified.

684
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:21,360
But just to be sort of randomly terrified of it, like to just be scared of commitment

685
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:27,160
without a real reason to, may mean that there's something else going on in there, in the old

686
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
heart.

687
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
What if it's simpler than that?

688
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,720
What if she just sees her friends getting engaged?

689
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,720
A great deal of my friends have gotten engaged this past year, like a lot of them.

690
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,640
I would say probably 90% of my high school graduating class.

691
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:46,280
And I see them together, I'm like, that's such a wicked bad idea.

692
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,520
Not the idea of getting engaged in general, but just you two together, nuh-uh.

693
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,360
The worst idea.

694
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,520
So maybe you're afraid that people will look at you like that, or maybe you're all afraid

695
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,140
you'll be like that.

696
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:05,080
Which I guess makes sense, you just got to be confident in your own and what you got

697
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,560
going and can't compare it to your friends.

698
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,560
I would say don't let that factor into it at all.

699
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,220
Don't let the idea that all of your friends are getting engaged, don't let that.

700
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,640
That has absolutely no bearing on your situation.

701
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,640
I think step one is you need to talk to your boyfriend and be like, hey, straight up, remember

702
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,200
two weeks ago when I said that I wasn't ready to get engaged?

703
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,580
Keep that in mind, that hasn't changed.

704
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,640
That is not something you need to bring up again right now.

705
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,720
I'll let you know when the time is right, but it is not now.

706
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:39,800
This is one of those weird situations where you having that fear should sort of preclude

707
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,360
the discussion.

708
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,720
If you're terrified of commitment and you express this to your BF and he still asks

709
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,360
you to get married, that may not be, he may not be ready.

710
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,440
That may not be the relationship you need to be in, because that's like, it's hard

711
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,440
being married.

712
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,120
Even if you love each other, it's tough, and that's not a good start to say, I really

713
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
don't want to do this.

714
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,120
Well, I do, so now you have to.

715
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,200
That's not a good start.

716
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:16,280
And plus, if neither of you are going anywhere, he might, here's probably what happened.

717
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,280
Everyone was getting engaged.

718
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,360
He brought up the idea of being engaged.

719
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,200
You backed off a little bit, so now he's even more freaked out, so he's trying to hold

720
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,760
on tighter.

721
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,640
He might force the issue because he's afraid of losing you, because all of a sudden you

722
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,880
weren't so down with the idea of being engaged, so you probably just need to make it clear

723
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,540
to him that it's not a reflection of the relationship between you two.

724
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,760
It's you and it's issues you have to work out on your own, so that he's not freaked

725
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
out.

726
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,440
Yeah, I sense from this email that you guys love each other.

727
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
I can tell that.

728
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,920
I sense a love there, but it sounds like you guys are one good long conversation away from

729
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,260
getting this sorted out.

730
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:01,200
It's like a convo needs to take place.

731
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,520
If it's not going to work out, there's always Griffin.

732
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,360
I can give you his phone number.

733
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,680
He's super nice.

734
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,960
Please ladies.

735
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
Ripe for the picking.

736
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,960
Ripe for the picking.

737
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,880
Like a delicious cherry.

738
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,440
One might even say over-ripe.

739
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:25,280
One might say he's developed some tendencies during his year of solitude that maybe are

740
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
not so attractive.

741
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,680
Maybe a few bruises on the fruit.

742
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:39,640
Maybe my rind is a little moldy, figuratively and literally.

743
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
Ladies are guys.

744
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
Ladies.

745
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
Line forms to the left.

746
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,280
Yeah, I'm not so picky anymore.

747
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,280
Just anybody.

748
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,840

749
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,840
Matchmaker.

750
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,840
Matchmaker.

755
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,160

Any tips that will result in the least amount of tears or tears tears because if it's tears

758
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:28,240
a mbnbm rule to live by if you are still getting allowance you don't have to be worried about

759
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:34,400
saving that is correct um in fact you don't have to worry about shit everything's awesome

760
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,920
you're eight just chill for a while just chill out you don't need to say you know i would

761
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:43,640

765
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,000
down on ira you're never too young never too young grace i don't think you're eight but

766
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,200
i seriously this is not a joke if you're getting allowance you don't need to worry about saving

767
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:12,560
you need to blow it buy some like on whippets you're young you'll recover eight i started

768

whippets when i was eight yeah wait unless you're trying to save up for like some awesome

769
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,800
purchase like you're saving up to buy a tv for your room or something no fuck it no fuck

770
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,120
it because you could wait 10 weeks and get that tv or you could have 10 straight weeks

771
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:32,160
of nothing but whippets and bubble tape don't say bubble tape flavored whippets don't save

772
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,200
money uh because if you want things just get them what if you save your money to get hit

773
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,360
by a truck i was gonna say this because of people saving that the economy is going downhill

00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:46,440
we gotta spend spend spend yeah great spend money like you were dying grace you're the

775
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:54,760

776
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:03,840
prosperity and and america is the zippo that's gonna set you on fire yeah so grace in closing

777
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:10,600
set yourself on fire set yourself on fire and spend all your money or set your money

778
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:17,200
on fire there it is there it is hey when did our podcast turn into mad money when people

779
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,320
started asking us questions about money it's their problem ask here's the question we need

780
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,840
to get should i ever ask you guys about money answer no there's your you know i have actually

781
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,400
been so excellent with money since i moved to chicago do you guys want to know my secret

782
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:37,380
tell me anytime i have the opportunity to spend money i say nah and i i do something

783
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:42,480
else instead okay i like that yeah it's just many people like hey how do i drink less soda

784
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,360
it's pretty cool actually um you don't drink soda anymore okay it is that easy it really

785
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,800
is grace i mean if you're really serious about saving money take half the money you get and

786
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,000
put it in a shoe box or a hundred percent of it just it's gone you never got that money

787
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,300
yeah when when you see something you want think do i want this or do i need it and say

788
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,520
well i'll leave it here now and if i still want it in like three days i'll come back

789
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,960
and buy it and by that point you've forgotten about it yeah i you know another good one

790
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,720
that works when you're at a store and you want something think to yourself it's probably

791
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,040
cheaper on the internet i'll buy when i get home then you want to think about it again

792
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:25,680
you won't or just shoplift just take it or take as you want how about this you get like

793
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,440
we'll say 20 for for your allowance right you spend five of that on one whip it okay

794
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,360
and you do it you do all of it really fast and then you will literally forget about the

795
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:41,760
other 15 okay because that part of your brain will be there do you guys know how many problems

796
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,000
can be served with the the liberal application of whip it the thing is it's important you

797
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,200
gotta be thinking about the 15 as you do the whip it right it's like eternal sunshine of

798
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:56,000
the spotless mind i got you got you the whippets hey do you guys know that i don't know what

799
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:06,680
a whip it is moving on um my 21st birthday is a few months away i'd like to throw a fun

800
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,440
party but i don't drink and i'd rather not have people drinking at my party what are

801
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,800
some fun ideas for a sober 21st sincerely the life of the party does this person not

802
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,400
understand that when you when you turn 21 that's the day that you're allowed to drink

803
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:29,920
right here's a fun idea do some drinking just get some four locos and some trash monkeys

804
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,160
and then just like just get it all out of the way in one night i i would love to like

805
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,780
actually give a real answer i mean but besides like board games but even board games are

806
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,840
more fun when you get a little tipsy and everyone gets stupid i mean like a good answer it's

807
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:56,080
like saying uh i came downstairs uh on december the 25th and my christmas tree was ablaze

808
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,640
and all my presents were ashes how could i have a fun christmas like you can't you can't

809
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:08,320
because here's the thing and you are an adult now and it's time to have some adult fun when

810
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,200
you turn like 40 yeah you can you can kick it and you can be like i don't want to drink

811
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:18,220
anymore i'm old but right now part you if there are people at your party that wish they

812
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:26,560
were drinking you have a bullshit party wait okay it's not a good party just you gotta

813
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,440
not have a party you can't listen you can't have a party it's gonna be so depressing you

814
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,120
can't do it i feel like i feel like we need to be more clearly spoken because it sounds

815
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:44,800
like we're saying hey pussy like grab a beer pussy um which we're not but you can't i don't

816
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,280
know it would be a bad idea for you to throw a 21st birthday party and then forbid people

817
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,560
to drink that's exactly what you you don't have to drink like whatever if you if that's

818
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,320
not your scene that's totally awesome um you know stand stick stick by your guns uh but

819
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,240
i don't know i think it would be a little it's like having a pudding announcing you're

820
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:10,240
having a pizza party and then not allowing anyone to eat pizza because not every party

821
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,360
has to have booze at it but when you announce it's your 21st birthday there's a connotation

822
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:22,160
to that where everyone goes turning 21 and then you're like no dbyob don't bring your

823
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:28,240
own booze and that's sad that is depressing for everyone it's like it would be like having

824
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,920
a quinceanera without a nice dress or any waltzes how many of us can we turn out it's

825
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:41,460
like having um oh come on come apparently exactly that many apparently it's like having

826
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:47,320
a dirt bike rally without any dirt bikes yeah sure yeah um it's like having a john cougar

827
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:54,440
melon camp listening party and then not allowing anyone to wear any denim yeah it's like it's

828
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,480
like making a bunch of jokes about whippets and not knowing what whippets are what a whip

829
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,560
it is it's basically like that i think you just need to ask yourself why you don't want

830
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:09,880
people drinking at the party because you you can you can do that you can have a party and

831
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,220
police it and be like hey you you know you you're a little you're maybe a little tipsy

832
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:20,520
so don't um you know don't have any more but i can see if it's your 21st you don't want

833
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,680
a bunch of people doing something that makes you uncomfortable it's their pride it's their

834
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:29,800
birthday i have an answer laser tag that's what i was just about to say go to a place

835
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,840
that doesn't allow drinking and then my mind went to billy bobs and then my mind went to

836
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,880
laser tag that's fucking incredible laser tag and then my mind went to tackling eight

837
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,680
year old kids and saying who's who's the man now dog sure um get drunk on laser tag prowess

838
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:48,400
yeah um or you could do like a fancy dinner at a fancy restaurant where people could drink

839
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,120
if they wanted to but it's not at your house you're not throwing the party so it doesn't

840
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,320
matter to you if people are drunk at a restaurant because nobody gets drunk at a restaurant

847
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:44,240
it is a major issue that is the issue it is the the the pre-eminent issue of our time

848
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:51,040
is that is that thing you said aka inverted nipple did you guys know that that is an alternate

849
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:59,360
name that we can call this aka my time alone aka shy nipple shy nipple come on out oh hey

850
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:07,560
um hey it's it's basically like my situation is like uh areola and then a basin like a

851
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:14,200
basin in the middle i've got a concave nipple kind of deal you could eat cereal out of it

852
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,680
is that normal i have one more crevice for the guys for my brother my brother made to

853
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:25,040
fill with wisdom right now any nipple a nipple and there's nothing's coming there it's just

854
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:32,440
an any nipple uh in how much of a turn off is it i think that it's i think that it's

855
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:39,800
not a turn off so much as it is uh fraud it is a fraudulent uh relationship that you've

856
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,400
entered into this gentleman he will have you tried in a federal court of law i want you

857
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,080
guys to follow me on this okay the only way to combat a turn off is with a turn on and

858
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:54,600
nothing is sexier than confidence my advice is to walk up to someone in a bar say hey

859
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,520
my name is tanya i have one inverted nipple what's up what's up what's up you don't believe

860
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:05,840
me click click booyah um play your cards right say say play your cards right maybe you'll

861
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:13,240
find out if i'm lying and then that that evening you will confirm that you were not lying um

862
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,280
yeah build a mystery around it that's that's the best yeah that's the best when you take

863
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,920
off your shirt look down and scream where'd it go whoa get out of here he's nervous no

864
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,760
one will ever love me and then you'll make that person be like well it's not so bad and

865
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,800
then you're like well it's like now you're mine now you've already been committed to

866
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:39,520
me um it's very bad it's a very bad thing it's a very bad thing um can i can i bust

867
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:46,200
out some of the responses yeah please yeah um winky emoticon face okay uh which is not

868
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:52,180
like spelled out it literally is one uh responded if he loves you he won't care if he doesn't

869
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:58,240
love you he will it seems like kind of a binary like i don't think that this is a black or

870
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,160
white issue i think that there can be degrees of grayness um in between it's got to be some

871
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,880
weird beard fantasy right like it's got to be somebody who's like i love it i hate when

872
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,800
girls have two that stick out i want to retch or when they have two that go in but when

873
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:25,000
they're one in one like husky eyes yeah i want i have you considered wearing a patch

874
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:32,640
over that one so when things get really intimate you're like you lift it up how about that

875
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:40,920
how confused is that baby gonna be how confused is her baby gonna be so hungry so hungry but

876
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:46,200
it's actually drawing milk out of me i it's it's like it's gonna be like the the uh el

877
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,340
ranchero near my house like no matter how hungry you are it never seems like it's open

878
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:59,000
you know keep coming back it's like again really what am i gonna do god uh it just most

879
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:06,080
importantly don't get aroused because it'll probably stop your heart yeah your nipple

880
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,600
is attached to a lot of important organs yeah you'll stop your heart uh you will you will

881
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:19,320
have to go to a hospital for a dead um how much of a turn off is it for guys i'm i pulls

882
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:25,800
a nipple a nipple's a nipple right i mean no matter how fucked up it is yeah no matter

883
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:31,520
how a boob's a boob's a boob i mean the guy is going to be he probably won't notice the

884
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,920
first time i mean god love him guys aren't the smartest um it's probably not going to

885
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,600
be that big of a deal as much as a production we've made out of it um i mean now that we

886
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:48,000
know though like if i ever if i ever saw it um i'm sure that that would be a very sensitive

887
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,920
that's a sensitive moment when you first see someone um naked that you probably don't want

888
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,920
their immediate reaction to be what you need to get a tattoo under that nipple that says

889
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:09,920
not an exit or or just like just it says deal oops that or like build it up like boy you're

890
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:16,680
not gonna believe what i've got for you like nothing you know in some cultures you've been

891
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:25,160
with the rest now be with the inverted nipple which is what i'm packing i i ruin which one
