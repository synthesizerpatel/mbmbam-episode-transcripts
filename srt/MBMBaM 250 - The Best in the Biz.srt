1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:01:02,000
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for joining us today for a very special

6
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:10,000
My Brother, My Brother, and Me, episode 250. A very important episode in the lifetime of any

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,840
podcast, and here we are, having our midlife crisis. I'm your youngest, babiest brother, Griffin

8
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,080
McElroy, joining me my two dear brothers. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I didn't know

9
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:32,400
we were doing something. And singing for us is Babs herself, Barbra Streisand. We managed,

10
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,320
we called up Babs. I was like, I need you, and she's like, what is it, podcast episode 250?

11
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,480
And I was like, yep, and she's like, the third one this week. Standard rates, free, here I come.

12
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:49,520
Making my entrance again with my you. Here come the Babs. Justin's around here somewhere.

13
00:01:50,800 --> 00:02:00,080
Hey guys, what a pleasure it is to be on this special episode of My Brother, My Brother,

14
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:11,760
My Brother, Me. My fault, I feel. I thought you want what I want. I'm sorry, my dear.

15
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:24,800
But where are the clowns? Big finish. Send in the clowns. Did we get clowns? Don't bother. Oh.

16
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:37,120
Okay. They are here. I love that we're making a big deal out of episode 250. Maybe

17
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,520
next year. I love they're making such a big deal out of episode 250 when we have completely fucking

18
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:52,960
dropped the ball on so many other celebrations. April 11th, 2015 marked the five-year anniversary

19
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,160
of My Brother, My Brother, Me. Totally slept on it. We just missed it. Five years of goofs,

20
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,400
and we just, I mean, we whiffed it. No, I remembered. I spent the day staring into a mirror

21
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,880
and just drinking whiskey as I glared upon what five years of the weight of this show had done

22
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:20,240
to my body. What are we talking about? Oh, it's bad. It's like, you eat a lot of fried chicken wings,

23
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,320
and I think that that maybe has a more detrimental effect than our-

24
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:32,160
When I started this show five years ago, I was a beautiful young man. Some people said

25
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:41,360
God-like features. But like the traditional sort of vision of God as an old bearded man.

26
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,080
Yeah, but like beautiful in that way where you look at him and be like,

27
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,560
that's a beautiful young old God. Sort of like how John Lithgow is beautiful.

28
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,920
Yeah, but now I'm more like John Lovitz. Beautiful, but like in a different way.

29
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,960
I'd like to make a point, by the way, that had we done a fifth anniversary observation,

30
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:06,320
this is the entirety of what it would have been. Five years is 260 weeks. In that five-year period,

31
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,200
we produced 247 episodes of My Brother, My Brother, Me, and the Vice Show for the Maldonera.

32
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:19,440
That is a miss of 13. That is 13 missed weeks. I think for five years, that's pretty good.

33
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,560
That's pretty fucking good.

34
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,320
This is my challenge to you, the listener. Find another podcast with that hit rate,

35
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,000
and I'll be impressed.

36
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,840
We're the Cal Ripken of podcasts.

37
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,160
If Cal Ripken can miss one every once in a while, we're the Cal Ripken of podcasts.

38
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,440
Do we miss any other important celebrations? Obviously, it's Thorwatch 3 with Avengers 2

39
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,800
in theaters right now, but we just didn't have time to do that, I guess.

40
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,040
Didn't do that.

41
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,920
Episode 69, I feel like we didn't really make a big deal out of.

42
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,120
Before I forget, Teresa and I went and saw Avengers 2 at 8 30 in the morning,

43
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,120
and we walked into the lobby of the movie theater. Do you know who else sees movies

44
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,480
at 8 30 in the morning? Donald Faison.

45
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,280
That's a great get.

46
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,680
Did you hit him up?

47
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,280
I didn't. I wanted to so bad, but he was mid-conversation with someone,

48
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,720
and I wanted to be cool. I wanted Donald Faison to think I was cool.

49
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,000
Man, I wish.

50
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,200
A lot of missed observations, a lot of missed celebrations. We're going to circle back to

51
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,920
some of them throughout the show as they come to us. We're not about self-adulation. I don't

52
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,640
think that's a crime. Well, I self-adulated yesterday. Wait, what are you talking about?

53
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,200
Masturbating a penis.

54
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,760
Five years more mature, ladies and gentlemen.

55
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,880
Griffin is providing a new service for our listeners that have trouble detecting dick jokes.

56
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,160
He's actually, to mark our fifth anniversary, he's actually providing a new service that is

57
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,280
not optional, that is required, where he points out dick jokes as we perform them and explains

58
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,920
them. It's boner captioning.

59
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,720
I am wondering if it's appropriate to moan slash groan in pleasure.

60
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,600
Moan slash groan in pleasure.

61
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,880
I just experienced ear shrinkage. Is that weird? My ears just sort of shrank and recoiled.

62
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,920
Griffin is referring to the way a penis will sometimes shrink and recoil.

63
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,720
As highlighted in the hilarious Seinfeld episode.

64
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,520
No, Justin, I was actually talking about my ears.

65
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:43,200
Is it appropriate to moan slash groan in pleasure when receiving a massage from a professional

66
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,400
massage therapist in a paid setting?

67
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,560
Nobody's listening to the show anymore. If you keep doing this,

68
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,880
we're going to lose every listener that we've ever had.

69
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,240
Hurry through it. Say the rest of it.

70
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,720
Okay, okay. I asked this because I was receiving a massage from my boyfriend,

71
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,560
a dedicated fan of the Bim Bam, and I asked him to buy me a real massage.

72
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,320
Then I wondered if this sort of moaning groaning you do when getting a massage

73
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,320
from a loved one is appropriate in a formal setting. Advice is appreciated

74
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,480
and needed, and that's from Pondering in Portland. This is a fucking great question.

75
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,560
This is the best question. Yeah, it's a real good one.

76
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,000
You know, because my immediate reaction was like, oh, no, no, no.

77
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,400
But then I think, like, what if it's like the massage therapist expects you to do it?

78
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,640
And if you don't do it, they're like, am I losing it?

79
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,840
Do I lose my tubs? I used to be able to rub.

80
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,600
But then again, what if you do too much? And then the masseuse is like,

81
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,040
I'll rub what she's rubbing or something like that.

82
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:43,920
I actually had a massage experience last weekend for Sydney's birthday.

83
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,040
We went to the beautiful Glade Springs Resort in Beckley, West Virginia,

84
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,040
and we got a couple's massage. And before the our. OK, first off,

85
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,640
let me ask you guys this. This is not a joke.

86
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,440
None of this is a joke, but like this is not particularly funny.

87
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,680
I'm just curious. There was a man and a woman.

88
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,160
When I saw the two of them, I was absolutely horrified.

89
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,800
We were going to be asked to choose. There is that is the Kobayashi Maru of marriage.

90
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,080
And there's no way I would have got it. It's the Kobayashi Maru of massages.

91
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,200
Whenever whenever you pick a like a preference at a new massage place,

92
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,080
like what do you want, dudes or women? And it's like,

93
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,160
well, there's no good answer to this, is there?

94
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,880
Because if I pick women, it's like women.

95
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,960
But actually, I got asked the same thing.

96
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,880
The only time I've ever had a prostate exam.

97
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,560
That's not a no. That's absolutely true.

98
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,240
And I did not know how to answer.

99
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,640
They asked if I'd rather have a male or a female doctor.

100
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,200
It's literally we just not do it.

101
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,440
It's either women or men. Like, it doesn't matter.

102
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,160
I guess that's true. It is a gender neutral.

103
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,480
Like it is the most beautiful, softest one.

104
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,560
Whichever one you pick is like, because I want it.

105
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,760
Who do you have? Who is the slipperiest?

106
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,320
Bring me a spectrum and I shall choose.

107
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,600
If Earth is ever invaded by pansexual, pangender aliens,

108
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,800
I hope we do the right thing.

109
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,080
And job one, before we ask about their technology

110
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,680
or their medical advances,

111
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,840
like we just put them to work doing massages.

112
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,840
Because that is, there is a no lose pick right there.

113
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,720
Put your weird sucker fins right on my back.

114
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,600
And this is good. I excrete a jelly through my gills

115
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,520
that it's like icy hot. You're going to love it.

116
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,320
I'm a very, very slippery alien.

117
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,800
Also, I exude the smell of lavender, so it's perfect.

118
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,640
Perfect. No, but when they, in the massage,

119
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
right before they leave the room,

120
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,400
they say, and this is a direct fucking quote.

121
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,560
Speaking of like impossible scenarios,

122
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,680
they say undress to your comfort level.

123
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,840
And then get out of the blanket.

124
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,800
And then it's like, oh, you left your boxers on? Pervert.

125
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,240
Exactly.

126
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,760
You want to be a messy underwear boy, huh? Okay.

127
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,920
Like, do you want me to be honest?

128
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,440
Because you don't need to leave the room

129
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,040
for me to address to my comfort level.

130
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,160
I'll just hop on up on that table.

131
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah. Let me just get up on this table.

132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,920
If I had, if I could reach a comfort level

133
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,720
with fewer articles of clothing before I left the hotel room,

134
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,360
I would have done just that. This is my comfort level.

135
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,520
I'm here. I'm living in it.

136
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,880
We're talking about moaning and grinning.

137
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,720
It's hard to say anything in that situation

138
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,840
without feeling like a total, total nasty boy.

139
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,440
Like a little softer. That's, it sounds like,

140
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,800
where do you want me to rub? Where does it hurt?

141
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,960
Uh, my upper thigh.

142
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,040
Like it does. I just started, I started running.

143
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,720
My thighs hurt a lot, but I can't be like,

144
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,400
I need you to pay special attention

145
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,120
to my bottom of my bathing suit reaching zone.

146
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,200
They asked him, like, if I had any problem areas.

147
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,720
They have to ask for attention.

148
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,680
Like, there's no, where, there's not a right,

149
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,520
I mean, what answer could I give there?

150
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,560
My forehead.

151
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:56,880
My forehead?

152
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,680
There's nothing, nothing.

153
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,040
My earlobes?

154
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,160
No, that's bad.

155
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,480
Rub my ear, rub them lobes.

156
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,520
But yeah, go ahead and moan, moan away.

157
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,320
Go to town.

158
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,360
No, wait, what?

159
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,560
No, we didn't answer the question.

160
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,920
No, I wouldn't moan.

161
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,720
Yeah, moan.

162
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,040
I wouldn't moan, I don't think.

163
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,440
But I, this is one of the scenarios, Justin,

164
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,840
where I'm gonna say that like, no matter what you do,

165
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,880
because you're concerned about appearing weird and creepy,

166
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,720
that you will not be the creepiest person

167
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
who's ever come into this establishment.

168
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,680
So I say go to town because for every one of you,

169
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,520
there are a hundred people who are just like,

170
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,720
there are a hundred people who are just like,

171
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,520
I'm here for me.

172
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,600
You know that there are people who,

173
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,920
when told undress to their comfort level,

174
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,160
literally just reached out at lightning speed

175
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,520
and pulled their dick out of the hole

176
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,720
in the front of their pants.

177
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,560
Like, okay, how about I undress to your comfort level

178
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,320
and see who blanches first?

179
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,080
I need to know what your,

180
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,960
we may be getting too intimate now as brothers,

181
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,920
but I do wanna know,

182
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
I wanna know what your comfort level was

183
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,960
in that situation with your wife and the couples.

184
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,680
Well, fucking great news, Griffin.

185
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,560
I was wearing some me undies boxers,

186
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,600
so I felt very confident that the,

187
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,480
because of the relaxed fit of my me undies boxers,

188
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
that they would be able to massage around them.

189
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,440
So my comfort level was my me undies boxers

190
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,280
and nothing else.

191
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,880
Okay, I thought you were gonna be like,

192
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,960
I need you to massage around my Tybee Island

193
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,080
parrot head t-shirt.

194
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,600
No, the cargo shorts will remain on.

195
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,440
Anywhere you see cargo shorts, I am fine there.

196
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,320
No soreness in the cargo short reach.

197
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,120
Please rub around the 3DS in the pocket of my cargo shorts.

198
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,920
Explore around my Nintendo 3DS,

199
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,440
but I need it there because I am street passing

200
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,720
with a 12 year old.

201
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,200
How about a Yahoo answer?

202
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,700
Hit me.

203
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,040
This Yahoo answer was sent in by level 9,000.

204
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,800
Yeah, Drew Druid, Drew Davenport.

205
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,280
Thank you, Drew.

206
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,360
It's by a Yahoo answers user, Iceman,

207
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,860
who asks,

208
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,760
Iceman.

209
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,260
Sweet.

210
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,640
Is someone with the personality of Jackie Chan

211
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,560
the perfect man for a woman?

212
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,260
Wait.

213
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,800
I've always wondered about that.

214
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,720
I don't personally know him,

215
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,000
but he seems humble, generous, unselfish, and kind.

216
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,640
What do you think is someone like him

217
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,000
irresistible to women?

218
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,480
Update, is he your type of guy

219
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,120
or do you need a man who's more aggressive and combative?

220
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,600
Wait, hold on.

221
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,000
Do you think someone with the personality of Jackie Chan

222
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,040
the perfect man for a woman?

223
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,560
I want to start with the update.

224
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,320
That person put that fucking crazy ass question

225
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,520
in the Yahoo answers,

226
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,480
then went about their day,

227
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,280
and then they were like,

228
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,000
oh, wait, yeah, I can't believe I didn't say.

229
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,800
Oh, shit.

230
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,440
One other thing.

231
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,440
I think Jackie Chan is the perfect man for a woman,

232
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,920
a man, whatever, because yes.

233
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,360
He's good for what ails you.

234
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,240
He's good for what ails you

235
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,640
no matter what you are in the mood for.

236
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,080
Jackie Chan has got it.

237
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,480
What do you need?

238
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,000
Do you need a bodyguard?

239
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,720
You need a bodyguard?

240
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,480
Sure, if that is your romantic ideal,

241
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,320
then fine, he can be that for you.

242
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,000
Do you need stunts in your life?

243
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,120
In your life, do you need somebody

244
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,680
to jump off of a ramp into a helicopter?

245
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,760
Because he'll do it, and he'll do it for real.

246
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,160
What if I needed a kind of bumbling tutor for my kids,

247
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,280
right, but then somebody tried to kidnap my children

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,880
from our home one evening while I was, say, at the opera.

249
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,720
Do I need Jackie Chan for that?

250
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,200
I possess an extraordinarily technologically advanced tuxedo,

251
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,280
and I need a man to wear it.

252
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,040
Who's gonna wear my space tech tuxedo?

253
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,480
Hey, it's me, Owen Wilson.

254
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,680
I'm looking for a friend.

255
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,000
See if you got any ideas.

256
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,480
I think I can help you out with that, Vince Vaughn.

257
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,440
No, not quite.

258
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,560
Can I hear that Owen Wilson again one more time?

259
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,060
Yeah.

260
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,760
I'm looking for a friend.

261
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,280
And this is Owen Wilson right after waking up.

262
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,760
No, he's always a little lost.

263
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
I'm just looking for somebody to help me

264
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,920
just be my friend, you know?

265
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,600
You're getting closer.

266
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,480
I got a mouth shave to help get me a little bit closer.

267
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,400
Hold your nose.

268
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,280
See if that helps.

269
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,800
I want to talk about life stunts.

270
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,160
Okay.

271
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,240
Griffin mentioned this idea of life stunts,

272
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,920
and it really resonated with me.

273
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,720
As in, stunts are things that happen in movies

274
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,360
to make it look like something dangerous is happening, correct?

275
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:19,840
Yeah.

276
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,400
And nobody gets hurt, ideally.

277
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,600
Well, no, that's my favorite part of every Jackie Chan movie.

278
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,160
Is that reel at the end where he has stunt bloopers?

279
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,960
You saved that.

280
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,200
You saved the snuff for the ending.

281
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,480
Here's all the parts where Jackie Chan died

282
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
and was replacing the new Jackie Chan.

283
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,760
And also, he got hit in the balls 17 times during filming.

284
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,200
Like 17 different times.

285
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,120
And every time that, you got to feel bad

286
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,360
for that fight coordinator guy who's just like in it.

287
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,600
It's just like, oh, I got in Shanghai Noon 6?

288
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,160
Awesome.

289
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,880
This is going to be great.

290
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,080
It's going to be so good for my career.

291
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,960
No, actually, bad news.

292
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,600
You accidentally kicked Jackie Chan in the right nut,

293
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,360
and you'll never work in this town again.

294
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,840
Yeah.

295
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,120
And now you're blackballed.

296
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,040
Oh, God.

297
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,840
Oh, God.

298
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Jackie Chan is the perfect man for any woman

299
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,080
unless she does not want a man who is just permanently sterile.

300
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,160
Like beyond sterile.

301
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,680
Permanently purple down there.

302
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,040
Just beat to hell.

303
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,720
You can't even clone Jackie Chan.

304
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,680
That's how sterile this cat is from all the ball shots.

305
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,480
Life stunts.

306
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,920
What?

307
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,360
Why don't we have more parts of your life

308
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,080
that incorporate stunts that are preplanned

309
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,120
that you know you're going to do

310
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,440
and just have like more stunts in your life?

311
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,560
Do you know where that would be a huge benefit, Justin?

312
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,560
Imagine like you've just realized-

313
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
Viral wedding proposal videos.

314
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,200
Yes.

315
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,680
You've just realized your fly is down, right?

316
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,360
And you're like, oh, I need a distraction.

317
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
You look over at Jackie Chan, you nod.

318
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,840
He pretends to like fall through like an awning,

319
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,480
you know what I mean?

320
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,080
And land and pop back up and all that

321
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,240
while you're zipping up your fly and no one notices.

322
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,600
That might be a little elaborate.

323
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,720
It's a little elaborate.

324
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,280
I think I would just say like, please meet Jackie Chan.

325
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,280
This is Jackie Chan.

326
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,640
Here is Jackie Chan.

327
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,280
Zip.

328
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,880
Oh no, excuse myself.

329
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,600
Zip.

330
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
That's a great, that is such a great,

331
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,440
like you're married to Jackie Chan.

332
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,600
You're at your friend's New Year's Eve party.

333
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,960
Things are winding down.

334
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,480
Oh no, you shit your pants.

335
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,720
Jackie Chan, take it away.

336
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,240
I need to get out of here.

337
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,040
I've got you.

338
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,640
Hi everybody, I'm Jackie Chan.

339
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,240
Oh my God, where did Griffin go?

340
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,920
Please, you can call me Jacqueline.

341
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,720
Everybody does.

342
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,640
My friends, my closest friends-

343
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,400
My closest friends call me Jacqueline Chan.

344
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
He's probably the coolest person ever, right?

345
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:35,840
Yeah.

346
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,320
I think that he would probably be in my top five people.

347
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,040
I would be like just devastated to find out

348
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,800
was kind of a jerk in real life.

349
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:51,760
No, you watch somebody like crash a train into him on accident

350
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,720
in those snuff bloopers at the end of his films

351
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
and he gets hit by the train and goes flying

352
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,640
and is cut in twain.

353
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,840
But then they like run up to him like,

354
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,640
Jackie, are you okay?

355
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
And he looks up and gives a smile and a thumbs up.

356
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,920
That's a dude.

357
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,200
Don't blame the conductor.

358
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,640
It's fine.

359
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,200
I find myself in a bit of a conundrum.

360
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,040
I really enjoy animal companionship,

361
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,880
but my boyfriend is very stern on the opinion

362
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,360
that he doesn't want the responsibility of having a pet.

363
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,240
The most he will even consider allowing me to have

364
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,520
is one of a simple pet rock.

365
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,480
That's cruel and not a real pet.

366
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,000
Brothers, how do I explain to him how important it is

367
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,520
for me to have an animal around the house

368
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,880
that I'll look after without coming off

369
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,080
as I'm trying to wear him down?

370
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,360
He's a listener of the show.

371
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:31,840
Excellent.

372
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,120
And if anyone could convince him,

373
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,920
it's probably you guys.

374
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,040
Sincerely, Cat Crazy in Canada.

375
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,520
You're gonna start referring to the cat as,

376
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,720
you need a familiar.

377
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,840
Oh, that's good, Travis.

378
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,200
For your magics?

379
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,600
Well, if it gets to that point,

380
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,040
I'm just saying if you don't wanna appear

381
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,560
like you're just trying to wear him down,

382
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,200
just be like, ah, a familiar would really help me

383
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,080
in my research.

384
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,720
Something like that.

385
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,520
You know, just keep dropping those every so often.

386
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,320
You get the familiar before you learn any wizarding.

387
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,640
Yeah.

388
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,240
Think about Harry Potter, right?

389
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,480
There was a point in Harry Potter's life

390
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,680
when he knew no magics, but owned an owl.

391
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,320
At that point in his life-

392
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,840
And that was just okay.

393
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,720
He was just a kid that owned an owl.

394
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,560
Like, what am I supposed to do with this?

395
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,640
That must have been the hardest thing.

396
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,480
Like, when he was getting magic books, cool.

397
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,600
And he got a wand, cool.

398
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,800
And here's a bird of prey.

399
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,880
Here's a big fat bird you have to feed mice to.

400
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,760
That's probably fairly difficult to keep alive.

401
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,080
Like, we're not talking like goldfish here.

402
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,760
Like, this is an owl.

403
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,960
Yeah, and the hardest part about keeping a pet owl alive

404
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,680
is when you wake up and it's in your room

405
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,560
and right next to you, not instinctively murdering it.

406
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,320
Not just instinctively tearing it in half.

407
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,840
Like, oh god, big eyes, bye.

408
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,680
Tear it, rip it.

409
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,600
Could you start, I mean, you gotta start small, right?

410
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,000
You have to start with like a beta,

411
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,040
maybe a nice beta fighting fish, you know, betas.

412
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,120
Nobody has anything against owning a fish.

413
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,360
Like, it's the lowest impact pet.

414
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,040
I would like to suggest another plan.

415
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,080
Release a dozen mice into your home

416
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,880
and then place a call, email or fax to my newly formed business,

417
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,800
Justin McElroy's prohibitively expensive

418
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,360
yet profoundly incompetent pest removal service.

419
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,720
I come to your home and I have a thing on my van

420
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,880
that says the best in the biz, okay?

421
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,400
That is an important statement.

422
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,480
And that's sort of like a general use decal

423
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,960
so that whenever Justin pulls a grip on any sort of trade skill.

424
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,560
Justin McElroy, best in the biz.

425
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,320
And then I show up and I'm like,

426
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,240
oh, I see your problem, you got mice.

427
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,840
And then I do my magic.

428
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,880
I don't know what it'll be.

429
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,400
It'll pretty much just be hooking vacuums up to heating vents

430
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
and like doing that for a little while

431
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,200
and saying like, yeah, well, and-

432
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,520
Blowing into things and then waiting.

433
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,520
Throwing cheese out the window and say like, it's there.

434
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,840
And then I'll say, everybody out.

435
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,800
And then I'll wait.

436
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,960
I'll say, well, folks, that'll take care of it.

437
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,160
Then-

438
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,680
That ought to do it.

439
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,240
Then you have two pet options.

440
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,880
Pet option one, you see mice.

441
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,480
Oh, we should call pest removal.

442
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,320
No, what point would there be in that?

443
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,160
We already got the best in the biz

444
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,000
and he couldn't get rid of all these mice.

445
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,360
We're stuck with this mice problem.

446
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,120
So option one, you have pet mice.

447
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,680
That's cool.

448
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,360
Option two-

449
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,440
Cage free roaming, cage free mice.

450
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,680
Option two, and I think you're really gonna love this one.

451
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,200
We've already called the best of the biz.

452
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,680
We've already called the best that humankind has to offer.

453
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,160
We have to take this back to the animal kingdom.

454
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,800
Meet my pet cat, Mr. Hunter, like predator.

455
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,240
Meet my cat predator.

456
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,560
And then you own a cat to keep the mouse population.

457
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,400
But your boyfriend doesn't know how many mice are in there.

458
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,640
You can never get rid of the cat

459
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,120
because you never know when he's gonna find another mouse.

460
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,800
And if you need to keep up the illusion,

461
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,440
release another mouse in there every once in a while.

462
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,960
Justin, I just want you to know

463
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,120
in the scenario of this movie that you've created,

464
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,720
I picture the cat being introduced

465
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,200
very similar to the priest in The Exorcist.

466
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,720
Like at the bottom of a set of stairs

467
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,320
in like one street light, like meet my acquaintance, Mr. Hunter.

468
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,000
And then it's just a cat in a trench coat.

469
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,840
Meow, I'm father predator.

470
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,920
Meow.

471
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,480
And the cat just says best in the biz across the side.

472
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,040
That's key.

473
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,560
I can't emphasize that enough.

474
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,080
Listen, what we're really talking about here

475
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
is branding opportunities for Justin's

476
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,000
best in the biz sign making business.

477
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,240
Now, can I ask Justin what you get out of this?

478
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,680
Are you charging a fee for your initial consultation?

479
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,400
Maybe you didn't hear, it's right there in the name.

480
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Prohibitively expensive.

481
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,200
Like if I'm gonna go through all this rigmarole,

482
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,480
I'm gonna get my taste.

483
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,680
I'm gonna get my beque.

484
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,400
And by beque, I mean the chicken

485
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,000
that I also bring to give you as a pet.

486
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,200
Listen, it's a full service business.

487
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,720
What does a chicken do?

488
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,880
Just makes a cat look good by comparison?

489
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,520
A chicken makes eggs, you fucking neanderthal.

490
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,120
I need a book.

491
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,280
Our first sponsor this week is Pro Flowers.

492
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,840
Mother's Day is coming up and you want to show-

493
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,120
It's like six days away?

494
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,880
Is that right?

495
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,400
Well, I mean, it's, well, I mean,

496
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,240
it depends on when this goes up.

497
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,760
Is it gonna go up on May the fourth?

498
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,000
May the fourth, that was our intro.

499
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,120
It was right there.

500
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,520
And another missed observation.

501
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,400
Make it up to your mom that you missed Star Wars Day

502
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,000
with a glass of 100 blooms with a free glass vase

503
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,240
for just $19.99.

504
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,840
You can make that day extra special

505
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,800
and add some chocolates for $9.99 more.

506
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,320

and you're gonna type in the code MYBROTHER.

510
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,400
Sydney, we got a vase of these flowers sent to us.

511
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,120
They were Peruvian lilies

512
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,400
and they were now Sydney's favorite flowers.

513
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,840
They are really, really beautiful and it's a great deal.

514
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000

Now say that this is the first episode

518
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,640
someone's ever listened to

519
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,560
and they're like, what's this guy talking about

520
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,760
about his undies?

521
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,200
Why is he saying me undies?

522
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,320
Why is he speaking?

523
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,440
It's this product placement

524
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,880
because I cannot imagine a less appealing product placement

525
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,840
than thinking about my brother wearing me undies

526
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,640
and getting them super duper oily and squishy

527
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,080
from massage juices.

528
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,560
They pull moisture away from your skin

529
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,880
so you're cool all day long down there.

530
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,640
I just wore them to a rent fair yesterday,

531
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
walked around for four and a half hours

532
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,960
whilst drinking ale and eating,

533
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,040
I ate a quail, which was pretty cool.

534
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,800
Turns out I wasn't supposed to.

535
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,680
They were very ugly.

536
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,960
You got the quail and ale special?

537
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,760
We watched a joust.

538
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,760
My joust person lost.

539
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,880
It was very sad,

540
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,680
but me undies kept my zone very dry.

541
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,120
If me undies can make Travis cool at a rent fair,

542
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,040
they are capable of some pretty goddamn superhuman feats.

543
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,880
They are the Jackie Chan of delicates.

544
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,720
Right now, this is a great deal.

545
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,160
meundies.com slash my brother.

546
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,400
You can get 20% off your first order and free shipping.

547
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,680
We've had so many listeners try these

548
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,280
and they absolutely adore them.

549
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,120
They're never going back to regular underwear.

550
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,640
Don't get that six pack for eight cents.

551
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,440
That's gross.

552
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,360
Who knows what's in there?

553
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,760
meundies.com slash my brother.

554
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,880
For men and women.

555
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,920
For everyone.

556
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,120
Yeah, for everyone.

557
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,720
They're fantastic underwear.

558
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,160
And you're just gonna love them.

559
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,840
I have a message here for Will and it's from Alita.

560
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,200
And Alita says to Will,

561
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,440
Will, we've been married for two years now.

562
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,640
Can you believe it?

563
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,720
And we're coming up on 10 years together.

564
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,560
I'm really happy about it.

565
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,320
I think you're just so great.

566
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,560
You can make this sound really sarcastic.

567
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,520
I think you're just so great.

568
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,280
Really, the greatest.

569
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,800
I love you more than everything.

570
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,280
Here's to all the future years of our super fun life.

571
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,320
Love, Alita.

572
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,720
Do you love that this is the first non-ironic

573
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,600
actually kind message that we've gotten in literally months

574
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,200
and we managed to turn it into something dark and despicable?

575
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,240
We're bad people.

576
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,440
We're terrible, terrible people.

577
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,720
Thank you for not just being like,

578
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,760
hey, I'm gonna make Griffin say dog farts now.

579
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,400
Here I go.

580
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,840
You did it all right.

581
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,240
That was actually their plan was to get you to say dog farts

582
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,120
and they just like took you way around the bend.

583
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,400
That's a deep con.

584
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,000
That's a deep 2015.

585
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,640
I have another message though,

586
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,400
and it's for Jorge Aviles.

587
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,120
God, do you think I hit that?

588
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
I think you nailed it.

589
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,600
It's for Jorge Aviles and it's from Melissa.

590
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,560
You had to give it another pass in there.

591
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,000
You had to go back for it.

592
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,760
You got a double dunk.

593
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,920
And it's from Melissa who says,

594
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,520
Jorge, thank you for introducing me to the brothers

595
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,520
on that road trip we took to Big Bend.

596
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,200
Beautiful, beautiful park.

597
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,240
Thank you for letting me share in the therapeutic nature

598
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,600
that is Mabim Bam.

599
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,880
Laughing alongside with you

600
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,040
while listening to their goofs is priceless.

601
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,920
Happy birthday.

602
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,400
Love always, your Babi or baby.

603
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,600
I think it's Babi.

604
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,480
Probably Babi.

605
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,520
I think it's Babadook.

606
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,920
If it's a show reference, it's probably Babi.

607
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,640
Love always, your Babadook.

608
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,400
I'm glad here that Melissa has acknowledged

609
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,200
the therapeutic nature of MBMBM.

610
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,000
Not enough people talk about the recovery

611
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,960
that can be accomplished

612
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,680
just by simply listening to our episodes.

613
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,960
Physical, mental, emotional.

614
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,840
We'll adjust your fucking energons for free.

615
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,480
For nothing.

616
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,160
If you went to an energon specialist,

617
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,800
they're gonna charge you like 60 bucks an hour.

618
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,440
No one's gonna get mad at you for moaning

619
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,680
during a My Brother and My Brother and Me episode.

620
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,480
Yeah, I just assume,

621
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,760
I've never listened to our show before,

622
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,600
but I just assume that people who listen to our show

623
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,000
are just constantly like, oh, yeah.

624
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,680
Yeah, oh, man.

625
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,400
Oh, yeah.

626
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,360
Oh, I'm gonna.

627
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,920
Ecstasy.

628
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,360
Oh, the pleasure.

629
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,400
I'm gonna nut.

630
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,700
Gross.

631
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,300
Gross.

632
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,880
I hate it.

633
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,440
I hate it.

634
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,280
Hi, I'm Julie Sabatier, host of Rendered.

635
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,000
It's a show about making meaning and breaking rules.

636
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,200
We're answering important questions like,

637
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,440
can you build a space suit in your living room?

638
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,280
I went to my brother's place in Beaverton,

639
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,600
and he has a swimming pool, and I pressurized the suit

640
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
and sat down there underwater for about 10 minutes.

641
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,520
The thing that I built was supporting my life.

642
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,480
That felt really good.

643
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,760
What does it sound like when you play a polka record

644
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,120
through a styrofoam cup?

645
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,400
And what happens when an airport carpet

646
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,160
gains a cult following?

647
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,880
Oh, my goodness.

648
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,880
The carpet has an Instagram.

649

Do you guys want a Yahoo?

652
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,640
Yeah, Griffin.

653
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,760
I would love one.

654
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,920
This one was sent in by YadruDru at Drew Davenport.

655
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,400
Thank you, Drew.

656
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,040
It's by Yadru Answers user, Lane, who asks,

657
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,400
is there such a thing as spirit sitting

658
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,520
that you can be paid for?

659
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,400
Is it like babysitting?

660
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,760
Like babysitting and being paid for your time.

661
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,120
Oh, I was joking.

662
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,080
For reals?

663
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,000
It says update.

664
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,840
The loudest like a whining baby

665
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,680
crawling all over and in you.

666
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,480
And that's not even information.

667
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,160
That's not, that's not, that's a,

668
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,200
that's a goddamn EE coming slam poem.

669
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,600
I have a question.

670
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,800
Griffin, read the exact phrasing of the question again.

671
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,240
Is there such a thing as spirit sitting

672
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,600
that you can be paid for?

673
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,840
Like babysitting and being paid for your time.

674
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,640
Time out.

675
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,320
That is a person who wants to get into this field

676
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,320
and would like to be paid for their abilities

677
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,200
with spirit sitting.

678
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,360
And then the further details are

679
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
the loudest like a whining baby

680
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,160
crawling all over and in you.

681
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,920
Okay, that's what happened here.

682
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,520
This person put up this question

683
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,520
and then they thought, well, I better get better at it

684
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,360
in case anyone says yes.

685
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,720
And then they got too big, too quick.

686
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,160
They got into some shit they didn't understand.

687
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,040
They got into some dark, some of his dark materials

688
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,760
and they, and they, and they opened the door way wide to.

689
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,520
His, his capital H.

690
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,600
His, his dark material.

691
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,360
Well, Lucifer, but yes.

692
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:41,840
Oh, okay.

693
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,920
I was a babysitter for a summer

694
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,200
and it basically involved me helping

695
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,960
one of the children beat all the very hard bosses

696
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,920
in Kingdom Hearts.

697
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,200
And I don't think that a spirit is going to be

698
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,280
quite as chill.

699
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,320
It's gonna be me.

700
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,800
It's gonna be me just constantly walking around

701
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,400
shutting cabinet doors.

702
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,440
Very funny.

703
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,200
Real funny spirit.

704
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,000
Pretty good stuff.

705
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,400
I go into the bathroom and I use the bathroom

706
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,760
and when I wash my hands,

707
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,160
all the skin falls off of my face in the mirror

708
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,720
and it's like, ah, it got me again, spirit.

709
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,640
Oh, you jokester.

710
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,280
Check this out.

711
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,160
You ready?

712
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,400
Mary Poppins, except for ghost children,

713
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,080
you're welcome, Tim Burton.

714
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,680
Please enjoy the movie that I have just written for you.

715
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,640
Oh my God, it's already out

716
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,000
and I'm looking at it on Rotten Tomatoes,

717
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,320
2%, 2% on Rotten Tomatoes.

718
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,280
Widely panned.

719
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,720
Helena Bonham Carter is Mary Spookins

720
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,600
and, thank you, Griffin.

721
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,800
A spoonful of poison.

722
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,440
That's my Helena Bonham Carter impression.

723
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,520
Why would you poison ghosts, Griffin?

724
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,120
That doesn't make any sense.

725
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,080
Because they're already dead

726
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
and it's like what they're into.

727
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,000
A spoonful of holy water banishes you to the great beyond.

728
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,440
Supercalifragilisticexpialis, oh shit.

729
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,720
Ghost, she got scared by a ghost.

730
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:02,960
Sure.

731
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,920
The good news is there is someone

732
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,040
who gets paid to sit spirits for you.

733
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,640
Go to your living room window,

734
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,320
look out at the street, there's a van there.

735
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,920
What's that van say on the side?

736
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,520
It says the best in the biz.

737
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,240
It's me.

738
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,400
Now Justin, what do you bring to the table

739
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,280
that makes you the best in the biz at ghost sitting?

740
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,320
A Ouija board.

741
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,160
I put it right on that table and I say,

742
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,080
let's sort this out.

743
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,120
Why are you still here?

744
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,480
And then I do, I'm the best of the biz.

745
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
So I say I got rid of them.

746
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,680
And what I do then is if you tell me the ghosts are back,

747
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,960
I just say, you're insane.

748
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,480
You're actually an insane person.

749
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,200
You need to go to the head doctor.

750
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,640
No, you just say that's a different ghost.

751
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,000
I'll take care of that one too.

752
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
You got, oh, it looks like you just,

753
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,760
you got ghosts up in the rafters.

754
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,320
I'm looking up here, you got some ghost damage in the corner.

755
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,480
No, Travis, I'm expanding the sale.

756
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,400
I'll say you are insane.

757
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,640
You need a head doctor, preferably one

758
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,160
that makes house calls look outside your window.

759
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,200
There's a van outside.

760
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,800
You step out of it.

761
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,640
David Blaine, what the fuck?

762
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,440
How do you do it?

763
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,720
You were David Blaine the whole time.

764
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,160
Best in the biz for psychiatric issues.

765
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,480
I come up and I help you that way too.

766
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,080
I help you in every way imaginable.

767
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,720
I'm gonna hit you with this.

768
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,200
You throw down the Ouija, throw down that Ouija board.

769
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,600
You say ghost, what is your unfinished business?

770
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,880
I'm trying to sit you.

771
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,160
And the triangle, the glass triangle starts moving.

772
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,600
And very slowly it spells out,

773
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,520
I need help beating Jafar in Kingdom Hearts.

774
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,080
I'm having a very hard time with the Jafar boss fight.

775
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,880
Can you help me?

776
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,040
And I'm like, yeah, dude, I got this.

777
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,880
The secret is you wanna use Thundaga.

778
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,600
The greatest test of your Kingdom Hearts acumen

779
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,600
is to give clues through Ouija board to say how to beat it.

780
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,880
You have to have some fast hands.

781
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,760
Well, no, Justin, the Ouija board is not a two-way thing.

782
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,280
You could just say out,

783
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,880
you don't need to use the Ouija board

784
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,080
to send messages to them.

785
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,280
Yes, Travis, that's true.

786
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,760
But Griffin is unable to see the ghost monitor.

787
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,000
So information about what is currently on the screen.

788
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,320
Right, they're playing PlayStation in the spirit realm.

789
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,320
Right, where all dead PlayStations go.

790
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,560
Right, I don't know what kind of equipment they have.

791
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,360
I don't know how they've got goofy kidded out.

792
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,280
One of my closest friends recently started selling cosmetics.

793
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,440
While I'm glad she found a way to make some extra money,

794
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,280
she's always asking me if I wanna buy some.

795
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,840
Even explain that she needs to hit her monthly sales goals.

796
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,800
As a friend, am I obligated to just help her out

797
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,080
and buy this stuff I don't need?

798
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,400
And that's from not buying it in Boston.

799
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,680
Sounds like you've already made up your mind.

800
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,960
Why not just hand her money and just say,

801
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,320
do you need it that badly?

802
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,120
Here's 10 bucks.

803
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,760
Here's $500.

804
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,680
I don't need any cream.

805
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,920
The cream doesn't expire.

806
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,120
Why don't you just stockpile?

807
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,920
Listen, I totally get this question.

808
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,160
I mean, in this day and age-

809
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,920
Travis sells a lot of chocolate bars

810
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,240
to try and pay for his band trip.

811
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,480
Listen, we're just trying to get to King's Island, you guys.

812
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,680
We just need this money.

813
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,040
Isn't this the reason that these businesses exist?

814
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,440
I mean, cause nobody's really selling the shit to strangers.

815
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,920
Nobody goes door to door anymore with this stuff.

816
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,400
They're sitting there and you're doing a birthday party

817
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
and you're like, well, you know what would help

818
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,200
with that problem?

819
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,480
I'm sorry, overheard you talking about bags under your eyes.

820
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,760
I have this product.

821
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,320
That's why it exists so that you can get your friends

822
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,040
into doing it.

823
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,440
You throw a small packet of cream at their eyes

824
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,520
and it explodes and covers them

825
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,280
and you've just cream bombed them

826
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,960
and then they have to pay for it.

827
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,800
That's a good sales tag.

828
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,320
That's how you become best in the biz.

829
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,240
I'm coming for your throne, Justin.

830
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,120
Come at my throne.

831
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,680
Can I ask why it's always cosmetics?

832
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,280
Cause if it was literally anything else,

833
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,000
I would be totally down.

834
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,800
If I have a friend that was like,

835
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,960
listen, I have a hard time making my quota.

836
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,960
I'm selling nature box snacks.

837
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,360
I would be like, I'll sign me up for just everything.

838
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,360
I'll buy all of everything you got.

839
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,520
I'll drink up all the nature box you got on the shelf.

840
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,920
Just let me introduce myself.

841
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,760
My name is, and then I start eating some pistachios.

842
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,520
Pistachios.

843
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,240
What?

844
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,040
Pistachios.

845
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,640
Pistachios?

846
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,360
Pistachios.

847
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,360
It's pistachios with extra potassium.

848
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,480
I once went on a great Twitter run

849
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,960
where I was just coming up with the top 10 nicknames

850
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,080
for pistachios.

851
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,800
What do you guys got?

852
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,520
Okay, here's some of the minds.

853
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,200
Stashies, great.

854
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,760
P-bombs.

855
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,080
What about little nut purse?

856
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,040
What?

857
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,760
Nut purses?

858
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,400
That's excellent.

859
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,120
Little nut purse.

860
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,280
How about oyster crunch?

861
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,080
Because it's like a little oyster

862
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,360
and you crack it and you get a little crunch.

863
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,360
I went with pistachios.

864
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,160
Little greenies.

865
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,960
Green nuts.

866
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,160
Green nuts, okay.

867
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,960
I think the problem-

868
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,440
Pistachios.

869
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,680
Pistachios?

870
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,320
I like that.

871
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,560
The problem with this question is,

872
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,320
I get that because when your friend's like,

873
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
hey, do you want to buy some of my wares?

874
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,920
And you know that they're trying to make money

875
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,120
and do it as a business,

876
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,280
it's really hard to look back on them and be like,

877
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,160
no, I can buy this cheaper somewhere else

878
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,160
and I support you doing it, just not financially.

879
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,040
That's tough.

880
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,720
Yeah, that's right, Travis.

881
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,440
This person has literally said exactly that.

882
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,800
That this is a hard situation.

883
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,800
I'm trying to get us back onto actually helping them

884
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,200
and not so much talking about pistachios.

885
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,280
I was terrified of the sales career

886
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,840
at an early age because of my exposure to the play

887
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,120
Death of a Salesman.

888
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,880
Here's what Death of a Salesman tells you

889
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,400
about selling things.

890
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
If you're really good at it,

891
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
eventually you're gonna be Willy Loman

892
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,680
because the, I don't know,

893
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,520
the things will change

894
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,120
and you won't be able to sell the widgets good enough.

895
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,480
Option two, it's going bad.

896
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,560
Psych, you're already Willy Loman.

897
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,920
Uh-oh, you missed your chance to get off the bus.

898
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,920
Don't be a salesperson.

899
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,360
Everyone ends up like Willy Loman.

900
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,480
But can't you also end up like Alec Baldwin

901
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,640
from Glengarry Glen Ross and always be closing?

902
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,480
You'd love that, wouldn't you, Travis?

903
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,840
I mean, as long as we're making play references.

904
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,440
See, Travis, that's a fictional piece of work.

905
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,400
That's a fictional play.

906
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:54,880
Oh, I see.

907
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,360
Salesmen die all the time.

908
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,200
That's just for real.

909
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,160
But do they ever truly live?

910
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,360
I work at a small office inches away

911
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,640
from three other people.

912
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,560
We all get along well and then spend time

913
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,080
talking as we work.

914
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,640
This sounds good so far.

915
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,840
I don't know why you would need this.

916
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,960
Sometimes we have lunches together.

917
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,080
It is enjoyable.

918
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,640
Later on, I go home and perhaps make some dinner

919
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,040
and watch a movie.

920
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,400
Anyway, anyway, good night.

921
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,160
Good night, man in the moon.

922
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,040
Another Grand Slam day in my cool life.

923
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,360
Had some good talks, had some chicken pot pie.

924
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,480
Pretty good all there.

925
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,160
Tomorrow's Debra's birthday.

926
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,400
We're going out for afternoon drinks.

927
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,000
I'll get to that laundry tomorrow.

928
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,120
It's no problem.

929
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,000
He'll still be there.

930
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,040
One guy, though, will put on his headphones

931
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
and tune us out until we start laughing

932
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,960
or the conversation sounds interesting.

933
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,040
Then he pops up his head and says,

934
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,400
what are you talking about?

935
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,200
Oh, my God.

936
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,000
He does this at least five times a day.

937
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,160
We have to repeat the entire conversation

938
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,640
to him every time and it's making me crazy.

939
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,000
Just pay attention.

940
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,600
Brothers, how can I keep my cool

941
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,400
and still have work chats around this guy?

942
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,240
That's from vexed in Vancouver.

943
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,440
Oh, Vancouver.

944
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,600
I'd love to go by there sometime.

945
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:22,880
Maybe make a visit there on, I don't know, August 30th.

946
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,760
Does that sound good?

947
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,480
Yeah, it's a date.

948
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,600
Yeah, I think I can work that.

949
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,240
I'll do that.

950
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,440
If you want to see me there,

951
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,600
go to bit.ly forward slash van, M-B-A-M and buy a ticket.

952
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,640
Anyway, more on that later.

953
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,440
More on that later.

954
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,000
God, it's rare when a person possesses

955
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,080
this sort of robotic work ethic strategy

956
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,720
and also like chronic FOMO.

957
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,320
Or it's like, you can't have both.

958
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,480
You can't get the best of both worlds.

959
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,960
Either do your business and be a good business boy

960
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,440
or be like a lunchtime fun boy, but you cannot be both.

961
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,120
You cannot be both.

962
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,840
I have an idea.

963
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,600
A lunchtime fun boy and a good business boy.

964
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,560
That's too true, Griffin.

965
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,080
I have an idea.

966
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,720
Hit me, Travis.

967
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,200
Every 20 minutes or so,

968
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,640
lean over and ask him what he's listening to.

969
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,960
Oh my god.

970
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,720
And then have him tell you about it

971
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,960
and then lean back and like 30 minutes later,

972
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,520
ask him again and do that until he's like,

973
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,960
hey man, why do you keep doing that?

974
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,080
And be like, because you do it.

975
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,160
Because you do it, Steve.

976
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,920
Get the fuck out, you're fired.

977
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,480
What if he's like, Dave, the guy I used to work with at TriData

978
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,960
and the answer to that question is always C&C Music Factory.

979
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,600
It is always the same C&C Music Factory cassette tape.

980
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,640
I think that that would be a pretty cool work day, honestly.

981
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,320
I'm a big fan of their work.

982
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,560
I recently in the car treated Sydney

983
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,960
to my recitation of all the lyrics that are gonna make you sweat

984
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
and she was not as impressed.

985
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,000
Every time he asks what you're laughing or talking about,

986
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,520
look him dead in his eye jellies and say, you.

987
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,360
Every time.

988
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,760
Every single time.

989
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,920
You, we're talking about you again.

990
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,080
He takes them off five minutes later.

991
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,040
Hey, what's all the hub?

992
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,320
It's you, I promise.

993
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,520
We're laughing at you and talking about you.

994
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,320
And not in a fun, nice way.

995
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,440
He'll have to keep his headphones off then.

996
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,960
How about one more Yahoo?

997
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,840
I just wanna get to it.

998
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,640
I love one.

999
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,080
It's sent in again by Drew Davenport.

1000
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,800
Thank you, Drew.

1001
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,120
Patrick, you did it again.

1002
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,680
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kat who asks,

1003
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,520
is crying over a celebrity normal?

1004
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,720
I want everybody, I want everybody to predict now.

1005
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,640
I know you're thinking Zayn Malik, maybe,

1006
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,320
who the celeb in question, this person has sent forward this quandary.

1007
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,000
Is crying over a celebrity normal, Kat asks.

1008
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,520
For no reason, I have been crying over Willem Dafoe.

1009
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,120
I was in my room watching one of his interviews

1010
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,080
and when it finished, I turned it over to watch TV.

1011
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,240
A few days later, I burst out in tears

1012
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,640
and I don't know if it was me thinking about Willem

1013
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,960
or if it was something else.

1014
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,840
I haven't been paying attention to him as much as I used to.

1015
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,160
I have been doing it for a few days.

1016
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,000
My boyfriend knows the reason for my crying

1017
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,520
and he's comforted me about it.

1018
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,440
My friend Maggie told me to stop crying

1019
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,680
and to just shut up about Willem Dafoe.

1020
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,720
I have looked up to him since I was nine years old.

1021
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,320
I'm 17 now though.

1022
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,280
My boyfriend said, just remember, I'm here for you

1023
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,680
if you need anything or if you wanna talk about things

1024
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,520
like celebrities, then I'm here for you.

1025
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,920
If you guys are gonna say it's your hormones, it's not.

1026
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,080
I can tell you this has been going on for days.

1027
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,800
I go outside a lot, so don't say it's that either.

1028
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,920
Could someone please help me?

1029
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,600
Is crying over a celebrity normal?

1030
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,880
But do you think her boyfriend said it

1031
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,560
as he was furtively throwing his personal possessions

1032
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,120
in a bag and buying plane tickets to anywhere else?

1033
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,360
Yeah, just give me a call whenever, I gotta go.

1034
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,880
Gotta go, bye.

1035
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,840
But she does.

1036
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,720
Is that window reinforced or, you know what,

1037
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,080
I'll figure it out.

1038
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,760
Nevermind, bye.

1039
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,680
Griffin, does she at any point in that question state?

1040
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,400
Okay, that's what I wanna get to.

1041
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,760
It's not like I heard Willem Dafoe singing

1042
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,240
like a beautiful angel and it brought me to tears

1043
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,920
or I heard Willem Dafoe talk about the death

1044
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,080
of his grandfather and how sad it was

1045
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,040
and it resonated with me on a very intimate level.

1046
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,040
No, it's just this person is going Willem Dafoe,

1047
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,240
like, oh my, wait, hold on, wait.

1048
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:56,240
Willem Dafoe is, he is, he exists.

1049
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,840
I think what this person is experiencing is guilt

1050
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,400
is because they said in the question

1051
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,520
that she doesn't think about Willem Dafoe

1052
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,880
as much as she used to.

1053
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,520
So maybe she feels like, hey, you know what

1054
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,720
I haven't been making enough of lately?

1055
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,800
Willem time.

1056
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,720
So it's like the scene in Toy Story 3

1057
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,400
where Andy comes across like all the old toys

1058
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,960
and she's sitting there thinking,

1059
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,840
I need to pass Willem Dafoe onto a six-year-old girl.

1060
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,680
I need to find a six-year-old girl

1061
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,480
and give her Willem Dafoe.

1062
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,840
It's me, Willem Dafoe.

1063
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,200
Have you thought about me lately?

1064
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,480
I noticed you haven't gone to see Grand Budapest Hotel.

1065
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,240
I don't know if I can take it.

1066
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,880
Finish it.

1067
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,840
What if Willem Dafoe showed up every time anybody prayed?

1068
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:52,840
Smash the windows out, like, finish it.

1069
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,200
I was about to, give me a second, Willem.

1070
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,080
And are you wearing a green goblin costume

1071
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,520
that you made for yourself out of cardboard boxes?

1072
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,740
That looks terrible.

1073
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,920
Finish it.

1074
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,720
Okay, just give me a second.

1075
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,340
And make sure you throw in an extra one for me.

1076
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,540
An extra prayer?

1077
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,380
What are you?

1078
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,620
An extra prayer for me.

1079
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:18,940
God won't listen to me anymore.

1080
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,980
I need all the help I can get.

1081
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,220
Anything you got.

1082
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,700
Forgive me, Father.

1083
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,580
It's been a while since my last confession.

1084
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,720
And also on the last one that I did,

1085
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,540
I forgot to pray for Willem Dafoe.

1086
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,020
And I feel super duper guilty about that.

1087
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:36,900
You should.

1088
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,820
Oh God, no.

1089
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,980
Wait, how did you?

1090
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,620
Is there a celebrity that when you guys think about-

1091
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,820
Them existing, they're existing.

1092
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:47,260
Just the thought of them moves you to tears.

1093
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,500
I'm betting that there's probably at least one.

1094
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,380
I'm trying to.

1095
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,100
I'm trying to work up a couple big fat tears

1096
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,860
thinking about somebody.

1097
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,740
Up, up, up, up, up.

1098
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,580
I got it.

1099
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,100
William Daniels.

1100
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,540
Mr. Feeny.

1101
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,380
John Adams.

1102
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,220
It's pretty solid.

1103
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:09,220
Just kind of, oh, there they come.

1104
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:26,580
Griffin's sadness sounds like a wounded animal.

1105
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,660
Don't you interrupt him.

1106
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,260
You get it all out, Griffin.

1107
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:34,260
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta Google

1108
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,660
and make sure he's in Girl Meets World, a lot.

1109
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,220
Don't stop.

1110
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,940
This is the first step in healing.

1111
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,500
People are apparently confused.

1112
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,620
He is in Girl Meets World.

1113
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,580
People are confused as to whether or not he is a ghost.

1114
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,380
There is some confusion on Girl Meets World

1115
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,860
as to whether or not Mr. Feeny,

1116
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,980
the character from Boy Meets World is a ghost or not.

1117
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,420
Hey, Girl Meets World, how's your storytelling?

1118
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,380
Pretty good.

1119
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,900
Cause people don't seem to be sure

1120
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,020
whether or not one of your major characters is a ghost

1121
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,660
or is a human existing person.

1122
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,060
Do you think that that's part of the natural progression

1123
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:24,040
as an actor?

1124
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,700
You go from like playing a leading man

1125
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,900
to like a more wizened sort of like grandfatherly presence

1126
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,480
to anytime you're on screen,

1127
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,820
it is questioned whether or not you are a ghost.

1128
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,780
It's just people assume,

1129
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,620
like I'm in that phase of my career.

1130
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,100
The ghost phase.

1131
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,660
I'm in the Sir Alec Guinness phase

1132
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,080
where I only play ghosts in all of my movies.

1133
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,420
I need someone to come and house sit

1134
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,200
for my William Daniels ghost.

1135
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,820
He gets very scared at night.

1136
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,900
He is uncontrollable.

1137
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:59,420
He gets, if he doesn't lay down to sleep by 7 p.m.,

1138
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,460
oh, there is just no dealing with him.

1139
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,420
It sounds like a job for one van.

1140
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,240
You know who that is?

1141
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,980
Van Morrison?

1142
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:08,820
Best in the biz.

1143
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,660
No, best in the biz, the van.

1144
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,500
My van I have.

1145
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,340
That's enough comedy for a van.

1146
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,620
Mr. Matthews, I'm a ghost now

1147
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,660
and I'm having a very difficult time

1148
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,380
beating the Beauty and the Beast level

1149
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,620
in Kingdom Hearts 2.

1150
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:25,620
Mr. Matthews, I need you to help me beat the dark Mickey boss fight, please.

1151
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,620
Can I hear that noise one more time?

1152
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:30,620
Excellent.

1153
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,620
Great, great noise.

1154
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:33,620
That's my ring tone.

1155
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:34,620
That's the end of the show.

1156
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,620
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

1157
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,620

00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:48,620
If you want to come see us

1162
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,620
when we do our Pacific Northwest shows,

1163
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:54,620
if you live up there in the top left part of the country,

1164
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:57,620
there's still tickets available for the Vancouver show.

1165
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:02,620
You can find those tickets at bit.ly slash van, M-B-M-B-A-M.

1166
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,620
If you want to come see us in Seattle,

1167
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,620
there's tickets left for that show too.

1168
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:09,620
It's bit.ly slash M-B-M-B-A-M Seattle.

1169
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,620
You can find all the details on when we'll be doing those shows

1170
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,620
and the specific venues there.

1171
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,620
Portland, that show is sold out.

1172
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,620
Sorry, but if you want, you can come see us in Seattle.

1173
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,620
There are still a bunch of tickets available for that one.

1174
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,620
If you're going to be in Seattle for PAX,

1175
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,620
you can come to the show,

1176
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:30,620
but you do not need a PAX badge to get into the M-B-M-B-A-M show.

1177
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:33,620
Those tickets are going fast and they're reserved seating.

1178
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,620
Yes.

1179
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,620
Do not wait. Do not hesitate.

1180
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,620
Go get those tickets.

1181
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,620
We haven't mentioned it in a while,

1182
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,620
but we've got PO boxes for the show

1183
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,620
an East Coast and a West Coast HQ.

1184
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,620
If there's anything you would like to send us,

1185
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,620
we get a lot of wedding invitations.

1186
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,620
That always makes us feel pretty special.

1187
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:54,620
Doesn't make you feel special though when we do not respond to them.

1188
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,620
We do not make it.

1189
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:01,620
The West Coast PO Box is PO Box 341769, 341769,

1190
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,620
Los Angeles, California 90034.

1191
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:09,620
PO Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia 2576.

1192
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,620
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters

1193
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,620
for the use of our theme song,

1194
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,620
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1195
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:18,620
You should definitely, definitely buy and listen to that album a lot

1196
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,620
because it's super-duper good.

1197
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,620
And best of luck, as always, to John Roderick

1198
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,620
on his Seattle City Council run.

1199
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:28,620
We are rooting for you, even if we can't vote for you

1200
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:31,620
because we don't live in Seattle.

1201
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,620
I might do an absentee ballot.

1202
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,620
I don't think that's how that works, Travis.

1203
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,620
Oh, bummer.

1204
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,620
There's new merch in the Max Fund Store,

1205
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,620
new Max Fund merch,

1206
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,620
including an incredibly awesome new Sol Bones shirt.

1207
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:47,620
So go check it out, maxfundstore.com.

1208
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,620
And we also have by Sydney's Sister Taylor.

1209
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,620
There's lots of My Brother, My Brother, Me merch there,

1210
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,620
other Max Fund merch.

1211
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,620
Go check it out.

1212
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:58,620
And please, if you can, share the show with a buddy,

1213
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,620
rate it, review it on iTunes.

1214
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:03,620
We don't spend any money advertising the show.

1215
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,620
We never have.

1216
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:07,620
We literally never have, so if you can help us out.

1217
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,620
And we never will.

1218
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,620
Well, I don't know about that.

1219
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,620
I'm on my fucking grind now.

1220
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,620
But if you can just help us out now

1221
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:16,620
when we're still in our five-year-long grassroots campaign

1222
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,620
by just telling a friend about the show

1223
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,620
and making them listen to an episode

1224
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,620
when they're in your car with you.

1225
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,620
If you listen to our show and you just realize that,

1226
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,620
hey, I've been listening to five years worth of this show

1227
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,620
and I've never reviewed it,

1228
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:30,620
we're at 2,996 reviews on iTunes.

1229
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,620
I want to make it into the big leagues, please.

1230
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,620
13 missed episodes in five years.

1231
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,620
Justin wants to be Mr. 3000 is what he's saying.

1232
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,620
Basically, yes.

1233
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,620
And, Watson, we get asked this a lot.

1234
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,620
If you would like to have a Jumbotron message,

1235
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:46,620
if you would like to wish someone a happy birthday

1236
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:49,620
or happy anniversary or just say,

1237
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,620
hey, I think you're great in the money zone,

1238
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:54,620
then just go to MaximumFun.org forward slash Jumbotron

1239
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:57,620
and you can set it all up there.

1240
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:01,620
We do a lot of them, so we can't guarantee a timeframe.

1241
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,620
It may be a delay.

1242
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,620
So non-time-specific, if you're willing to wait,

1243
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,620
it's a great way to tell someone you like them.

1244
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,620
And go listen to the other Max Fun shows.

1245
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,620
If you haven't, Jordan, Jesse, go.

1246
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,620
Stub Pockets and Yourself, Throwing Shade,

1247
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,620
Sawbones, The Adventure Zone, Bunker Buddies,

1248
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,620
we do those three.

1249
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,620
There are a ton of really great shows.

1250
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,620
Lady of the Lady, One Bad Mother, Pop Rocket.

1251
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,620
Just go to MaximumFun.org and poke around.

1252
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:27,620
Look around.

1253
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,620
There's a dropdown list of all the shows.

1254
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,620
You're going to like all of them.

1255
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,620
Oh, and a special plug here.

1256
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,620
A friend of the show, John Hodgman,

1257
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,620
is coming to our hometown.

1258
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,620
Well, not our hometown, but our home state,

1259
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,620
Charleston, West Virginia, live.

1260
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,620
What?

1261
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,620
In June.

1262
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,620
Yes, this is happening.

1263
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,620
So just search for John Hodgman Charleston

1264
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,620
and you'll see tickets.

1265
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:52,620
I'm going to be there and I'm going to try to con my way

1266
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,620
on the stage to get my...

1267
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,620
I just want applause.

1268
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,620
I don't really want to do anything for it.

1269
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,620
But tickets are very reasonable, 30 bucks.

1270
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,620
It's part of Festival June 22nd in Charleston.

1271
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,620
So go see our buddy John Hodgman.

1272
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,620
With me.

1273
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:08,620
Y'all ready for that final?

1274
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:09,620
You know it.

1275
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,620
Yeah.

1276
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,620
Y'all ready for my new mixtape?

1277
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,620
This final mixtape is fire.

1278
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,620
And it was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

1279
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,620
Thank you, Zoe.

00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,620

1285
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,620
It's asked by Doug Yahoo.

1286
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,620
Doug Yahoo asks...

1287
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:37,620
Why does the footballist Steve Madden

1288
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,620
now make fashion shoes?

1289
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,620
I'm Justin McElroy.

1290
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,620

This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1293
00:53:49,620 --> 00:54:08,620
Get your dad's score out of the lips.

I'm Magnus Burnside, the fighter.

1301
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,620
Did you guys like that?

1302
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,620
Did you, the listener, like that?

1303
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,620
You were just swept up in a world of high fantasy and magic

1304
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,620
where anything can happen and anything is possible.

1305
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,620
Hi, I'm Griffin McElroy, dungeon master for The Adventure Zone,

1306
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:38,620
a new podcast on Maximumfun in which magic and mystery intertwine

1307
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:42,620
for a very erotically charged role-playing experience.

1308
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,620
You can catch it every other Thursday here on Maximumfun.org or iTunes.

1309
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,620
It's for Dungeons and Dragons, but with family.
