1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,000
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,320
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. Griffin and Justin are away. They're traveling

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,080
about this great world of ours, exploring new adventures. I don't know. I think they're working.

8
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,840
I don't really pay attention when they talk. But this is our best of episodes. It's episode

9
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,280
82 to 91, so we're getting close to that 100 episode mark. We hope you enjoy it. It includes

10
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,960
a lot of my favorite bits, including Dwarf and Cake Boss and a bunch of good ones. So I hope

11
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:33,680
you'll like it. And yeah, here you go. Enjoy. Who has this much time? You know, when I last

12
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,840
updated my status update, when I want people to know that I did something cool, that's the only

13
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,760
time that you should ever update your status or twitter or anything. If you're doing something

14
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,360
cooler than somebody else might be doing that exact second, that's when you tweet. Or you're

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,200
making something good for dinner. Over half of my status updates just say,

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,080
check out this thing I did. That's basically it. I made this. I made this thing. Okay, and as much

17
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,560
as I hate people that are just like, I went to the store today, what I really hate is those ones

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,800
that are like, a, you know, a true friend will do this, but a dear friend, and I'm just like,

19
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,800
fuck you. You know, that's people that don't actually have friends. Can you give me, can you

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,240
give me an example of what you mean, Travis? Oh, you're gonna have to give me a second. I'd love

21
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,240
an example too. I would love this. You're gonna have to give me a second. No, no, no. I would

22
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:27,680
love it just like straight off the dome freestyle. Uh, I don't know. Oh God, give me a fuck. So like,

23
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,240
a true friend will drive you to the airport. A dear friend will fly the plane.

24
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:43,680
A good guy will get you flowers. The right guy will eat them for you. Eat these flowers. Prove

25
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,960
you love me. Eat these rhododendrons. Prove your love and eat the rhododendrons. Eat them, David.

26
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,280
Bite the rose. Bite the rose, David. Bite the rose, David. Um, what if our dreams are just

27
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,680
blurred memories of our previous lives? What? These are all coming to us from Yahoo Answers

28
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,960
user Los Pumas, who, uh, is really turned out about 60 of these. Okay. Dear parents,

29
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,600
just because it's your house doesn't mean it's not my privacy. Sincerely, teens.

30
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:26,000
Is this guy 45? Teens. Teens. Guess what? It does mean that. It means it. It means it all over.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,160
Teens. That's our new sign off for my brother. My brother and me. Kiss your dad's green lips

32
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:40,640
is gone. Teens is it. Oh my God. There's websites that generate Facebook statuses for you. Oh, no,

33
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:49,280
teens. Now I have a virus. Uh, this is an advice show for the modern era. We're going to get to

34
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,400
the advice in just a second. But first, some lady in this audience has a secret about these two.

35
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,520
Oh. Yes, it's true. She knows who she is. She is probably too ashamed to admit it. Um,

36
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:08,480
when I get nervous pre-show, and I always do, uh, I gotta make peeps. And sometimes I have to use

37
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,480
the one closest to the green room, which in this case was the ladies room. We didn't want to,

38
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,560
I guess, ruin the magic of the show by exposing ourselves to the audience. Uh, there were two

39
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,960
stalls in there. Travis and I agree on peep procedure. We both went in, went in both stalls.

40
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:30,560
There she is. There she is. Okay. Normally I would apologize, but you did not follow the

41
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,440
bathroom procedure. You didn't take all the handle. Didn't knock on the door. She didn't

42
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,000
expect there to be two dudes. You always have to expect two dudes. You always expect two dudes in

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,360
the bathroom. This is a classy show. She shouldn't have to expect two dudes hanging out crossing the

44
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:55,280
streams. There were two different stalls. We did pause in the middle and switch stalls,

45
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,280
but that's just so we could get the full experience. And I giggled in the middle of the

46
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,880
act, like, cause it was so ridiculous to do it. And we high-fived as we were passing. That part's

47
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,200
not true. I definitely giggled though. And I couldn't just, was I giggling when you came in?

48
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:18,080
Cause that would, God, God damn it. I think it's rid of the pre-show jitters,

49
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,600
like supreme embarrassment. Yeah. That's a, that's a deep shame.

50
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:31,680
God damn it. No, my dad reads those. The jig is up. Oh man.

51
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:41,360
Um, okay. So, uh, he says I'm a Grinch. It doesn't matter what holiday it is.

52
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,440
Christmas, Thanksgiving, Halloween, 4th of July. He did not include candle nights,

53
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,800
but I'm assuming or anything else. Just can't get excited for him. Want to get excited,

54
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,800
enjoy the holidays, but just can't seem to. How can I stop being a Grinch? Like things.

55
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,240
Okay. Normally we try to cut a little deeper to the bone here on our show,

56
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,000
but I guess like things is a, is a perfectly suitable answer.

57
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,160
Like every holiday, like Columbus day and like Canadian Thanksgiving and stuff.

58
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,400
What about Independence day? Maybe they all the aliens.

59
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,600
Can you not eat super fruit gummies during the show? Sorry. You sound like my,

60
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,080
this is my chaw addicted brother, Griffin. He loves two things, bad advice and smokeless tobacco.

61
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,760
Um, no, but really Independence day, not a fan of that. It's just fireworks and hot dogs. How can

62
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,920
you not get into things exploding? And also there are hot dogs there. Is every day of your life a

63
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,200
holiday? Are you Tim McGraw live like it was like I was dying style every day out there,

64
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,920
skydiving, rock and mountain climbing? No. Well, you're here. So I can tell that's not true.

65
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:53,520
Wow. What do you have? Let me say this. Do you have anything against them or is it just like,

66
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,920
eh, I don't feel it. Oh, welcome to adulthood.

67
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,520
Guess what? Nothing's as good as it used to be. You turn like 16 and people stop giving you candy

68
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,480
and sparklers and it's sad from now on. Yeah. You have to, but then you have to drink chillers and

69
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:17,600
five hour energy drinks just to feel. Yeah. We have a cure for your problem. It's called alcohol.

70
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,040
Get on the bus. What I found in my adult life is all the holidays that I loved as a kid,

71
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,000
like Halloween and Christmas and stuff. I had to give those up to appreciate holidays,

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
like St. Patrick's day. Sacrifice a few holidays so that the other ones mean more.

73
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,840
No, I'm just saying like, I've learned to appreciate. I don't have to go to work today days

74
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,680
and I get to drink all day. How do you not like those days? What's wrong with you?

75
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,720
I think you're too broken for our help, but sir, I'm sorry. You will be issued a full refund.

76
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,520
You were not.

77
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,040
I have a Yahoo. A Yahoo, you say? I have Yahoo Answers. From the Yahoo Answers service. From

78
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,280
the Yahoo Answers platform. Okay. That was developed. I can't stop drinking it even though

79
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,160
I know it's like an experiment now. It's like mouth art for your mouth. This one was sent in

80
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,080
by Alethea Eckhart. Thank you, Alethea. It's by Yahoo Answers user Nevaeh, who asks,

81
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,240
have it backwards. Hey everybody, by the way, cheese it with that. All right. Unless your name

82
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,400
is Nevaeh and you're here, in which case it's lovely. Who asks, what can I get a horse and dog

83
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,760
for Christmas? We're having a Christmas party on this Saturday and we're doing Secret Santa

84
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,680
and I got a horse named Daisy and a dog named Bandit, which Bandit is kind of old and only

85
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,200
has 20% vision. So I can't really get him toys. So what else can I get a dog that only has 20%

86
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:58,320
vision? Euthanasia. And what do you buy a horse for Christmas besides treats? Horse treats,

87
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,120
apples, sugar. Hey, guess what? That's the only thing that horses give a shit about and not being,

88
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,600
those three things and not being kicked in the sides. Those are the four things the horse is

89
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,200
like. I got you this necklace of roses. I like oats and not having a man on me.

90
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,240
Maybe you could get him a smaller horse and a smaller dog. But you know what? Even those

91
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,760
horses give a shit about holidays. Just saying. Hey, just saying. Get it together. They get a

92
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,280
little extra trot in their gallop right around Thanksgiving and stuff. I don't know what horses

93
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:43,680
like anymore. In my day, horses, they appreciated the simpler things like Smucker's Raspberry

94
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,960
Preserve. I used to have my finger on the equestrian pulse and nowadays I just feel so divorced from

95
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,840
it. You know what you could do? You could get the horse a dog present and the dog a horse present

96
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,960
and then they swap them, Gifted and Magi, and they become best friends. That's not how Gifted

97
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:06,480
and Magi work. Thanks for the watch chain, it's yours now. Gifted the lazy guy. Swapperoo. News

98
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,960
flash, if you're a horse, you don't fucking know that. Take it for granted. Somebody tells you to

99
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,880
run in a circle, you're like, okay boss. I guess, thanks. I hope I get oats for this. We've gone,

100
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,400
I don't know, five minutes without addressing the fact that someone got a horse and a dog and a

101
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:27,200
Secret Santa. What kind of fucking Secret Santa is this? What kind of Secret Santa is there where

102
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,600
you draw a human being saying like, oh, whoo, shots to blood there. Someone that wears shoes

103
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,000
and pants and stuff. Yeah, I got the short straw, looks like I got the horse. Good news, you can

104
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,840
give the straw to the horse. You will enjoy that very much. Why is your response not, this is a

105
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:50,560
horse. I think there's been a clarifying error. You have written Bandit. No, I entered the human Secret

106
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,520
Santa. I'm a human and I have a horse. Is the horse and dog draw names? What the fuck is that

107
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,880
horse gonna get? All I got is these shoes, they're like an apple. Do you want this eaten apple?

108
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,320
Steven the human isn't gonna like this apple. Bad news for Dorothy and accounting,

109
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,000
you're not getting anything. Don't even buy a gift, you're going home empty-handed.

110
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,960
Here's a Yahoo that has nothing to do with snooze. It's by Yahoo Answers, sent in by

111
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,720
Nefariosity. Thank you Nefariosity. It's by Yahoo Answers user question mark who asks,

112
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:45,280
what do angels eat for my book? How to cook for angels. I'd read it. I would, I'd read it.

113
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,800
That Shiner Buck is so good after drinking that orange jizz for 30 minutes. That's because it's

114
00:11:50,800 --> 00:12:02,640
made here in Austin. I am writing a book and the girl in my book is pregnant with an angel

115
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,280
and I want her to have something to crave. Unfortunately, it's a biography.

116
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,400
You're not writing a book, let's be honest. You're justifying to your dad.

117
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,960
Yeah, daddy it's an angel. Trust me, it's an angel baby. I'm trying to win a bet with my stupid

118
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:29,280
friends. What do angels eat? Two different people in the Yahoo Answers platform wrote angel food

119
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:36,800
cake. Good one guys. Nobody said angel hair pasta. Could get another angel based. What about devil's

120
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:44,560
food cake? Can you believe it? Travis, if you make the jokes that are as bad as the jokes that are in

121
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,760
there, then people don't have to listen. No, I said it in a tone of voice like I'm mocking them,

122
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,240
but it's all I could come up with. If we just had bad jokes snidely for 30 minutes, would you guys

123
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:59,520
be cool? I think like anything. I guess anything they want to. Obviously their teeth are made of

124
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:10,240
metal. Angels I pretty sure only eat cloud-based foods. So like cloud burgers. Like cloud burgers

125
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,960
mostly. Right. Did they eat like tacos? Cloud tacos. They can eat cloud tacos. They're not

126
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:23,280
exclusively towards cloud burgers. There's a lot of cloud-based foods in this situation that I'm

127
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:29,760
whipping up live on stage. Griffin's out there on a bold new frontier and he's writing the rules.

128
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,200
They'll keep challenging me on this. What about cupcakes? God damn it. Yeah, they eat those too,

129
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,880
but they're made of clouds. In this situation I'm creating. What about- Have you guys ever seen

130
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:48,240
improv before? This is how it works. Normally we record for an hour and 15 minutes. You get a 55

131
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,640
minute show and these are the gems you're missing out on. If you could believe it, you would be robbed

132
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:58,320
of cloud tacos. This is my brother, my brother, me, face to face, three, Tokyo Drift, the cutting

133
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,960
room floor. Do angels have to- Do angels- Let me bring it down. Do angels have to- Things are

134
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:12,240
getting too funny. Let's have a really intense theological discussion. What do you guys think

135
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,520
about angels? If I get to heaven- Taking all comers. When I get to heaven and I become an angel,

136
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,480
because I think I did a pretty good job down here. Pretty sure that's how it works. I don't

137
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,960
want to have to have the onus of eating on me. Angels only eat because they're hungry, because

138
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:40,640
then actually angels only eat to take food away from poor people. This is mine. This isn't made

Answers. God. I know, she sent in link 30. It's by Yahoo Answers user Mycroft who asks,

141
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,760
what are some awkward places to hang mistletoe? Belt buckle. Gallows. Funny, awkward, uncomfortable,

142
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:08,640
or bizarre places to hang mistletoe? Shanks. On the top of the coffin. Oh man. What? It's Christmas.

143
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:16,640
Yeah. Oh gosh. The top of the speculum? I don't know what that means. Okay. What's a funny,

144
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:23,280
awkward place to hang- You know what I really like? On your belt buckle. That's hysterical.

145
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:28,240
No, I already said that one. We know. We're commenting on the comedy. Belt buckles was good.

146
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,960
Yeah. What about on the back of the belt loop of your pants so it looks like you're saying,

147
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:39,120
kiss my fanny. That's what I reduced it for candle lights. You have to say fanny? Now just

148
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,520
so you know, Griffin, in many countries that aren't America, fanny means something completely

149
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,320
different. Is that true? Yeah. I didn't know that. What does it mean? That's darty. I don't want to

150
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,880
know about it because it's candle lights. No, you don't. All right. What about anywhere? Anywhere

151
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,280
in the world? Anywhere that you hang mistletoe is always awkward and terrible. Guys, have you ever

152
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:05,760
been- We've all been on this planet for between 28 and 31 years. No, 25 years, right? 24. That's

153
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,760
okay. It's Christmas. You don't know my age. That's all I want. I asked you for Christmas for

154
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:17,440
a card. A birth certificate. I wanted you and Obama to give me a birth certificate for Christmas.

155
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,040
Have you guys ever been to a Christmas party or gathering or somebody's house where there was

156
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:31,760
actually mistletoe on display? Yes, but not until recently. I went to a party and I walked into the

157
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,440
kitchen. Hold on, wait. This story sounds like it's going to be long. Will it also be funny?

158
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,760
Yeah. It's very short. Is it linked to humor? Let me assuage your fears. It's very short,

159
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:49,600
but not funny. Okay, break on through then. I walked into the kitchen and looked up and there

160
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,280
was mistletoe hanging in the middle of the room and around the perimeter of the room were eight

161
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:03,840
guys looking really uncomfortable waiting for a girl to walk into the room. What are you doing?

162
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:10,160
Look up. You got me. Get some chapstick. Get your birch bees. It's smidgen time.

163
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,600
Maybe this was a fever dream, but I feel like I went to a boy-girl party in middle school

164
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,200
where mistletoe was hung aloft from the rafters like something that you hang from rafters.

165
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,040
I think it's the most awkward thing in the world and I wish we would stop doing it.

166
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:34,080
I've never been smooched. No, thanks to mistletoe. I don't think that's a real thing people are

167
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,440
doing. Are there any good answers? The fifth street overpass. The end of my dog's tail.

168
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,880
Whoa. That's awful. And last but certainly not least, on your mom. Okay, it was funny for a

169
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:54,640
minute. What's it? Above the toilet. I like that actually. Kiss the toilet. Kiss that toilet before

170
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,840
you use it. Hey everybody in mistletoe, you know that you don't just have to kiss whatever inanimate

171
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,040
object home. It's not like a binding contract. That's what people said on your dad's wardrobe.

172
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,040
The litter box on a table lamp. Light switch. Come here, light switch. Cassandra says,

173
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,360
put it in the guy's locker room. Smiley face. I don't think that's going to play out how you

174
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,200
think it's going to play out. Good game, Brock. Hey, Brick, come here. Did you just name them Brick

175
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:30,080
and Brock? Hello, Brock. Hello, Brick. I guess we should have seen this coming. Christmas law

176
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,120
binds us, Brick. I know, Brock. Why are we so adherent to it? Hey, good hockey. Come here.

177
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,040
That's hockey sweater. Let me take it off of you. I want to kiss you under the mistletoe.

178
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,400
Hey, what's going on in here? Get out of here, Brack. Get out of here, Brack. Brick and Brock

179
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,840
are kissing. Come over here, Brick. You're cool. Brick, it's time for this kiss party. Guys,

180
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,280
it's pronounced Bruce for the last time. It's Bruce. It's Bruce.

my pigtails and die, who asks, if you were a legitimate vampire, as 99% of the world is,

183
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,680
who would you surprise with the gift of eternal life this Christmas? For me, it would be Bob from

184
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,520
accounting. He has nice hair, and it deserves to look that way forever. Wow. A legitimate vampire.

185
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,840
Not one of these fakie, not one of these fly-by-night, Johnny-come-lately vampires.

186
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,200
Not one of these kids that go to the mall on a hot topic, and they bite the fangs,

187
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,800
and they put them on their teeth, and they bite each other. Yeah. And then they get sick

188
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:41,520
from the bites. From the bites and the Chinese-made fake fangs. They've made of lead,

189
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,160
and you get sick from putting them in your mouth, and then from putting them in the neck.

190
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,320
I don't know if I can say this or not, but I think I would give that eternal life to the pope.

191
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,560
Make him forever pope. Oh, no. Really? You're enjoying John Ratzenberg that much?

192
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,120
Enjoying John Ratzenberg that much that you're going to keep him as a turnip pope? I just kind

193
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,680
of like the idea of forever pope. I feel like he could really get a lot done. That's impossible.

194
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,120
Think about it. If he... None of us are Catholic, by the way. Go on. No, I'm not Catholic.

195
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:17,600
I'm not. If you're a vampire, you can't... How is your day going to be? He wears a cross

196
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,880
on his hat. It's going to be unpleasant. It's going to be unpleasant. It's a labor of love.

197
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,680
I'm going to live forever, and I'm going to have migraines the whole time.

198
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,360
Because there's a cross on my hat. Like, what are you talking about? The pope is the worst.

199
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,600
I don't know anybody... His whole style is going to have to change. I mean, that's obvious.

200
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,480
I don't know anybody with more day-to-day cross exposure than the pope.

201
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,160
Okay, then I'm going to switch to David Boreanaz. Well, that's a little on the nose.

202
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,480
Yeah, he's the pope of my heart. I know he can do it. I've seen him succeed

203
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,400
as a vampire previously. You are the only one I know that can handle this power.

204
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,320
I'm going to say Ellen. Why Ellen?

205
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,040
Can you... Here's my reasoning. Can you imagine a world after Ellen, post Ellen, P.E.?

206
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,160
Uh... Can you imagine the year one P.E.?

207
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,600
I cannot, and I don't think the world could either. I don't want to imagine. I just want to

208
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,280
see her dance, and she'll dance the whole show and never get tired because she's a vampire,

209
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,880
and then she'll get angry at her guests who get tired. Because, like, when you're a vampire,

210
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,680
you can pretty much dance forever. Can I do Robert Pattinson just as, like,

211
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,120
payback? Surprise.

212
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,480
Surprise. Now you live forever. Oh, what if you gave him eternal life and

213
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,560
then immediately staked him through the heart? Just, like, right away. One-two punch.

214
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,240
Well, that would just be... That would be murder. Or could you get it around the murder charge?

215
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,640
Because that is undead. He was a vamp.

216
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,000
Yeah. You cannot be tried for killing a vamp.

217
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,440
Okay. That's true.

218
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,880
Or a tramp. You can get one from a rail car.

219
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,080
Or a scamp. Or a scamp. Get out of here. I'm going to tell you.

220
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,560
Oh, now I've got it. I'm going to turn all of the rail riders, all of the lovable hobos,

221
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,920
into vampires. Oh, my God. Hey, ABC,

222
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,200
I will sell you the series that I just created about...

223
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,400
Boxcar vampires....beautiful boxcar vampires that ride the

224
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,480
rails at 40k. Boxcar trampires.

225
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,320
Oh, tramp. Boxcar trampires. Boxcar trampires.

226
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,240
What they'll do is they'll go around and have premarital sex, and then they'll... Some of them

227
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,640
go to college. And some of them learn a little bit about love, but a lot about themselves.

228
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,080
Yeah. And one of them is Neff Campbell. More like matronly, I think.

229
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,680
I would have gone with Misha Barton, because she looks vampiric in the face region.

230
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,520
She does, right? She looks hollow.

231
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,800
Her and Tilda Swinton, I think, would be a good...

232
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,440
Tilda Swinton can be her mom. Can we sign Tilda on?

233
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,320
I'm not ready for TV. You get to play a boxcar vampire. Where do I sign?

234
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,400
How many times do I have to sign to be a boxcar vampire?

235
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,200
That is an undeniable role. I want you to know,

236
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,160
that sounds like Russell Brand doing an impression of Tilda Swinton.

237
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,320
How about Russell Brand, the vampire? What's he doing? Russell,

238
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,160
he already looks like he lives in a boxcar.

239
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,480
Whatever the opposite of eternal life is, I would like to give to Russell Brand.

240
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,040
I would like to give him like 30 second life remaining.

241
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,480
Have life. Just to see what he does. Only now do I know what it means to truly live.

242
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,800
Here's the thing. In this day and age, people change jobs. Millennials.

243
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:30,080
No one is tied to any one position anymore, which makes creating past work experience

244
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,600
just the easiest thing. Pick a friend, write down their cell phone number,

245
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:44,080
say they were the manager at the now defunct, etc. And then have the manager call them.

246
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,360
Your friend will say whatever you tell them to.

247
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,960
You know, have the manager call us. We'll say whatever you want.

248
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,880
Yeah, I'll lie. I'll put a message.

249
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,960
For five dollars, I'll tell them you were president.

250
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,480
Is it possible that it's not like they're under qualified,

251
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,280
like they don't have the years of experience, but they're under qualified,

252
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:08,240
like it's a job as like an engineer or like as a surgeon and they just don't have any knowledge?

253
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,080
Well, I fucking hope it's not a surgeon.

254
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,760
Yeah, I would hope so too.

255
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,400
I don't think the people who listen to our show are clinically unstable,

256
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,160
which seems to be the picture that you're painting.

257
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,160
Now, come in here, Dylan. What prepares you to be a marine biologist?

258
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,680
Nothing.

259
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,160
Nothing.

260
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,600
Absolutely nothing.

261
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,840
I like fish and I'm scared of water. Let's get this done.

262
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,120
Let's learn some shit about otters.

263
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:37,600
I got you. I got an underwater microscope. Come on. Science. Where's the whale?

264
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,280
Where's the whale at?

265
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,360
Which one's the shark again?

266
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,560
Okay. Yeah, that's right.

267
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,360
I want to put my microscope on a shark.

268
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,320
I'm going to call in that big fish like Jonah did. Remember?

269
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,400
I'm going to learn about his inside part.

270
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,120
By the way, I only believe in sciences in the Bible. Let's do this. I'm unqualified.

271
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,320
The Bible and Pinocchio.

272
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,080
This is my dream.

273
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,800
This is my dream, sir.

274
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,640
This is my dream job. I fucking hate fish. I hate this. Let's do it.

275
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,360
Come on, you slimy bitches.

276
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,400
Look at him flop around on the table. This is crazy.

277
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,440
Somebody get me a science knife. I'm going to go to town on this fish.

278
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,280
Give me a science knife. I gots to cut this whale open.

279
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,600
Tell you what, I'm not qualified for this job,

280
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,240
but I'm going to dissect this octopus right in front of you. Watch. You watch. You watch.

281
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,200
I'm going to cut off some squid legs, put it on this octopus,

282
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,280
make the ultimate tentacle monster animal.

283
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,440
Is this science yet? Did we do it?

284
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,240
I want to do some science. Drop me in this tank. I'm going to tie this octopus' legs together like Popeye.

285
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,800
Let's keep the food train rolling. This one was sent in by Galiayali. Thanks, Galiayali.

286
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Hi? That's H-I-G-H and then a question mark.

287
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,760
Who asks, yes?

288
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,840
You're on Yahoo Answers, I'm going to assume.

289
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,280
What do you do to make the most of your time?

290
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,040
What do you do to make the lettuce on your sandwich feel sexy?

291
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
Wait, uh-huh.

292
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,960
The responses to this question really shows off that Yahoo Answers is just an Algonquin

293
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,160
roundtable of comedy.

294
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,440
Is there no more to the question?

295
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:21,840
That's it.

296
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,880
No, that's it. That's it.

297
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,680
Uh, Megan responded, lay my meat on it real slow, then squirt mayo on it.

298
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,680
Oh, God.

299
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:38,560
I get it all wet, put it under water just to make it so much more important that the rest of the lettuce,

300
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:43,680
when really I'm just trying to wash any bacteria off, then I get kinky with it and bite it.

301
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,680
That got, that took a weird practical turn in the middle.

302
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,040
Yo, girl, you know DDT and what all, and then I funk it.

303
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,760
Dress it up in something sexy, not mayo.

304
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,800
I can't enjoy it if it's dry unless it stays completely naked.

305
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,560
Whisper naughty things to it.

306
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,960
Put it in your mouth to bite it and suck on it.

307
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,080
This is lettuce.

308
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,880
Everybody, it's lettuce.

309
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,960
Like, what's the matter with you?

310
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,280
Let me suck on this sandwich, Fixins.

311
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,480
I forgot, I've lost the place where it's Griffin and the Yahoo answer sings,

312
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,840
and now I just think my brother's is awful, awful mess of humanity.

313
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,280
Add salad cream.

314
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,520
Oh, God.

315
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,120
No, wait, hold on.

316
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,280
Does it say add salad cream?

317
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,440
Add salad cream in all caps and a smiley face at the end of it.

318
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Hey, America, that's not even a thing.

319
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,800
That's not a thing.

320
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,920
You made up salad cream for your dumb joke.

321
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,520
You mean salad dressing?

322
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,920
Uh, a special secret sauce.

323
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,000
Why are you, why are you jizzing on your sandwich?

324
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,320
Why are you objectifying lettuce?

325
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,120
Put that away.

326
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,600
How about you just eat it?

327
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,120
How about you just put it in your mouth?

328
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,920
Cause lettuce.

329
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,880
Hey, internet, stop what you're doing.

330
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,960
Put down the mouse, open the front door and walk outside.

331
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,320
And remember that you live in a real world with consequences for your actions.

332
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,520
Call your dad.

333
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,400
Call your dad.

334
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Just call him what you're doing right now.

335
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,560
You're talking about fucking lettuce.

336
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,080
Well, these sure are some hilarious bits, huh?

337
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,400
Yeah.

338
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,200
These bits, real top notch.

339
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,680
I love them and you should too.

340
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,520
But I wanted to take a quick time out to tell you about our sponsors this week.

341
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,320
Couple of them I think you already know about.

342
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,920
If you've listened to the show like ever before, you've probably heard of MeUndies.

343
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,520
But MeUndies is a new way of doing underpants.

344
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,000
And it's quite lovely, quite wonderful.

345
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,640
Not only the patterns, but the execution.

346
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,200
They're committed to making the world's most comfortable underwear.

347
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,760
And as far as I'm concerned, they have done it.

348
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,480
I wear MeUndies and you should too.

349
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,560
Gird your loins with only the greatest underpants in town.

350
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:01,120
And right now, they're offering 20% off your first order if you go to MeUndies.com

351
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,640
my brother.

352
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,040
And if you don't love them, your first pair is free.

353
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,360
But that's completely unnecessary because you will love them because they are wonderful

354
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,240
underpants.

355
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,920
We also want to tell you about Naturebox.

356
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,800
Naturebox, you know them.

357
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,920
By this point, I'd be amazed if anybody's not already doing Naturebox.

358
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,720
But you should be.

359
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,320
From snacks like peanut butter nom-noms or sriracha cashews and Asiago cheese crisps,

360
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,760
which are my favorite.

361
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,040
Naturebox has over 100 delicious snacks to choose from.

362
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,040
They can get delivered directly to your doorstep.

363
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,680
They release brand new choices every single month.

364
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,440
It's full of flavor, but without any of the junk, the stuff you don't want.

365
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,920
So head to naturebox.com slash my brother and unbox a world of taste and possibility.

366
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,920
If you go to naturebox.com slash my brother, your first box of hand-picked snacks sent

367
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,280
directly to your doorstep.

368
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,280
So trust me, if you haven't already tried it, you'll love it.

369
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,520
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

370
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,480
We also want to tell you to check out Scolding the Winds.

371
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,800
Riley is alone after being kicked out of her parents' house at 18, getting herself out

372
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,640
of an abusive relationship and finding comfort only in her vices.

373
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,800
She has no one left to count on, and when her feelings for a colleague begin to grow,

374
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,760
Riley wonders if love is the answer to life's problems, or if it's just one more reason

375
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,200
to pour another drink.

376
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,000
Interested in religion, love, or advertising?

377
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,360
Buy Scolding the Winds.

378
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:27,840
It's only $5, and it's Joel Kelly's debut novella, and it's just five bucks at Scolding

379
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
the Winds dot com.

380
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,400
It sounds really cool to me.

381
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,280
I'm going to check it out.

382
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,560
I think you should too.

383
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:38,640
Scolding the Winds dot com, that's like winds, like W-I-N-G-S dot com.

384
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,280
Check it out.

385
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,280
Also, do you enjoy puzzle games?

386
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,840
I do.

387
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,360
Well, let me tell you about this one.

388
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,800
Sure, it's your basic cryptogram game, but with runes.

389
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,360
Solve the puzzle by matching each rune to a letter.

390
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,560
Over a thousand puzzles, and all the content is free.

391
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:58,000
Categories include historical quotes, Shakespeare passages, and King James Bible verses.

392
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,960
Just go to iTunes app store and search for runic cryptogram.

393
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,280
Runic, like tunic, but with an R.

394
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:05,840
Go check it out.

395
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,840
That sounds really cool and exactly the kind of app I love, so I'm going to check it out.

396
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,720
I also have a message for Kate from Graham.

397
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,760
10 years ago, you chose to marry a man with the same name as your brother, which is absolutely

398
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,640
not weird.

399
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,120
You loved him, fed him, and quietly made his ugly green pants disappear.

400
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,480
Every day, I'm filled with joy and awe that you're my wife.

401
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,760
Here's to the next 10 years of laughter, fashion errors, and whenever possible, naps.

402
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
Sweet, sweet naps.

403
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,840
That's awesome, Graham, and Kate sounds like a wonderful person, and it sounds like you're

404
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,360
very lucky to have her, Graham.

405
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,560
You're very lucky.

406
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,520
You don't deserve her.

407
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,040
She's way too good for you.

408
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,960
But yeah, that's really great for you guys.

409
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,920
Congratulations.

410
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,440
And now, back to the show.

411
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,640
I'm ready.

412
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,440
Here comes Yahoo.

413
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,960
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

414
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,840
Thank you, Lisa.

415
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,880
It's by Yahoo Answers user steveman3015.

416
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,800
That's a pretty good username.

417
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:03,840
Yeah.

418
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:14,240
Who asks, what would happen if Uncle Jesse, in parentheses, John Stamos, from Full House,

419
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:21,680
do, if he got shorted a nugget at McDonald's, say he orders a 20-piece nugget.

420
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,920
He receives his order, he counts the nuggets, and he sees he only received 19 of them.

421
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,560
What would he do?

422
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,640
Now, this could just be a thought exercise that this guy is doing, but I would like to

423
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,880
think that this man, Steveman, has been shorted a nugget, and he's like, I don't know what

424
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,160
to do, and so I have to look.

425
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,280
Where can I look for advice?

426
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,080
Towards John Stamos, Uncle Jesse from Full House.

427
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:51,520
His WWUJFFHD bracelet.

428
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,160
I think that John Stamos would get really mad at the person behind the counter, but

429
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,640
then, after a moment's thought, he would have mercy.

430
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,100
Jesus.

431
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,320
I think he would-

432
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,880
Have mercy.

433
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,760
Give me another nugget.

434
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:12,960
I think he would get up, and he would leave the McDonald's restaurant, because he's-

435
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,320
And remember that he's John fucking Stamos.

436
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
He's John goddamn Stamos.

437
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,160
Why the hell is he at McDonald's ordering chicken nuggets?

438
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,720
Yeah.

439
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,760
Who could name the original name of Full House?

440
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,360
That's originally called House of Comics was the original bitch, and it was not a good

441
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:29,600
name.

442
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,680
Sourdough Sweethearts was the original name of the show.

443
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,800
What's with all these dudes?

444
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,300
Yeah.

445
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,880
Yeah, you know what the weirdest thing about Full House is?

446
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,760
If the mom wasn't dead, it would be the weirdest goddamn show on television.

447
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,160
Hey, have you guys seen the new episode of Lazy Uncles?

448
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,640
At one point, one of them was living in the living room.

449
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,960
They just, like, strung up a sheet, and that was his bedroom.

450
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,960
The theme song originally went, everywhere you look, there's an uncle.

451
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,400
There are uncles fucking everywhere.

452
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,640
And you know what's even weirder?

453
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,800
Only Uncle Jesse was related by blood.

454
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,600
Joey was just there.

455
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,400
Just there!

456
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,240
There's a fucking embarrassment of uncles in this household.

457
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,600
A murder of uncles.

458
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,000
That was actually the first title.

459
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,480
The original title was A Murder of Uncles.

460
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,960
Do you know that for seven years, Joey Gladstone would meet a woman at a bar and she would say,

461
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,640
should we go back to your place?

462
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,360
And he would say, I'm not sure that's a good idea.

463
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,800
I live with my friend and his brother-in-law and his three daughters and my brother-in-law's

464
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,960
wife and their twin sons and our dog.

465
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,200
And Kimmy Gibbler from time to time.

466
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,800
And Kimmy Gibbler occasionally.

467
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,280
And also all of my puppets and Popeye toys.

468
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:49,680
Right.

469
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,120
And I have to record the Rush Hour Renegades to probably get going.

470
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,400
You know, if that show were recorded today, Rush Hour Renegades would be a podcast, right?

471
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
And I don't need the competition, frankly.

472
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,360
That's true.

473
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,960
And maybe the Smash Club?

474
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,760
Is that it?

475
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,320
The Smash Club?

476
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,760
The Smash Club lives in their house?

477
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,920
I thought so.

478
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,400
I felt like that show was like some kind of horrific like MC Escher drawing where no one

479
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,360
could escape the house.

480
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,400
Like Uncle Jesse got married and had twins and they put him in the attic.

481
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:16,880
Yeah.

482
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,120
Well, like some kind of crazy aunt.

483
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:26,320
Let's also remember that Jesse's last name changed midstream and no one commented on

484
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:26,320
it.

485
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:26,640
It did?

486
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,360
So I'm not sure logic and reason hold sway in this.

487
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,680
True.

488
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,400
How do you know so fucking much about Full House Trilogy?

489
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,320
It used to be Jesse Cochran, but John Stamos wanted something that sounded more Greek.

490
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,640
So he picked the most Greek name that there is on the Earth.

491
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,840
Guys, this Yahoo answer was sent in by Chuck Jones.

492
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,720
Thanks, Chuck Jones.

493
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,720
Oh, it's so good.

494
00:35:52,720 --> 00:36:03,920
It's by Yahoo Answers user Gary who asks, thongs for men, in parentheses, boy skins?

495
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,520
Hi, I was wondering if anyone knew where the website boy skins is gone.

496
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,560
I wanted to buy a thong form there, but saw they no longer wear up.

497
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,440
I also wanted to buy my son one since he saw mine and wanted to try it.

498
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,960
No, I'm not a pedo.

499
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,440
He's 15 and can speak for himself, thanks.

500
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,360
Thanks, does anyone know where I can buy adult and youth boy thongs?

501
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:23,680
Thanks.

502
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,160
Oh, God.

503
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,480
Boy skins, if you couldn't tell from my pronunciation, does have a Z up on it.

504
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,240
Is there a Y?

505
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,920
No Y?

506
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,560
There is a Y.

507
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,000
I mean, at the end of boy, but not men skins, not mid skins.

508
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,280
Oh, no, no, no, no.

509
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,080
It would have been better if it was B-O-I-Skins-Z, but I was not so lucky.

510
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,000
But trademark ever living.

511
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,560
Mm-hmm, why is this a thing?

512
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,120
Boy skins website?

513
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,040
Everyone in the answers is saying go to Kmart and Walmart as if that's,

514
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,680
how do they, how is that, do they have those there?

515
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,040
I know from personal experience that Walmart does not have sock garters,

516
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,280
so I really doubt they have man thongs.

517
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,360
Can we call them boy skins from now on?

518
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,320
And also can we call our podcast boy skins from now on?

519
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:16,320
Hey, in the effort to actually give this person a helpful answer,

520
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,920
I just Googled boy skins and boy do I regret it.

521
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,720
I shouldn't have done that.

522
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,400
And if there are any government agents now monitoring my DSL usage, I'm sorry.

523
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,480
Very sorry, I didn't mean to do it.

524
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,400
Is boy skins, I don't see a website called boy skins.

525
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,520
I see a lot of usernames named boy skins and a Yahoo, a YouTube channel called boy skins.

526
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,840
So I'm thinking that this person's trying to start some branding.

527
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,800
Oh, all these accounts are closed.

528
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,120
I'm trying to Nancy Drew this shit, but.

529
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:54,240
Boy skins just fell off the face, well, fell off the butt of the internet, let's be honest.

530
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,960
About, nope, fuck.

531
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,480
Nope, you can't find boy skins anywhere.

532
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,880
There's a, there's a blog spot called boy skin.

533
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,800
Oh no, don't just go to boy skin at blog spot.

534
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,320
Oh, it's dicks all over dicks for miles.

535
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,120
How could this happen?

536
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,280
Well, you know, in 20 years on an episode of storage wars,

537
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,640
they'll open up a storage container and find this box after box label boy skins.

538
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,200
And they'd be looking at going, you know, the money skins are worth,

539
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,400
that's like a thousand dollars a box right there.

540
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,040
I'm seeing like $6,000 in thongs.

541
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,560
Is that a Hummel boy skin?

542
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,040
I can tell that looks like a Hummel boy skin.

543
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,720
I was hoping that they were going to find the boy skin website.

544
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,520
Cause I was curious how you were going to conceptualize that for me.

545
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,840
Do we have to domain name boy skins?

546
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:50,720
Underneath, underneath this, what appears to be an elderly woman sewing table folded

547
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,920
up in the shelves here.

548
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,240
There seems to be a website called boy skins.

549
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,920
It's become corporeal.

550
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,880
It looks hungry.

551
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,160
It seems, now this looks like a regular cupboard, but when you open it and go inside,

552
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,520
you exit on the other side into boy skins, the website.

553
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,680
Have a look around its directories and indexes.

554
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,880
You're going to like what you see.

555
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,560
You're going to be horrified at the way you look.

556
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,280
I guarantee it.

557
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,920
So Mr. Tumnus, you look fantastic.

558
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,920
Very svelte.

559
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,960
How did you get the tiny holes over your furry legs, Mr. Tumnus?

560
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,720
That is really doing some, it is shaping you very attractively.

561
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,560
That is the most vivid mental picture I think we've ever created on this show.

562
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,440
Cause I can't, I can't, it's a lot of, it's like-

563
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,320
I can't get it out.

564
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,360
And if you could see in my head, the look Mr. Tumnus is giving me is troubling.

565
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,640
Cause it's angry.

566
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,000
It's not like a seductive look.

567
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,280
He's angry that I'm there.

568
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,200
I'm forming this sentence with my mouth and speaking it with the power from my brain,

569
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,360
but I'm only dedicating about 1% of my brain to that task cause the other 99%

570
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,960
is dreaming up this visage.

571
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,600
And I can't.

572
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,200
I've been meaning to correct you children.

573
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,200
It's pronounced ass land.

574
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:15,760
Jesus.

575
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,160
Hey, I'm a straight red-blooded American male who in May is serving as best man at my gay

576
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,840
best friend's wedding.

577
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,600
Ceremony itself is very traditional, but I'm stumped when it comes to the bachelor party.

578
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:36,080
The attendee mix is going to be about 50, 50 straight gay with a few lesbians thrown

579
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,640
in for color.

580
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,880
How do I throw my pal a rainbow colored bachelor party?

581
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,760
Please note that my friend by his own admission is a terrible gay and he's expressed support

582
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,920
on one occasion, a desire to have an Asian lady stripper at his party getting down in

583
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,400
Durham.

584
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,040
Wow.

585
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,440
Wowzers.

586
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,840
I feel like the bulk of it's already planned.

587
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,160
This is a lot-

588
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,840
Asian lady stripper.

589
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,120
I mean, this is a- this is a real tough one.

590
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,800
We don't get many toughies like this.

591
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,320
Ultimately, the easy answer, which is to say the not funny answer, is you give him what

592
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,280
he wants and I guess an Asian lady stripper.

593
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,400
I guess that's what you do.

594
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,320
This is my answer.

595
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:12,960
The fun answer.

596
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,280
What can't- what can't you do?

597
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,160
God, you're right.

598
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,480
I'm imagining like a- like a coligulin miasma of genital delights.

599
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,840
Just a bacchanal.

600
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,320
Just a-

601
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:22,720
Yeah.

602
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,000
What's a- what can- what do you want because it's everywhere.

603
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,320
The fucking sky's the limit as far as fucking goes.

604
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,360
Earthly delights.

605
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,240
Put it anywhere.

606
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,960
Happy bachelor party.

607
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,560
Sorry Dave couldn't marry you.

608
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,840
He died last night.

609
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,640
He OD'd on hedonism.

610
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,400
Now he's a- he's a weird sexaholic and he can only love gay dead-

611
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:56,400
He was drinking wine out of a lady's hair and he was going crazy.

612
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:56,880
Are we done?

613
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,320
Maybe a cake?

614
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,440
I don't know.

615
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,280
Maybe a tasteful cake.

616
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,000
Some- some balloons?

617
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,920
Hey, welcome to Cake Boss.

618
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,320
This week on Cake Boss, we're making a big cake shaped like a butthole for a gay guy's bachelor

619
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,200
party with an Asian lady stripper gonna pop out of it.

620
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,040
We're making a cake-

621
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,320
This cake looks like a dick going into a cake shaped like a vagina going into a

622
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,240
cake shaped like another vagina.

623
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,040
Cake Boss.

624
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,720
Cake Boss.

625
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,520
Stay tuned for the littlest chocolatiers, by which I mean they're inside the cake.

626
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,240
What the fuck?

627
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,160
I'm making eight dicks today.

628
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,880
Cake Boss.

629
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,000
This isn't even for a party.

630
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,800
This isn't even being filmed right now.

631
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,440
This butthole cake's for Cake Boss. Cake Boss.

632
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,600
This cake's for-

633
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,200
Fucking Cake Boss.

634
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:15,840
This cake's made of sand and also I'm a ghost.

635
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,080
Yeah.

636
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:30,000
Guys, this Yahoo answer was- should I- should we Yahoo it?

637
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,680
Yeah, I was about to ask you for one and then you fucking incepted me.

638
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:34,960
I love it.

639
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,640
This Yahoo was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

640
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,760
Thank you, Lisa.

641
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,880
Lisa is becoming, quickly, our top gold contributor.

642
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,520
This question was asked by Rezxion.

643
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,640
R-E-Z-X-I-A-N.

644
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,520
Rezek-

645
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,160
Rezektion.

646
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,840
Or perhaps Rejohn.

647
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,280
Oh no.

648
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:56,640
Rejohn.

649
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,960
Gucci Gucci Vinny Vinny Vinny Vinny Park.

650
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,840
Kreishon asks-

651
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,880
Gucci Gucci Vinny Vinny Vinny Park.

652
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,120
Gucci Gucci Gucci Vinchy Vinchy Marijuana.

653
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,880
What's up with these basic bitches?

654
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,760
Rejohn asks-

655
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,160
If you could assassinate any of the characters of Saved By The Bell, who would it be and how?

656
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,360
Zack, Slater, Screech, Kelly, Lisa, Jessie or Mr. Belding?

657
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,200
I would have to go with-

658
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,280
Probably A.C. Slater.

659
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,280
Oh my god.

660
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,280
You actually answered it.

661
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:42,200
Well, you know, the funny thing about this is that this is actually how Good Morning

662
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:48,040
Miss Bliss ended was with the assassination of Miss Bliss, and it was the catalyst of

663
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,040
Saved by the Bell.

664
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,720
That's how Saved by the Bell started.

665
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,720
As I'm going over this...

666
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,760
Hayley Mell's character, Miss Bliss, was assassinated.

667
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,120
As I'm going over this wiki, one of my favorite things that I've learned is that the creators

668
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:04,680
and writers and the producers and everything don't give two shits about continuity in

669
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:09,360
the Saved by the Bell universe, because like, so they cancelled Good Morning Miss Bliss

670
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,680
after like 12 episodes and re-launched it to Saved by the Bell, and so then when they

671
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,400
sold it into syndication, they just kind of wrapped the Good Morning Miss Bliss episodes

672
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,560
into it, and they're like, fuck it, no one will notice.

673
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,560
And nobody did.

674
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,560
They're kids, Donald.

675
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,560
They're kids.

676
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,480
Kids are stupid.

677
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,080
They just love Zack's hair, and they love romance between him and Kelly Kapowski.

678
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,080
Did you see?

679
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,280
He said, time out, and he had like a phone and shit.

680
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,280
It's awesome.

681
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,280
Back off.

682
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,160
I would, of course, assassinate Zack, because you do that, the infrastructure crumbles,

683
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,280
and you can slip in there, and then you're the cool guy.

684
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,080
You can't let anyone know you did it.

685
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:50,520
What you're failing to take into account, Justin, is that all of this is the dream of

686
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:58,760
Zack Morris, he's staring into a snow globe while his dad and mom sit in the corner going,

687
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:03,240
he just stares at it all day long.

688
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,040
When he freezes time, he actually is talking to his therapist.

689
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,600
Let's back up really quick, because first off, I don't think you assassinate a Saved

690
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,600
by the Bell character.

691
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,800
I think you can only murder them.

692
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:21,160
I think if you kill Zack or A.C. Slater, it's a murder and not an assassination, right?

693
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,160
What's the difference?

694
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,000
I thought you were going to say that you can't murder them because they're all vampires.

695
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,240
Well, that, but I don't know.

696
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,640
You can only slay them.

697
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:36,800
You assassinate a king or a political figure, but you murder a high school student.

698
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,880
I would assassinate Senator Zack Morris.

699
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:47,480
I mean, to be fair, Zack is basically the king of Bayside High.

700
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,400
I think he may have even referred to himself as such.

701
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,540
That's actually how the high school wars were started, is that Archduke Zack Morris was

702
00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:03,720
assassinated by one of the cast of California Dreams, actually assassinated Archduke Zack

703
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,880
Morris, and that was the start of...

704
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,960
The problem is is that the kids from California Dreams had a signed treaty with the cast of

705
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:19,080
Hang Loose that said that in the event of war, you have to fight with us, and pretty

706
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,080
soon it just got really hairy.

707
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,640
The Zack Attack Proclamation.

708
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,640
Mm-hmm.

709
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,640
Right.

710
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,680
We all recall.

711
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,360
Let's play a game called...

712
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,420
The shot heard around Bayside.

713
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:34,600
Let's play a game called Who on Yahoo Answers Scares the Shit Out of Me the Most?

714
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:40,640
Is it best answer submitter Ot Yowna who replies, AC Slater, I don't know how, but I'd make

715
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,640
it painful.

716
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,640
Whoa.

717
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,640
Okay.

718
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:48,920
Is it cutiepie1987 who says, Kelly, suffocation on pom-poms.

719
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,920
Wow.

720
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,320
Is it Chris who said, screech, I would choke him, I hate his voice.

721
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,000
Jesus Christ.

722
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,420
Was it James A?

723
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,280
It was James A, who responded, I would handcuff them all together in a circle, then I would

724
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,000
stand in the center wearing body armor and drop a live hand grenade.

725
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,760
Whoever lived would be subsequently beheaded.

726
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,760
Wow.

727
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,760
Wow.

728
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,240
I would watch that movie.

729
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,720
Dear internet, this is Travis.

730
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,520
We're breaking up.

731
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:23,620
Brynn McDonald 2005 said, Jessie, because she was one of the ones who left for most

732
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:27,960
of the show and returned only till the end for Kelly and Zack's wedding, I would have

733
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,400
her fall out her window room.

734
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,400
Wow.

735
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,920
Jessie, you fair weather bitch.

736
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,920
Wow.

737
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,320
Yeah, she's there when it suits her.

738
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,320
Yeah.

739
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,560
I would kill Tori Scott because clearly she is a phantasm.

740
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,360
Can we just kill nobody?

741
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,160
Can we not kill anybody on this fictional kids show?

742
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:54,560
You fuck.

743
00:48:54,560 --> 00:49:00,120
You know what's funny by definition about the phrase, I'm not a sports nut, is that

744
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:05,320
if you actually use the phrase sports nut, it automatically disqualifies you from the

745
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,320
distinction.

746
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,880
Unless you're Bob Euker.

747
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,480
If you're Bob Euker, he can say he's a sports nut.

748
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,480
Yeah.

749
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,080
Other than that, you don't like sports.

750
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,120
You're saying something you think someone like sports says.

751
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,680
I'm a bit of a sports nut.

752
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,240
I think you could call me a sports nut.

753
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,280
I spend time at the BW3s.

754
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:35,400
Someone could accurately classify me as a basketball man, a soccerista, a soccerista

755
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,400
in your country.

756
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,760
Well, I don't know what they call soccer.

757
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,760
Footballerino.

758
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,640
Football, footballist, I guess.

759
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:49,600
What about, no, I got nothing.

760
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,600
I like that honesty.

761
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,600
Polo.

762
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,600
That's what I was going for, polo.

763
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,600
Polo.

764
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,000
We need more horse-based sports.

765
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,480
We need to be more honest about the production of this show, Travis.

766
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,480
I like that.

767
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,480
Hit me.

768
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:12,080
This one was, this one was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

769
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,080
Thank you, Lisa.

770
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user, the Leviathan, who asks, how do you prepare for a staring

771
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,960
contest?

772
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,600
I always get into a staring contest with my cousin when I see him and I want to prepare

773
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,480
to finally beat him over the holidays.

774
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,960
What can I do to become a champ?

775
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,040
This is a good sport you can get into, right?

776
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,560
Step one, training montage.

777
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:38,120
Staring contest, you're going to, step one, you're going to want to moisturize.

778
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,360
Is applying Visine during a staring contest legal?

779
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,360
Is that allowed?

780
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,360
As long as you don't blink.

781
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,360
If you could do that blink-less.

782
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,960
Then you're a fucking robot with robot eyes.

783
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,960
Yeah.

784
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,960
Oh, robot eyes.

785
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,960
Steve Forbes up in this bitch.

786
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,960
Oh, robot eyes.

787
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:56,280
If you tap both your eyes out, put some glass in there, you'll never, I don't think you'll

788
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,280
have to moisten them.

789
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,080
Wait, do you mean just like shards of glass or like a fake eyeball?

790
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,560
Glass eyeballs, not shards of glass.

791
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,320
Okay, shards of glass is a very intimidating technique.

792
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,320
Yeah.

793
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,560
I don't see how that helps you.

794
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:12,360
Did, can I get a clarification on this?

795
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,420
I find that I travel all around this great, great blue globe and people have different

796
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,480
definitions of staring contest.

797
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,200
When I was growing up in my neck of the woods, it was if you blinked, you lose.

798
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,760
If you blinked, you were out.

799
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,040
If you blinked, you're out.

800
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:30,800
But a lot of people seem to roll with if you smile or laugh, you're out.

801
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,440
It's about keeping a straight face.

802
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,440
No.

803
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,040
Then that could just go on forever.

804
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,360
See Griffin knew what I was talking about though.

805
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,360
Griffin complete.

806
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,360
Yeah, yeah.

807
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,360
I've heard it.

808
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,360
Do you know what it was?

809
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:51,400
It was a lot of kids were doing it, the original full game version of staring contest and they

810
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,800
were going blind.

811
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,080
They were just going blind.

812
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:03,080
And so the academia, the public education system of this great nation of ours sort of

813
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:09,560
enforced the second rule set and taught that to my generation so that our perfect peepers

814
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,400
would remain.

815
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,900
And then when that started to get boring, they introduced Pogs.

816
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,120
They actually recorded a lot of, there was a lot of public awareness.

817
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:24,640
The same people who did I'm Not Gonna Play Sun City did a tribute song, If You Care Please

818
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,640
Don't Stare.

819
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,640
Yeah.

820
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,400
That was kind of swept the airwaves.

821
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,840
Lionel Richie I think co-wrote that with Andrew Dice Clay, which was kind of a weird pairing.

822
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,880
And then there was the one Stop and Think and then Take a Blink.

823
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,880
Right.

824
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,880
I really liked that one.

825
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,880
Who co-wrote that, Trav?

826
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,880
Because I was trying to remember.

827
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,280
I think that was Elton John and Billy Joel together.

828
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,760
It was amazing.

829
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,760
Okay.

830
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:49,760
Yeah.

831
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:58,320
There was a redo of the Donald O'Connor song, Make Them Laugh, Make Them Laugh, colon,

832
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,360
the new rule set for staring contest.

833
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,360
Right.

834
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,600
For God's sakes, Make Them Laugh.

835
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,680
Who co-wrote that?

836
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,680
I forget.

837
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:12,200
It was originally written by Donald O'Connor, but the new version was written by Rosie O'Donnell.

838
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,200
And Donald Loege.

839
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,200
That's weird.

840
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,200
That's weird.

841
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:28,880
And I know that there was another one, Song for About Blinking Laugh.

842
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,720
And that one was by Tears for Fears.

843
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:37,160
That one was by Tears for Fears and Infant Lady Gaga.

844
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,560
Embryo Gaga.

845
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:44,080
I basically wanted to say Infant Lady Gaga and didn't come up with the part with the

846
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,080
song.

847
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,480
So I kind of, I don't know if you guys could notice, but I kind of flubbed my way through

848
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,480
that.

849
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,480
No, no.

850
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,480
You totally covered it.

851
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,480
Did I nail it?

852
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,480
Malcolm to the Mabim Bam Sausage Factory.

853
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:58,480
We're taking you inside with director's commentary this week.

854
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:07,480
Is it weird that when I talk about babies, I have to talk in this voice so I don't wake

855
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,360
up the imaginary baby in my room?

856
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,000
I don't think that's weird.

857
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Okay.

858
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,680
Um, I don't do it.

859
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,680
I don't do it.

860
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,680
I don't.

861
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,680
It's not a conscious decision.

862
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,440
Is there an age cutoff for imaginary baby that you talk to in your room?

863
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,840
I just, I just want to be soft.

864
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,000
Is imaginary baby there right now Griffin?

865
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,880
Babies aren't tough, you know, guys.

866
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,880
So don't get rough.

867
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:30,880
Let's not get rough with these babies.

868
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,280
Do you ever sit in a, do you have a rocker in your office in which you snuggle and rock

869
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,160
your imaginary baby?

870
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,920
It's not a real, it's not a real imaginary baby.

871
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,360
I'm just saying I talk like there is one.

872
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,120
I know, I know it's not a real imaginary baby, sweetie.

873
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,880
If you wouldn't, if you guys wouldn't mind, just like keep it down, keep your voices down

874
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,880
a little bit.

875
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,880
Um, what's his name?

876
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,880
It's adorable.

877
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,880
His name is Dor, Dor, Dor.

878
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:03,720
Wait, hold on, did you name your imaginary baby Dwarf?

879
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,880
He sounds like the head of the House of Lannister.

880
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,720
Oh God.

881
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:20,000
I like the one where your imaginary baby taught me how to play golf.

882
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,800
And Tim Conway has Dwarf.

883
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,360
He's short because he's a baby.

884
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,600
It's an imaginary baby that lives in Griffith's heart.

885
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,600
Dwarf.

886
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:42,800
You know, when I, when I go, whenever I go hiking, I always bring a big bag of Dwarf.

887
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,480
Delicious.

888
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:50,560
What about mini golf attendees?

889
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,200
The people who have to like chase off the team.

890
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,200
Windmill winder.

891
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,440
And teens are like fucking on the mini golf course.

892
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,320
Somebody has to chase him off and that's a job that we can get paid for.

893
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,000
Get out of that clown's mouth, you fucking teens.

894
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yeah.

895
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Dirty, dirty, dirty teens.

896
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Oh shit.

897
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Jesus, it's Dorp.

898
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
You kids get out of here.

899
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Get out of here.

900
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I'm an invisible baby.

901
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I'm an invisible baby from Brooklyn.

902
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,040
Get out of that clown's mouth.

903
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:17,720
I made an invisible boom boom in my typy.

904
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:32,840
I'm going to call the baby police to have them come get you out.

905
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,520
Baby fireman in the tiny ladders.

906
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:42,960
And now I sound like a baby hairdresser.

907
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,880
This is baby mini golf so you can't even see it.

908
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,040
It's microscopic.

909
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,080
And it's imaginary baby golf.

910
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:58,280
Welcome to Dwarf's Mini Mini Imaginary Baby Golf.

911
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:02,040
I owe it all to my dad, Griffin.

912
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,040
It's so weird.

913
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,680
Now where can I ash this cigar, universally?

914
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:15,000
Where would be a funny, disrespectful place for me to ash my mini imaginary cigar, Dwarf?

915
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:27,200
Next time on Invisible Baby, All in the Family.

916
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:33,080
My child is Edith Bunker.

917
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,320
Let's come back with a Yahoo answer.

918
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,940
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield, too.

919
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:38,940
Thank you so much, Lisa.

920
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:39,940
Precious.

921
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:40,940
Precious fan of the year.

922
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,440
Can she just have some money?

923
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,760
Yep.

924
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,760
Someone give her some money.

925
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:51,160
It was asked by Brian, who asks, is it illegal for me to upload a picture of me with a sword

926
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,480
to Facebook?

927
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,880
I want my default pic to be one of me with the sword I got in eighth grade.

928
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,440
If I do not look threatening, is this illegal?

929
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,520
Any ins and outs I need to be aware of?

930
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,520
P.S.

931
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:08,720
I will look civilized.

932
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,720
Call Guinness.

933
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,960
This is the first time David has ever looked civilized.

934
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,960
It's me.

935
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,040
I'm wearing a frock, and this is my gentleman's foil.

936
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,040
How civil?

937
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:25,120
I'm actually, I'm looking at the Facebook rules right now about posting pictures, and

938
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:29,720
it says to do it, you have to have a really intense look on your face and be holding the

939
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,920
sword somewhere down around your crotch.

940
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:37,840
You have to have photoshopped fire, like Dragon Ball Z fire, on the sword and possibly in

941
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:42,600
your eyes, and it has to say something above it, like, Destiny.

942
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:47,000
And you have to make sure that you've tastefully trimmed your scraggly beard.

943
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,400
If somebody could photoshop us, pictures of us like that, I will make it my favorite.

944
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,080
I want nothing but Dragon Ball Z photoshops of us.

945
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,080
Fire, swords, beards.

946
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:59,160
There's fire and swords, laser beams, tails.

947
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,720
Maybe he meant civilized, which is to look like Sybil Shepard.

948
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:11,200
I like the idea of civilized better, like us in full 1930s military regalia with an

949
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,360
epée in one hand and a tea sandwich in the other.

950
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,360
Very fancy.

951
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,680
I used to own swords, everybody.

952
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,680
I still have swords.

953
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,040
There's nothing wrong with that.

954
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,600
I'm just not gonna like take Facebook.

955
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:30,560
It's like, I mean, there's lots of, okay, I have a crockpot, but if my Facebook picture

956
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:36,160
is me holding a crockpot above my head like, yes!

957
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,160
Look at it!

958
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,160
This is me!

959
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:42,720
This is me in 2012 with a crockpot, small about it.

960
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:47,360
Like it doesn't matter, like putting it in your Facebook picture is, it defines you.

961
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:53,160
I mean, it is your, that is your, your outside message to the world, right?

962
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:58,200
Well, I think if you're the kind of person that owns swords, then you're the kind of

963
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:02,000
person that owns swords and there's no getting around that.

964
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,240
You know, I have, I have a sword and you guys want to know a secret?

965
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,240
Not.

966
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:12,040
I mean, this is really dicey, but I'm going to, I'm going to go with yes.

967
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,560
I would never own a gun.

968
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:17,880
But I see nothing wrong with keeping a sword by the bed for protection.

969
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:23,240
Is this about to get, are we about to have an argument about the lethality of swords?

970
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,480
No, no, no.

971
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,800
I'm just saying like, I, I see no, I would like to envision a circumstance in which a

972
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,800
criminal breaks into my house and has a gun and I draw a sword.

973
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:38,120
You're telling me you could more easily stab a stranger with a giant sword than you could

974
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,120
shoot a stranger.

975
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,120
Like, you sever their-

976
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,120
No, I'm hoping that they're shocked.

977
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:44,840
You stab them in the guts and then you see it.

978
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,080
You see everything.

979
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,280
You watch their intestines spill out across your Davenport.

980
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,520
I can do a pretty deep lunge and I feel like it'll be really intimidating.

981
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:56,840
That's, Travis, that's the most fucked up thing you've ever said out loud.

982
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,840
I don't think that's true.

983
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:04,280
Why don't you just keep a heavy rock next to the bed, fucking you Lord of the Fly psychopath?

984
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,920
I keep that under the couch.

985
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,980
I just want to, I would just like to, I don't want my kids getting hurt, but I would like

986
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:15,200
the feeling of crushing a man's skull with my bare hands.

987
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,360
So I'll just keep a big rock next to my bed.

988
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:24,560
Now the floor does open up into a sort of boo boo box scorpion trap.

989
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,700
But it's that, I mean, guns, yuck.

990
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,700
Not for me.

991
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,200
Travis, you do have to do me a favor, though.

992
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:35,400
If you ever get into this imaginary situation, you gotta tube it for me.

993
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,600
I gotta see what happens.

994
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:45,280
Seriously, I will make a whole Bravo series about that night you did that dumb thing.

995
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,280
That's fair.

996
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,280
Yeah.

997
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:54,200
I, I, do you, okay, if you have the sword and they are like, they see you, okay?

998
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,200
What?

999
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,480
Describe that very next.

1000
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,360
This is how I picture it going.

1001
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:05,440
It's a very slow burn down to their gun and then they slow burn down to my sword and then

1002
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,680
they drop the gun and just start backing away.

1003
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,680
Okay.

1004
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:09,680
That's how I hope it pans out.

1005
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,680
You have, why?

1006
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,680
Why would that happen?

1007
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,680
Because otherwise they shoot me in the face.

1008
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,680
Yeah.

1009
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:19,720
I mean, no, definitely I'm pretty well versed in the actual thing that will definitely really

1010
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,720
happen.

1011
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,720
I'm kind of curious.

1012
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,360
Why do you think they're going to take me sort of inside and why you think they're going

1013
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,360
to see this?

1014
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:31,360
Well, I also have the true faith that like in an emergency situation, I would just immediately

1015
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:35,640
be able to have like the, the Dragon Ball Z fucking superpowers.

1016
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,640
Yeah.

1017
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,640
I just feel like it.

1018
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:42,480
Ninja would just come upon me and I would just move like a fucking bullets would come

1019
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,480
up on you.

1020
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,480
You would be dead.

1021
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:53,040
Oh man, got to tube that for me.

1022
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:57,460

It's a departure off of the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1041
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,120
It's an incredible album.

Start from the beginning.
