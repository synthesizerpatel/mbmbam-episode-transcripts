1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
I've saved this tiny green apple to eat during the show.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,920
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,240
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,760
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,760
cool they are for listening.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,760
What's up, you cool baby?

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:48,280
Cut a

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,400
hole in some sheets.

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:58,920
Cut holes in a sheet, candy an apple, bob it, and get ready.

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
It's H-time.

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,320
I don't think you can bob for an apple once it's been candied.

12
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,840
Yeah, they're super buoyant.

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,400
You push it down far enough it'll rock it through your ceiling.

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,320
I'm saying the rich caramelly exterior is going to wash right off once doused in water.

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,920
I feel like maybe we should put a limit on the amount of holes one is going to cut in

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
a sheet.

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
Just some holes.

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,920
What is it?

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
Three?

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,920
Four?

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,920
Twelve?

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,520
I think you've got to have two for the peepers and one for the penis.

23
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,160
That's my thing.

24
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
That is a spooky ghost.

25
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,160
You're going as a horny ghost.

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,160
Yeah.

27
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,160
They aren't all ghosts.

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,880
Yeah, because they can't.

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,880
Well, you know.

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,960
They have to watch everybody having sex.

31
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,560
This is My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show and Halloween prep show for the modern

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,560
era.

33
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,280
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,160
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

35
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,640
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,520
Do you think we should just start adding to that disclaimer, the advice show for the

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,200
modern era, and also a show about ghosts that love to fuck?

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,960
Because that's pretty much all we talk about anymore.

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,200
Can you imagine if we destroyed a horse and it turned into a ghost that loved to fuck?

40
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,720
That would be like what our whole show is.

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Yeah.

42
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,040
Hey, by the way, if you haven't had your Halloween costume planned yet, there it is.

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
It's right there.

44
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,720
You're a dead ghost horny horse.

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,000
You'll be the only one at the party, I guarantee.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,360
All you need is a friend who is a good sport.

47
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
Yeah.

48
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,280
Did you guys ever read that old comic strip, Casper the Overly Friendly Ghost?

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,140
I loved that one, until it got canceled, and thanks, McCarthy.

50
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,140
Thanks for nothing.

51
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,520
Do you guys have your costumes planned?

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Yeah.

53
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
You know what you're doing.

54
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
Yeah.

55
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,560
I mean, this is our Halloween prep show.

56
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,120
This seems like the time to talk about it.

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm going to go as Freezer Gaddafi.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,480
I'm post-street murder, currently housed in a freezer while the people decide what

59
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,280
to do for my body.

60
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,360
My whole line is going to be, it's never been this chilly in Libya.

61
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Yeah.

62
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
That's my line, I think.

63
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
That's your whole goof?

64
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,920
That's a pretty good line.

65
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
I made a Gaddafi goof.

66
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,240
Remember before, it's Libya, but it's chilly.

67
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,840
I made a Gaddafi goof yesterday, and somebody was like, whoa, man.

68
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,680
The shit's still, that wound is still fresh.

69
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
It's like, really?

70
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
Really?

71
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Fuck that guy.

72
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,680
Him?

73
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
Fuck that guy.

74
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
Fuck that fool.

75
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,680
I hate him.

76
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,680
Fuck that guy.

77
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,320
I don't even know what he did, but I know I'm supposed to hate him, so there.

78
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
Yeah.

79
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,320
I think he wore outlandish shirts and terrorized an entire nation.

80
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
Okay.

81
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
Which is the less crime.

82
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Both of those.

83
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
Stacey and Clinton.

84
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Yeah, I don't know.

85
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,120
Hey, every so often, my wife or I will lend a small amount of money to a friend, usually

86
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,120
small, like $20.

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,720
The problem is that sometimes these different friends try to repay us in gifts instead of

88
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,680
hard cash money.

89
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,440
For example, they'll suggest buying me coffee or a bottle of wine to service the debt.

90
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,880
I've even had a friend add me to his Costco membership and then propose that it counts

91
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,840
as repayment.

92
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,480
These friends aren't in the poorhouse and have the cash on hand.

93
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,420
Should I take these alternative gifts graciously or be firm and require money?

94
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,280
That's from vexed in Vancouver.

95
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,840
Who needs an amount of money that is under $20?

96
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,240
If you just wait, you'll make $20.

97
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,640
Just chill out and somebody will give it to you.

98
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,400
Money is so boring.

99
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,960
Money is just...

100
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,400
It's great to get paper, but once you get that paper, it's just paper.

101
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,440
You can't do anything with it.

102
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,760
You're basically having your friends go out and buy you exciting things, like a Costco

103
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
membership.

104
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,480
It's not worth its weight in gold, but it's not that heavy.

105
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,520
The additional details of this, though, where he said the problem is that what they spend

106
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,720
the money on is not things he would normally spend money on.

107
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,780
That's not a problem.

108
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,160
That's an awesome.

109
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
That's the opposite of a problem.

110
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
Right.

111
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,880
A Costco membership is the sort of thing that you tell yourself you're going to get, but

112
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,840
no one really knows how to get them or what counter to go to.

113
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,000
You'll go there and you might ask the wrong person.

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,480
Then they're like, you're at a blockbuster.

115
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,080
What are you talking about?

116
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,160
They're like, blockbuster clothes.

117
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,840
What they should do is add all of his friends to the Costco membership and then demand that

118
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,920
whenever he loans them a trivial amount of cash like this, that they should repay him

119
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:29,600
in something from Costco, such as a four-pound bucket of gummy worms or something.

120
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,800
I got you this industrial-sized silly putty.

121
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,280
Hey, man, I hope you like Ferrero Rocher because here's a pyramid.

122
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
I heard you like crybabies.

123
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,040
I got you a bucket.

124
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Chew on this.

125
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,160
Yeah, you know that candy that you haven't had in 13 years?

126
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
They've been-

127
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Do you remember tearjerkers?

128
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
I got you some tearjerkers.

129
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,040
They've been stopped buying them at Costco.

130
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
Here's a whole barrel.

131
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,600
I really did have a bucket of... That's the one thing I've ever bought at Sam's, a bucket

132
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
of crybabies.

133
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
I used to be all about that.

134
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,520
I bought a bag at H-E-B last week.

135
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
Did you?

136
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,600
They're good for... Here's what a lot of people don't recognize.

137
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,160
They have such therapeutic qualities.

138
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,960
If you have a sore throat or you're stuffed up, pop a crybaby in there.

139
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,560
The sour will make it go away.

140
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,080
That's free advice from us to you.

141
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
Free advice from me.

142
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,000
Tea is for bitches.

143
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,440
Real nice, you crybabies.

144
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,920
I think that the problem with this whole situation that he's running into is I think it's different

145
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:28,880
if your friends say, would you rather have a bottle of wine or that $12 I owe you?

146
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,400
They're just going, I got you this wine to pay you back.

147
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,280
That wasn't the arrangement, bitch.

148
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,160
I hate buying wine though, so 100% of the time I'm going to go with the wine.

149
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,680
Yeah, but then it's an awesome game show friendship.

150
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Yeah.

151
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
Oh, right.

152
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,680
You could have Wes behind door number one or you could take the cash.

153
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
This is great.

154
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,520
This is a great thing though.

155
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,560
I'm excited about this.

156
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,600
The cool play is to wait till your friend borrows money, pays you back with a bottle

157
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,040
of wine, and then the next time they hit you up for money, you give them that same bottle

158
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
of wine back.

159
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
I say, that's bartering.

160
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,600
Oh, I thought this was the economy we were in.

161
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,680
I thought we were in a wine economy.

162
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,360
What kind of relationship do these people have with their friends?

163
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,720
They're like, ah, man, I need $16.

164
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,040
Better go get Jerry.

165
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,080
I am not the town ATM.

166
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
They have money.

167
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,560
Why are they borrowing money from their friends?

168
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Nobody needs six.

169
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
This is what I'm saying to you.

170
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,160
This is the bigger problem I have.

171
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,240
No one needs less than $20.

172
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,020
Nothing costs that.

173
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,020
Nothing costs less than $20.

174
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,680
Just stop going with your friends to the dollar store.

175
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,120
Right, like, hey, listen, I just parked outside your house, and the parking meter is going

176
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,480
to cost me like $8.

177
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,720
Can you hit me up?

178
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
You should have walked.

179
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,880
You shouldn't have driven.

180
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,600
Maybe a movie ticket, but even then, there's an argument.

181
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,680
But why would you go to the movies and not bring money?

182
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
That's an important question.

183
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,000
See, and I also kind of feel like if you pay for a ticket for your friends to the movie,

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,520
here's what I'm having a problem with.

185
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:09,000
Maybe this is just because I'm living, I'm in the 82%, so I'm living an affluent lifestyle,

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:18,280
but I kind of feel like anything under $20 is almost like a gift you're doing anyway.

187
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,320
I wouldn't think of that as like a, I did this nice thing for you because I gave you

188
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
$20.

189
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,920
I'd be like, oh, I got to do something nice and help you out and give you.

190
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,880
The way I look at it karmically is over all the times of my life that I've bummed money

191
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,040
off people for things, now I'm karmically paying that back by being like, no, I got

192
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,040
it.

193
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
Don't worry about it.

194
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
I got it.

195
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,200
See, in my head, I have a tiny bookkeeper with a green visor and one of those receipt

196
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,180
machines that just like the receipts fly into the air karmically, and I have a running

197
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,500
tally of exactly how much money everybody owes me all the time, and I'm not miserly

198
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
about it.

199
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,080
I don't want to go after those people, but Travis, you owe me $364.

200
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
I believe that.

201
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,600
Justin, you and I are totally even, which is nice, but I mean, all of my friends, like

202
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,320
Stu, Stu owes me $455, and I'm never going to forget about that.

203
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Ever.

204
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Ever.

205
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
Stu.

206
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
That's classic Stu though.

207
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,120
God forbid something happens to Stu and you never see that money.

208
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,480
Oh, I have already lost a lot of funds, unrecoverable funds.

209
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,800
Gaddafi I drew 20 spot.

210
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Gaddafi?

211
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
That fool owed me $12.

212
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
$12 whole dollars.

213
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
He was like, Griffin.

214
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,360
He sent you a bottle of wine, and you're like, no Gaddafi.

215
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,440
Griffin, can I get a scarf?

216
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
It's so chilly in Libya.

217
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Give me a $12 scarf.

218
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
And you're like.

219
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,840
Well, we were hitting up the bars on 36, and he was like, oh man, I left my wallet at home.

220
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,880
I was like, Gaddafi, I got you.

221
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
And I did got him.

222
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
And then you know what happened?

223
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,360
He went and got himself killed.

224
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,920
Thanks Gaddafi for nothing.

225
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Yeah.

226
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,200
And all that full drink is buttery nipples.

227
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Yep.

228
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,600
And so you know it's going to be a pricey night.

229
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:09,520
My serious advice to you is that you don't accept the money and you don't accept the

230
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,120
gifts and you make them live with that.

231
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,320
You make them live with that debt and you cash it in when you are ready.

232
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:23,720
Make everyone you know live in constant feeling of being indebted to you.

233
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,280
That's going to be a hard policy to reverse though, because they know that they can come

234
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,040
to you with a bottle of wine and you say, okay, we cool.

235
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,760
So the next time they come to you with a bottle of wine, it's going to be tough for you to

236
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
be like, nope.

237
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,320
No, I think you'd do exactly that.

238
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,240
Hey, I got you this bottle of wine.

239
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,600
No, no, that is not dollars.

240
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
I cannot spend that.

241
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
And you turn and walk away.

242
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
In this economy.

243
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,240
No, you got to go so hyper polite.

244
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,940
It's got to be like, no, no, no, I can't accept this.

245
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,860
It was a gift from me to you and then you just let make them live with it.

246
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,160
It's the most sort of hostile generosity you can muster.

247
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,600
If it's a small thing, if they're like, here's some, here's a can of Planner's Peanuts.

248
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,720
It was $2 at H-E-B. You can't be like, no, no, no.

249
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,520
That dollar, that money is a gift.

250
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,960
It's fucking peanuts.

251
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,000
You need to calm down.

252
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,960
What if you set up like a Godfather-esque kind of friendship economy where you're like,

253
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,560
no, no, no, but there will come a time when I will call on you for those Planner's Peanuts.

254
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,360
Hey, you know, Stu, I need you to fucking murder him.

255
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,360
It's like, dude, you gave me $13.

256
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,280
I'm not going to murder Stu for that.

257
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:37,960
Maybe they come to you, they say, hey, I know I owed you $10, but I got you this jar of

258
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
peanuts.

259
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,640
You turn it up and dump the peanuts out in front of them and say, with juice, it's $12.

260
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,640
I'll see you in a week.

261
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
You got to put the juice on.

262
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,840
That's the problem.

263
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,240
What peanut is that?

264
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,800
You got to put the juice on because a lot of people will loan you.

265
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
You got to get the juice on.

266
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
A lot of people will loan you.

267
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
You better go to Walgreens.

268
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
No juice.

269
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
You better buy me a can.

270
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,440
Buy me a can of emerald nuts with the chili lime sauce on them.

271
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,240
That damn will be cool.

272
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,380
Hold on real quick.

273
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,760
Just to clarify, Justin, you're saying that when you loan your friends a small amount

274
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,280
of money, you got to charge a really high interest, like a 150% loan?

275
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Yes.

276
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,880
The smaller the amount, the more juice.

277
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,560
If you borrow $2, tomorrow you'll owe me $6.

278
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,160
If I loan someone a dollar and later they try to hand me a grubby piece of paper that

279
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,280
has one written on it, I will tear it in half in front of them.

280
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,160
What am I going to do with $1?

281
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,920
I'm not the sort of person that accepts $1 bills from people.

282
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,920
That's your department.

283
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Have you noticed that?

284
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
I'm not the poor one.

285
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,920
You're the poor one.

286
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,520
What am I going to do with a dollar?

287
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,200
Do I look poor?

288
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
I'm rich as shit.

289
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
I'm the bank.

290
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,360
I've got dollars all over the place.

291
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,680
I thought you sneezed and needed something to blow your nose into.

292
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,680
Oh, this is a confetti in front of a shitty party.

293
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
That's the only thing I could do with this right now.

294
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,400
Give me a dollar, keep it.

295
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,600
If you are going to borrow money from a friend and you are going to pay them back with cold,

296
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,920
hard bills, make sure they're not grubby.

297
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,960
Make sure they're not dirty bills.

298
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,960
If they can't go through a soda machine, I'm not interested.

299
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,320
I'm not even talking about the relative crispness.

300
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,440
I'm talking about bills that look like you got it from a cashier and you're like, oh,

301
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
cool.

302
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,440
I'm going to keep this right in my butt.

303
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,600
I'm going to put this right between my cheeks and keep it there for a while.

304
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,040
Why did you put this bill in between your cheeks?

305
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,280
And then you give that bill to other people.

306
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
That's nature's wallet.

307
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,760
Cash is so gross.

308
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,680
If God didn't want us to put dollar bills in our butts, he would not have left a slot

309
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
there.

310
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
That's what I'm saying.

311
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,960
Don't talk about the change first.

312
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
Nature versus nurture.

313
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,680
Hey, that did not relate.

314
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,200
Nothing in that made sense.

315
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,960
I have a problem with a buddy of mine that I'm hoping you can help me with.

316
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,880
Travis used to be so good about pairing these questions down.

317
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
I meant to pair this down.

318
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,480
They're like epic poems now, but okay.

319
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,160
He and his wife gossip so much and I get uncomfortable when neither of our talk to them because of

320
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,160
it.

321
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,280
I was talking to him earlier today and out of nowhere, he brought up something very personal

322
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,840
that his wife had been told in confidence by a mutual friend of ours.

323
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,200
I'm going to talk about a little secret nobody expects that will be kept.

324
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,040
Neither of us have any business knowing it, and I know I'm not the only one he's told.

325
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,960
I've tried to say things like, I don't need to hear this, or that should probably be between

326
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:41,000
you and your wife and so and so, and he plays it off like it's okay if he's told me as long

327
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,320
as I don't tell anyone else.

328
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,840
I don't usually like being confrontational, but this is the type of thing that I should

329
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,320
be confrontational about.

330
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,120
I don't feel that I'd be out of line going up to his wife and telling her to keep her

331
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,440
mouth shut about these things, but I honestly feel like that wouldn't do any good.

332
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,160
How is someone supposed to handle gossips like my big mouth friend and his even bigger

333
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,080
mouth wife?

334
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,160
Too mad to think of a clever name in Iowa?

335
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,120
Unacceptable excuse, but we will answer your query.

336
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,560
I almost would like to say emergence theory, eventually this will take care of itself,

337
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,560
and all your friends will be like, oh, we shouldn't tell anything to Gossipy Jane and

338
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,080
her Gossipy husband, but really, in real life, people-

339
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,440
I don't know how it works.

340
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,880
Because people want to talk about their problems to whoever will listen.

341
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
I think you gotta-

342
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Hence our show.

343
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,400
You gotta give them a lesson.

344
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,640
You gotta treat them to a lesson, like a hard-learned lesson.

345
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:47,480
Go around and tell everybody about your big mouth buddy, Mike, and you gotta say, oh yeah,

346
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,200
Mike, don't tell anyone, but he's got shingles all over his dick, and just tell it to everybody.

347
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,440
Tell it to every person that you know and see and encounter.

348
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,040
And then, when it gets back to Mike, he'll come to you and be like, hey Dave, what the

349
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
fuck?

350
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,560
And you say, now you know how gossip hurts, shingle dick.

351
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:13,440
I don't see this as a huge problem for you, provided that you don't give these people

352
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,960
any information.

353
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,680
Don't you want this information?

354
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,740
Don't you want to be Lord Varys, the master of whispers?

355
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:30,680
Don't you want to know all the secrets of the kingdom?

356
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:39,080
I don't see how, as long as your loose lips don't sink your specific ship, you want to

357
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,760
be able to trade in this information.

358
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,120
So you're saying that he becomes like a vault, just a well of information about everyone

359
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
they know.

360
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:52,120
Right, until that information becomes relevant or valuable to him.

361
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,840
I think the problem, though, is that sometimes you find out the wrong thing, and all of a

362
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,600
sudden you're just laden with this power.

363
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,700
You find out that such and such is cheating on so and so, and you're like, what do I do

364
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,720
with this?

365
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,960
Now I know this thing, and every time I look at them, I know this thing about them.

366
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,180
That can be destructive.

367
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,920
That can ruin a friendship.

368
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,480
And also, this person's going to have to live in fear of his friend's big mouth and his

369
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,460
friend's big mouth wife.

370
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,000
Every time he does something that he doesn't want other people to know about.

371
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,840
Like, oh yeah, he was at his in-laws house and he tooted and nobody heard it, but I know.

372
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,680
I know, and now you know.

373
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,320
Is it a serious enough offense that you could stop being friends with these people?

374
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,880
Because that's sort of where I'm at.

375
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,440
I don't think you could talk someone into being more trustworthy.

376
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
No.

377
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,320
I don't think you could say, it hurts my feelings when you're shitty because you're a shitty

378
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,360
person, so please stop it.

379
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,020
Hey, everything about you sucks.

380
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,680
Can you do something about that?

381
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
Yeah.

382
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,800
It just seems to me like if someone's sharing these very personal things with them and then

383
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,120
they're going around telling people, they are fundamentally missing the purpose of friendship

384
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
and trust.

385
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
Yeah.

386
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
I mean, it's hard to...

387
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Yeah.

388
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,280
I mean, all you can do is sort of close yourself off to them and stop trusting them, which

389
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,760
is kind of what I was saying before.

390
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,120
You stop giving them your information, and what I would also tell you to do is encourage

391
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,440
other friends you know to stop giving them juice.

392
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,000
And if they ask, like, why aren't you as forthcoming as you used to be, you say, well because you're

393
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
fucking gossipy.

394
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah.

395
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,760
And that's sort of like cold, you know, I think it'll have a chilling effect that would

396
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,680
hopefully correct the problem.

397
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,920
And I would say to try to avoid, you know, too big a drama, don't tell your other friends

398
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,120
like, hey, they told me this thing about you.

399
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,900
Say that they're very gossipy about your other friends, just so that you aren't gossiping

400
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,400
about them to other people.

401
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
I don't know, guys.

402
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,720
I think you got to keep feeding the beast a little bit, because I feel like the second

403
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,880
you start starving these people like this, they're going to start making shit up.

404
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,640
And then, and then the shoe is really going to be on the other foot.

405
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,320
Are you saying feed them misinformation?

406
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,520
No, I'm saying feed them a little trivial stuff, like the time you tooted at your in-laws

407
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,320
house so that they don't like go around saying like, oh, yeah, Mike got feline AIDS.

408
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
Oh, secrecy.

409
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
Yeah.

410
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
I heard Mike got rickets.

411
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,320
Don't make them quit cold turkey.

412
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Yeah.

413
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,720
You got to, you got to drop them off a little bit.

414
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,720
I don't know why it's got to be some obscure venereal disease that you've got, but that

415
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,880
seems to be like the kind of like the worst kind of information to trade in.

416
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,280
My fingers smell like chlorine.

417
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,920
Don't tell anybody.

418
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,520
You promised.

419
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
My socks don't match.

420
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
Keep that to yourself.

421
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,520
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

422
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,520
Yes, please.

423
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,520
I guess.

424
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,420
I have a few.

425
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,000
This one was sent in by Diego Garcia.

426
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Thank you, Diego.

427
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Lewis, who asks, I have a 20 gauge shotgun and need a nickname

428
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,920
for her.

429
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,560
Don't say Betty Lou or old Yeller.

430
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
How about shooty?

431
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Okay.

432
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
That's very direct.

433
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
Shoot gun.

434
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,560
Shoot gun.

435
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Very literal.

436
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,560
Yeah.

437
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
Gunny Gunnarsson.

438
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
A very literal name.

439
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
You're doing good.

440
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,560
You're so far.

441
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
Okay.

442
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
Yeah.

443
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
What about Gaddafi Slayer?

444
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Whoa.

445
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,560
This is the one.

446
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Okay.

447
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,760
This is the one that brought him down, brought down the big dog.

448
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,760
Yeah.

449
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,240
I went over to Texas and I grabbed him by his stupid collar and I said, listen, Gaddafi,

450
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
get out of town.

451
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,240
Get out of here.

452
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,240
Pulled him out of his trailer home.

453
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,000
Punched his mail ticket.

454
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,360
Can't hide in Texas, Gaddafi.

455
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,040
Get out of here.

456
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,840
And he looked incredibly white.

457
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,840
Yeah.

458
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,840
That was weird.

459
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,960
And he was a woman, which was weird.

460
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Yeah.

461
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Yeah.

462
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,200
Um, what about shoot caliber?

463
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,720
Okay.

464
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,400
It's like a medieval thing going on.

465
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,000
Can we call it operation Iraqi freedom?

466
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You can.

467
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You can.

468
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Maybe.

469
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I like that patriotic angle.

470
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The glittering Eagle.

471
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's gotta be something.

472
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's gotta be something patriotic.

473
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Right?

474
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,040
It can't be a shotgun, it can't be something like, I like the idea of a girl's name, but

475
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,800
that seems more applicable to like an old automobile.

476
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
Yeah.

477
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Or a pistol.

478
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,200
What if you named it Top Gun?

479
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,240
What about red, white, and boom?

480
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,440
Cause that's very, very, your pride is there.

481
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,480
These colors don't fun because-

482
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,440
These colors don't gun?

483
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,920
I'm sorry, Griffin.

484
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,040
Ah, fuck me.

485
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
Shit.

486
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,760
Um, how about the only friend I'll ever need?

487
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,760
Uh, what about, uh, second, second amendmenty?

488
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,920
It's kind of a classic personification.

489
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:55,200
The right to bear harms?

490
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,520
How about Betty Lou?

491
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
Damn it.

492
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
No, you did a bad job.

493
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Did a bad job.

494
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,520
Hmm.

495
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,280
How about Dracula?

496
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,800
No, this is, okay, this is a vein we need to explore because your gun's name should be

497
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
scary.

498
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,840
This is my gun, Wolfman.

499
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,840
This is my gun, Dracula.

500
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,080
This is my gun, The Mummy, starring Brendan Fraser.

501
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,880
How far out of the Universal Monsters over can we go with these gun names?

502
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,800
I mean, can it be the creature from the Black Lagoon, the gun?

503
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,040
I think so.

504
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,720
The creature from the Black Lagoon.

505
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Okay.

506
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,680
Hey, what about Tim Gunn?

507
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
That's good and butch.

508
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,480
Yeah, I like that.

509
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,560
Maybe Hot Shots, Hot Shots Part 2.

510
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,560
Maybe.

511
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,560
Okay.

512
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,760
This is my gun, Charlie Sheen.

513
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,200
Charlie Sheen, the gun.

514
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,200
This is my gun, shooting.

515
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Um.

516
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
It's my Charlie Sheen impression, everybody.

517
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Oh.

518
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,560
If it's told, I couldn't bust it out.

519
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,080
What about two and a half barrels?

520
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,080
That's not bad.

521
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
But it doesn't make sense.

522
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,080
There's only two barrels.

523
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
You got to put another half barrel on there.

524
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,200
You got to put a tinier barrel.

525
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,920
So here's some of the suggestions that Yahoo has provided.

526
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Big Mama.

527
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Okay.

528
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
No, that's good.

529
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
It's got a nice.

530
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
Sure.

531
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,920
I guess.

532
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,920
It's got a nice.

533
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
Is there another?

534
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
Is there a...

535
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,720
What was the Big Mama's house?

536
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,720
Big Mama's gun.

537
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
Big Mama's gun.

538
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
That's good.

539
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
Norbert.

540
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,160
Norbert, the gun.

541
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,400
The wife.

542
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,960
Old Blue, the Terminator.

543
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,600
The apple corer.

544
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,240
Now hold on real quick.

545
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Okay.

546
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
Brother said not Old Yeller.

547
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
Yeah.

548
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,280
And so other dudes just went for a different color.

549
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,280
Shiloh.

550
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
Greeny.

551
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Um.

552
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,840
Something for an old dog that's near death.

553
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,840
What?

554
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
It's a good dog name.

555
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
It's a good gun name.

556
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,920
Oh, okay.

557
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,560
I thought you were saying that was the name of the gun.

558
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,400
It's for an old dog that's near death.

559
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
Trust me.

560
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
No.

561
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
No.

562
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Um.

563
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Stacy or Jeff.

564
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Mrs. Bangbang.

565
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Baby sister.

566
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
Baby sister.

567
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Irene.

568
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Grace.

569
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,120
I call mine the 20 gauge.

570
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,320
The shotgun is yet to complain about it.

571
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,320
Okay.

572
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,320
Wait.

573
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
What?

574
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,320
Hold on.

575
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
So you didn't come up with the name.

576
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
Is that what he means?

577
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,320
He just calls it what the gun is.

578
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,320
Okay.

579
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,320
And the shotgun hasn't protested so far.

580
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,320
Um.

581
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,320
Vern.

582
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,960
Oh, Jesus Christ.

583
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,600
Blood first, then a name.

584
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,080
A gun earns its name when you make your first kill with it.

585
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,080
Oh no.

586
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,880
This is, this is my gun.

587
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,880
Accidental family tragedy.

588
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,020
I really wish I'd named it before.

589
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,020
This is my gun.

590
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,080
Take that uppity bus driver.

591
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,080
This is my gun.

592
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
Nirvana ruiner.

593
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,560
Oh no, oh no.

594
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,000
I'm tapping out of this.

595
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,040
Hey, mbnbm, is it weird for a straight guy to paint his fingernails?

596
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:10,000
I've been thinking about this for a while and I would really like to paint my fingernails

597
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,480
a color like blue, but I'm not sure how socially acceptable this would be.

598
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,960
I also wonder what girls think if they saw this and they don't already know me.

599
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,400
What do you guys think inquisitive in Illinois?

600
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Real quick.

601
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,400
I want to clarify something about this question that I know to be true.

602
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,800
Whether it's weird or not has nothing to do if you are a straight guy or a gay guy.

603
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Yeah.

604
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,420
That's a, yeah.

605
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,340
That's a misconception that I find very funny.

606
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,880
Like if this was a gay guy doing it, it would be totally cool.

607
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,880
Yeah.

608
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,640
I don't think the gay thing enters into it.

609
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:45,240
Like I don't think, I mean, obviously there's a, it's a gender identity issue, but I wouldn't

610
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,280
think it would be any more or less socially acceptable for a straight or a gay guy.

611
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,740
I don't think it would matter really.

612
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,840
Did we get this because we talked about nail care last week?

613
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,320
God, I never thought when we started this show that this would be, this would be one

614
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,040
of our frequent subjects.

615
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,840
I think, I mean, if you're asking the question, I typically think that if you have to ask

616
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,320
if something's socially unacceptable, it probably is.

617
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,320
Yeah.

618
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,160
Like yes, obviously it's socially unacceptable.

619
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,000
It's not a thing that people do, but that shouldn't stop you from doing it, you know?

620
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,180
Listen, you doing it isn't going to kill somebody.

621
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,440
It's not like the end of the world.

622
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,360
You do it and you want to do it, then do it.

623
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,840
But yeah, you're going to get some weird looks and people are going to give you shit about

624
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,840
it.

625
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
Like, because it is weird.

626
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,800
But if you want to, it's, isn't that sort of like, isn't it sort of like the, what was

627
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,000
it we were talking about where if, if you are the sort of person that-

628
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,520
Yeah, we were talking about manicures and hats.

629
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,520
Yeah.

630
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,060
Like if you're the sort of person that can pull that off, that's your style, don't let

631
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:52,880
it keep you from it, but you know, things like, oh, like take Penn Jillette, for example.

632
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,440
Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say.

633
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,840
Penn Jillette is a cool guy and he's, you know, he's rock and roll, manly.

634
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:07,720
You know, I don't think he's, he is somebody you could accuse of being unhip and he rocks

635
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,360
some nail polish on there.

636
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,980
Now, I don't know who that is, but I just assume that it's somebody who's, is it somebody

637
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,720
who's like Trace Angel?

638
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,200
You know, you know Penn Jillette is.

639
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Is that like Criss Angel?

640
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,200
No, it's like, like Penn of Penn and Teller?

641
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Not.

642
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,120
Are you serious?

643
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,520
I'm not familiar.

644
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,080
I know who Criss Angel is, is it somebody like, cause he also paints his nails.

645
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,760
They, no, they, they do the magic goofs.

646
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Like, oh, kind of like Criss Angel, you mean?

647
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,320
They're basically like Criss Angel, okay?

648
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
Yes.

649
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,320
Yes, perfect.

650
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,320
Criss Angel.

651
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,200
They're like a fat and silent Criss Angel.

652
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:50,120
You're telling me that it's like people who do magic tricks and illusions and acts of

653
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
misdirection.

654
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,120
Mm-hmm.

655
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
Prestidigitation.

656
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
Prestidigitation.

657
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:59,040
Ledger mane and their nails are painted.

658
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:05,200
So I mean, if it walks like a Criss Angel and wears, wears big black pants like a Criss

659
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,600
Angel, then it's probably a Criss Angel.

660
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,280
If I see somebody floating above the Luxor, I've got to assume that's Criss Angel.

661
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Yeah.

662
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,240
So what you're saying is, yes, he can paint his fingernails as long as he engages in prestidigitation.

663
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Mm-hmm.

664
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
Okay.

665
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,920
I think, no, I think what he's saying is if he paints his nails and engages in prestidigitation,

666
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:29,560
he is, by all rights and purposes, he should be able to walk into any bank.

667
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,360
And so I would like to withdraw the $37.

668
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,240
Can I see two forms of identification?

669
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
Sure.

670
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,800
Check out these nails and this awesome card trick.

671
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,160
Check out these, check out these nails and I'm wearing your watch.

672
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,360
Let me get a couple hundo.

673
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,280
Just take it out of the Criss Angel account.

674
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,000
Check out the one labeled fun money.

675
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,520
Sir, this is a Bank of America in Des Moines.

676
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,680
You do not have fungible assets here.

677
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,120
Oh, don't I?

678
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
Check it.

679
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,120
Holy shit, where'd all this money come from?

680
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
Criss Angel.

681
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,720
It's in my hands and it has your face on it.

682
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Mind freak.

683
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
I've ruined $100.

684
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
Holy shit.

685
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,560
I think maybe Criss Angel just robbed this bank.

686
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,000
Either Criss Angel robbed the bank or he just ruined a hundred dollar bill of his.

687
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,840
I don't think he has those to lose.

688
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
Should we call the cops?

689
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,960
I, let me, just let me think for a second.

690
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,200
My mind is still freaked right now.

691
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
Just give me a second.

692
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
I'm reeling.

693
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,800
I gotta unfreak it up here.

694
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,240
Is anybody enough mind freaks still in the air?

695
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,160
It's gotta be.

696
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:36,160
We all think about Criss Angel in the context of mind freak, but what we rarely think about

697
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:44,720
is that Criss Angel is a real person who has to go to Whole Foods and he buys kale.

698
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,700
Like this is something, this is a real person that does these things, right?

699
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,240
He's not just magicking all the time or maybe he is.

700
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,040
Wouldn't you like to think that he is like even at home and no one's around, like all

701
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,200
of a sudden the coffee's in the glass and he's like, sigh, mind freaked.

702
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:09,120
My problem with mind freak is that it, it, it's unfairly, it's unfairly watchable because

703
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,840
it's constantly taunting you with the possibility that you'll see Criss Angel killed before

704
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
your eyes.

705
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,840
It's like an irresistible ratings bait, I think, and it's not fair and I think they

706
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,560
do have to deliver on it eventually, at least an amputation.

707
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:28,760
Like today I'm going to set myself ablaze while a man shoots a revolver at me.

708
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,560
Like oh man, clear the Tivo, here we go.

709
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,800
What if Criss, Criss Angel really just one day like wanted to cash it all in, like he

710
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:41,080
just gave up and so he filmed it and it was like, oh what an awesome trick, oh he's not

711
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,080
moving.

712
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,080
Yeah.

713
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,080
Today I'm going to drink lava.

714
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
Hey Criss?

715
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,080
Criss?

716
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,080
Criss, I wouldn't advise that.

717
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
Criss, I wouldn't advise that.

718
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,760
Um, maybe you should cancel this one.

719
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:59,040
He, I'm looking at pictures of him right now and I cannot fucking handle his whole style.

720
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
His whole, yeah.

721
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:04,640
There's a thing on, there's a thing on, okay if you go to A&E TV right now, there is an

722
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,020
ad for the show and the tagline of this like I think it's a maybe a trivia question or

723
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:14,280
an interactive game and it, the question is will you save or kill Criss Angel?

724
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,320
The game is called Kill Criss Angel.

725
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,320
Okay.

726
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,160
Like they know what they're doing with this and they, they're playing off our desire to

727
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
see him die.

728
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,840
Hey world, if you see Criss Angel, give him a hug.

729
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,880
Just tell him like it's okay and that it's going to be alright and maybe you know he

730
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,880
just wants to hang out.

731
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,480
Maybe just buy Criss Angel a beer.

732
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,120
We could save Criss Angel's life today.

733
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,880
I would, I would like to try to reach out to Criss Angel and say it's not that there

734
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:47,640
are many people I'd like to watch die on TV but you, you are the only one that keeps taunting

735
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,040
me with the possibility and that's the only reason I'm so hungry for your death.

736
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Like the first season on that show started out as real magic, right?

737
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,200
And now it's just like fucking bear baiting.

738
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,120
Like it's, it's waiting to watch Criss Angel die.

739
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,320
Did you see the bear baiting episode?

740
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,920
I thought that it was going to gobble him up for sure.

741
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:11,320
All I hope is that Criss Angel when he like does do something like drink lava, I just

742
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:17,960
hope that his last words are like mind free.

743
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,920
And now the mind that is freaked is my own.

744
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,560
I have freaked my own mind.

745
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,680
And now it's time to mind freak Jesus.

746
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,720
May flights of angels freak thee mind to thine rest.

747
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:39,540
Alright Criss, I gotta go through the book here and look at all of your life's sins and

748
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,040
accomplishments and what?

749
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,320
You're already inside the game!

750
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,720
Hey St. Peter, I'm wearing your watch.

751
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,080
Oh, mind freak.

752
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,320
You know, this is a, when I worked at Best Buy, um, there was a day when I swore Criss

753
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,960
Angel came into our store and like walked around and bought some CDs and I'm like on

754
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,320
the radio going, I swear to God Criss Angel is here.

755
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,420
It's Criss Angel.

756
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,760
But it wasn't Criss Angel.

757
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,360
It turned out to be the lead singer of Hinder.

758
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,280
He just had that look like I'm somebody terrible.

759
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,640
That's why lead singer of Hinder bought his own CD.

760
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,720
You don't know me, but I'm the worst.

761
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,720
I got a vibe from that guy like I wanted to see him die on TV.

762
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,720
Was that Criss Angel?

763
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,880
Nah, that was Hinder.

764
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
Mr. Hinder.

765
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,480
Griffin, if I'm ever going to buy CDs at Travis' Best Buy, then I'm going to need a trip to

766
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:44,480
the Money Zone.

767
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,760
I don't own that Best Buy, just to clarify, it's not my Best Buy.

768
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:54,640
First up to Glenna from Patrick, Griffin, what's the message?

769
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,640
Patrick would like to wish Glenna a very happy anniversary.

770
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,600
She is his best friend and you know what, his beautiful wife.

771
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,240
Congratulations Glenna on both of those achievements.

772
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,880
It's their 10th anniversary on October 27th.

773
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,960
They've been married for 10 wonderful years and he knows that they will have many more

774
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
to come.

775
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,480
A song from Griffin would be awesome, but I understand if it's not possible.

776
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,280
I mean I can try.

777
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:28,960
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?

778
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,640
Amber is the color of your energy.

779
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,560
Glenna is your wife and will remain to be.

780
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:46,160
Hey, Tyler, you don't get a song, but Chelsea and Trevor Woodburn want to wish you a very,

781
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,120
very happy 31st birthday.

782
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,560
Ooh, the big 31, Justin, you're coming up on that one, right?

783
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,360
Yeah, yeah, it's not a very special one.

784
00:34:54,360 --> 00:35:01,360
Just that march, march to the old grave room, me and Tyler, arm in arm.

785
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:07,120
When your burden becomes too heavy, I will help you carry it.

786
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:11,920
I will carry that burden with you and I want you to know that I'm here for you.

787
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,260
Like a bridge over old ass troubled water.

788
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:21,360
What if instead of celebrating your 31st birthday, you celebrated the 10 year anniversary of

789
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,920
your 21st birthday?

790
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,680
Oh, that's fun.

791
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,880
That sounds really great, Cheryl, from accounting.

792
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:37,760
Hey, this next one, guys, let's take a step back because this one's all about Joseph.

793
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,360
Travis, give me the pitch.

794
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,360
Well, here's the deal, ladies.

795
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,360
Hey, ladies.

796
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,920
His name is Joseph Buchanan, or JJ.

797
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,380
He's 20, but he's turning 21 on the 29th of October.

798
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,560
He moved from Wichita, Kansas to Lawton, OK, to manage a subway while I go to college.

799
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,720
While you go to college?

800
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,720
I jump 10 sits.

801
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,280
Hey, Joseph, would you mind just working at this?

802
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,920
Would you be a sandwich engineer for me while I do my four year?

803
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,200
Can you work at Subway while I go to college for us?

804
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,200
Thanks.

805
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,680
He enjoys reading, playing video games, and you can contact him by searching on Facebook

806
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,040
for Joseph James Buchanan.

807
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:21,500
This is a stand up young man, and I feel like he's got, I mean, he's almost 21 so he can

808
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,760
buy you booze.

809
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,600
And he's getting himself a college degree, ladies, and a degree in sandwich engineering.

810
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:36,040
That's gonna be a cool guy.

811
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,680
I'm looking at this profile right now.

812
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,480
He's got some great interests, like some great films, 300, Anchorman, Dune, he's there for

813
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,480
you.

814
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,380
Mythbusters, Scrubs, he's into it.

815
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:53,800
I'm looking at a picture of him doing, he's benching like 400, and then here's a picture

816
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,800
of him, and it looks like he's been making love for like a really long time, so he looks

817
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,840
really competent in that department.

818
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,960
It looks like he's been doing it like really good, too.

819
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,120
He's been doing it like super good, because like she is high-fiving him, and there's a

820
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:14,640
clock on the wall that's like a timer, like a stopwatch, and it says 35.

821
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,960
So they've been at least doing it for 35 minutes in this good manner.

822
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:24,680
Now, Griffin, you're going into the realm of fantasy, like impossibility.

823
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,300
So ladies, get at him, Joseph James Buchanan.

824
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:35,320
If you want to get onto the money zone, our Jumbotron where we focus in on one of our

825
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,080
very special listeners, go to MaximumFun.org.org.

826
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:45,480
And you can do that, and if you're a business that you want us to highlight, Griffin will

827
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,640
write a professional-style jingle for you and sing it.

828
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,520
I want to thank Joseph for being so brave as to be our first personal ad.

829
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
I know.

830
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,840
Ladies, please don't let us down.

831
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Get at him.

832
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,280
Please get him some.

833
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,520
Please get at him.

834
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,120
Recently, an ex-boyfriend of mine has moved back to town.

835
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,120
We get along.

836
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,280
We don't really gel as friends.

837
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,300
The problem is, he gets along really well with my older sister of one year.

838
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,360
They hang out together often, which makes me jealous in a he-was-mine-first kind of

839
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,720
way, which was somewhat juvenile.

840
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,040
It makes me feel silly, as without her influence, I feel no need to pursue him.

841
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,480
Do you know if it's possible to overcome this jealousy?

842
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,320
And if so, please share this wisdom childishly covetous."

843
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,320
Oh, the heart, right?

844
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,120
The heart.

845
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,400
That's the trickiest muscle.

846
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,800
Tangled web of tissue and blood and bones.

847
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,800
That's the heart.

848
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,400
Well, it sounds like it's a heart freak.

849
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,080
Sounds like somebody's trying to heart-freak you.

850
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,120
I mean, this dude knows what he's doing.

851
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Oh, yeah.

852
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
Yeah, he does.

853
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,560
Yeah, he's like the Criss Angel of hearts.

854
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,720
Nice to meet you, my name's Tom Jones.

855
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,720
Criss Angel of hearts.

856
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,240
That's my name tag.

857
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:15,280
He knows that he's doing it, and I think, I don't know, your sister might not have intentions

858
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,400
like that, but you gotta talk to your sister, I think.

859
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,080
I don't think this is such a ridiculous thing.

860
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:29,120
If one of you two is hanging out with an ex-girlfriend of mine, just like bro-ing out, I would say

861
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,120
something to you.

862
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
It would be weird, yeah.

863
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,120
It would be weird.

864
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:37,360
It wouldn't necessarily, I don't think it would upset me in a way where I'd be jealous

865
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,920
in any way, but it would be so weird that it would be off-putting for me.

866
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,200
Yeah, and I think that that's, sometimes the heart's stupid, and I think your heart may

867
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:55,400
be mixing up the fact that it's weird with making you feel like you want him.

868
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,920
Your heart doesn't want him and doesn't want to be back with him, and in your head I can

869
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,800
hear you saying that, like you recognize that.

870
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,800
What's happening is the weirdness and the hurt of your sister doing that is making you

871
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,160
jealous.

872
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:16,080
I think more specifically, you're a little hurt that your sister is doing this more than

873
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,320
you are jealous of their relationship.

874
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,080
And I think if nothing else, just talking to your sister about it just to clarify the

875
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:28,080
situation because your sister might say like, oh, it's being nice because it's your ex-boyfriend,

876
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:34,440
but finding out what's going on will at least help you clarify how you're feeling about

877
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,560
the situation.

878
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:43,240
You're on some tricky territory here because I think your focus is off a little bit, and

879
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,320
your focus needs to be, this is a thing that's happening that could upset your relationship

880
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:55,040
with your sister, which is so, so, so much more important than you being uncomfortable

881
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,480
with your ex-boyfriend being back in town.

882
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,160
I'm willing to bet that if he told your sister, she would say, oh, I didn't realize it was

883
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,160
bothering you.

884
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,160
Cool.

885
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
Yeah.

886
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,160
Like, I won't hang out with him anymore.

887
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,160
Yeah.

888
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,160
It won't be that important to her.

889
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,160
Yeah.

890
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,240
Family first, you know?

891
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,240
Family first.

892
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,240
Blood before wine.

893
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,240
Sure.

894
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,240
What?

895
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,240
What?

896
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,500
That's what Dracula says.

897
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,880
This Yahoo is sent in by Dracula, who is also known as Matt Labelle.

898
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,880
Thank you, Matt.

899
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,880
Matt Labelle is Dracula?

900
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
Yeah, I know.

901
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,880
I knew it.

902
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,180
Son of a plastic Matt.

903
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:32,680
Next by Yahoo answers user Bobby, who asks, Mac freak.

904
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:38,400
Who asks, is it offensive to dress up as a giant penis with a pair of boobs to answer

905
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,280
the door for trick-or-treaters?

906
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,360
I am planning on donning a giant penis costume complete with plastic boobs and a plastic

907
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,880
butt piece.

908
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,920
If I answer the door for trick-or-treaters, would parents be offended?

909
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,360
I mean, it's not like people have to ring my doorbell, and it is my house.

910
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,880
Is it violating anyone's rights?

911
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,160
I mean, maybe it would be better if I didn't answer the door.

912
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

913
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,040
So you just sit in your apartment alone dressed up like a boob dick?

914
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,040
Drinking.

915
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,480
Boob dick with butt piece.

916
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,480
Why does it...

917
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,480
What?

918
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,480
What's your theme?

919
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,480
What's the overall palette of this costume?

920
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,120
Why does the dick have boobs?

921
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
I don't understand.

922
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,000
I'm going to be Freezer Gaddafi.

923
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,520
Oh, me?

924
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,160
I'm going to be a ghost.

925
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,860
I'm going to be a boob dick complete with plastic butt piece.

926
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,920
You know, I'm not doing just one.

927
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,600
I decided I would go for the full Monty, the full Nightmare Monty.

928
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
Yeah.

929
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,320
You know, if you pulled down Prince's pants, that's what you would see, right?

930
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,320
Pardon me.

931
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,680
The artist formerly known as Prince, you have boobs and a butt on your penis.

932
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,420
You have an anatomically correct penis.

933
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,120
It's like you have a sexy lady as your penis.

934
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,400
Yeah.

935
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,680
What's going on down there, Prince?

936
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,680
Does that even...

937
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,680
Does it work?

938
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
It does.

939
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,680
It does. You know the only thing that comes out of it?

940
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,680
Purple rain.

941
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,680
Purple rain.

942
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,680
God damn.

943
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,680
Oh, no.

944
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,720
That's the end of the show, folks.

945
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,720
How...

946
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,720
77 good episodes.

947
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,720
This...

948
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,960
How...

949
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:15,200
I think that the kids, even the six-year-old that comes to your door and opens it is going

950
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,560
to be more confused than upset.

951
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,400
They may not even make the connection that you're supposed to be a penis.

952
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,800
What do you...

953
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,760
You're like a naked woman wearing a mushroom on your head.

954
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,760
I don't...

955
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,680
Are you naked Susan Powder?

956
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,680
Like what?

957
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,680
Here's the thing.

958
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,080
I'm willing to bet that if you're the type of guy that sits around and thinks about this

959
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,640
question, people aren't going to be ringing your doorbell.

960
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,240
They know that guy's house.

961
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,240
Yeah.

962
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,240
I'm trying...

963
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,240
Can we...

964
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,040
But he does give away full-size candy bars and that's the trade-off.

965
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:56,920
Can we get a vagina on this costume and you can be like Bacchus, God of Sex.

966
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,920
I am everything.

967
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,920
It's easy.

968
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,920
You just put it over the mouth hole.

969
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,920
No.

970
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,920
What do you want?

971
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,920
No.

972
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,920
What are you in the mood for?

973
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,920
Is that a...

974
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,600
Because I got it all.

975
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,520
Does that boob butt penis have a Van Dyke?

976
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,520
No.

977
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,560
I can understand your confusion.

978
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,560
Is that a Hitler mustache?

979
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,560
It is not.

980
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,560
It is not.

981
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,560
It is a...

982
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,600
What if you just did the vagina as a hand puppet?

983
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
Christ.

984
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:28,320
How good would the candy bar have to be before you...

985
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,320
If some dad...

986
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,680
It's a king-size payday, so I'm not certain because it's king-size, but it's payday.

987
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,400
Did you go to that house?

988
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,760
There's a guy dressed up in there like Princess Genitalia, but here's the thing.

989
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,680
Whatchamacallit, he is giving away rolls of quarters.

990
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,640
It's like 10 bucks a quarters.

991
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:54,120
Listen, that house, there is a man dressed up like all the genitalia, and he's only

992
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,000
giving out bit of honeys, so let's just make it clear.

993
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
That might be a crime, actually.

994
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,760
That may be against the law.

995
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,800
I saw his dick, boobs, butt, and vagina, and I got some Necco wafers, so the crime did

996
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,160
not fit the punchline.

997
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,160
You know what?

998
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,160
I always say that if he's gonna do it, he embraces it, and he sits on a lawn chair on

999
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,160
the porch.

1000
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,160
Yeah.

1001
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
Let him know what they're...

1002
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,160
Yeah.

1003
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,160
Getting into.

1004
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,160
And wave.

1005
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,200
This man talks a big game, but I have to believe that if a child came to his house and opened

1006
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,440
the door, he wouldn't just open it dressed up as all the genitalia and then be like,

1007
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,440
sup!

1008
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,440
Hey!

1009
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,440
I'm embarrassed.

1010
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,440
What are you?

1011
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,080
Oh, you're a Ninja Turtle.

1012
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,680
You'll know what I am later.

1013
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:40,120
Daddy's gonna take you home and give you the worst talk of your entire life that anyone's

1014
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,120
ever received.

1015
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,120
That may be...

1016
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,440
To explain that constitute a child, it may constitute child abuse.

1017
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,440
I'm not...

1018
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,440
I can't say for sure.

1019
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,640
Well, honey, this was a great Halloween, but now for your own good, I have to murder you.

1020
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,640
Yeah.

1021
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,720
Eight years later, that child is gonna be a senior in high school, it's gonna be the

1022
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:00,280
night of his senior prom, he's gonna pull down his girlfriend's thing, and then be like,

1023
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,840
hmm, this isn't how I know it to be.

1024
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,320
This isn't how I learned it.

1025
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,960
Maybe it's a diagram costume.

1026
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:13,280
It's like slim good body, you know, it's slim bad body.

1027
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,600
Just shows you all the bad things.

1028
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,600
Hey, where's your boob dick?

1029
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,600
This isn't...

1030
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,600
This is...

1031
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,600
I don't even know what to...

1032
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,600
What the hell?

1033
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,600
What's this bait and switch?

1034
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,600
This is just like a normal vagina.

1035
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,600
You only got the one.

1036
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,280
I need all four.

1037
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,280
I can't finish.

1038
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,320
I can't...

1039
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,320
Save me, Prince.

1040
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,320
Save me, Prince.

1041
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:35,040
The only girl for me is Prince.

1042
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,160
I recently met a girl in a bookstore.

1043
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,900
She works there, and I really liked her, so next time I went there, I asked her out.

1044
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:45,420
She said she can't, but I can always come by for tea at the bookstore, which is also

1045
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,800
a tea shop.

1046
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,200
I'm pretty sure that means she has a boyfriend.

1047
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,900
She was very nice, and then every time I go there, we end up talking for a few minutes.

1048
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:59,540
Should I go and ask her for that tea, or just move away from this city, Mitch in Romania?

1049
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,120
Did you say Mitch or Dracul?

1050
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:06,560
Well, Dracul, here's the deal.

1051
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,720
I don't know if she has a boyfriend or not, but she doesn't want to have that tea with

1052
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,120
you.

1053
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:21,000
I was reading in a book, and I forget the name of the book, the title escapes me, but

1054
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,640
it's a book about etiquette, and in that book, they introduce the idea of the Brad Pitt test,

1055
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:32,360
which I think is a wonderful, wonderful tool that everyone can implement in their day-to-day

1056
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,460
lives.

1057
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:43,200
If Brad Pitt asked a girl out at a tea shop, it wouldn't even be an issue.

1058
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,560
She would have that tea.

1059
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,800
She would go wherever.

1060
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:53,480
If she wanted to have this date with you, it would have gone down.

1061
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,480
That's what I'm saying.

1062
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:00,040
I'm not comfortable with the idea of every man on earth evaluating himself compared to

1063
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,040
Brad Pitt.

1064
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,040
How many steps down?

1065
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,040
No, no, no.

1066
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,040
I don't think that's it.

1067
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:08,240
What it sounds like to me is it's a criteria of people will often say, well, she couldn't

1068
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,960
do it because she was at work, or she couldn't do it because she has a boyfriend, but the

1069
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,760
deal is she said no without saying no.

1070
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,760
She was being nice.

1071
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,760
Right.

1072
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,920
You got politely turned down for whatever reason.

1073
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,640
Maybe she has a boyfriend, maybe she doesn't.

1074
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:28,960
Yeah, I mean, you got turned down, you have a great way of saving face because you already

1075
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,960
go there.

1076
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,160
Just go and enjoy her in the ladies' zoo that is her job and appreciate her there.

1077
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:44,060
I have another idea, and that is that you need to give her the Paul Giamatti test.

1078
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:50,840
That is, if she would go out with Paul Giamatti, she would probably go out with you.

1079
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,200
What are her standards like?

1080
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,200
Yeah.

1081
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,120
Maybe you need to meet this boyfriend, and maybe he's just a real ugly pile of crap.

1082
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,400
I feel like if you compare yourself to Brad Pitt on a day-to-day, you're going to lose

1083
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,400
your mind.

1084
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,280
If you compare yourself to Paul Giamatti in any field other than acting, of which he is

1085
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:10,560
superb and sublime, then it's going to go much, much better for your self-esteem.

1086
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,520
Can we for once just take it easy on Paul Giamatti on one of these shows?

1087
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,520
No, you know why?

1088
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,920
He's out there doing it every day, Griffin.

1089
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,200
But he's so good.

1090
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,320
I saw him on Ides of March, I wept, and his part wasn't even particularly sad.

1091
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,880
It was actually rather a happy part.

1092
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,880
It was.

1093
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,880
But he's...

1094
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,600
Ides of March, filmed in Cincinnati, starring Billy Jays.

1095
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,440
Yeah, that's true.

1096
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,200
He looks like a... what are those creatures?

1097
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,200
A big toe?

1098
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,120
No, like a sleaze stack.

1099
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,800
I've recently been entered into your relationship.

1100
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,160
We can't just bounce off that subject by me saying that Paul Giamatti looks like a sleaze

1101
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,160
stack.

1102
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,560
That's usually when one of the two of you chides me, and I say, I'm sorry, Paul Giamatti.

1103
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,560
We gotta come to a...

1104
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,560
You know what?

1105
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,560
Sometimes, Griffin, you just nail it.

1106
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:06,280
Yeah, sometimes you just lead... you and Paul Giamatti live in your own, like, parallel

1107
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,200
universe together, and if you want to make amends with him, you go to his house.

1108
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:15,960
I'm tired of you using our show as a platform to apologize to Paul Giamatti.

1109
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:16,960
You know what, Griffin?

1110
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,960
Buy a fucking person, Aladdin.

1111
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:23,240
Say you're sorry to Paul from now on, because I'm tired of you using NBNB AM as a bully

1112
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,040
pulpit to apologize for bullying Paul Giamatti.

1113
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,040
It's done.

1114
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,040
It's over.

1115
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,040
Hey, guys, can we cut out cyberbullying of Paul Giamatti, please?

1116
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,680
Can I just say one thing, though?

1117
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,360
Yeah, as long as it's not directly addressed to Paul Giamatti.

1118
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,360
Paul, if you're...

1119
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,360
Not as much.

1120
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,360
Paul, if you're...

1121
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,400
I've recently entered into your relationship with this girl.

1122
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:50,040
I would like to issue a statement to all Paul Giamattis, and that is that I'm so sorry.

1123
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,040
I'm so sorry.

1124
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,040
Paul's...

1125
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,120
There's a Paul Giamatti in Idaho right now that's, like, crying.

1126
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,120
Messrs.

1127
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:02,080
Giamatti, I apologize for my actions in working with you.

1128
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,360
I want to get through this question.

1129
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:07,920
I have recently entered into a relationship with this girl who has been out of a long-term

1130
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,320
relationship for a short time, as have I.

1131
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:16,040
One thing that kind of bothers me, and I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong here, but about

1132
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:20,820
99% of her Facebook profile pictures are her kissing her ex-boyfriend.

1133
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,280
Am I in the wrong for being concerned with this?

1134
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,520
Is it okay to request these be removed?

1135
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,000
Ocarina in Ohio.

1136
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,760
I don't believe that this young man is an ocarina, but go on.

1137
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,520
No, he is not a sweet potato-shaped flute.

1138
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,280
I think what needs to be removed is you.

1139
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,880
You got to go, and I'll tell you why.

1140
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,720
Because anybody who 99% of their Facebook profile pictures...

1141
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,720
Let me say again.

1142
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:52,680
If she has 100 Facebook profile pictures, 99 of them are pictures of her kissing somebody.

1143
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:58,200
That's not okay in any language.

1144
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,020
Can we just, like, talk about this issue specifically?

1145
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:09,720
And this really is kind of a bugbear with me, but your profile picture on Facebook or

1146
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:15,800
any other social networking service should be an attractive, well-framed picture of your

1147
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,880
head and shoulders.

1148
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,880
And it should be a headshot.

1149
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,880
And that's it.

1150
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,880
It should be a headshot.

1151
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,440
It should be a professionally taken headshot.

1152
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,520
And it has to adhere to the rule of thirds.

1153
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,800
I want lighting to be appropriate.

1154
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,880
And it should be at least two years recent.

1155
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,640
Yeah, within the last two years.

1156
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,920
Because I'm tired of these motherfuckers.

1157
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,640
Your baby, stop it.

1158
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,640
Your dogs.

1159
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,640
Just a weird color design.

1160
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,880
What the fuck is that?

1161
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,160
You with other people?

1162
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,680
Hi, which one are you?

1163
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,800
Like I don't know how to address you because I don't know what you look like.

1164
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,960
I don't know if I need to talk to you like you're a fat person or not.

1165
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,840
Like I don't know if you're living your life that way.

1166
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,720
The kids drive me crazy.

1167
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,400
Why are you letting your baby have a Facebook?

1168
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,760
Why does this baby have a Facebook?

1169
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,720
And why does Breakfast of Champions is his favorite book?

1170
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,200
Like stop it, baby.

1171
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,200
I agree.

1172
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,080
Also, don't put, I don't want to see you as a cartoon.

1173
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,480
I don't want to see you as a Mad Men cartoon.

1174
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,160
Is that still a thing?

1175
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,080
I want to just see you.

1176
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,080
Just be yourself.

1177
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,120
Let me see your face.

1178
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,400
I need it.

1179
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,360
Now back to this guy's problem.

1180
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,480
Are you in the wrong for being concerned about this?

1181
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,200
Is it okay to request they be removed?

1182
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,360
It's not okay is the problem.

1183
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,360
No.

1184
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,360
They shouldn't be there in the first place.

1185
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:38,280
Like my girlfriend, her Facebook profile is just a hundred pictures of dudes butts.

1186
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,200
Like yeah, that's not okay.

1187
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,200
Yeah.

1188
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,240
I think the whole situation is just weird.

1189
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:48,640
So maybe you don't say anything and see how it shakes out and you just accept that it's

1190
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,640
already weird.

1191
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:56,720
Or you go down the list and you like each one or you just comment nice.

1192
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,920
Oh, I like this.

1193
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,640
Like this smooch.

1194
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,740
Everything's looking good here.

1195
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,800
Let's try this one out tonight.

1196
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,800
You guys look really in love.

1197
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,680
That must have been such a pleasant time in your life.

1198
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,160
I'm sorry you had second best with me.

1199
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,020
I bet you're sad this is over.

1200
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,860
Is this the Applebee's on third?

1201
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,920
This looks so nice.

1202
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,920
Let's go there.

1203
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,560
You and me and him if you want.

1204
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,840
I have a fun idea.

1205
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,440
Let's recreate all these pictures.

1206
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:27,440
It'll be like the soldier kissing his lady on V-Day.

1207
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,920
These hit locations and reenact these loving moments.

1208
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,880
Don't have a picture of you kissing anybody on Facebook.

1209
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,880
And guess what?

1210
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,460
If you do have that picture and you think you're about to break up with this person,

1211
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:45,160
like as soon as the idea enters your mind, you delete every single one of those pics.

1212
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,400
And if they notice like, hey, what happened to all our kiss pics?

1213
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,400
It's got to go.

1214
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,400
It's got to end right then.

1215
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,880
That's your entry into the situation.

1216
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,160
I was hoping you wouldn't notice because now I do have to in fact cut this off.

1217
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,960
Please please come into my office, Bradley.

1218
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,680
Bradley, your performance lately.

1219
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,400
We really appreciate the time that you've committed to this relationship over the last

1220
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,600
couple of months.

1221
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:18,360
But in this economy, it just seems like the kiss pics and the cutesy poking on Facebook,

1222
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,480
it's ruined and we're going to have to let you go.

1223
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,800
Can we please start breaking up with people and blaming the economy?

1224
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,240
It's like, listen, layoffs are all over.

1225
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:33,200
I just I haven't recovered from 9-11 yet.

1226
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,200
I keep saying I'm going to back.

1227
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,160
Everything changed on that day, that fateful day.

1228
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,160
And that includes my love for you.

1229
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,200
So yeah.

1230
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:49,440
So listen, just leave your name tag with Darcy on the way out, I guess.

1231
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,400
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

1232
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,280
But first, real quick housekeeping stuff.

1233
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,000
This is my brother, my brother and me.

1234
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,120
We're at MBMBAM.com.

1235

We're on tweedo at MBMBAM is our username.

1236
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:10,560
We love it when people talk about our show using the MBMBAM hashtag.

1237
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:18,760
I know Carly Violet did Nick Claw's Guillermo, Croco Swine is still there with YHT and John

1238
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:27,240

1240
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:39,720
And I want to throw out Brent O'Floss and I just did a video where we talk about this

1241
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:43,260
podcast and talk about his web comic, talk about all that stuff.

1242
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:44,260
It's very funny.

1243
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:47,760
And more than anything, I just wanted to say it was great catching up with my dear friend

1244
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,760
Brent O'Floss.

1245
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,720
So thanks, Brent.

1246
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:55,140
And I also want to thank Letty Van Hemert and Nick Rose for pimping us in meat space

1247
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,240
in the real world.

1248
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,240
Thank you guys very much.

1249
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,240
That's not much.

1250
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:04,960
So when you make that tweet with your mouth, mouth tweets, we are going to have if we do

1251
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,600
not already, I'm not I don't think we have this right this second.

1252
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:14,000
But I would not be surprised if by the time you listen to this, this is is active.

1253
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:22,280
But we have a brand new My Brother, My Brother, Me T-shirt headed to MaxFunStore.com from

1254
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,100
our friends at Tipotico.

1255
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:29,160
It is a should I say what it is or should I just let people discover for themselves?

1256
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:35,240
It is a fully erect penis with boobs, but yeah, it's a whole shebang.

1257
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,920
It's called the whole shebang is the name of the shirt.

1258
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:48,360

1259
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,000
We'll tweet about it when it goes live.

1260
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,800
But keep an eye out for for MaxFunStore.

1261
00:57:54,800 --> 00:58:01,680
I don't think iTunes will let us put a thing on it called the H-O-L-E There's all this

1262
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,680
look.

1263
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,140
It's an opportunity to do research.

1264
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:07,460
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winners for the use of our theme song.

1265
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:11,920
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed, which a bunch of other people

1266
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,400
got on Twitter today and said they started listening to and then it's fucking dope.

1267
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:20,440

We're not needy.

1274
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,320
It's not a big deal.

1275
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,320
Griffin.

1276
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,500
I'm a little needy.

1277
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:38,200
