1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,760
Hi everybody, it's the Sick Boys.

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,560
It's all the sick, well it's two of the sick boys, and there's sick women also,

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,160
sick women and children, and everyone's sick and it's a nightmare.

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,800
Now, to be fair, I am not sick.

9
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,600
Oh, how's that?

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,800
Well, let me take that back. I would say I'm not physically ill,

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,280
but in many ways, mentally, spiritually.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,400
Yeah, I've said that about you for a long time, is that your spirit itself is sick,

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,080
like you're religiously sick.

14
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,600
Yeah, for like seven-

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,040
Travis, I've got great news.

16
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,120
For like seven nights in a row, BB has been up from like 1 to 4 or 30 in the morning.

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,920
Yeah, thank you all for waiting on this episode.

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,440
It's been the case for all of us for like the better part of a week now,

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,480
and it is tough to put together some laughs for you.

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,720
But here we are, and we wanted to put out something this week,

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,280
and so we have a live show for you, but little do you know,

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,960
or maybe you do, depending on what I make the episode description,

23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,800
it's actually two live shows in one.

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,320
I have combined some of the best bits from our two back-to-back Chicago shows that we did last year

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,240
into one super episode.

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,480
And Trav, I don't know how much you remember about the Chicago shows,

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,600
but there's some fucking jammers up in there.

28
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,520
Oh, okay. I'm excited to forget to listen to it.

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,320
People are finally going to get to know why some of the Bim Bam fans

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,520
who were in attendance that night are constantly talking about seven parrots,

31
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,720
because this is when that sort of comes to a head.

32
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,720
It's a fun episode, and we apologize for, you know,

33
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,880
we like giving you a heads up that a live episode's coming out,

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,960
but obviously that wasn't possible this week.

35
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,840
But yeah, it's two live shows in one.

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,680
I cut like a ton of stuff out of both of them

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,880
just to put together one super episode.

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,840
So here's that, and we'll talk to you when we get to the Money Zone.

39
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,440
Hello, everybody, and welcome, my brother, my brother-in-law,

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,720
and welcome to my show for the modern era.

41
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,160
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

42
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,720
Please, Auguste, save some for later.

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

44
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,240
And I'm your sweet baby brother

45
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,800
in 30 Under 30 Media Luminary, Griffin McElroy.

46
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,380
We...

47
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,520
We are dying.

48
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,920
Well, technically, we all are for the moment.

49
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,600
Have a fun show, everybody!

50
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,880
Or I'm gonna start dying.

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,420
We...

52
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,880
...eated the deep dish.

53
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,840
We have tasted...

54
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,800
We have tasted...

55
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,560
...your tall pizza.

56
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,000
We have, as have so many tourists,

57
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,600
fallen into the pizza trap that you have lured for them.

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,440
Oh, no, you ate the deep dish.

59
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,760
Oh, no, you're not supposed to eat the deep dish, obviously.

60
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,280
This savory cake you call deep pizza.

61
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,320
This savory cake you call deep pizza.

62
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,480
You guys are probably tired of hearing about your pizza,

63
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,400
but I'm tired of feeling your pizza in me.

64
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,520
We're having fun, but...

65
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,040
I feel like I was hit by a garbage truck.

66
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,520
Here's the thing, it's delicious.

67
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,960
It's a delicious garbage truck.

68
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,040
It's delicious, but I feel like I was hit by a garbage truck

69
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,320
and that some of it got into me.

70
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,880
And that's not a knock on that,

71
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,880
it's a knock on our garbage bodies.

72
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,120
We haven't yet had that Van Morrison,

73
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,640
like, well, Van partied too hard.

74
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,960
He's going to need someone to walk him off stage tonight.

75
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,840
There's no more con.

76
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,680
He's going to do four songs and go home.

77
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,720
But we were like perilously close backstage having a conversation.

78
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,320
Justin was doing his TaeKwonDo,

79
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,800
getting all of us sort of psyched out of our minds.

80
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,720
I was doing it in a room alone,

81
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,280
and then people entered while I was doing TaeKwonDo.

82
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,840
And that seems to me like it should be treated

83
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,200
like someone using the bathroom.

84
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,880
It should be, if you see me-

85
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,200
The noises you made were sort of synonymous.

86
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
It's called a key up and it's a part of the formation.

87
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,040
It's powerful.

88
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,640
I don't want to forget that there's a key up with that spear hand.

89
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,040
So it's just part of the formation.

90
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,600
Yeah, I agree.

91
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,920
I'm not doing it right if I'm not doing the key ups.

92
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,440
I guess, 100%.

93
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,160
Okay, thank you.

94
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,360
Thank you all so much for coming.

95
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,960
No, he's not going to do it now.

96
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,560
It's not a performance.

97
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,880
He just compared it to using the bathroom.

98
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,920
You perverts.

99
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,480
Yeah, you-

100
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,320
Take a dump on stage.

101
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,640
We're saving that for Milwaukee.

102
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,520
Yeah.

103
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,400
Yeah.

104
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,720
Because they nasty.

105
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,160
They nasty in Milwaukee.

106
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,960
What an honor it is to be here with you all tonight.

107
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,920
I'm so excited.

108
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,160
Yeah.

109
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,080
We might actually try tonight.

110
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,080
Tonight, before we've always phoned it in for the 50 plus shows we've done before this.

111
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,280
But tonight, we're bringing it for your beautiful, wonderful city that has made us feel so well.

112
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:29,600
You know what?

113
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,440
Tonight, we horny for this one.

114
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,680
Yeah.

115
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,600
God, we can say all we want, but I still feel like I'm going to die.

116
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,160
Like, we're trying to talk ourselves into not dying, but it's just not going to happen.

117
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,120
If the burp police were here tonight, backstage, we would have been sentenced to life.

118
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,160
I actually feel great.

119
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,720
Great.

120
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,600
Open up.

121
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,480
It's the fart BI.

122
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,280
How do you all, are you all just sort of accustomed?

123
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,680
Have your bodies become inoculated to the tall pizza?

124
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,240
Is that what it is?

125
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,880
I don't know.

126
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,520
I don't know.

127
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,080
I don't know.

128
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,640
I don't know.

129
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,200
I don't know.

130
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,760
I don't know.

131
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,720
Guys, should we get going?

132
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,040
Yeah.

133
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,720
So, this is like, it's an advice show, as you've certainly gleaned by this point.

134
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,200
Kind of a do as we don't sort of situation.

135
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,600
Don't eat at the pizza.

136
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,640
Don't eat of your pizza.

137
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,040
Unless you've got natural, I'm assuming you've developed some sort of digestive toxin.

138
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,080
Or perhaps like a separate stomach chamber that allows you to regurgitate.

139
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,640
We didn't turn the tall pizza into could the right way.

140
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,000
But, so we take your questions and turn them out and be like into wisdom.

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,560
That's the bit.

142
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,360
You know what?

143
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,720
Let's all take a nap.

144
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,160
Just a tight 20.

145
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:45,920
Okay.

146
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,280
I'm gonna turn it around right now.

147
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,760
Are you ready to turn it around with us through your energy and power?

148
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,920
It's too much.

149
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:54,800
Help.

150
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,680
I'm too amped.

151
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,280
All right.

152
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,520
We don't normally do this, but you want to start with the Yahoo?

153
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,640
I do want to start with the Yahoo.

154
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,560
If you've never listened to our show before, we take questions and turn them alchemy-like

155
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,680
into wisdom.

156
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,840
And Griffin has extracted some questions from the Yahoo answer service.

157
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,400
I have a team of people who extract it for me.

158
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,680
I would never put on the suit required to go into the fucking upside down

159
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
and tangle with these fucking monsters.

160
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,520
Uh, this one was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

161
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,240
Thank you, Seth.

162
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,520
It's from Yahoo answers user Kaylee, who asks, what would happen if I shoot a Ouija board?

163
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,720
I've been playing with that thing and now I want to get rid of it.

164
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,480
What would happen if I shoot it multiple times with a real shotgun?

165
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,720
First off, does this guy not know of other ways to get rid of things?

166
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:52,960
Yeah.

167
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,680
It's just like, that was a delicious Coke Zero.

168
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,440
Oh, I got all my, would you do the Ouija board like, or is this sitting on the ground?

169
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,200
I think if you think it has a demonic presence inside of it, you, there's no, you don't want

170
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,160
to risk it.

171
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,720
Right.

172
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,000
This ain't no game.

173
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm going to shoot this Ouija board on the ground.

174
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,560
Thank you.

175
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,520
I'm going to execute this Ouija board.

176
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,240
This person thinks that the Ouija board would, would kill me.

177
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,280
Sure, this person thinks that the Ouija board would withstand multiple direct shotgun blasts.

178
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,760
Yeah.

179
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,960
Like they think it is imbued with some sort of dark energy.

180
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,000
No, no, no.

181
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
They've never fired a shotgun before, in which case this could also be very hilarious.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,400
Oh yeah.

183
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,520
One way or the other, film this.

184
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,960
Yeah, please put it on video.

185
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,280
We do.

186
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,600
Cause you might release a demon or you might like lift yourself off the ground and go flying

187
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,280
back cause you're six inches from a sidewalk firing a shotgun.

188
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,080
It's going to go bad.

189
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,320
I feel like Jumanji 2.

190
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,400
Not the one that's already coming out, but a new one.

191
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,800
That's really just an edit of the first one.

192
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,200
Right.

193
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,080
Where they, where one kid gets sucked into the game for 30 years, which is a huge bummer

194
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,120
if you really.

195
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,440
Yeah.

196
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,880
How's your kid's movie?

197
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,520
It's bad.

198
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,520
But then the, one of the other kids is like, well, fuck this.

199
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:09,840
Yeah.

200
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,720
Just blows it all.

201
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,840
Do you guys remember?

202
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,840
Or David, David Allen Greer, like a rhino rams his car and he's like, I'm going to find

203
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,880
that fucking game.

204
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,440
Why didn't they just like shoot it?

205
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,800
The first animal comes through.

206
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,400
You shoot the board, you shoot.

207
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,680
Or the animal.

208
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,880
Everybody was very like.

209
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,440
You can't do that.

210
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,240
They're endangered.

211
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,920
Oh, cause they're, there's not enough fantasy animals out there.

212
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,440
And that's why we called you all here today.

213
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,480
Hey, why didn't we use the Jumanji board to generate more endangered animals?

214
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,760
We could fix the whole thing.

215
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,680
Just like, oh, we're almost out of tigers.

216
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,120
No, we're not Robin.

217
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,680
Go ahead.

218
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,960
Let them out.

219
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,680
There it is.

220
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,880
Tigers, tigers everywhere.

221
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:47,920
Yeah.

222
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,280
Do you guys remember?

223
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,160
There was a cartoon version of Jumanji.

224
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,400
No.

225
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,360
Right.

226
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,280
There's a cartoon series and it was set not of the whimsical board game playing part,

227
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,000
but of.

228
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,040
It wasn't whimsical, Travis.

229
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,000
People died.

230
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,560
But you know the part where little kid Robin Williams and we're the picture like a 10 year

231
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,480
old in the jungle for by himself for 30 years is the world moves on without him and he becomes

232
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,320
the animals he's afraid of.

233
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,840
That's what the cartoon is.

234
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,000
How fun to like bury his shit.

235
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,680
My parents just died.

236
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,880
That monkey just pooped.

237
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,680
It's a cartoon.

238
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,800
I don't know how electronics work.

239
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,480
How fun.

240
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,280
I just fought a wombat for the right to eat my own scat.

241
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,560
Enjoy kids.

242
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,720
To be fair, they also made a cartoon out of Beetlejuice where Beetlejuice is like a lovable

243
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,280
rascal.

244
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,800
Uh, he was a lovable rascal.

245
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,720
Robin, that movie's unbelievable.

246
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,720
Jumanji, the only thing that is unbelievable about it that keeps it from being like a documentary.

247
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,200
The only thing.

248
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,920
The only thing that when Robin Williams comes out, he just doesn't instantly snap that fucking

249
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,640
board over his face.

250
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,680
And flush it down the toilet.

251
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,800
Flush it down the toilet.

252
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,560
The first, like there should be 10 minutes of that movie where Robin Williams is peeing

253
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,600
on the Jumanji board.

254
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Yeah.

255
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,880
Fuck this.

256
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,600
Fuck this.

257
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
I recently bought a pair of designer Heelys.

258
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,800
Show over.

259
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,600
End of question.

260
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,600
I recently bought a pair of designer Heelys because a teen told me they were cool.

261
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,800
That is such a bad, that's such a bad like life strategy.

262
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,760
Such a bad reason to do anything.

263
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,260
Yeah.

264
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,520
Uh, how do I learn to Heely without anybody seeing me fall down or stumble or get hurt?

265
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:39,360
Heely without anybody seeing me fall down or stumble or otherwise make a fool of myself.

266
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,840
I have a roommate, so practicing at home is out of the question.

267
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,720
I'm assuming, I'm assuming your roommate's a shut-in.

268
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,440
That's fine.

269
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,840
Uh, I also live in a big city.

270
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,320
We know.

271
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,480
We're here too.

272
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:52,960
Remember?

273
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,280
We're all gonna be here in Chicago.

274
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,920
It's pretty big.

275
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,080
A lot of beautiful architecture too.

276
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,200
Oh, so lovely.

277
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,920
The art deco.

278
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,240
Lovely.

279
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,000
I can't stop talking about these gothic touches.

280
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,040
I'm 37.

281
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,280
So unless I'm practicing at 3 a.m. on weekdays, someone could see my shame.

282
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,440
Also, it'd be dark and I'd probably fall.

283
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,720
Please help me out so that I can be my best, raddest self.

284
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,040
That's from Hesitant Heel Head from Chicago.

285
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,680
Are you here?

286
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,640
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

287
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,240
Hold on.

288
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,840
All right, I need complete silence.

289
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,200
I'm gonna ask again.

290
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,400
Are you here?

291
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,800
Okay.

292
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,000
Okay, I heard a what?

293
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,880
I heard a what?

294
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
So, okay, thank you.

295
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,560
Yes, you are here.

296
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,440
Excellent.

297
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,520
When you led out to this, how-

298
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,360
You don't have to answer this because I'm gonna answer it myself because I saw the joke work.

299
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,160
Please don't because you don't have a microphone and we do.

300
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,280
When you're having this conversation with said teen,

301
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,440
did you lead off by going,

302
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,400
hey, what's cool?

303
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,760
And the teen was like,

304
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,640
designer Heelys and you're like, got it.

305
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,000
Like ran out the door.

306
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,720
Designer Heelys.

307
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,160
Is there a postscript on the email that's like,

308
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,760
I'm gonna, okay, I'm just gonna try it.

309
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,880
My kneecaps, my kneecaps, they're gone.

310
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,880
My legs are melting.

311
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,240
They're just gone.

312
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,040
My legs are coming off at the seams.

313
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,040
Legs have seams.

314
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,080
I've unraveled.

315
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,320
I've unraveled like a flesh mummy.

316
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,640
I firmly believe that-

317
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,240
I'm 37 years old now, I mentioned.

318
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,160
Jesus.

319
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,960
I know.

320
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,560
That's basically 40.

321
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,680
All right, all right, all right, all right.

322
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,480
Youngins.

323
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:38,980
Yeah.

324
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,920
Okay, all right.

325
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,440
So anyway, where was I?

326
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,080
Before I started-

327
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,480
Oh, are you starting to forget what you were talking about?

328
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,040
Oh no.

329
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,800
Oh, before we decided to have a nice long ponder at my open grave.

330
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I'm 37 years old now and I've learned a lot in those 37 years.

331
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:07,840
And one of the things that I have sort of become the most clear to me is that what matters in

332
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:16,400
life is not the accumulation of wealth or stuff or prestige, but the important thing

333
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,440
and the thing that you can really do for the world is what can you give to the people that

334
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,080
you encounter?

335
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,000
How can your life be a service to them?

336
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,640
Because in the end, that's the only thing that matters.

337
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:36,080
So I guess what I'm saying is, if I saw an adult fall the first time they ever used Healy's,

338
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,760
it would be the greatest gift you could give me sort of personally in my day-to-day life.

339
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,320
You would have to announce, this is my first time.

340
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,280
First time.

341
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,040
Hey everybody, gather around.

342
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,280
I've decided to try Healy's today.

343
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,920
Today.

344
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,200
Now for you.

345
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,120
I'm pretty nervous about it.

346
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,040
I'm three days away from retirement.

347
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:57,920
Right.

348
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,840
If you would do that, that would be such a gift.

349
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,960
What an amazing thing that would be sort of a facet in the jewel that is my life.

350
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:12,800
One of the biggest facets would be that time I saw a grown adult try Healy's for the first

351
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,560
time and beef it.

352
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,600
Beef it so hard.

353
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,240
Because the other option is that they say, I'm going to try Healy's for the first time,

354
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,840
and it's glorious.

355
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,600
And you're just like, a butterfly.

356
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,160
They've done it.

357
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,800
They've finally become what they were always meant to be.

358
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,160
I'm sorry, what?

359
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,200
What's everyone yelling?

360
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,080
You're wearing them.

361
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,440
You're wearing them.

362
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,760
Excuse me, he's wearing them.

363
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:45,120
Excuse me, I'm going to need house lights and I'm going to need you to come to center

364
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,240
aisle now.

365
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,280
Hold on.

366
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,840
Hold on.

367
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,240
Hold on.

368
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,040
Serious question.

369
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,720
Come on over here to the center aisle.

370
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,840
Is this your first time?

371
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,600
Because I'm actually kind of mixed on it.

372
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,120
That's hysterical.

373
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,080
But also, are we insured?

374
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,840
How does that even work?

375
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,240
Listen.

376
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,360
Paul, can you give me a thumbs up or thumbs down?

377
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,280
On encouraging an audience member to Healy's.

378
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,920
Yeah, it's an iffy.

379
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,200
Okay, iffy.

380
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,920
I'll take that.

381
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,320
They're going to be fine though.

382
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,800
All right.

383
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,120
Whatever you do, don't Healy.

384
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,960
Wink.

385
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,840
Don't say wink.

386
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,800
There's a being in the recording.

387
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,840
Don't say wink.

388
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,240
We'll just wait.

389
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Now, come down to one more aisle over, please.

390
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,720
Center.

391
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,360
Center stage.

392
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,520
Oh, you're going to go around.

393
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,960
You haven't been drinking, have you?

394
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,280
Because, okay.

395
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,760
Can you?

396
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,080
All right.

397
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,280
And I need everybody to be quiet.

398
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,080
Okay, we're going to count down.

399
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,440
Can you yell your name, please?

400
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,720
Sam.

401
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,200
Sam.

402
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,640
Sam.

403
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,520
Sam.

404
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:41,840
Sam.

405
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,600
And what would you like on your theme song?

406
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,400
Here we go.

407
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,680
Wait, Sam, wait.

408
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,600
What are you putting on?

409
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,200
Just in case.

410
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,240
No, I'm just going to film.

411
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,120
Oh, I thought you were going to put on some Healy music.

412
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,280
No, okay.

413
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,640
Just going to put on the theme song to Yuri on Ice as you glide effortlessly down the...

414
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,120
All right.

415
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,720
Okay, and I'm ready.

416
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,760
Go ahead, Sam.

417
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,280
Healy on down to us.

418
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,320
Please be careful.

419
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,200
Please be careful.

420
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,120
All right.

421
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,400
You're doing it.

422
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,600
All right, dab, dab.

423
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,320
We got to dab.

424
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,360
Keep going.

425
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,880
Okay, and we'll stop right here.

426
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,840
We'll stop right here.

427
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,720
We'll stop right here.

428
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,200
Perfect.

429
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,880
Perfect.

430
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,760
Okay.

431
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,240
Thank you.

432
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,120
Sam, everybody.

433
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,880
And a special thanks to the security guard who stopped Sam from Healying too close to the stage.

434
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,760
Sam, you now owe this man a life debt.

435
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,240
Okay, thank you, Sam.

436
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,320
Thank you, Sam.

437
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,040
That was excellent.

438
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,680
You did so good.

439
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,120
And now you're great at Healying.

440
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,400
We fixed one.

441
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,440
Oh, how exciting.

442
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,520
How about a Yahoo from the Yahoo Answer Service?

443
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,200
This one was sent in by Level 9000.

444
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,720
Yeah, Drew Drew, Drew Davenport.

445
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,520
Thank you, Drew.

446
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,640
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user, but we'll call them Bill-a-me.

447
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,480
Bill-a-me asks,

448
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,960
Cat won't come out of hiding after I got a vape pin?

449
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,840
So today we actually thought our cat ran away because we couldn't find him,

450
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,800
and he doesn't usually hide like that.

451
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,240
I also got a new vape yesterday, and I wonder if this was the problem.

452
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,640
Help!

453
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,240
Jeremy, Jeremy, I'm not going to watch you do this to yourself.

454
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,760
I care too much about you, Jeremy, to be a part of this.

455
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,600
Jeremy, the science is inconclusive.

456
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,400
I'll be under the couch.

457
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,560
If you'll excuse me, I have to lick my asshole.

458
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,800
Which is much like vaping, if you think about it.

459
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,720
Don't get me wrong.

460
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,640
It looks radical.

461
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,280
It looks so cool.

462
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,400
Sick as shit.

463
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,240
But I care about you, Jeremy.

464
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,760
Do you think that the cat was wondering like,

465
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,440
could you do that the whole time?

466
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,640
And you're just now?

467
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,680
Are you a wizard?

468
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Are you a weather wizard?

469
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,200
You make clouds?

470
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,760
If I could blow cotton like that, I would be doing it 24 hours in the cod.

471
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,880
If cats could vape,

472
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,480
if cats could vape,

473
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,400
you know they would be blowing cotton in your face 24 hours a day, right?

474
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,560
You would wake up in like fucking London fog and it's like, what is this?

475
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,200
Oh, that's right.

476
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,360
My cat is fucking ripping some blueberry dream right into my eyeballs.

477
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,840
Garfield would be fucking lighting John.

478
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,520
You wouldn't see normal.

479
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,560
There is probably not a Garfield strip that couldn't be accurately concluded with Garfield

480
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,200
just, well, Garfield had a real rough day at the honest.

481
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
And Garfield thinks, tell me about it, John.

482
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,280
And John's like, ask the girl on date.

483
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,920
She said, no.

484
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:00,000
Every Garfield strip has just two.

485
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,960
Just make sure two more frames like a pendant on of those.

486
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,280
That's frame four.

487
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,800
Frame five.

488
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,040
You're such a fucking idiot, John.

489
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,440
Jack Garfield would blow it right in John's face.

490
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,240
Yeah, definitely.

491
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,640
It's just a big cloud around John.

492
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,440
Around John.

493
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,640
Then the last strip is secondhand vape.

494
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,760
Like, it's killed John.

495
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,080
It's inconclusive.

496
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,800
We don't know yet.

497
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,880
The science is out on that one right now.

498
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,880
Jim Davis definitely vapes, though.

499
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,840
Do they make lasagna flavored vape?

500
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,840
Oh, he would love that.

501
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,520
He would love it.

502
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,200
But you know when he wouldn't vape?

503
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,400
Mondays.

504
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,880
Are you kidding me?

505
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,800
No, I think he would vape extra hard on Mondays.

506
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,840
He would especially vape double on Mondays.

507
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,600
It's the only thing getting him through.

508
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,360
Yeah, ripping that Monday cotton.

509
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,680
How about Yahoo?

510
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,320
Yeah, please.

511
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,600
Please.

512
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,000
I don't want to oversell it.

513
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,160
It might be the best Yahoo of all time.

514
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,520
Well, at least you didn't oversell it.

515
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,000
It was sent in by Ben Schultz.

516
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,480
Thank you, Ben.

517
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,280
It's Yahoo Answers user, Dean, who asked.

518
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,640
Really?

519
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,920
No, it's great.

520
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,800
But I can't do the voice because I don't want to do anything to sully this beautiful-

521
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,640
You could do your sully impression.

522
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,560
Perfect.

523
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,680
I'm a pilot.

524
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,720
Yeah, what's up with that?

525
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,800
Finally, someone put that guy on blast.

526
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,080
Oh, I saved a bunch of people.

527
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,360
What's his rap light with ducks?

528
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,760
Probably not great.

529
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,720
You ever think about that?

530
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,440
Probably not good.

531
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,320
No, he steered a plane into ducks.

532
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,000
He's a monster.

533
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:43,840
Anyway-

534
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,120
Yeah, fuck sully.

535
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,400
I'm sorry.

536
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,440
Is he here tonight, actually?

537
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,080
We're just having fun, sir.

538
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,880
Thank you for your service.

539
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,720
The best Yahoo of all time.

540
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:17,680
Dean asks, if I legally bought the Mona Lisa, would anyone be able to stop me from eating it?

541
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:25,840
Once in a generation, a Yahoo comes along that I don't even know how to joke about because,

542
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,080
I don't know.

543
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,240
It's like Ben came down from a mountain and handed this to me on a tablet.

544
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,080
So, could they?

545
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,560
Could they?

546
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,880
I mean, it's your painting.

547
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,080
Yeah, Indiana Jones is not going to kick in the door to your apartment and be like,

548
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,360
it belongs in a museum.

549
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,080
It does look good.

550
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,200
I get it.

551
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,920
It does look good.

552
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,880
Belongs in a museum.

553
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,080
It belongs in here, indeed.

554
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,960
What if that's how Last Crusade ended?

555
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,640
It's like, you have chosen wisely.

556
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,040
Thank you.

557
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,280
Yeah, you look like Willy Wonka to take a bite out of it.

558
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,600
Now, you could eat a little.

559
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,600
This is an example.

560
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,040
Picture the Mona Lisa, right?

561
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah.

562
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,480
That bottom inch could go.

563
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,040
It could go.

564
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,080
You could eat the bottom inch.

565
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,280
No one would know.

566
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,360
It's not as big as you think it is.

567
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,720
So, like, have a side.

568
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
There are bigger paintings you could eat.

569
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,360
Okay.

570
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,400
Nighthawks is a big one.

571
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,760
You could eat a lot of Nighthawks.

572
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,040
Jackson Pollock has some.

573
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,040
Could you eat?

574
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,400
Okay, Travis.

575
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,600
If you're going to eat the Mona Lisa, would you start with the face?

576
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,400
No, background.

577
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,480
I'd start with the background.

578
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,040
You can eat that.

579
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,760
Here's what you do.

580
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,280
You photocopy it.

581
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,000
Okay.

582
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
Then you eat the background.

583
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,360
Then you just put it over the photocopy.

584
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,320
Yeah, this is literally a Mr. Bean movie you've described.

585
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,320
Oh, no.

586
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,640
I can think a few Power Plays better than getting the Mona Lisa,

587
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,160
making a perfect copy of the Mona Lisa, eating the original, and giving it back.

588
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,560
And say, like, I changed my mind, and I want you all to have it.

589
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,200
All right.

590
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,760
And then when you see people enjoying it in a museum, you're like,

591
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,440
oh, yeah, it's the real one.

592
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,800
And you just rub your tummy.

593
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,160
You rub your tummy.

594
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,960
Do you think that this person would start getting kicked out of the art

595
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,800
auctions because they're just like, 100 million and $1.

596
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,280
That's a knife and fork in there.

597
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,240
They've got a napkin, and it's part of the Mona Lisa.

598
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,080
And they just tore up a Monet to do a little...

599
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,040
That is good because I don't know that anyone, like, when they've died,

600
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,080
have been able to donate their body to a museum before.

601
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,200
I want to donate the Mona Lisa to you.

602
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,080
It's in there.

603
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,040
It's in there, trust me.

604
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,200
Even if you wanted to eat the Mona Lisa,

605
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,360
I suspect that you would probably get about a third of the way through it for like, ugh.

606
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,240
Like, it's not going to be good.

607
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,360
And you don't want to sully that experience with ketchup.

608
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,600
Yeah.

609
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:06,960
Right?

610
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,680
You know what most people don't know? It's very deep.

611
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,520
Yeah, raised sides and everything.

612
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,160
I read the best news story ever the other day.

613
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,720
And it was from some museum.

614
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,600
They realized they had a Van Gogh piece from his, like,

615
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,160
Olive Fields collection that he did.

616
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,320
And what they discovered is that there was a grasshopper in the paint...

617
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,080
Kansas City, what's up?

618
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,320
Represent at a Kansas City museum.

619
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,600
There was a grasshopper just in the painting.

620
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,960
And I love that so much because Van Gogh must have just been like...

621
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,840
Got you!

622
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,040
Got you, you bastard!

623
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,360
Yeah.

624
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
And he still, like, sold it or whatever.

625
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,000
Just like, yeah, you're gonna love it.

626
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,480
Here it is.

627
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,560
It's so realistic.

628
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,400
Here it is.

629
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,600
Grasshopper free.

630
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,920
This painting's called something different.

631
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,400
Oh, you're not going with the same Olive Fields naming commission?

632
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,320
No, this one's called Trapped Idiot.

633
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,600
Take that, fucker.

634
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,080
It's called Take That, Fucker.

635
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,640
Yeah.

636
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,280
Yeah.

637
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:11,920
Now, Griffin...

638
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,880
It looks delicious.

639
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,320
Was it called Olive Fields?

640
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,200
Or are you just very carefully not calling it his Olive Garden period?

641
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,400
Yeah, that's not...

642
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,080
What I said was wrong.

643
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,520
Thank you for bringing it up, Travis.

644
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,200
You could do a tortilla.

645
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,360
You could do a Mona Lisa with beef and cheese.

646
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,840
That's probably the most appealing way of eating it.

647
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,560
And that's good because you could probably get a couple out of that.

648
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,800
Don't eat the Mona Lisa by yourself.

649
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,000
There's only one to eat.

650
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,840
You should share it with everybody.

651
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,120
Is Jackson Pollock still with us?

652
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,240
Because if he is, you give that dude some fucking Subway squeeze bottles of

653
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,160
nacho cheese and guacamole.

654
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,440
He's a sandwich artist.

655
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,920
Whoa, you could eat the Mona Lisa and a Jackson Pollock at the same time.

656
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,600
That's amazing.

657
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,240
Now, I think the perfect crime...

658
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,000
Why wouldn't it be more valuable?

659
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,520
That's just double art.

660
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,560
No, Jackson Pollock painted another painting over that painting.

661
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,320
It's like double art at that point.

662
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,160
Hey, I heard you like paintings.

663
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,080
Yeah, I think if you're going to eat the Mona Lisa...

664
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,880
And I am.

665
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,880
Yeah, we have a sandwich.

666
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,160
You then have to claim it's stolen because they're never going to find it.

667
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,440
And I guarantee it would take the world's greatest detective to suspect.

668
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,840
I bet he ate it.

669
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:39,440
I thought you were going to say the world's greatest art restorer who would look at your...

670
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,800
Give me a couple days.

671
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,920
Well, this is it.

672
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,960
My last job.

673
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,760
I thought I was out.

674
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,320
Give me that, Jimmy.

675
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,680
I thought it was out.

676
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,560
Let's do this.

677
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,840
I think I see the nose.

678
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,840
I'm going in.

679
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,960
It's impossible.

680
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,600
Not for me.

681
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,760
Not for me, a patient pervert.

682
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,840
What if Dr. Alan Grant had been digging in that big pile of dinosaur poop in Jurassic Park

683
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
and he's been like, reach?

684
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,080
Oh, God, the Mona Lisa.

685
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,480
I'm sorry.

686
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,920
Here is another question that I have for you, my brothers, on the iPad.

687
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,680
That same one that I use for Munch Squad.

688
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,400
And you might think, does he have difficulty getting back to the original

689
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,840
app with the questions list on it?

690
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,200
Does he ever have to vamp to cover it?

691
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,360
And the answer is no.

692
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,720
My fiance and I are...

693
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,200
No, what?

694
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,800
Okay.

695
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,360
You sure?

696
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,920
Yeah.

697
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,480
Which one?

698
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,840
No, do it because you already started it.

699
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,640
Well, no, I don't have...

700
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,040
Okay.

701
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,920
Hey, everybody.

702
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,800
Give us a second.

703
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,440
Give us a second.

704
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,440
My fiance and I are getting married on 420.

705
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:41,940
Yeah!

706
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,360
The debate was whether or not Griffin had earned this question.

707
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,120
I've been real good.

708
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,800
My fiance and I are getting married on 420.

709
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,280
Yeah!

710
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,600
All right.

711
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,680
Whee day!

712
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,720
Woo!

713
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,520
My fiance...

714
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,040
Yeah!

715
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,920
My fiance and I are getting married on April 20th.

716
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,960
But there's a problem.

717
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,880
We don't partake in...

718
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,640
It says here, magic cigarettes.

719
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,600
How can we embrace this dankest of days by inserting subtle nods to that...

720
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,720
Dope herb and help our guests ride high on the magic dragon?

721
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,080
You've ruined 420.

722
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,200
P.S. It says, I had to look up most of these euphemisms.

723
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,040
I never would have guessed.

724
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,560
It was so organic.

725
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,600
That's from going green for our wedding in Chicago.

726
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,160
Are you here?

727
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,840
Okay.

728
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,240
All right.

729
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,200
That's eight people.

730
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,340
Okay.

731
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,120
I just need one person to answer and I need...

732
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,160
I need them to say, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

733
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,320
I need them to say, I am here.

734
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:47,600
Okay.

735
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,160
Perfect.

736
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,720
All right.

737
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,120
That was a really good Seussical kind of moment.

738
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,000
That was very nice.

739
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:59,600
What I need you to do for me is to yell out another name for marijuana that you know.

740
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,000
The first...

741
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,120
Quiet.

742
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,240
Go.

743
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,120
Weed.

744
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,680
Weed.

745
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,400
Yeah, that actually works.

746
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,600
You're a narc!

747
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,320
Get out of here!

748
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,400
Get this narc out of here.

749
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,040
Okay.

750
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,760
Here's my question and you don't have to answer because we'll make jokes about it

751
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,480
one way or the other.

752
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,640
Did you accidentally plan your wedding for 420 or did like...

753
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,480
Was it like, well, it's not weed, but maybe it is weed and like you stole it from somebody

754
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,040
because that's the thing.

755
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,600
There's probably somebody who's like, oh, I really want that venue for 420 because I love weed.

756
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,280
You're keeping that venue from someone that was going to go hard on a weed wedding.

757
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:37,760
Yeah.

758
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,520
It was going to be like weed themed.

759
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,120
I'm sorry.

760
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,080
Was it your anniversary?

761
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,600
Nice.

762
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,960
Are you sure this is not a very important day for you?

763
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,760
Because that's the thing.

764
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,600
You will have to spend like the rest of your lives together married.

765
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,880
Like when people are like, when are you marrying?

766
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,840
You'll say 420 and even like the most boring...

767
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,240
No, no, no.

768
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,640
Stop.

769
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,280
Stop.

770
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,960
You won't say 420.

771
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,080
Okay.

772
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,120
That would be a wild response to what he's married.

773
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,320
But even the most boring government employee will be like...

774
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,920
And you'll have to say like, no.

775
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,080
I think that even if you do not partake and you shouldn't feel pressured to, one of the...

776
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,200
Is it legal here, by the way?

777
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,360
We need to start finding that out before we go to...

778
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:21,600
No.

779
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,080
No.

780
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,560
Then it's not okay.

781
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,680
Paul.

782
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,440
And I am against it.

783
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,320
Paul, burn it.

784
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,320
Paul, start flushing.

785
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,720
Flush it.

786
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,680
Toilet time, Paul.

787
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,000
Flush it.

788
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,200
I know we had established that if I yelled that you toilet time from the stage,

789
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,360
it meant one thing, but it means something different.

790
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,600
It's like double entendre.

791
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,240
Even if you don't partake and you shouldn't feel pressured to,

792
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,600
one of the...

793
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,760
There are two great things about your wedding.

794
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,120
And one is that it's a special day you'll remember for the rest of your life.

795
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,160
It's a beautiful moment where two souls become one.

796
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,400
And there's cool tax stuff that happens.

797
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,520
But the best next thing is that you get to remember

798
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,760
which of your friends got too fucked up at your wedding forever.

799
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:08,960
It's a wonderful gift.

800
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,680
Because I've got it.

801
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,840
I've got that list in my mind right now.

802
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,080
And they know, and we know, and everybody knows.

803
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,120
I feel like at a 420 wedding, it's just like you're gonna have a whole...

804
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,280
A whole table of people who just disappear for a while in the corner

805
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,640
and watch fucking Happy Gilmore on one of their phones.

806
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,600
And it's like, yeah, having a good time, guys?

807
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,320
Well, Jim, if you think about it, it's way better.

808
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,000
Wouldn't you rather have that than you got too drunk and you got in a fight?

809
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,600
Like, I'd much rather have, like, no, there was no leftover cake because of Bob.

810
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,880
That's a way better experience to have.

811
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,120
Yeah, it turned out we didn't have to take any leftovers home.

812
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,080
Probably the best thing you can do is don't go hard on the weed stuff.

813
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,280
But do tell the person officiating the wedding that you are gonna go hard on the weed stuff.

814
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,560
Because I want them to have a lot of, like, just like the buds emerge from the plant.

815
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,000
As the seeds combine to make one...

816
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,640
I've written here raunchy joint.

817
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,360
I don't know what that is.

818
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,440
So shall your love be dank.

819
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,040
Your love, too, should be dank.

820
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,320
I hope, yeah, so if the...

821
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,040
Be kind to one another.

822
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,080
If you know what I mean.

823
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,880
Be like we...

824
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,160
Oh, that's good, too.

825
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,840
You can put, like, BYOB and BYOW with, like, a question mark.

826
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,920
And, like, if they're cool, they'll know.

827
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,640
Yeah, that's a really indecipherable code there, Dan Brown.

828
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,600
I feel like you should, instead of the usual entrance music, the, you know, the...

829
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,840
Fuck.

830
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,360
Nope, that's the graduation one.

831
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:39,860
Uh-oh.

832
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,240
Do you mean the wedding march?

833
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,740
Yeah.

834
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,540
Anyway.

835
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,520
420.

836
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,600
I feel like you should make your entrance music police sirens.

837
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,240
But quiet.

838
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,000
So good.

839
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,720
So good.

840
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,360
Okay, wait.

841
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,720
Continue on.

842
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,080
Your dessert table?

843
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,200
Brownies.

844
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,920
But regular.

845
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,720
But don't say that.

846
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,680
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

847
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,480
I'd love that, Griffin.

848
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,360
Thank you so much.

849
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,600
Uh, this one was sent in by Level 9000.

850
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,520
YaDruDru at Drew Davenport.

851
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,240
Thank you, Drew.

852
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,280
It's an anonymous user, so I'm gonna call him YaDru.

853
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,440
YaDru answers user Jerry, because there's an ad at the top of the screen with a guy

854
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,320
named Jerry on it.

855
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,800
Thank you.

856
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,640
Not Jerry Seinfeld.

857
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,200
The other one.

858
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,040
Jerry asks, stiller.

859
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,360
Jerry asks, soldiers in the Troy horse.

860
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,520
I have been wondering.

861
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,360
It's called a thing.

862
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,720
Like, it's not called the Troy horse.

863
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,000
Yeah, the Trojan horse.

864
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,520
It has a name.

865
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,960
Anyway, I have been wondering, what if the soldiers in the Troy horse needed the washroom?

866
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,480
This sounds like a pretty ridiculous question, but I am really curious about this.

867
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,080
You could read that in a really kind of gross, like, I am

868
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,960
really curious about this.

869
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,480
They were hiding inside of the wooden horse for a whole day.

870
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
Did they pee and drink and eat inside?

871
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,400
Love, Jerry Stiller.

872
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,760
Do you think, like, they all got in the horse, and they're like, okay, so now we gotta be here.

873
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,800
Oh, man.

874
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,320
Oh, no.

875
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,760
Everybody used the bathroom before.

876
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,320
Nobody used the bathroom before?

877
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,920
I told, I said, but I didn't have to go then.

878
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,600
Front left leg is the toilet.

879
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,920
That's the first thing we're deciding.

880
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,080
Front left leg is where everybody goes to the toilet.

881
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,400
We're putting the foosball table in the rear right leg.

882
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,800
So front left is the toilet.

883
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,120
So front left is the toilet.

884
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,080
And then the Troy horse, which is now what I'm going to call it, rolls up.

885
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,240
It was wood.

886
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,200
You know it wasn't Ziploc fresh, keeping all that.

887
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,240
No way.

888
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,720
No way.

889
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,960
Can we let this big, stinky ass horse in?

890
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,800
This horse stinks like piss.

891
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,640
And also, I hear voices murmuring inside talking about, like, oh, no.

892
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,960
Dylan used the front right leg.

893
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,200
That was the sandwich leg.

894
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,320
That's the sandwich leg.

895
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,520
Good going, Dylan.

896
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,800
You butthole.

897
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,360
Oh, no.

898
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,400
They hear us.

899
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,600
Stab, stab, stab, stab.

900
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,720
Could you make, speaking of buttholes, could you give the horse a butthole?

901
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,000
That's a working out house.

902
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,680
It's a modern model.

903
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,080
I have a great horse for you.

904
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,040
Check it out.

905
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,160
It really poops.

906
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,540
Whoa.

907
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,160
Get that thing in here.

908
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:39,200
Well, I mean, even without the real shit tech, why did they see this big horse room?

909
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,560
Like, fuck, yeah.

910
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,640
I've got to have that big horse.

911
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,800
How often do you get the chance?

912
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,360
It's like, listen, I know we have nowhere to put it.

913
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,680
But how often do you see a giant horse?

914
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,880
I know.

915
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,840
If you got beat in that fight, you know, between the two people is between?

916
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,520
If you got beat in the-

917
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,520
Probably one of them, Troy.

918
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,960
Probably some, like, Troy or the Trojans or whatever.

919
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,920
If you got beat by the dudes in the horse, you got beat by, like, 100 guys

920
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,000
that had been awake for 24 hours and shitting in a wooden horse's leg

921
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,560
and marinating in their friend Jerry's farts.

922
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,800
And then they got out and beat you in a sword fight?

923
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,600
You were alerted to their presence, like, creak.

924
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:24,640
Yeah.

925
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,280
Oh, god.

926
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,960
The fucking hatch on that open and just, like, the 100 of the most exhausted human beings.

927
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,560
Just, like, 100 David Blaine post stunts should be, like, barely dragging their way out.

928
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:44,560
Now, do you, speaking of the Troy hearse, do you think the cat who made it got to a point

929
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,680
where he was, like, I could make this better, but it's a trick?

930
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,120
I could make this look more like a horse, but it's just-

931
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,880
How good does it gotta be before it's just a giant wood horse?

932
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,200
Yeah.

933
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:05,280
Speaking of this, building on this, if you had the people and the resources to do this,

934
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,440
do you think that that guy maybe suggested, like, do you maybe want me to make you some weapons?

935
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
I could just build you a ladder.

936
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,840
I could build you a ladder.

937
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,800
Just a big ladder.

938
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,240
A cool staircase that you could use.

939
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,520
You could shit wherever you like, up in the dark.

940
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,040
You go up with a ladder.

941
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,720
I could spend the next month making you wooden guns.

942
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,000
What do you want?

943
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,800
What do you want?

944
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,160
Are you sure you want to do this?

945
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,280
No, no, trust me.

946
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:33,920
No, no, no.

947
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,720
A horse.

948
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,280
A toilet horse.

949
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,040
I need, I need this.

950
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,600
This is important to me.

951
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,640
That is the thing that, like, the Troy horse is always referenced as, like, amazing, like,

952
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,200
strategy.

953
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,840
The people who let it in were just shitty at that.

954
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,200
It wasn't a good plan.

955
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,120
Yeah, that should be- that's because it was the first trap ever.

956
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,120
It was the first ever trick.

957
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,600
No one had ever tricked anybody before.

958
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,000
Because, like, we didn't have the term Trojan horse.

959
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,480
Yeah.

960
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,280
So it's like-

961
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,480
That's a big, good horse.

962
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,400
They'd always wondered why it was called that.

963
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,720
And then they're like, oh, okay, I get it.

964
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,680
Because of this.

965
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,720
Because of this with the trick with the guys who smelled like farts.

966
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:26,080
Trap, I want to tell you all about- oh, hey, welcome to Money Zone.

967
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,560
Trap, I want to tell you about movement watches.

968
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,360
Okay.

969
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:35,360
It's MVMT, but it's pronounced movement because it's hip and it's now and it's fashionable.

970
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,680
And they couldn't afford vowels.

971
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,360
The vowels are expensive.

972
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,720
It's 2018.

973
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,000
In 2019, it's probably just going to be MVT.

974
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,440
I always wanted to see that on Wheel of Fortune when they're like, can I buy a vowel?

975
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,960
And it's like, you can just have a vowel.

976
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,680
Letters are free.

977
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,440
Letters are free.

978
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,440
Bust up the big banks.

979
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,520
This is the call to arms.

980
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,600
Anyway, I have a movement watch.

981
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,920
I actually have a couple of them and they are so choice, so fashion forward.

982
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,680
Love the way they look on my wrist.

983
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,640
They got a nice, big, sort of proud, noble face on them that I get a lot of compliments

984
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,320
on every time I wear my movement watch.

985
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,040
I love it.

986
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,760
And they start at just 95 bucks.

987
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,560
And at a department store, you're looking at like 400 or 500 bucks to get a nice watch.

988
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,600
But movement watches comes in so much under that.

989
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,680
And by selling online, movement cuts out the middleman and retail markup and it provides

990
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,120
you with the best possible price.

991

They got over 1 million watches sold in over 160 countries.

992
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
That's 160 million.

993
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,440
No, I don't know if that that's not what that means.

994
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,480
Anyway, you can get 15% off today and get free shipping and with free returns by going

to movement.com slash brother.

996
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,360
My brain.

997
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,360
Yeah, I wasn't going to say anything.

998
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,960
That's MVMT.com slash brother.

999
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,080
It hurts to make thoughts, but the watch has a really clean design.

1000
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,120
It's seriously I've been getting compliments on it.

1001
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,680
And this is the best time to step up your watch game.

1002
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,480
This is the best time to step up your watch game.

1003
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,920
And you know what time it is because of the watch you'll know.

1004
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,800
Yeah, we got it.

1005
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,120
Yeah.

1006
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:16,080
OK, I also want to tell you all about MVMT.com slash brother and join the movement.

1007
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,160
Now break up the big banks.

1008
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,920
OK, so we've talked a lot about me on these in the past and I realized that we did we.

1009
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,520
Yes, it's a new year.

1010
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,480
Listen, it's a new year.

1011
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,040
And a lot of people when they think new year, they think new you.

1012
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,960
And they're like going through this laundry list of like, I'm going to do this for myself

1013
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,280
this year.

1014
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,640
Let me tell you something.

1015
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,000
You might not think about it, but I can't even begin to tell you the importance of investing

1016
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
in some new underpinnings for yourself.

1017
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,040
Yeah.

1018
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,920
You know what I mean?

1019
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,200
Yeah, for your pizzeria.

1020
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,520
Well, because you got to think about it like it's like the foundation of your whole look,

1021
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,320
your whole external presentation of your outfit.

1022
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,680
You know, it's good.

1023
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,920
It feels good to put on fresh underpants.

1024
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,280
Got to bag it up.

1025
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,720
Got to bag it up.

1026
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,800
And listen, me on these is three times softer than cotton because it comes from sustainably

1027
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,040
sourced.

1028
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,680
Fuck cotton though.

1029
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,160
Fuck it.

1030
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,480
OK.

1031
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,280

That is probably statistically true, but I know I got some fellow insomniacs out there

1061
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,400
who that might not be inherently true.

1062
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,160
Yeah, our party animals like me.

1063
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,280
OK, you will go to bed at least once this year.

1064
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,400
And when you do, you sleep for 41 days.

1065
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,680
You will get ready for the rest of the party.

1066
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,600
You deserve to have your best night's sleep every night that you sleep on a brand new

1067
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,040
set of Bull and Branch sheets dedicated to making the most comfortable sheets in the

1068
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,440
world.

1069
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,040
And I can vouch for that.

1070
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,960
We have a couple sets of Bull and Branch sheets now and I got their Bull and Branch bath sheets.

1071
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,080
There's like a bath towel, but much larger and able to like wrap around my entire body

1072
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:52,960
It's so great.

1073
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,680
It's real nice.

1074
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,520
As you know, three U.S. presidents are sleeping better than ever on Bull and Branch and I

1075
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,800
hope it's the good ones.

1076
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,160
I say it's the good ones.

1077
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,760
The alternate reality ones.

1078
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,960
Try them yourself.

1079
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,600
Risk free.

1080
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:03,920
Wow.

1081
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,000
Getting political on this one episode.

1082
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,120
Then try them yourself.

1083
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,560
Risk free for a month.

1084
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,600
Right now you get 20 bucks.

1085
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:12,800
50.

1086
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,440
Holy shit.

1087
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,720
That's even better.

1088
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,600
Fifty dollars.

1089
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,560
Wow, Trav.

1090
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,440
Fifty dollars off plus free shipping at BullandBranch.com.

1091
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,520
Promo code my brother, BullandBranch.com, spelled B-O-L-L and Branch.com.

1092
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,040
Promo code my brother.

1093
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,480
Got a couple Jumbotrons here.

1094
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:33,120
This one is for Katie and Dave and it's from Rodney who says, hold on.

1095
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,440
Zoom in the font.

1096
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,240
It's again, just the eyes.

1097
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,320
The eyes are sick also.

1098
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:40,880
Hi, Katie.

1099
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,760
Happy birthday.

1100
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,240
Maybe.

1101
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,040
Thank you for putting these three dorks into my life.

1102
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,960
Thanks so much for being a good, good friend for these like five or six years.

1103
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,600
I can't wait for the message you send after you hear this.

1104
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,640
Thank you, Dave, for bringing the three of us together.

1105
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,840
Thanks, Trashcan.

1106
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,960
I love you all.

1107
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,280
Since there is room, Teenage Mutant Ninja.

1108
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:00,960
No, read it.

1109
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,640
Tootin' Mean-Age Needle-Teedles.

1110
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,840
That's what it says.

1111
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,000
I like that.

1112
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,800
That's not my brain doing a bad job of it.

1113
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:17,120
Yeah, nothing else to say about that one except Tootin' Mean-Age Needle-Teedles.

1114
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,000
Tootin' Mean-Age Needle-Teedles.

1115
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,600
Tootin' Paddle.

1116
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,560
This next one is for Jamie and Brandon.

1117
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,000
It's from Tommy.

1118
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,160
Jamie, if you hear this, you are morally, if not legally obligated to watch the Entourage movie.

1119
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:32,960
Oh, no.

1120
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,440
I'm so-

1121
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,440
Listen, Jamie-

1122
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,080
That checks out.

1123
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,200
Legally, law, it works.

1124
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:37,920
It's true.

1125
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,800
Jamie, I'm sorry about that.

1126
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,960
But watch it, understanding that the Entourage movie is unstuck in time.

1127
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,200
Yeah.

1128
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,320
You can read all about it on the internet.

1129
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:51,040
Brandon, play this for Jamie and record his reaction, and I'll give you back your copy of Gex.

1130
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,320
Damn.

1131
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,360
You're both great friends, but these are my terms.

1132
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,160
Forgive the Good Brothers, for they know not the hell they have wrought.

1133
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,400
I am mad with power and growing stronger.

1134
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,160
All right.

1135
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:04,960
Okay, cool.

1136
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,240
Good use of Jumbotron.

1137
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,840
Sort of a demon, maybe.

1138
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,640
Okay.

1139
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,520
Some sort of demon with a captive Gex situation.

1140
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,120
Before we hop back into the episode, I wanted to plug just a couple things.

1141
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,480
One, and this is-

1142
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,520
Can I lie down?

1143
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,000
Yeah.

1144
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,640
This is super timely, because you only have a couple days on this one.

1145
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:29,840
But me and Teresa are going to be at San Francisco Sketch Fest, Sunday the 14th, doing a Schmanners at 1pm Pacific time.

1146
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,280
And you can still get tickets to that.

1147
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,920
Go to sfsketchfest.com.

1148
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:43,920
I will also be doing the Worst First Chapter show and the Fake Ted Talk show Friday and Saturday night.

1149
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,440
So you can come see those as well.

1150
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,040
But go get those tickets at sfsketchfest.com.

1151
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:56,720
Also going to be doing the JoCo Cruise, which you can find out all the information about that at JOCocruise.com.

1152
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,520
I just did an episode of Good Christian Fun.

1153
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,800
You did a great job on that.

1154
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,520
Thank you.

1155
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,800
It was super wonderful.

1156
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,120
I'm now listening to every episode.

1157
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,520
I'm a big fan, and everybody should check it out.

1158
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:14,160
I also just did a video with Gabbie Dunn on Gabbie's YouTube channel.

1159
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,960
I also just did an episode of Can I Pet Your Dog that just came out.

1160
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,400
And I think coming out later this week is an episode of Bunker Buddies.

1161
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,680
I was very busy this week.

1162
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,400
Yeah, I'll say.

1163
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,080
All right, that's it.

1164
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:26,880
Enjoy the rest of the episode.

1165
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,720
Thanks, Max Fun, for having us on the network.

1166
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,720
And thank you, John Roderick and the Long Winters, which I think we do in the episode.

1167
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,240
But I still really mean it.

1168
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,080
But that's it.

1169
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,600
Yes, you can go back to bed now.

1170
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,480
I love you.

1171
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,200
I love you, too.

1172
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,200
I was talking to Justin.

1173
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:41,760
Oh, okay.

1174
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,880
He's here with me in the room.

1175
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,040
Good joke, Justin.

1176
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,720
Ooh, stinky fart.

1177
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,440
I like how you did one.

1178
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,000
Bye.

1179
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,500
Bye.

1180

00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,720
My name is Brad.

1190
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,280
Hi, Brad.

1191
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:29,780
Brad!

1192
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,280
Brad!

1193
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,180
Let's do it.

1194
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,580
So I work with...

1195
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,300
Okay, so it was a Borat impression and that's not your regular voice.

1196
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,180
So when I said Brad, it was like, he's doing a Borat impression,

1197
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,140
but then I was like, what if that's his regular voice and I kind of bailed?

1198
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,900
But now that I know it's a Borat impression...

1199
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,260
Go on.

1200
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:48,900
Go on, Brad.

1201
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,400
Sorry.

1202
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,940
So I work with high school kids.

1203
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:52,580
Okay.

1204
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,380
Marching band.

1205
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,500
So you know they freaks.

1206
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,260
Yeah, they're nasty.

1207
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:01,700
So the biggest problem I have with them is they have this tendency that they just don't stop dabbing.

1208
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,200
Mm-hmm.

1209
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,860
Wait, is that real, Brad?

1210
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,360
Brad.

1211
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,420
No, no, no, no, no, no, it's real, it's real, it's real.

1212
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,020
Also, it's not really a problem, but go ahead.

1213
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:13,940
No, it is.

1214
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,020
It's just constant dabbing.

1215
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,860
While they're trying to play instruments?

1216
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,620
They disrupt the rehearsal and they want the instructors to dab.

1217
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,180
They caught me dabbing, I'm sorry to say.

1218
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:29,140
I just need to know, what can I give them instead of dabbing, or how do I make the dabbing stop?

1219
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,260
What can I give them other than dabbing is like, how do I introduce the next thing?

1220
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,580
And maybe it's working really hard to be good at instruments.

1221
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:41,780
We tried that, so they're sort of into that, you know?

1222
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,500
That's good.

1223
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,300
I tried the knee dab, which is this.

1224
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,380
That's not better.

1225
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,580
I enjoyed it.

1226
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:52,020
But I think what Travis said, there's some heat there, where it's like,

1227
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:57,540
hey everybody, I'm Griffin, this is my new viral video, and all the teams are going to get really into it.

1228
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,500
This is the new thing, it's called, practicing your scales.

1229
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,500
Have you ever thought about, and listen, Brad, I instantly respect you and what you do.

1230
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,020
Except for the Borat impression.

1231
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,700
No, and you did the dab, you did.

1232
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,780
Have you ever thought about like, looking around the room and asking them like,

1233
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,260
how many of you are going to do this after this?

1234
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:24,580
How many of you are going to do this after this, and like, those people you encourage to rehearse or practice or whatever,

1235
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,580
and the other one's just like, dab away.

1236
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,100
Just like in Mr. Holland's opus.

1237
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:36,260
That would be way more, I played the trombone in middle school, and all I did was just like,

1238
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:43,060
hum through the trombone, never actually learned to play the trombone, and just convinced my parents like,

1239
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:46,500
just sign this, I'm not going to practice, and they're like, we don't want you to fail.

1240
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,140
You hear that, dad?

1241
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,700
Take that, dad.

1242
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,700
You're on blast, Clint.

1243
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,060
Um, oh man.

1244
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,500
Do you have any like, ringers?

1245
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:05,300
There's probably some instruments that have long enough rests in the sheet music where they could get some good dabs in there.

1246
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,340
And if that's the case,

1247
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:06,900
Gong.

1248
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,940
The gong, yes.

1249
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,700
Gong is the one, it's the right at the end.

1250
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,820
Super dab.

1251
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:17,060
Because if that's the thing, I see a way for you to really stand out during the competition.

1252
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:17,620
Yes.

1253
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:21,060
Does that help?

1254
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,060
It helps.

1255
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,100
Thank you, Brad.

1256
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:30,180
Hi there, okay, so I know you guys are from the great state of West Virginia.

1257
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:30,900
Hell yeah.

1258
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,900
So you're probably-

1259
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,900
You know, Abraham Lincoln made West Virginia a state.

1260
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:40,420
So you're probably pretty familiar with the urban legend of the Mothman?

1261
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:43,220
Yeah.

1262
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,060
Okay, I think some people know where this is going.

1263
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:55,300
So over the past couple of months, Chicago has been having this thing where people have been reporting sightings of a seven foot tall winged creature with red eyes.

1264
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:58,500
Fucking followed us here.

1265
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,300
That fucking asshole.

1266
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,580
Mothman, are you here?

1267
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,860
He wanted to go to the Jimmy Buffett show with you guys.

1268
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,660
Paul, Paul, I'm gonna need another drink.

1269
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:11,060
The Mothman's in Illinois.

1270
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:14,260
That was extremely fast.

1271
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:18,660
Paul heard Mothman, I was like, they're gonna need this.

1272
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:25,460
So it's even been on like the cover of the Chicago Reader and there's a lady who came and confessed that she summoned it through a-

1273
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,300
That's not how Mothman works.

1274
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,660
It's not.

1275
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:32,420
So my question to you is, do you think that maybe it is?

1276
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,340
And if so, what should we do as a city?

1277
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,860
Stay off bridges.

1278
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:39,060
That's ghoulish.

1279
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:42,260
It's that dude's whole line of business.

1280
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,340
He's a bridge warner.

1281
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,420
That is true.

1282
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:47,220
Hold on, wait.

1283
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,460
I think we're gonna go with the Mothman one this time.

1284
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,860
Thank you so much.

1285
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,500
Thank you.

1286
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,220
Thank you very much.

1287
00:52:53,220 --> 00:53:02,740
Somebody did ask me, I can't remember who I was having the conversation with, and they're like, hey, so we were talking about like, Crypto Zoology and like, Local Legends, and they're like, and what's the Mothman's deal?

1288
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:07,140
And I'm like, well, some people saw him, and then a bridge collapsed.

1289
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,980
And then they made a movie.

1290
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,260
It goes way deeper.

1291
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:13,220
So has Enric Cole been spotted anywhere?

1292
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,180
Oh, yeah.

1293
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:14,660
No?

1294
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:15,140
No.

1295
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,100
Okay.

1296
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:20,580
So we're probably okay from a safety perspective, because if Cole's not chasing the Moth-

1297
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,460
You know Cole?

1298
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:25,780
Cole was the one who arrived before the Mothman.

1299
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,700
Wait, there was a pre-Moth?

1300
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:33,220
If you don't know, the Mothman rolls up, and he's like, oh, the bridge, the bridge, and then the bridge collapses. That's the Mothman's whole deal.

1301
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,860
He doesn't fly around or shoot spores all over.

1302
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:39,220
But to have a pre-Mothman, it's like, uh-oh, the Mothman's gonna come.

1303
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:44,660
But a guy named Enric Cole showed up before, like, hunting the Mothman.

1304
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:49,460
So he was like, so the Mothman's like an intergalactic convict who's escaped from space.

1305
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,660
This is real.

1306
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,100
This is 100%.

1307
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,060
Well, I mean, it's not like-

1308
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:53,860
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1309
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:56,580
It's not real.

1310
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:00,660
I'm just telling you, like, don't get it twisted. It's not, like, real.

1311
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:04,580
Just West Virginia has, like, one crypto dude.

1312
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,820
Can we just keep him? Just the one?

1313
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:12,420
And he's not even that good. He doesn't shoot spores out of his wings to put Pokemon to sleep or whatever.

1314
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:16,020
Like all he does, he warns you about faulty infrastructure.

1315
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:19,780
Oh, there's a pothole that's gonna fuck up your Jetta.

1316
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,980
Thanks, Mothman.

1317
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:24,580
Can we get the chupacabra in here to at least, like, kill a goat or something?

1318
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:29,380
You know, like, 50 people died, right? It wasn't, like, a pothole. It was, like, a whole bridge collapse.

1319
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,340
It was a tragedy.

1320
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,180
So he did that one. He's like, I'm done.

1321
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,340
He didn't even do it. He didn't even do it.

1322
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,820
He was just walking back going, I don't know about that bridge.

1323
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:46,020
No, okay. If you're saying that the Mothman should have conducted a more thorough, effective advertising campaign about the dangers of the silver bridge, yes, I agree.

1324
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,860
The Mothman was not very effective as a harbinger of-

1325
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,980
The city hall recognizes the giant Mothman.

1326
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:51,940
Thank you so much.

1327
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:52,340
Thank you.

1328
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:54,980
He was just walking by that bridge. It does not look safe.

1329
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:58,980
Uh, actually, let me back up, because Neil Carnegie says I should use praise first.

1330
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:02,420
Debbie, the harvest festival this year was fucking kick-ass.

1331
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,180
Anyway-

1332
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:07,060
I want to put my engineering degree to good use.

1333
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:07,780
Finally.

1334
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,900
Um, Kit, please don't steal our Mothman.

1335
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,420
It might be another Mothman.

1336
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,380
Could-

1337
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,340
There's one in Iowa.

1338
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,100
There's one in Iowa. That's what I'm saying.

1339
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:16,900
There's not.

1340
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:17,780
It's Iowa.

1341
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:23,620
I don't- like, fucking Art Bell is not going to walk out on stage and be like, it's true, there are.

1342
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,860
Um, there's not.

1343
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:33,300
But do you think West Virginia Mothman, like, sees in, like, he gets the Chicago paper, and he opens it, and he's like, that's not me.

1344
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:43,540
This is the problem, though. We're all playing Calvin Ball with cryptozoology. If you start saying that the Mothman's in Illinois, he will be, because, you know.

1345
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,220
So, like, let's just-

1346
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:46,740
Uh, because he's created by thought.

1347
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,100
You are absolutely correct, Justin.

1348
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:48,740
And belief in-

1349
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:52,660
As the Mothman is a manifestation, it's actually short for Mothmanifestation.

1350
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:58,500
As Neil Gaiman dictates in his book, American Gods, Kit, please don't steal our Man Moth.

1351
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:58,980
Thank you.

1352
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,340
No, Man Moth is a different one.

1353
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:03,700
Okay, you can have Man Moth.

1354
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:10,740
Alright, so, um, about a year ago, uh, my family got a, uh, parrot from a pet store.

1355
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:16,740
And it was, like, really fun, because, like, it's, like, a cool pet that I can, like, show my friends, like, we have a parrot. Um-

1356
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,900
As opposed to a shitty dog.

1357
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:19,860
Yeah, I mean-

1358
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:20,980
Ugh.

1359
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:25,540
Ew, I get it. I've seen dogs.

1360
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,900
Anyways, uh, boys, now we have seven parrots, and I don't know what to do.

1361
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,940
Wait, what?

1362
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:32,980
Hold on.

1363
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:37,860
Alright, alright, save it. Um, oh, good luck.

1364
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,220
I'm afraid to ask my question.

1365
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:44,020
No, you go ahead and hit us with this. Maybe you have eight parrots. Go on.

1366
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,540
We don't know. What's your name?

1367
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,820
Uh, my name is Benny.

1368
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,300
Hi, Benny.

1369
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,420
Like, the man of the Jets.

1370
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:48,900
Okay, cool.

1371
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,180
Fantastic.

1372
00:56:50,180 --> 00:57:01,860
And my question is, I have been living with my partner for about a month now, and we have kind of a problem in that he will show me media, like, I've watched Death Note and Breaking Bad and a bunch of other anime-

1373
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,460
Anime or live action?

1374
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,740
Uh, the anime. The anime.

1375
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:05,300
Oh, okay.

1376
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,980
Oh, phew.

1377
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,260
I don't know. Is that good or bad?

1378
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,780
No, stop talking, Travis.

1379
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,140
Subs or dubs, go.

1380
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,220
Okay, so, alright.

1381
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,740
Send us the media.

1382
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:24,100
The problem is, is that he won't watch anything that I like. Like, I tried to get him to listen to a few podcasts. You might have heard of them, like The Adventure Zone and My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1383
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:24,900
Sure, sure, sure.

1384
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:29,460
And he just won't do it. How do I fix him?

1385
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,020
Okay.

1386
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,460
I actually, can we answer both of these?

1387
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:37,300
Play this. Play this clip of 3,000 people booing.

1388
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,020
I kind of want to answer both.

1389
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,340
I mean, that's against the spirit of the thing.

1390
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,020
Okay, can I answer this one real quick?

1391
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:44,500
Yeah.

1392
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,100
Okay, Benny, here's the thing.

1393
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:46,580
Yes, sir.

1394
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:53,300
You have to pick the right time to play a podcast for someone, because it's not just sitting around in your house, because there's a bunch of other better shit to do.

1395
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:53,940
That's true.

1396
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:59,700
It has to be in a car. That's the only time you can trick someone into listening to a podcast.

1397
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:04,980
They should, the tagline for podcast should be, podcast, when your hands are busy doing other things.

1398
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:11,380
Right, because there's literally, or your eyes too, is eyes, hands, but your ears are free.

1399
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,180
Podcast?

1400
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:12,500
Podcast.

1401
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,540
Like, that's it.

1402
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:16,260
Podcast. It's six hours to Phoenix, motherfucker.

1403
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,300
I guess things happen.

1404
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:25,700
Right. Because that's the thing. I love podcasting. I would rather play video games, watch TV, read a book.

1405
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,300
Anything is better than podcasts.

1406
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,380
Nap, anything.

1407
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:36,260
We are the mustard condiment that you put on the meat of the good thing you're actually excited about doing.

1408
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:36,900
Does that-

1409
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,220
So maybe watch our TV show.

1410
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:43,700
Yeah, the TV show's a good egg.

1411
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,220
VRV.CO.

1412
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,020
VRV.

1413
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,340
All six episodes streaming live.

1414
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,940
He actually really does like your TV show.

1415
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,860
Fuck yeah, he does. That's a good egg.

1416
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,300
Thank you, Benny. Thank you so much.

1417
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,180
Thank you, brothers.

1418
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,300
Seven parents?

1419
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,140
How did you get to seven?

1420
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:00,340
I mean, you said it like, I got one and then I sneezed and there were seven.

1421
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:04,900
You had to have gotten to six and been like, this is fucking ridiculous.

1422
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:08,340
Can I ask you, I want to ask you a serious question and I promise we'll let you answer.

1423
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,140
Yeah, no, go ahead.

1424
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:19,940
What was it about having six parents that you were like, this is good, but there's a hole in our hearts for something else?

1425
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,020
There's just, it's missing.

1426
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:26,660
We're missing something and it's, I think it's another parent.

1427
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:29,300
How after six parents do you not think, turtle?

1428
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,540
Maybe like, maybe that's what we don't have.

1429
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:35,940
Were you trying to start a parrot acapella group and you needed a deep parent?

1430
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,940
I really wish we were, but all of them are completely untalented.

1431
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:40,820
Awesome.

1432
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,180
Was that what you were trying to do?

1433
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,900
Was each parent, maybe this one will be cool?

1434
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:50,660
Please don't use our podcast as a bludgeon to lay waste to your parents.

1435
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,980
Hey, shout out to you, mom.

1436
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:53,780
She's catching up.

1437
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:57,220
Your parrot's named mom?

1438
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:58,260
Are you okay?

1439
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:05,380
Tell me what the sort of sonic experience of crossing the threshold of the house is like.

1440
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:09,940
How well can you imagine about 12 hours of screaming every day?

1441
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:14,020
Pretty well, I have a baby.

1442
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:16,820
The conversion rate is one baby to seven.

1443
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,140
Yeah, it's about that.

1444
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,860
Do the parrots all hang out in the same room or is it like,

1445
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:24,340
There's parrots in the living room.

1446
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,980
Okay, so we have our living room.

1447
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,980
There's like a wall of cages, right?

1448
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:30,340
Okay.

1449
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:35,380
And how many of those are parrots and how many are humans?

1450
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:37,940
Okay, we have this fun little thing where-

1451
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:41,700
That should have been an easy answer.

1452
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,780
You shouldn't need a fucking like,

1453
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:46,660
hold on, I want to answer your question about human cages,

1454
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:50,420
but I'm going to need to cushion this a little bit.

1455
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:54,100
Okay, I can't just come out and say I have three humans in cages.

1456
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,740
Let me preface.

1457
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:00,740
Kind of a 50-50 deal.

1458
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,180
Now I'm not sure.

1459
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:08,900
You can't lie to us right now because you just said you have seven parrots.

1460
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,060
So you don't want us to start questioning everything.

1461
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:12,740
Especially that half a person.

1462
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,380
Why did you?

1463
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,500
I'm just going to ask you a question and I want you to answer me.

1464
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,300
And I'm tired of the lies.

1465
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,580
I'm tired of the runaround, okay?

1466
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:24,580
Why did you buy a seventh parrot?

1467
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,180
Okay, all right.

1468
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:28,580
We did not buy each parrot separately.

1469
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,580
So you steal parrots from people.

1470
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:31,540
That's disgusting.

1471
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:35,380
Wait, do you wake in the morning and a new parrot is there?

1472
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:37,460
I mean, that does happen sometimes.

1473
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,100
But not that quick a turnaround.

1474
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,780
I promise, we'll let you finish this time.

1475
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:45,940
Why did you buy a seventh parrot?

1476
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:49,220
It all started when...

1477
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,260
No, I'm locked in.

1478
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:51,220
Go ahead.

1479
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,020
You got me.

1480
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,580
It was a dark and stormy night.

1481
01:01:54,580 --> 01:02:00,100
Fucking, can we just do in media res and you're kind of like about to buy the parrot?

1482
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:00,820
Yeah.

1483
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,100
So you can help.

1484
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,540
We got two parrots as the final sixth and seventh parrot.

1485
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:09,060
Okay, let me rephrase my question.

1486
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:12,020
Why did you buy a sixth and seventh parrot?

1487
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:12,500
You know what?

1488
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,860
I'll track it back.

1489
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:14,820
Second.

1490
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:15,700
Second.

1491
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:16,900
No, fifth and seventh.

1492
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,500
Your sixth and seventh parrot.

1493
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,580
What made you sort of...

1494
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:25,060
Was it you needed one for Saturday and Sunday?

1495
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:32,020
Well, and this is, I shit you not, this is completely honest.

1496
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:37,300
One of the parrots, parrot number four.

1497
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,660
That's what you call them too.

1498
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:43,380
That's what you put on their prisoner ID badges.

1499
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:45,220
Parrot four.

1500
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:49,380
You didn't finish your gruel, parrot four.

1501
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:53,220
Are vittles not up to your demanding standards?

1502
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:57,700
Perhaps parrot six would enjoy the rest of your gruel.

1503
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:01,940
While parrot seven looks at his parrot Hayworth poster.

1504
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:06,180
Okay, so parrot, sorry, your gag was parrot Hayworth.

1505
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:06,660
Yeah.

1506
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,540
Okay, go ahead.

1507
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:09,620
It's like Shawshank, parrot redemption.

1508
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:10,020
I got it.

1509
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,380
Shit.

1510
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:14,340
Just make sure Shawshank redemption, but with parrots.

1511
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,700
This is gonna, we've had a lot of fun.

1512
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,220
Here's just gonna be like, parrot four died.

1513
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,060
And we just had like five minutes in.

1514
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:22,420
Okay, so why do you have so many parrots?

1515
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:23,060
Please justify it.

1516
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:24,340
Something happened to parrot four.

1517
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,940
Parrot four was lonely.

1518
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:26,180
So...

1519
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:27,620
Wait, what?

1520
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:29,940
Fuck you parrot four.

1521
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,060
They don't get along.

1522
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,220
The parrots hate each other.

1523
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:35,380
They have like, it's like game of thrones.

1524
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,340
They have different houses.

1525
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:39,700
Thank you for being...

1526
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:43,940
Pikachu fights the others and she's smaller and weaker than the rest.

1527
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:49,300
Put them in a different part of the house.

1528
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:50,100
Stop, Travis.

1529
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:50,900
Travis, stop.

1530
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,180
Is your parrot named Pikachu?

1531
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:54,500
Wait, what?

1532
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,780
Is your parrot named Pikachu?

1533
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:58,420
Yeah, you want me to go through the names?

1534
01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:59,380
Sorry.

1535
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:01,540
Now I want to list the fucking names?

1536
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:02,980
Yeah, list your parrot names.

1537
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:05,620
Hey, goodbye everyone else's questions.

1538
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:08,340
Okay, list the names of all your parrots.

1539
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:09,060
All right.

1540
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:10,500
If you can remember them.

1541
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,060
Yeah, right.

1542
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,540
We have Celeste.

1543
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:15,620
We have Buckberry.

1544
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:17,460
We have Pikachu.

1545
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:18,020
Fantastic.

1546
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:20,420
We have Sadie.

1547
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:24,340
We have Taco spelled T-A-A-K-O named after the wizard.

1548
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:25,460
My mom's a fan of the show.

1549
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:27,140
Hell yeah.

1550
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:29,860
And then we have Pepper and am I missing one?

1551
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:30,420
Wait.

1552
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:31,140
Yeah.

1553
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,100
Yeah, you are.

1554
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:32,980
Yeah, you are.

1555
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:34,420
You know how I know?

1556
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:35,940
You have seven parrots.

1557
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:36,900
Rexie.

1558
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:39,300
We have Rexie short for Tyrannosaurus Rex.

1559
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:39,940
All right.

1560
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:40,340
Okay.

1561
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:41,620
Was that the seventh?

1562
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,700
No, that was number five.

1563
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,860
Jesus, we are in the weeds.

1564
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:46,580
Can I ask you?

1565
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:50,740
I want to ask you two questions and I'm going to ask them in succession

1566
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:52,260
and then you can answer them in succession.

1567
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:55,860
First question is, what's the worst part about living with seven parrots?

1568
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:00,180
The second question is, what's the second worst thing about living with seven parrots?

1569
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:05,780
Wait, can I add a third question?

1570
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:06,340
Of course.

1571
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:07,380
Third question.

1572
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:11,700
Is there any improvement that you thought, oh, thank God we have that seventh one?

1573
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:12,180
Yeah.

1574
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:16,980
Did you have like a home invaders and like six weren't enough to bring them down?

1575
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:20,180
The seventh one swept in and bit off their dicks.

1576
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:21,300
Okay.

1577
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:24,340
Tell me the worst thing about living with seven parrots.

1578
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:26,980
And then tell me the best thing about living with seven parrots.

1579
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:27,220
Okay.

1580
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,980
So we have one, two, three, and four.

1581
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:29,780
We need answers.

1582
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:30,100
Okay.

1583
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:31,140
So what's the worst?

1584
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:34,020
Worst thing is that parrots absolutely cannot be potty trained.

1585
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:35,460
No, they're parrots.

1586
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:35,620
Yes.

1587
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:36,580
They're huge.

1588
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:37,700
Yeah, that's huge.

1589
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:38,340
What's the second?

1590
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:42,580
The second worst thing is probably that one of them is a sociopath.

1591
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:46,660
But you can never remember which one.

1592
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:49,860
So it's like they ask you to join them in a room alone.

1593
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:50,820
You're like, wait a minute.

1594
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:52,340
Are you the one who, oh well.

1595
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:54,900
But it is really good at solving bird crime.

1596
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:55,140
Yeah.

1597
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:58,820
It's parrot number four, the lonely one.

1598
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,580
Oh, that fucking parrot four.

1599
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:02,980
What's the name of parrot four?

1600
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:03,780
Do you remember?

1601
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:04,500
Yeah, Sadie.

1602
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:04,980
Sadie.

1603
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:05,780
Fuck Sadie.

1604
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:06,260
Sadie.

1605
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:07,300
No, Sadie's great.

1606
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,020
What's the best thing?

1607
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:09,540
I hope they get avian flu.

1608
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,700
Jesus, Travis.

1609
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,900
Come on, Travis.

1610
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,820
And then they all turned against me.

1611
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:15,220
Yeah.

1612
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,620
I'll drink some more Malort, thank you very much.

1613
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:24,900
To put a nice button on this, to give it just sort of a nice ending,

1614
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:30,980
because we've just been dunking on your seven small birds of paradise for a bit.

1615
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:36,900
What's the best thing about living with seven birds?

1616
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,340
Thank you, Griffin.

1617
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:40,020
What's the best thing about the seven birds?

1618
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,860
You can't just say, thank you, I need the best.

1619
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:43,540
There's not a best thing.

1620
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,060
We'll edit it in later.

1621
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:50,820
The best thing about having seven birds would probably be the look on all of our

1622
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:55,540
friends and loved ones faces of concern and shock and horror as they enter our house.

1623
01:06:55,540 --> 01:07:01,380
Do you ever just, thank you so much.

1624
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:01,780
Thank you.

1625
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:03,140
Thank you for all your parents.

1626
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:06,420
Did you think you were going to be up here for 15 minutes, by the way?

1627
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:07,060
Probably not.

1628
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,420
I hope you wore comfortable shoes.

1629
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:10,740
That's going to do it for us.

1630
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:14,420
Thank you so much, Chicago, for listening to us.

1631
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:15,380
We hope you had fun.

1632
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:18,740
Thank you to everybody.

1633
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:22,100
Let's have a big round of applause for everybody that was brave enough to stand up and ask a

1634
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,540
question because it's very scary.

1635
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,780
So thank you to everybody.

1636
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:26,500
Do you see that?

1637
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:27,780
So what?

1638
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:29,060
Well, the P's upside down.

1639
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,580
The P's upside down.

1640
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,980
There we go.

1641
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,860
Now your U is, I'm not going to troubleshoot you.

1642
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:37,380
On one side it says juice and on the other side it says juice.

1643
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:40,180
It probably says Justin because like in the TV show, remember?

1644
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:41,300
Anyway.

1645
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,900
Now it says Jostin, now it says Jorps.

1646
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:43,620
Now it says-

1647
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:44,340
Now keep going.

1648
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:45,460
Okay, now it says Josta.

1649
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,260
Thank you to everybody for coming out.

1650
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:48,660
Thank you.

1651
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:51,300
Can we turn the house lights down because people are starting to leave to get to their cars early.

1652
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,260
It's freaking me out.

1653
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:52,980
It's bumming me out.

1654
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,180
I don't want to say, bye everybody.

1655
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,060
Like no hard feelings.

1656
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:57,780
I do it all the time, but I just don't want to, I can't say it.

1657
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,460
Wait, get a poster on your way out.

1658
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:01,300
Yeah, make sure to buy poster sneakers.

1659
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:02,100
We got you.

1660
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:02,740
You're busted.

1661
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:04,980
So now buy a fucking poster.

1662
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:09,860
So that's, thank you so much to the Chicago theater, which is beautiful.

1663
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:16,420
And I hope you're all frequenting this venue as much as humanly possible because it's fucking gorgeous.

1664
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:17,300
It's really amazing.

1665
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:18,980
And thank you to Chicago in general.

1666
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:20,580
Yeah, you've been amazing.

1667
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:23,860
Thank you to Schmaners for opening for us.

1668
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:24,900
They were fantastic.

1669
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:30,420
Thank you to our daddy for doing our intro and coming with us and helping us out.

1670
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:36,100
Thank you to Paul for coming around and helping us out with everything.

1671
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:40,340
Check out the music of Paul and Storm available everywhere, books are sold.

1672
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:40,820
Everywhere.

1673
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:41,940
It's everywhere.

1674
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:43,780
You can't trip without finding Paul and Storm.

1675
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:45,620
Oh, and go on the Joko Cruise also.

1676
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:47,300
Joko Cruise is going to be on it.

1677
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,140
Yeah, my wife and I are going to be doing Schmaners.

1678
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:49,940
Our dad will be there.

1679
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:54,180
We're going to probably do some D&D, not a venture zone, but D&D stuff.

1680
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:54,420
Yeah.

1681
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:58,180
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

1682
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:00,420
It's a departure off the album, but in the days to come.

1683
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:00,740
Yes.

1684
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:06,900
I also just want to say a general thank you to our wives and families and babies and stuff

1685
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:07,700
for being so cool.

1686
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:08,500
Yeah.

1687
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:10,900
Thank you to CAA.

1688
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:12,660
Thanks for them.

1689
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:16,180
We're not going to be, because of the aforementioned babies, they got to get to bed.

1690
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:18,180
So we're not going to be hanging out afterwards and stuff.

1691
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:21,220
But we so appreciate you all coming and being so kind to us.

1692
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:25,220
Because really, having this many people here to see our dumb podcast really means the world.

1693
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:25,620
Yeah.

1694
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:28,660
And I used to live in Chicago, and I've seen shows here.

1695
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:33,300
And the fact that we're up here right now is never not going to be completely surreal.

1696
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,260
You're so kind.

1697
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:35,540
Thank you.

1698
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:36,180
Thank you all so much.

1699
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:36,820
Thank you so much.

1700
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,940
So every week on my Bim Bam, if you never listen, Griffin reads the last Yahoo.

1701
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:44,580
And then on the next episode, we come back and sort of discuss it.

1702
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,220
This one was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

1703
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:49,220
Thank you, Seth.

1704
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:55,460
Yahoo answers user Caleb, who asks, has there ever been a person to get shoot in the balls

1705
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:56,500
and survive?

1706
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,000
Ouch!

1707
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,620
My name is Justin McElroy.

1708
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:00,740

And together, we host a podcast called Still Buffering, where we answer questions like,

1720
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:42,100
why should I not fall asleep first at a slumber party?

1721
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:43,380
How do I be fleek?

1722
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:46,500
Is it OK to break up with someone using emojis?

1723
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,260
And sometimes we talk about butts.

1724
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:49,300
No, we don't.

1725
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:49,800
Nope.

1726
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:56,180

I am a teenager.

1729

And I was too.

1730
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,180
Butts, butts, butts, butts, butts.

1731
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:31,940
Well, you've changed your mind, far too many times, over and over again, over and over again.
