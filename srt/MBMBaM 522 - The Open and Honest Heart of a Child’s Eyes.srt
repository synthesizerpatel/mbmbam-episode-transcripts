1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,960
countries

6
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,720
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me and Advice Show for the

7
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,880
Modern Era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy and I just punched the knows.

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,840
I'm your middle brother treve Drop

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,840
I'm your sweet, and I'm your, I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin.

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,840
No.

11
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,840
What?

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,840
No, Justin and I were bringing like a high energy thing in, you kind of came in scary.

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,840
No, I think he gave, I think he's like the bad, the wild man.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840
I was pretty bad.

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,840
Oh.

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,840
Yeah, let me go at it a different way, because a lot of people when they say like, he's the bad boy, like he talks like this.

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,840
But he could also be a bad boy like, I'm Griffin.

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,840
Well, can you do that and then do some like sound effects, like some mouth sounds kind of thing?

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,840
Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,840
I'm Griffin.

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,840
Because you know he's up to some shit.

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
Uh-huh.

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
Yeah, he's really weak in the juice.

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,840
He is a bad boy, that one.

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,840
Yeah, but I feel like he's a lowercase b, lowercase b bad boy, as opposed to like capital b's all around, like I'm a bad boy.

26
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,840
I'm a bad boy.

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,840
I'm over here with fucking Nobzilla and the Wolfman, and I'm just a bad boy.

28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,840
You sound like you're like the third host, but also you live in the vents, and we can't get rid of you.

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,840
Don't open that closet.

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,840
Oh boy, that's the prize closet.

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
If you want something out of there, it's your own risk.

32
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,840
I have a confession to make.

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,840
Almost every episode, I tend to start now by Googling Britney Spears just to see like how she's doing.

34
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:28,840
Because I feel like she's on a sort of like power groove that no one is, like people aren't clocking it.

35
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,840
It's a quest in the fantastical sense that like people rarely actually go on.

36
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,840
She's like every, and this is not a mocking of Britney Spears, she's just on some like very next level shit,

37
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,840
and is very much like having a personal journey that is completely about her own power and her own shit.

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,840
So I just like to Google Britney Spears just to see like what is going on right now over there at that camp.

39
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,840
Fucking first headline that pops up from one day ago,

40
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Britney Spears makes eye-opening discovery after watching Tim Burton's Big Eyes.

41
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:09,840
How did that make the news?

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,840
Okay, may I read the quote as to what the eye-opening discovery was?

43
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,840
No, no, no, I've got the story here. I'm on this tit. Don't fucking Google Britney Spears after I already Googled her.

44
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,840
If you wanted to make it a thing, you should have given it a segment name.

45
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:30,840
The 38-year-old pop star took to Instagram on Saturday, August 8th, in the year of our Lord, 2020,

46
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,840
to gush about Tim Burton, her favorite director in the whole world, and his 2014 drama about American painter Margaret Keane.

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:46,840
She gives a short synopsis of the film, which starred Amy Adam and Christopher Waltz, a fucking, I mean, by any stretch of the imagination,

48
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,840
a minor Tim Burton work that does, I'll admit, have its moments.

49
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,840
And here's her quote.

50
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,840
It was very weird the same day I watched this movie.

51
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,840
I did a mini photo shoot and look how freaking big my eyes were, the singer wrote alongside the photo shoot pictures.

52
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,840
I mean, my eyes have never been that big.

53
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,840
It's actually kind of crazy and they aren't retouched at all. Coincidence, maybe?

54
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,840
She said, and this is like, this is powerful, I think.

55
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,840
If the power of what you see and hear can influence your life that much,

56
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:29,840
I mean, literally stay away from bad people and raise your awareness with high-energy people.

57
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,840
That's what I learned from this. And watch Big Eyes while you're at it. Thank you.

58
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,840
And then it says hashtag ad, which is weird.

59
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,840
Hashtag ad for the 2014 Sony Pictures film. No, for 2014's Big Eyes.

60
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,840
I wish somebody would make a movie called Strong Muscles Big Wiener, because that would be sick to channel that.

61
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,840
So that's Britney Spears just coming in.

62
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,840
I would just hope I started recording. I jumped in on the boys.

63
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,840
Normally we talk about what we're going to talk about at the beginning.

64
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,840
I started the recording and just absolute called shot.

65
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,840
Like, I hope Britney Spears is on some dope shit. And there she is.

66
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,840
Just Britney talking about how good 2014's Big Eyes is. Did you see Big Eyes?

67
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,840
No, I can't say I did.

68
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,840
It's good. It's an okay little flick. That's what I'll say. It's okay.

69
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,840
This has been Big Eyes Watch, I guess?

70
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,840
More like Britney Watches Big Eyes Watch.

71
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,840
Oh damn! Let's revisit. Let's do Britney Watch Scoob Watch. Get her take on Scoob.

72
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:41,840
Hey, can we start doing the show? I feel like we got a lot of gas in the tank.

73
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,840
If it's not Riddle Me Piss, then you can...

74
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,840
It's not Riddle Me Piss. This is a different thing.

75
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,840
I wanted to say thank you to everybody. We finished the Max Fun Drive. It was very surprisingly...

76
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,840
A lot of people were giving and we weren't expecting all that support. It means the world.

77
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,840
So we always talk about how people support. We like to put back into the show.

78
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,840
Feels like play along at home.

79
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:15,840
So I made a bit of an investment here and I wasn't sure how this was going to play out, but I have a special guest here.

80
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,840
Hey everybody, it's me, Dave Matthews.

81
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:28,840
My friend Travis reached out to me and asked permission to use some of my songs and he told me his idea.

82
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,840
And I said, only if I can play to little baby.

83
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Dave, it's so cool to have you on the show. How have your sort of journeys been going, man?

84
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Tell me, any recent pilgrimages?

85
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,840
Mostly into my own mind.

86
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:56,840
That's probably for the best because of your sort of irresponsible sort of treatment of human waste while you are on.

87
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:03,840
I've got a bad track record with my duty. I still feel bad about that.

88
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Say out loud what you did, like the court ordered you to do.

89
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,840
Well, it wasn't me, but my tour bus was filled with Dave Matthews shit.

90
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,840
Well, not just Dave Matthews, the shit of the band.

91
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,840
If you think about how healthy that band eats, it's probably just cliff bars though, huh?

92
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
Just a big table of cliff bars.

93
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
We get a lot of roughage.

94
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:31,840
And then my tour manager dumped it over the side of a bridge in Chicago, if I remember correctly, and it landed on a boat full of people.

95
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,840
And I still feel real terrible about that.

96
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:43,840
Yet, even if it hadn't landed on a boat full of people, Dave Matthews, you shouldn't make your boat shit over a bridge.

97
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Well, in recompense, I haven't pooped in over 20 years.

98
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
Fantastic.

99
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,840
I will say about Dave Matthews though, a lot of celebs have some black marks on their career.

100
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,840
I do have to say in the grand skew of things, he made his bus take a shit on a boat. It's not the worst.

101
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:11,840
So Travis and I have cooked up a little game for you all, and here's the theme song.

102
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,840
We fish at each other, wondering what the other is fishing.

103
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:25,840
We remember being fish, laying under the table and fishing.

104
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Thank you, Dave. I'll take it from here.

105
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,840
So this game is called Laying Under the Table and Fishing.

106
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,840
And what we've got here, I've got a collection of Dave Matthews lyrics and fish lyrics.

107
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
Like the band Ph.

108
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,840
The band Phish, and I'm going to read them.

109
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:46,840
And these different rounds, they can be any combination of Dave Matthews band lyrics and fish lyrics.

110
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,840
And Justin and Griffin, I want you to guess which is which.

111
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
I think we understand.

112
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,840
I unironically enjoy both of these bands.

113
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
I do as well.

114
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
Is that about to be a challenge?

115
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,840
No, I do as well. I do as well.

116
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,840
They just have a similar jam feeling.

117
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,840
I mean, ants marching slaps ass, and I will cede a few more points to Mr. Matthews.

118
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

119
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,840
I just wanted to jump back in here.

120
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
A lot of my music slaps ass, Griffin.

121
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
It's very good.

122
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,840
I'm very proud of it.

123
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
All right.

124
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840
I'm not proud of everything I've done in my life.

125
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
Dave, can I talk to Travis?

126
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,840
It may be like when you tell me you're busting your shit on a boat.

127
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Yes, I feel terrible about that.

128
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,840
I've already said I've been blocked up for years because of the guilt.

129
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,840
You're kind of turning into a southern grandpa, Dave Matthews band.

130
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,840
When I go back, no one really knows where I'm from.

131
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
South Africa.

132
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Maybe.

133
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,840
I don't even know anymore.

134
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,840
I've traveled so much.

135
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
All right.

136
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
Now, sorry, Dave.

137
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
We're running out of time here, Dave.

138
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
All right.

139
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
Round one.

140
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
Feels like it.

141
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Boy, it feels like it more and more every episode.

142
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Round one.

143
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Caught you just then.

144
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Hands were in the cookie jar.

145
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
How can we share when you sneak up and go?

146
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,840
I have no intention of losing my beard.

147
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,840
How they design, and then we go again.

148
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Fish.

149
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,840
I'm going to say fish just because Trey Anastasio oft has a beard,

150
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
and I don't think I've ever seen Dave Matthews.

151
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,840
And he loves cookies.

152
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Incorrect.

153
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,840
That is Dave Matthews from Kit Kat Jam.

154
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
Damn it.

155
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
He did a song called Kit Kat Jam?

156
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Kit Kat Jam loves those.

157
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
I love.

158
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Give me a break.

159
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Whoa, that was weird.

160
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,840
You picked up the sentence right where Travis left off.

161
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Travis and I have been together so long now.

162
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
We finish each other's sentences.

163
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
All right.

164
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,840
You've been there for all of Travis's major recent life events,

165
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,840
like when he picked up a not great Dave Matthews impression.

166
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
Well, I live inside Travis now.

167
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,840
It's a being John Malkovich journey we're on.

168
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
All right.

169
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Next lyric.

170
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
I had to get away.

171
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
I was losing my interest.

172
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,840
Instead of expanding my world, I was just scanning Pinterest.

173
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Okay, wait.

174
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,840
I want to say Dave Matthews.

175
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840
That feels too concrete for fish.

176
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:06,840
I'm going to say fish every round and hope that I get some right.

177
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
Griffin is correct.

178
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
That is fish.

179
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Things people do.

180
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,840
That's a great name for a song.

181
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
Great name for a tune.

182
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Woman, please, I'm in your possession.

183
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
You are my obsession.

184
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Let me go down, down, down, down, down.

185
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:27,840
If I don't hop on that boat when Justin feels so certain about it

186
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,840
and get dumped on that beautiful Vance bus.

187
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,840
Hop on the boat, Griffin.

188
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Yes, that is correct.

189
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
Because Dave Matthews Band 7 says,

190
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Justin 1, Griffin 2.

191
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Okay, you ready?

192
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
Round 2.

193
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,840
And then one day, you find it to your intense delight

194
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,840
that three wrong turns can really make a right.

195
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,840
So why not be like me?

196
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Be proud of all your crimes.

197
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Because when I screw up once, I do it two more times.

198
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,840
That's fish.

199
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,840
That is David Matthews Man.

200
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,840
I'm the David Matthews Man.

201
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,840
No, it is fish.

202
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Justin's correct.

203
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
It's 2 and 2.

204
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
That's from Fish's Blaze On.

205
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Next one.

206
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
I can't stop thinking about you.

207
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

208
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,840
Why would I want to?

209
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
I like coffee with toast and jelly,

210
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,840
but I'd rather be licking from your back to your belly.

211
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
Fucking Dave Matthews.

212
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
Are you kidding me?

213
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
I think I'm going to.

214
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,840
It's obvious it's Dave Matthews.

215
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Whoever it is, I'm wearing a wire,

216
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,840
and I've been waiting for this moment to arrest David Matthews Man.

217
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,840
It was me, David Matthews, from my song Shake Me Like a Monkey.

218
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Okay.

219
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Fucking Dave.

220
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
That sucks, Dave.

221
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
Here's a hint.

222
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
There's my secret tip.

223
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,840
If a lyric sends you looking for a hang-up button that does not exist,

224
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,840
who is this?

225
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
Hey, Dave.

226
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
How did you get this number?

227
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
David Matthews Man, can I ask you a question?

228
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Yes, please.

229
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,840
Is it one uninterrupted lick?

230
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
Yes.

231
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Okay.

232
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Which axis do you rotate the woman?

233
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,840
I have a lathe.

234
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,840
I'm glad you have a woman lathe, David Matthews Man.

235
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,840
I only use it consensually.

236
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,840
No, I know, but does it go sort of-

237
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
And concentrically.

238
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
Okay.

239
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
Little baby.

240
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840
Fantastic.

241
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
You're dodging the question.

242
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,840
Do you go height-wise or-

243
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,840
It depends on the day.

244
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,840
That's a great deal of distance different.

245
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,840
If you go from her back and then you go around her side of her tummy

246
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,840
to her belly button, you're traveling half of the width circumference.

247
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,840
But if you go from back and then over her head and down her face

248
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,840
or down the butt is another option, Dave.

249
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,840
And I feel like we're talking about a few different sort of tongue experiences.

250
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,840
It all depends on how much time I have in my schedule.

251
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
Are there more?

252
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
There are more.

253
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Okay.

254
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
Round three.

255
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,840
Currently, I believe it's two and two.

256
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Okay.

257
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Oh no, three and three.

258
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,840
How could it possibly be round three?

259
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,840
If you give, you...

260
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,840
Okay, sorry.

261
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
If you give, you, you begin to live.

262
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,840
If you give, you begin to live.

263
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,840
You begin, you get the world.

264
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,840
If you give, you begin to give.

265
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,840
You get the world, you get the world.

266
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
If you give, you begin to live.

267
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,840
Dave.

268
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,840
That was you, Dave, wasn't it?

269
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,840
I'm going to say fish because that feels like a jam sort of.

270
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
It was me, Dave Matthew.

271
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840
I can't, I don't know what that means.

272
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,840
Dave Matthew's man kind of breaks sometimes.

273
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
And you've got to, you've got to get a little needle

274
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,840
and you've got to push it in his little reset indentation.

275
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
And it's either on his back or his belly.

276
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
In his dimple.

277
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840
Okay, so that was Dave.

278
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
That's Dave.

279
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
Wow, congratulations.

280
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
So it's four to three.

281
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
Griffin is winning.

282
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
And that's from the song, You Might Die Trying.

283
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Okay, next one.

284
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,840
Legally, you have to tell me how many more fucking questions there are left.

285
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
One last one.

286
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,840
I'm not all bad, but I'm a faithful sinner.

287
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,840
I might get lost, but I'll be home for dinner.

288
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
Fish.

289
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,840
If God don't like me, he can send me to hell.

290
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,840
But I love the way you love me, girl.

291
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,840
I love the way you move.

292
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
Now see, it's Dave Matthew.

293
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,840
If he says that, if he mentions girl,

294
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
I feel like fish doesn't fuck like that.

295
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,840
Dave Matthew's band is like, get on my lathe, girl.

296
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,840
I'm going to say Dave Matthew's man.

297
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,840
It was the Dave Matthew's man.

298
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,840
Griffin wins five to four, but it was a good, good battle.

299
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:29,840
Dave Matthews, every lyric Dave Matthews writes is like a very creative pervert.

300
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,840
And every song that Fish writes is like a harlequin with gout.

301
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:44,840
If it's a medieval harlequin or some sort of like jester in a dark carnival, that feels more like Fish.

302
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:51,840
I just want to remind everyone that my song, Crash, is about a man spying on a woman through a window.

303
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,840
I love songs about perverts.

304
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Stop getting married to it.

305
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,840
I love perverts.

306
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,840
I might not be one myself, but I celebrate their whole deal.

307
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Thank you so much for having me.

308
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Do you guys have any snacks or a bathroom I could use?

309
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
Okay, goodbye. Thank you, Dave.

310
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,840
This is our advice show, obviously.

311
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,840
Oh, you're kidding me.

312
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
We're 16 minutes in.

313
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
We're just now laying out.

314
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,840
I don't think we can say that fucking anymore.

315
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
It is.

316
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,840
This is a Dave Matthews show where we sometimes tell people what to do.

317
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,840
I'm in an air travel related pickle.

318
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Next month, I'm moving from Japan to the Czech Republic.

319
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,840
I'm in the midst of packing things to ship over, which is expensive as shit.

320
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,840
I got three hats I refuse to part with, a couple of bowlers, and a wide brim hat.

321
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,840
The problem is they don't fit the last box in my suitcase.

322
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,840
I can already see what you're about to ask.

323
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:46,840
So how many hats is too many hats to wear on an airplane without getting caught, stopped?

324
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,840
How many hats can I wear before I'm too suspicious?

325
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,840
And that's from Mariah.

326
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,840
Okay, I can say from experience.

327
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,840
I have worn one hat, and I've had to remove it so they could pat my hair.

328
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,840
And tell me I'm a good boy.

329
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,840
Yeah, and then they smelled their hand for a long time.

330
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,840
Yeah, so I will just say one hat.

331
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,840
And now I think you're asking several questions here, Mariah, right?

332
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,840
Because I don't think, I don't know about the travel laws of either Japan or Czech Republic,

333
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:24,840
but I don't think there's anything illegal about wearing more than one hat onto an airplane.

334
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:34,840
No, I mean, we can't wager a guess at the sort of cultural differences that would sort of aid us in answering this question.

335
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,840
I do think we can say that I can't imagine a society where three hats is great.

336
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,840
I want to hit you guys with a question, a theoretical question.

337
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:56,840
Okay, is there a place that is less suspicious to put a second hat than on top of the first hat?

338
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Because I'm sitting here thinking about it, like what if you put it here or here or here?

339
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,840
I feel like any place you put the second hat is going to be more weird than on top of the first hat.

340
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,840
Yeah.

341
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:18,840
Is that fair? Could you safety pin the hats together so that one hat goes on top of your head and the other two hang down on either side of your head?

342
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,840
Okay.

343
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,840
And just call it fashion.

344
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,840
Oh, this is fashion.

345
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,840
It's fashion.

346
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,840
I feel like you could have one on a carabiner on your waist.

347
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,840
That's fucking great, Juice.

348
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:38,840
That's like, listen, I don't know what this day is going to hold. This hat could get, I don't know, ruined.

349
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,840
Blown away by a jet engine.

350
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,840
Could get blown away by a jet engine, confiscated by a handsy TSA agent. No one knows.

351
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:54,840
But I think you could do one on your waist, on your belt hook.

352
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,840
And for the third, let me suggest, big teddy bear. You put that hat on the teddy bear.

353
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,840
That's actually not bad, Travis. God damn it.

354
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,840
Well, I mean, it is. All you've done there is added a tremendous amount of bulk to your hat.

355
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,840
It is when I get carry-ons. Yeah, it now becomes a carry-on. But you can't carry on a hat.

356
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,840
You can't be like, I have two carry-ons, my backpack and this hat.

357
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:24,840
And that's good for going through security, too, because you're carrying a giant bear wearing a hat. And they'll say, that's adorable.

358
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,840
You're like, yeah, his name is Mr. Not-Filled-With-Drugs.

359
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,840
Okay, we don't test him.

360
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Let me ask you guys something.

361
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Come here, Doctor. Come here, Doctor Oozy Belly.

362
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,840
What is more suspish? Two hats or three hats?

363
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
Two hats is way more suspish than three hats.

364
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
Agreed.

365
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Here's the thing that's fucked up about what Travis said about it being fashion.

366
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:57,840
If I saw somebody with two hats, I would think it was some sort of shell game or something terrible is underneath one of the hats.

367
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,840
If I see three hats on the person, I'll be like, that must be the style.

368
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,840
Three hats, you're doing a thing.

369
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
You're doing a thing, yeah.

370
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Now it's an affectation.

371
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,840
Two hats, you're being an asshole.

372
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,840
Two hats, you might have put on a hat forgetting you already had a hat on.

373
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,840
That's what I'm saying. Two hats, this is my argument.

374
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,840
Two hats raises the, and I think this is what we're finally getting the meat of here.

375
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Two hats raises the question of did they not remember that they had already placed a hat on their head.

376
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,840
Correct.

377
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,840
Three, there's just no way.

378
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,840
We've kissed plausibility goodbye, it's a choice you're making.

379
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,840
And I can get on board with that if it's a choice.

380
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,840
You've chosen.

381
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,840
I just remembered the types of hats we are talking about here, and it is two bowlers and a wide brimmed hat.

382
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,840
Oh, easy.

383
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,840
So you go bowler, wide brimmed hat bowler, wide brimmed hat sandwich, bada bing, bada boom, fashion.

384
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,840
That is the way to do it, yeah.

385
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,840
I guess my question is, and please Mara, I do not take this as a personal judgment on you,

386
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,840
but there is no way to get through this sentence without it being explicitly that.

387
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,840
Why do you need these hats?

388
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
Because they're cool hats, Griffin.

389
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:15,840
Two bowlers and a wide brimmed hat feels like, especially when you're doing an uprooting of your life from one sort of region to another.

390
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,840
Yeah, clean slate.

391
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,840
I think you should clean slate it.

392
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:28,840
When I moved from Cincinnati to Chicago, I threw so much stuff in the dumpsters right behind the shitty apartment that Travis and I lived in.

393
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,840
I threw several swords away.

394
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,840
You think I wanted to keep those swords?

395
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Yeah.

396
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
Absolutely I did.

397
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,840
But I'm starting over.

398
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,840
I'm rebooting my life.

399
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Maybe now in your new life, your Czech Republic life, you just have one hat that you're very proud of.

400
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:53,840
What if you wore all three hats and as you walked into the terminal, you just kept shouting, hats for sale.

401
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,840
50 cents a cap.

402
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,840
I've got hats for sale.

403
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,840
And then you go through security and then you continue yelling, hats for sale.

404
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,840
Hats! And then everyone's like, why is that person wearing so many hats?

405
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,840
Oh, obviously, it's because they're for sale.

406
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Now, obviously, there's a downside here.

407
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
There is a risk where someone buys your hat.

408
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,840
Someone's gonna buy your hat and then you don't have any more.

409
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Yeah.

410
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
But that's a choice.

411
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
I mean, at least you got that going for you now.

412
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,840
You can buy another hat when you get there.

413
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Yes.

414
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,840
I would make the argument it's a risk of being too pragmatic about it.

415
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,840
If you can't wear all three of these hats at the same time, you probably don't need three hats.

416
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,840
Thank you.

417
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Huh.

418
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
Well, yeah.

419
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
Huh.

420
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,840
But what about coordinating with different outfits?

421
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,840
Just get rid of the outfits that match the other two hats.

422
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,840
Ah, but they only have three outfits.

423
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
It's like, have you never seen, it's like, have you never seen Doug?

424
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,840
Like, just wear the same outfit and the same hat.

425
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,840
How come Doug never wore a bowler?

426
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,840
Can we, he would have been chomping fucking BB's style if he did that.

427
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
That's true.

428
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,840
Can we taskmaster this a little bit and like, try and, why,

429
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,840
I think there's a way to do this without it being weird at all.

430
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
Wide brim hat goes on the head.

431
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
There is nowhere else that that is going to go.

432
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
Yes.

433
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
The brim is far too wide.

434
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,840
One bowler, you put some elastic on it and put that around your face.

435
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,840
That's your mask.

436
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
Okay.

437
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

438
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
Yes.

439
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,840
Now we just have one more hat to conceal.

440
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,840
And I feel like so far, boys, I've done the lion's share of the work on this.

441
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Okay.

442
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
I have it.

443
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,840
So if you can tell me where the other hat goes, where it's not going to be weird.

444
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,840
You're going to-

445
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,840
Don't say under the shirt and say it's like a tummy.

446
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
No.

447
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,840
Okay.

448
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,840
No.

449
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,840
You're going to clip two straps onto it, sling it over your shoulders.

450
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Now it's like a hat pack, you know?

451
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,840
It's kind of like, oh, that's like a cool looking backpack.

452
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,840
It looks like just like a bowler.

453
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
Thanks.

454
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
It's a hat.

455
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,840
Thanks.

456
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
It's just a regular hat.

457
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
What do you keep-

458
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,840
You like take off to show them and just like packs of loose gum fall out of it.

459
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
It's very bad and ineffective.

460
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,840
It's a hat pack.

461
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
It's a hat pack.

462
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
What do you keep in it?

463
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,840
What do you keep in it?

464
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
The hat.

465
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,840
It takes my hat from one to another.

466
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,840
I do think though you could do the like neck thing, like hang it like a safari guy from

467
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,840
your neck hanging to your back.

468
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
And maybe no one would question it.

469
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
I think you might be able to get away with that actually.

470
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,840
I actually think now that I'm thinking about it with all the TSA agents here in the United

471
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,840
States that I've encountered, they would be like, are there drugs or a bomb or whatever

472
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
in that?

473
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
And I'd be like, no.

474
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
And they'd be like, then just keep, please keep moving.

475
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
Please keep moving.

476
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,840
We have a lot of people to get through and I don't care about your dumb ass hats.

477
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

478
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,840
Please.

479
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,840
I'm so excited for this one.

480
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,840
It's sent by the prospector Merritt Palmer.

481
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,840
Mariah, I'm not saying your hats are dumb.

482
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,840
I'm saying all my hats are dumb.

483
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,840
No, I'm not saying Mariah's hats are dumb.

484
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,840
I'm saying two of them are.

485
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,840
Okay.

486
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
And one of them is good.

487
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,840
And that's the one to really invest in.

488
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,840
Okay.

489
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,840
This Yahoo is asked by Yahoo Answers user HangingBat.

490
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,840
And I'll be honest with you, boys.

491
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,840
I mostly want to talk about this one for the responses.

492
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,840
HangingBat asks, poll.

493
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,840
If you were a recipe, what ingredients would I need?

494
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,840
Big open mouth smiley face emoticon.

495
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
Is this a sexy thing?

496
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,840
You read it like that.

497
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,840
It's on Yahoo Answers, so it's gonna be for some people.

498
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,840
Okay.

499
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,840
If I was a recipe, not what food would I be,

500
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
but what ingredients?

501
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
Yeah.

502
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,840
So we have 10 responses to this.

503
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,840
Okay, okay.

504
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,840
10 Yahoo Answers users have weighed in.

505
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,840
And given their, I'm on allrecipes.com

506
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,840
looking at these users' recipes to make them as human beings

507
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,840
as they are known on the Earth today.

508
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,840
And each one is a slam dunk in a different way,

509
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,840
which I've never really seen before.

510
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
And I would like to just sort of do them.

511
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,840
These are from two days ago, by the way.

512
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,840
Merrick got this one hot and fresh out the kitchen.

513
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,840
P says, everything's sweet and a large oven.

514
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Tongue sticking out emoticon.

515
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,840
Weasel McWeasel says, a healthy dose of no quit

516
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
with a liberal splash of charm and wit.

517
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,840
That's good.

518
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,840
But those aren't ingredients that you can buy.

519
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,840
I can't go to the store and be like, where is your don't quit?

520
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,840
Travis, you can't approach this.

521
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,840
I need you to come at this with the open

522
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
and honest heart of a child's eyes.

523
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,840
I mean, I understand that, but I was sitting here

524
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,840
thinking about, I don't know, some salt.

525
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,840
Like I was like trying to do it.

526
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,840
Travis's recipe is a fucking little pair of glasses

527
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,840
he can push up his nose when he's being an asshole.

528
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Hence nay, please.

529
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
Exactly, thank you.

530
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
Thank you.

531
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,840
This one's, yeah, Little Big Man says, a heart.

532
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,840
And as the song goes, handel me with care.

533
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,840
You know the song from, I guess the composer,

534
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,840
Handel me with care.

535
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Cheese brain does say tequila, mix orange juice

536
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,840
or some Sprite will be fine, add loads of ice.

537
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,840
That's a screwdriver, I think.

538
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
But those are ingredients.

539
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
It's not a screwdriver.

540
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,840
If you want to make Travis, you need blood

541
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,840
and bones and skin and some goo for the eyeballs.

542
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,840
But what of the soul?

543
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,840
I don't, call God, don't put a soul in there.

544
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
All right, Elliot, that's rough.

545
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,840
Elliot the corgi says lots of fur, vanilla ice cream

546
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,840
and a cozy hoodie, hun.

547
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
Wait, lots of fur?

548
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,840
Lots of fur, please let me finish.

549
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,840
This one got, this is the only one of these 10 answers.

550
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,840
You can give the answers a thumbs up or a thumbs down.

551
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,840
This one has two thumbs up and one thumbs down.

552
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,840
It's the only one that somebody said no.

553
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Lots of fur, vanilla ice cream and a cozy hoodie, hun

554
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,840
and then a dog emoji.

555
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,840
And I don't know if the dog is part of it.

556
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840
Okay, read the username.

557
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
Elliot the corgi.

558
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,840
Thank you.

559
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
It's a corgi.

560
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Yeah.

561
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,840
Got the ability to use a computer.

562
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Then why the hoodie?

563
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
Now the hoodie is a good question

564
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
because it's weird enough you're on the internet.

565
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
You don't need to draw more attention to yourself

566
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,840
by wearing a hoodie.

567
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,840
Dogs have nature's hoodie.

568
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,840
And I love a corgi too.

569
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,840
But that is, and please corgi users,

570
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,840
actually go ahead and tweet at me corgi lovers.

571
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,840
They're not the best smelling breed of dog.

572
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
They got that coarse hair.

573
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
They sweat a lot.

574
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
They're low to the ground.

575
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,840
They pick up a lot of detritus.

576
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,840
I don't want to continue.

577
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
What is the best smelling dog?

578
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,840
Recycling that.

579
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
What's the best smelling dog?

580
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,840
Uh-huh.

581
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840
Hmm.

582
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
Chocolate lab.

583
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
Does it smell like chocolate?

584
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
Is that what you mean?

585
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,840
ABCA Me.

586
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
Griffin, I'm sorry.

587
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,840
Does it smell like chocolate?

588
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
Yeah.

589
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
ABCA Me says,

590
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
egg whites, granulated sugar, cream of tartar,

591
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
tartar or tartar?

592
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
Nobody's quite sure.

593
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,840
Vanilla extract.

594
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
So that's Travis, actually.

595
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Yes, thank you.

596
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,840
My friend fucking Hal A. Pino says,

597
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840
high octane, grain alcohol matches,

598
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,840
and the ability to run really, really, really fast.

599
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:14,840
Can you handle it?

600
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
Nice.

601
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840
Just the idea.

602
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,840
If someone's like, how fast do you run?

603
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,840
You're like, really, really, really fast.

604
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,840
We're going to burn some shit down.

605
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
Why?

606
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Because we're making this Yahoo Answers user in the lab.

607
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
I'm going to read the ingredients to this one first,

608
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
and then I'll read the username.

609
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,840
Just a vat of high fructose corn syrup

610
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,840
and a mold that looks like a roach.

611
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,840
And that's from Yahoo Answers user, Gummy Roach.

612
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Oh.

613
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,840
They didn't make this account to answer this question.

614
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,840
They have answered 8,634 questions.

615
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,840
They have 314,000 points.

616
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,840
This is a power user.

617
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,840
This person's name I can't read

618
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,840
because it's made out of weird characters,

619
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
but I think it might say Shadow.

620
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
Shadow says spice, spice, and more spice.

621
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
No, why don't you?

622
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Spice as hot as pepper spice.

623
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
So hot you can't handle it.

624
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,840
I'm talking about Carolina Reaper hot,

625
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,840
the world's hottest pepper.

626
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:19,840
I guess Shadow is just a big pepper?

627
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840
Also, Shadow, I don't know how to tell you this,

628
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,840
but spice is like a category of food.

629
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,840
You wouldn't, in a recipe book,

630
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,840
add eggs and butter and some spice.

631
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,840
This username is corrupted in some way.

632
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,840
I can't read it.

633
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,840
It's just two blank boxes.

634
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
It says passion fruit and Turkish delight.

635
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,840
So they're bringing up the weakest result there.

636
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,840
But I like any of these that I could go,

637
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,840
okay, I'm going to make this person.

638
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,840
The Gummy Roach, I could make that.

639
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
You could make that person.

640
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,840
That one wins Travis's prize.

641
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
Right, but if it's like, can't do attitude

642
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,840
and a whole bunch, don't quit,

643
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
can you handle that?

644
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,840
I'm like, that's not helpful.

645
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,840
That's like if I said how to make a cake

646
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,840
and you said lots of sweet and delicious.

647
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Fuck you.

648
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,840
That's nothing.

649
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
I feel like that could get most people there though.

650
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
Yeah, if I said make a cake

651
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840
and they said, what do I need to make it?

652
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
I say, you just need some delicious in there.

653
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
They'd be like, I'm on it.

654
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Now, Yahoo Answers user Hangingbat responded,

655
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
updated the question three days ago

656
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840
that said too hot to handle, lol.

657
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
And I don't know what that's-

658
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Lol.

659
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,840
No fucking idea what that's responding to.

660
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,840
I'm guessing the Carolina Reaper won.

661
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Did they win?

662
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,840
Anyway, what was the recipe for you two boys?

663
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,840
For mine would be can't do attitude

664
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,840
and don't quit

665
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,840
and three eggs

666
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,840
and some blood.

667
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,840
Mine would be probably neutral colored shorts.

668
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,840
Uh-huh.

669
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,840
And then I think you could just improvise the rest of it.

670
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,840
Yeah.

671
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,840
The neutral colored shorts are so essential to my recipe.

672
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
Yeah.

673
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,840
My recipe on all recipes would be neutral shorts soup

674
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840
and then in parentheses, Griffin McElroy soup.

675
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
Yeah, uh-huh.

676
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,840
Because that's what they call it in some regions.

677
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,840
Mine would be a mustard seed faith and a world-class hog.

678
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,840
Huh.

679
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,840
Now, huh.

680
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
Okay.

681
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,840
With mountains.

682
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,840
I was just-

683
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,840
With which?

684
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
With which?

685
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Exactly.

686
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,840
I have faith in my hog.

687
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,840
And Travis' was eggs and blood and can't do attitude

688
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,840
because he didn't want to play.

689
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Okay, do you want to hear mine?

690
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
No, no, you did yours.

691
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
You decided you didn't want to play.

692
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,840
I said mine before that it was blood and bones.

693
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,840
You stay in the dugout because you didn't want to play.

694
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,840
And the coach put me and Justin,

695
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,840
and we're out here fucking swinging, smashing homers.

696
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,840
Well, if you want to make a Travis,

697
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,840
then you need some T for tasty

698
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
and you need some R for ravishing.

699
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,840
The game's already over.

700
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,840
He's still running around the bases.

701
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,840
And you need some A for ass.

702
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
He's still running around the bases.

703
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,840
And you need some V for virginity now.

704
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,840
And you need some I for indecent.

705
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
Long ago, somebody left with the cup.

706
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
And you need some S for sexy.

707
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
And he's still going around.

708
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:26,840
And then you need some M for marscapone.

709
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,840
Okay, so we're going to take a quick break.

710
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,840
And when we return to you here just after the music,

711
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
we'll be talking about some beloved sponsors.

712
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
So get there for that.

713
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:46,840
Squarespace.

714
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,840
It's time, my friends, time for the uprising.

715
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,840
You've been doing too much in the meat space.

716
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,840
And it's time to do it in the Squarespace.

717
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,840
You're going to build a website, not just any website,

718
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,840
a beautiful website that stands out and changes the world.

719
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,840
It's time to disrupt.

720
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,840
It's time to showcase your work.

721
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,840
Sell products and services of all kinds.

722
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Promote your physical or online business and more.

723
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
And what's that and more?

724
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840
Whatever you can dream.

725
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,840
You can dream it.

726
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
You can do it with beautiful customizable templates

727
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,840
created by world-class designers.

728
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,840
Everything optimized for mobile right out of the box.

729
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,840
Analytics that help you grow in real time,

730
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,840
free and secure hosting, and nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

731
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
You will not be stopped.

732
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,840
You will always be moving forward.

733
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,840
You will always be closing by going to squarespace.com

00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:51,840
You got me ready to like overthrow the fucking economy

739
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,840
and government.

740
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,840
Yeah dude, let's disrupt.

741
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Nothing, all the other stuff that has happened until now

742
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
that has been so bad.

743
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Yeah.

744
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
That wasn't, this was the domino.

745
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
This was the V for Vendetta.

746
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,840
You knocked that shit right over.

747
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,840
That's right.

748
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,840
Can you imagine a V in V for Vendetta?

749
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,840
I was like, yes, we have to stop all of this,

750
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,840
all of this horrible stuff.

751
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,840
And also look at the website I created.

752
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,840
It's got photos of all my travels and some of the pages

753
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,840
are password protected.

754
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,840
And now Natalie Portman, check this out.

755
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
Click.

756
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Hey Stitch Fix also.

757
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,840
The government tried to shut down my hamster dance.

758
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,840
But they can't stop the signal.

759
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,840
Wait, isn't that Serenity?

760
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,840
I love that movie.

761
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Great flick.

762
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,840
Stitch Fix is here to give us boxes of clothes.

763
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
So we don't go to clothes store

764
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
and we bring the clothes store to us,

765
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
except it's not even like that

766
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,840
because you have a personal stylist

767
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,840
who you give a little profile for

768
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,840
and they will figure out what clothes

769
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
are gonna look really good.

770
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,840
All these boxes are personalized just for you

771
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,840
and your color styles and budget

772
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,840
and you get nice looking clothes

773
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,840
and you pay a $20 styling fee

774
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,840
for each fix that is sent your way

775
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
which is credited towards anything you keep

776
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,840
and you can schedule it for any time.

777
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,840
You can change your schedule whenever you want.

778
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,840
I have been getting them every month

779
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
but I don't leave the house anymore

780
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
so I've bumped it back to once every two months

781
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,840
and it's no big deal.

782
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
It's real fucking easy.

783
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,840
There's no subscription required.

784
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,840
Shipping, returns and exchanges are always easy and free.

785
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,840
You only pay for what you keep

786
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,840
and you can get started today

787
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,840

00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,840

789
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,840

790
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,840
for 25% off when you keep everything in your fix

791
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,840
one last time, stitchfix.com slash my brother.

792
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,840
Hi, I'm Allie Gertz.

793
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,840
And I'm Julia Prescott

794
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,840
and we host Round Springfield.

795
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,840
Round Springfield is a new Simpsons podcast

796
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,840
that is Simpsons adjacent in its topic.

797
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,840
We talk to Simpsons writers, directors, voiceover actors,

798
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,840
you name it, about non-Simpsons things that they've done

799
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,840
because surprise, they're all extremely talented.

800
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,840
Absolutely.

801
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,840
For example, David X. Cohen worked on The Simpsons

802
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,840
but then created a little show called Futurama.

803
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,840
That's our very first episode.

804
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
So tune in for stuff like that with Yardley Smith,

805
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,840
with Sim Long, with different writers and voice actors.

806
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,840
It's going to be so much fun

807
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,840
and we are every other week on MaximumFun.org

808
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,840
or wherever you get your podcasts.

809
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

810
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,840
Oh?

811
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

812
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Yeah.

813
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,840
Bum, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num, num.

814
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
I want a munch.

815
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
Squad.

816
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,840
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

817
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,840
I want too much.

818
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
Squad.

819
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,840
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

820
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Welcome to Munch Squad,

821
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,840
it's a podcast within a podcast,

822
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,840
we're following the latest and greatest in brand eating.

823
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,840
I am so excited because America has decided to pretend

824
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,840
that coronavirus does not exist.

825
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
And as a result, our fast food chains

826
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,840
are beginning to awaken from their great slumber

827
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,840
for new creations, new ideas, fresh thinking.

828
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,840
And who does fresh better than Chipotle?

829
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,840
Oh, is that rhetorical or is that a real question?

830
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,840
No, I mean, if you would have said like a Hardee's,

831
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,840
I would have given you some shit,

832
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,840
but I feel like Chipotle is middle of the pack.

833
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,840
You're thinking fresh, you're thinking Chipotle.

834
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,840
They did the fucking Fiona Apple commercial.

835
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,840
Yeah, well, this one is new

836
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,840
and Chipotle is launching the Tony Hawk burrito.

837
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Huh?

838
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,840
Fresh as hell.

839
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,840
Chipotle Mexican Grill on Monday, this one's fucking fresh.

840
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,840
The box came out today.

841
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,840
The Chipotle Mexican Grill on Monday

842
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,840
announces teaming up with skating legend

843
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,840
and brand super fan, Tony Hawk,

844
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,840
to offer his go-to Chipotle order exclusively

845
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,840
on the Chipotle app and chipotle.com.

846
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,840
Wait, can I guess?

847
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,840
Guess what his go-to ever is?

848
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,840
Sure, yeah.

849
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
It's just an empty burrito

850
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
that he later puts a cold hot dog in.

851
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,840
Is that it?

852
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,840
No, you're very close.

853
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
Can I do a guess?

854
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,840
Yeah, do a fun guess.

855
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
It's a big burrito.

856
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,840
He sticks four wheels on.

857
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
They ride.

858
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,840
Starting today, the first 2,000 fans.

859
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,840
Wait, let Griffin finish.

860
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
Let Griffin finish.

861
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
What's he do, Griffin?

862
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,840
He rides it like a skateboard.

863
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,840
Starting today, the first 2,000 fans.

864
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
And the wheels are tomatoes?

865
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840
No, they're wheels.

866
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,840
Oh.

867
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,840
I feel like I might be able to, if I act fast,

868
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,840
I might be able to be among the first 2,000.

869
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,840
And you guys are clearly doing your own thing.

870
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:42,840
Someone just try to get this burrito real quick.

871
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,840
The first 2,000 fans who order the Tony Hawk burrito

872
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,840
made with brown rice, black beans, chicken, tomatillo,

873
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,840
red chili salsa, pink trucks from a skateboard,

874
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:59,840
and guacamole will get access to the Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1

875
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:05,840
and 2 warehouse demo for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, or PC.

876
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,840
What a weird coincidence that this would, like,

877
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,840
his brand super fanship would coincide with, like,

878
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,840
a new Tony Hawk, like, video game experience.

879
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,840
Yeah, it is very weird that, yeah, you're absolutely right, Travis.

880
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,840
This is one of the stranger occurrences we've seen in our time.

881
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,840
Those two have dovetailed magnificently together.

882
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:31,840
Chipotle's, so I already said that, on August 14th at 11 a.m.,

883
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:38,840
PT Anderson will direct a new motion picture strike, no, Pacific Time.

884
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,840
The launch will culminate in a two-hour livestream

885
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:45,840
from Chipotle's Twitch page that they have featuring Tony Hawk,

886
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,840
fellow skateboarder Jagger Eaton, actor Finn Wolfhard.

887
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,840
Fuck yeah!

888
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,840
What?

889
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,840
A sentient burrito, Mick Jagger, Jesus Christ of Nazareth,

890
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,840
all eating burritos slowly.

891
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:06,840
Still living Elvis Presley, now dead Elvis Costello.

892
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,840
That's right, he'll be dead by August 14th, folks.

893
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,840
No, it just says first three.

894
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:16,840
They're going to be playing Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 and 2 warehouse demo,

895
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,840
and they're going to be giving out up to 5,000 free burritos

896
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,840
to viewers throughout the stream.

897
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Now, it says they're going to give out up to 5,000 free burritos.

898
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
I do like the reality where they're like,

899
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,840
we've given away 4,000 of these bad boys.

900
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,840
The next thousand are coming home with us.

901
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Hi, it's me, Finn Wolfhard.

902
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,840
Oh, no, not again.

903
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,840
Yeah, anyway, I want 30 burritos delivered to my home,

904
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,840
and the cost of that will be, oh, let me stop you right there.

905
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,840
It's zero.

906
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,840
This first-of-its-kind menu integration gives our fans a chance

907
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,840
to eat like the greatest skater of all time

908
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,840
and get access to the demo

909
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,840
for one of the summer's most anticipated video game releases,

910
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,840
says Chris Brant, Chief Marketing Officer.

911
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,840
Real athletes need real food,

912
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,840
and Chipotle is excited to continue being part of Sony's training routine,

913
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,840
whether it's competing at the skate park or in a video game.

914
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,840
Hey, this isn't the first time somebody has sold a food item

915
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,840
because a celebrity liked it at their store, right?

916
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,840
People have been doing that for, let me check,

917
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,840
all of the time of restaurants.

918
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,840
Yeah, but this one's Tony Hawk, and it's a burrito.

919
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,840
I just want to step in here very briefly.

920
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:40,840
I know that Tony Hawk's body,

921
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,840
the body of Anthony Frank Hawk,

922
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,840
the Birdman's body and my body have several chemical

923
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,840
and physical differences.

924
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,840
We can all agree on this, right?

925
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,840
This is granted. This is settled law.

926
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,840
The man is 52 years old,

927
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,840
and if I were to make a list of things he felt like doing

928
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,840
after pounding a burrito,

929
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,840
I can almost guarantee you skateboarding

930
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,840
would be extremely low on the list.

931
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,840
Tony Hawk has been a Chipotle celebrity cardholder,

932
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,840
whatever the fuck that means.

933
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,840
It's an exclusive membership tier,

934
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,840
afforded to famous friends of the brand

935
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,840
that grants recipients free meals and catering since 2013.

936
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,840
Holy shit.

937
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,840
Did you guys hear this? Yeah, I'm hearing it now, baby.

938
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,840
Are you hearing this? I'm hearing it now, baby.

939
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,840
Tony Hawk has been a Chipotle celebrity cardholder,

940
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,840
an exclusive membership tier,

941
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,840
afforded to famous friends of the brand

942
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,840
that grant recipients free meals and catering since 2013.

943
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,840
Hey, Chipotle, I was just kidding.

944
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,840
I love you. I love you.

945
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,840
I take it all fucking back.

946
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,840
I was just joking. You're great.

947
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,840
I've always been a fan,

948
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,840
and Justin Griffin have never loved you like I love you.

949
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,840
Chipotle burritos are our favorite way to refuel

950
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,840
after long skate sessions, adds me.

951
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,840
No, it's Tony Hawk.

952
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,840
It's a blast to see the enthusiasm for Chipotle,

953
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,840
skating, and video games continue to grow

954
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,840
and inspire a new generation of presumably burrito eaters.

955
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,840
Whether you're a veteran THPS player or new to the game,

956
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:17,840
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 TM has something for everyone.

957
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,840
And also the burritos still.

958
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,840
Still the burritos.

959
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,840
Chipotle has amassed around 27,000 followers on Twitch.

960
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,840
Like, finales for the Chipotle Challenger Series,

961
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,840
the brand's marquee esports tournament

962
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,840
that allows amateur gamers to compete against gaming stars

963
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,840
and celebrities have been livestreamed on Chipotle's Twitch,

964
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,840
along with exclusive musical performances.

965
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,840
Aye, it's me, Mick Jagger.

966
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,840
What an honor it is.

967
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,840
What an honor it is to be playing on the Chipotle Twitch channel.

968
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,840
Start me up.

969
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,840
The first 2,000 account holders to order the Tony Hawk burrito

970
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,840
on the Chipotle mobile app or at order.chipotle.com

971
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,840
will receive a code to the email associated with the account,

972
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,840
allowing the recipient to access a demo version of the relaunch

973
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,840
of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater TM 1, TM, and 2 TM video game,

974
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,840
ESRB rated T for team.

975
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,840
Cool.

976
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,840
I think they do a cuss in Superman by Goldfinger,

977
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,840
so that's why it's not E for everyone.

978
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,840
Here's the problem.

979
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,840
I want to order this to get the code.

980
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,840
I want to play the game.

981
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,840
I don't want to go pick up a burrito.

982
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,840
I'm recording a podcast,

983
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,840
and I really don't want my wife to answer the door

984
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,840
and a man in a mask says, here's Tony Hawk's burrito.

985
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,840
Yeah.

986
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,840
That's going to be hard for her to parse.

987
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,840
Unless it is the Birdman himself.

988
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,840
Or a Birdman.

989
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,840
Or a Birdman's hand.

990
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,840
Squid, enjoy your remastered skateboarding game.

991
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,840
My wife is a big fan of Michael Keaton,

992
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,840
so she might enjoy that actually.

993
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,840
Just a joke.

994
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,840
No, the movie had him in it.

995
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,840
Yeah, it's just a fun...

996
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,840
It's just a fun goof, the just ones do.

997
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,840
Just a goof.

998
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,840
I recently decided to shed my hoarder lifestyle

999
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,840
and embrace a more minimalistic approach.

1000
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,840
It's been going well so far.

1001
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,840
I threw away all my hats.

1002
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,840
One problem though.

1003
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,840
What do I do with the yearbooks?

1004
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,840
I have one for each year, K through 12,

1005
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,840
and I never look at them.

1006
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,840
Donating seems weird,

1007
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,840
since it's such a weirdly personal item.

1008
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,840
My name is usually pinned with the inside cover messages

1009
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,840
from classmates, et cetera.

1010
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,840
But it also seems wrong to just throw them away.

1011
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,840
Am I doomed to carry them forever?

1012
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,840
That's from yearbook yeeter.

1013
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,840
I mean, you could keep them in your basement in Chicago,

1014
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,840
and then a fateful flood will take care of it for you

1015
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,840
like I did.

1016
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,840
That fateful flood, boy.

1017
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,840
I was traveling around with a huge cardboard box

1018
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,840
full of keepsakes,

1019
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:43,840
and then I had two paper Trader Joe's bags

1020
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:48,840
full of things like yearbooks and the like.

1021
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,840
And that great flood, ooh.

1022
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,840
The great flood of 2010 done took care of most of them for me.

1023
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,840
And it was rough for a while.

1024
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,840
I still get sad to think about the things that I lost in there.

1025
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,840
But whenever I move, wicked easy, wicked fast.

1026
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:07,840
So I think that yearbooks fall under the category of things

1027
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,840
that you keep because you convince yourself that someday

1028
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,840
someone else will want to know that thing about you.

1029
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,840
I think about this now with two kids that hypothetically

1030
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,840
someday my kids will be in high school, and they're like,

1031
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,840
I want to see daddy in high school.

1032
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,840
But let's be honest, that's not going to happen.

1033
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,840
I'm going to keep them long enough to show them to them,

1034
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,840
and then they're going to be like, okay, I don't care.

1035
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,840
We're all flying around in jetpacks and hover dogs now and shit.

1036
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,840
What do I give two shits about the fact that you were in some club

1037
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,840
in high school?

1038
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,840
And so now it's just like, well, now I've lugged this around forever.

1039
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,840
Hey, what if we, and I'm just going to throw this out,

1040
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,840
and I'm going to disrupt the whole yearbook industry.

1041
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,840
Well, careful, Travis.

1042
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,840
Are you thinking about what that would do?

1043
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,840
Digital yearbooks.

1044
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,840
Whoa.

1045
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,840
That's it.

1046
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,840
Okay.

1047
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,840
Wow.

1048
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,840
Yeah, I imagine they're already doing that.

1049
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,840
Probably.

1050
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,840
It seems like it's happening already.

1051
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,840
But if not, TM, TM, TM.

1052
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,840
Justin's got that cloud tech.

1053
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,840
That's on the next level.

1054
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,840
I actually don't have any cloud tech.

1055
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,840
I'm sorry.

1056
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,840
No, no, no, Justin.

1057
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,840
It's the Jostens.

1058
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,840
Yeah, I heard you.

1059
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,840
I just don't have any cloud tech.

1060
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,840
No, not Justin.

1061
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,840
It's Justin and Travis and Griffin.

1062
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,840
My brother.

1063
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,840
My brother and Mar.

1064
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,840
Oh, hi, Justin.

1065
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:29,840
Here, flood notwithstanding,

1066
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:35,840
I a couple times had to pare down my collection of keepsakes

1067
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,840
because I feel like there is a...

1068
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:43,840
I feel like actually the yearbook is one of the best sort of nostalgia

1069
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:48,840
per square inch that you can possibly keep around, right?

1070
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,840
If you're going to toss all your other keepsakes or whatever,

1071
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:58,840
I feel like the yearbook is literally a bunch of literal paper-thin

1072
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,840
old nostalgia drops.

1073
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,840
The few that survived that fateful flood,

1074
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,840
I have enjoyed looking back on every two years or so.

1075
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:14,840
Could you go through and just remove the pages

1076
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,840
that have nothing to do with you?

1077
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,840
That's great.

1078
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,840
I love that.

1079
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,840
And then combine all of them, all your yearbooks,

1080
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:26,840
into one long school book that includes all the years,

1081
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,840
but only the ones that pertain to you.

1082
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,840
If you're in 12th grade,

1083
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,840
do you care about the kids who are in 9th grade?

1084
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,840
No?

1085
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,840
No, you don't know them.

1086
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,840
Cut them out.

1087
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,840
You can go through all your photos and photo albums too

1088
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:48,840
and just tear apart the ones that you're not really a featured player in.

1089
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,840
And then go through all the books you own.

1090
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:55,840
And if the author wasn't nice enough to include you in that book,

1091
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,840
why would I read a book I'm not in?

1092
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,840
Maybe you go through your yearbook, you touch each kid's face,

1093
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,840
and you think, does this face spark joy in me?

1094
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,840
And if not, you burn it out with a cigarette.

1095
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,840
One by one.

1096
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,840
It's totally normal.

1097
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,840
It's just a totally cool thing to do that everyone does.

1098
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,840
And you mark their name off a big list.

1099
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,840
You don't burn each photo twice over the eyes.

1100
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,840
That would be fucking wild.

1101
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:26,840
One cigarette burn in the middle of the face, and then you move on.

1102
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,840
Now, you will want to try to make sure the kid behind that kid

1103
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,840
on the other page you also don't like.

1104
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,840
That is the one thing.

1105
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,840
Can I change the subject briefly?

1106
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,840
Okay.

1107
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,840
This is the shit that drives me crazy,

1108
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,840
is these brands put out these deals, and then they're like,

1109
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,840
if you actually try to do it, you can't.

1110
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,840
It's like they don't ever expect you to actually do the dumb thing

1111
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,840
they said to do, right?

1112
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,840
So I go to order.chibotle.com or whatever the fuck,

1113
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,840
and I'm like, let me get that Tony Hawk burrito.

1114
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,840
And it is not listed anywhere on the page.

1115
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,840
I know the ingredients of it.

1116
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,840
I'm wondering if it's like a code

1117
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,840
where I have to put in the right ingredients.

1118
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,840
You know what I mean?

1119
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,840
And then it'll just...

1120
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,840
Didn't you say that they announced it today,

1121
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,840
but the press release said August 14th?

1122
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,840
No, that's when it culminates with Finn Wolfhard

1123
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,840
playing Tony Hawk against Tony Hawk.

1124
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,840
Oh, right, right, right.

1125
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,840
I'm sorry.

1126
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,840
I'm going to try...

1127
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,840
If you guys are okay with this, we don't normally do this,

1128
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,840
but I'm going to try to call my local Chipotle.

1129
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,840
Okay, but don't put him on speaker.

1130
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,840
I'm not going to put him on speaker, Finn.

1131
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,840
I'm just going to call my local Chipotle.

1132
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,840
Okay.

1133
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,840
And you guys will just hear my part of it.

1134
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,840
Okay.

1135
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,840
So you won't hear them.

1136
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,840
Justin's really good on the phone.

1137
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,840
I wish I was as good as Justin on the phone.

1138
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,840
Please don't take me out.

1139
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,840
Okay.

1140
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,840
So strong and confident voice.

1141
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,840
There's a voicemail message.

1142
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,840
If you're calling about the Tony Hawk burrito, press nine.

1143
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:58,840
They're talking about the dining room precautions they've taken.

1144
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,840
That's good.

1145
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,840
I like that.

1146
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,840
Just can't help but eat inside Chipotle.

1147
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:04,840
Yes.

1148
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,840
Do you like extreme burrito experience?

1149
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,840
Yes.

1150
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,840
Do you like mostly fresh ingredients?

1151
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,840
Were you fucking in Stranger Thing?

1152
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:22,840
Do you think you could totally pwn Tony Hawk in his game?

1153
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,840
Hey, Tony Hawk is doing a Chipotle promotion

1154
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,840
where if you order a special Tony Hawk burrito,

1155
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,840
you get a demo of the game.

1156
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,840
They said you have to do it online

1157
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,840
after the first 2,000 people.

1158
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,840
So I feel like the clock's kind of ticking on me

1159
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,840
and I can't find a way to order the Tony Hawk burrito.

1160
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,840
Do you know anything about it

1161
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:45,840
or do I sound like an absolute lunatic to you right now?

1162
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,840
Yes, it's Justin.

1163
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:53,840
Hey, how's it going?

1164
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,840
I'm pretty good.

1165
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,840
Hold on.

1166
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,840
Okay.

1167
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,840
I'm recording our episode of My Brother, My Brother and Me right now.

1168
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:05,840
Can I put you on speaker real quick?

1169
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:06,840
Okay, great.

1170
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,840
Hold on one second.

1171
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,840
Okay, what was your name again, please?

1172
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,840
It's Haley.

1173
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,840
Haley.

1174
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:19,840
So have you heard about this Tony Hawk burrito?

1175
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,840
No, I haven't.

1176
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,840
Okay, I'm not making this up

1177
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,840
and you knew me from sound,

1178
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,840
so I'm imagining you know I'm not making it up too.

1179
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,840
No, not at all.

1180
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,840
Yeah, this is a thing that's happening,

1181
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,840
but corporate has not communicated to you

1182
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,840
that this is a thing that is going on, correct?

1183
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,840
No.

1184
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,840
Okay, so don't you think it's kind of shitty to be like –

1185
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,840
no, I'm not going to ask you to say something Chipotle is doing is shitty

1186
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,840
because that's your employer

1187
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,840
and I don't want to mess up your whole situation there.

1188
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,840
But –

1189
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:53,840
It's not shitty.

1190
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,840
What?

1191
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,840
I don't know.

1192
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,840
No, it's just really shitty.

1193
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:01,840
Haley, you don't have to take fucking swings at Chipotle

1194
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,840
for our benefit.

1195
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,840
It's awful.

1196
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,840
Okay, Haley, stop.

1197
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,840
Stop it.

1198
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,840
You're going to get yourself in trouble.

1199
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:16,840
I'm just saying that I just think it kind of stinks that Chipotle is doing this

1200
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,840
and I would like to –

1201
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,840
if you hear –

1202
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,840
and you definitely have not heard anything about a Tony Hawk burrito.

1203
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,840
Is that correct?

1204
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,840
Okay.

1205
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:29,840
Well, Chipotle, Haley, thank you so much.

1206
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,840
This is my brothers Travis and Griffin.

1207
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:31,840
They're on the line too.

1208
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,840
Hi.

1209
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,840
Hi.

1210
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,840
Sorry he just called you Chipotle Haley.

1211
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,840
Well, I mean, she's a –

1212
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,840
Haley, I'm sorry if I get you in trouble with Chipotle.

1213
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,840
We can offer you a position at the McElroy franchise

1214
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,840
if something like that happens or maybe we can try to buy that Chipotle.

1215
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,840
Oh, Haley, do you know anything about the VIP membership

1216
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,840
that you can get at Chipotle if you're a celebrity?

1217
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:56,840
Tony Hawk has it and I was just wondering if you had a form somewhere.

1218
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,840
I don't have it, but I can ask.

1219
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,840
Okay.

1220
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,840
That's okay.

1221
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,840
I don't want you to take up any more of your valuable time.

1222
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,840
Thank you so much, Haley.

1223
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,840
I appreciate it.

1224
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,840
Okay.

1225
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,840
I appreciate you.

1226
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,840
Have a great day.

1227
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,840
All right.

1228
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,840
Have fun.

1229
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,840
Bye.

1230
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,840
Bye.

1231
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,840
Okay.

1232
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
Clearly, Haley wasn't telling us everything.

1233
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,840
No.

1234
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:15,840
I mean –

1235
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:16,840
Yeah.

1236
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,840
Haley is definitely holding out.

1237
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,840
We're all –

1238
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,840
Yeah.

1239
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,840
I'm sorry, Haley.

1240
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,840
I hate to be the one last but clearly Haley knows more than they're telling us.

1241
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,840
I think Haley was busy either creating or eating

1242
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,840
or selling one of the last few Tony Hawk burritos

1243
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,840
and she also like definitely, definitely has gotten people into the VIP freebie club.

1244
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,840
Yeah.

1245
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,840
For sure.

1246
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,840
For sure.

1247
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,840
Yeah.

1248
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,840
For sure.

1249
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,840
For sure, for sure, for sure, for sure.

1250
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,840
But boy, we really can't do that anymore, huh?

1251
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,840
No.

1252
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,840
Especially you, Justin.

1253
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,840
I feel like you cannot call local places anymore.

1254
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,840
Oh, it's this guy.

1255
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,840
Yeah.

1256
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,840
It's this fucking –

1257
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,840
This guy.

1258
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,840
It's this fucking guy.

1259
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,840
This fucking guy.

1260
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,340
The fucking acapella guy warned me about you.

1261
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,840
You like to call fucking people on your podcast.

1262
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:54,840
Okay.

1263
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,840
Well, Haley –

1264
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,840
I feel like I could do it.

1265
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,840
My voice is just so bland and ordinary that it's hard to even pick it out.

1266
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,840
You know what I mean?

1267
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,840
Justin, are you doing okay?

1268
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:09,840
Because when she recognized who you were, I felt from, you know, however many thousand

1269
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:16,840
miles away from each other we are, like I felt your gonads go up in your body.

1270
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,840
Yeah.

1271
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1272
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,840
As a sort of fight or flight response.

1273
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,840
It was not good.

1274
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,840
It didn't feel good.

1275
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,840
I felt like I was caught doing something wrong and I wasn't actually –

1276
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,840
And you were.

1277
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,840
You were.

1278
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,840
You were doing –

1279
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,840
I never knew if they heard about the Tony operator.

1280
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,840
Yeah.

1281
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,840
For sure.

1282
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,840
For sure, for sure.

1283
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,840
For sure, for sure, for sure.

1284
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,840
For sure.

1285
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,440
I forget what we were talking about, but I can't talk about anything else.

1286
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,440
I need to go lie down.

1287
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,900
Yeah, this is quite a thing.

1288
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,320
Thank you so much to everybody for listening to our podcast.

1289
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,320
We love you very much.

1290
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,320
Thank you to Haley.

1291
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:52,840
We'll be checking in with you periodically to make sure –

1292
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:58,040
Oh, and by the way, Chipotle, obviously, if anything happens to Haley as a result of

1293
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,240
her participation in this, we are coming for you.

1294
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,240
And you will not enjoy it.

1295
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,240
Oh, holy shit.

1296
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,240
This is not an idle threat.

1297
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,120
We have a certain set of skills.

1298
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,280
We have a certain set of skills.

1299
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,280
Hey, you know what?

1300
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:15,840
I can actually, in this exact situation, in this exact situation, I can say with a straight

1301
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,040
face that I do have a particular set of skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.

1302
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:24,360
If there's one thing the McElroy brothers are known for, it's weaponizing our audience

1303
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:29,240
to annoy big corporations into letting us do stuff.

1304
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,440
We've only used that power to create before.

1305
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,680
I'm kind of curious what it would feel like to destroy.

1306
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:43,120
Big news today, Chipotle was destroyed from the inside out by three weirdos.

1307
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:46,880
All right.

1308
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,940
Thanks again, by the way, for supporting us in the Max Fun Drive.

1309
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:55,280
It really is very kind of you, and we couldn't do this without you all.

1310
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,840
It's just very touching every year, honestly.

1311
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:02,560
I keep waiting for the year when it's zero and everybody wises up, but thank God it wasn't

1312
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,640
this year.

1313
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,640
There will come a point, right?

1314
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,720
Just law of averages, there will come a point when people are like, I think we've given

1315
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,720
enough.

1316
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,720
I think we've done enough.

1317
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,720
That's it.

1318
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,440
We're doing well here.

1319
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,400
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure.

1320
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,560
Off the album, putting the days to bed, been going long and strong with that jam and keeping

1321
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,520
that wax spinning all summer long.

1322
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,160
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo for us?

1323
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,160
I do, I do.

1324
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,360
Thank you to Max Fun, by the way, for having us on the network.

1325
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,160
A few people sent this in.

1326
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,160
Thank you.

1327
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:41,000
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user, who I'm going to call Kelly, asks, in all caps,

1328
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,840
with many exclamation points and question marks, does kissing your cat count as a first

1329
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,840
kiss?

1330
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,840
Oh, no.

1331
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,840
It was an accident.

1332
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,840
It was an accidental kiss.

1333
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,840
That's what the details say.

1334
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,840
I'm not going to read it.

1335
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,840
My name is Justin McElroy.

1336
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:56,840
I'm Travis McElroy.

1337
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,840
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1338
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,840
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1339
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,840
Kiss your dad.

1340
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:24,240
Square on the lips.
