1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,740
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me and my show for the modren era

9
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,540
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. Hello booze and ghouls and

10
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:28,260
Non-boonary folk. I'm your middle this brother Travis were wolf wolf

11
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,580
McElroy, it's ah, it's ah, it's early August

12
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:45,740
No, let Griffin do his so I can ignore yours and this is Griffin and this and this is Griffin McElroy

13
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,740
There's a chill in the air

14
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,740
The leaves are turning

15
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,740
I had a silly dentist thing happen

16
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,740
From orange and brown and yellow

17
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,740
I can't I can't

18
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,740
There's a chill things are getting spooky

19
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,740
We're all already unhinged for time you cannot do this

20
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:15,740
I went to the home goods store to buy a picture frame and they had Halloween pillows for sale

21
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,740
Okay, so that's it that means that's the starting gun

22
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,740
The season has begun

23
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,740
They had ceramic pumpkins

24
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,740
It's it's actually gang it is July the 29th as we're required

25
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,740
Yeah, spooky season

26
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,740
When the ghosts come out to play

27
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,740
The ghosts won't be out Traff for three more entire earth months

28
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,740
The ghosts are on the beach

29
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,740
My local home goods had Salvatore Ferragamo Uomo fragrance on clearance

30
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,740
That don't make it fall. That's obviously an autumnal scent

31
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,740
Right

32
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,740
Don't make it fall

33
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,740
It's spooky season

34
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,740
It's absolutely not

35
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:07,740
I got one brother who is who's turned into a vampire skeleton only bones

36
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,740
And then I have and then I have another brother that's trying to backdoor Richard Stink in here in this in this Halloween

37
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,740
No, no, here's here's what you're fucking with

38
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,740
Yeah, this is why this is why

39
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,740
This is what's up Travis

40
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,740
This is why I sampled it. This is why I sampled it

41
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,740
Richard Stink comes out four times a year at the beginning of every season

42
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,740
And then my brother is telling me that it is the spooky season upon us

43
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,740
Then Richard Stink comes out

44
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:41,740
Now if he's gonna obey the Gregorian calendar of our ancestors, maybe you've heard of it, you know

45
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,740
That's up to Richard to decide

46
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,740
That same fucking calendar by the way that says that September 13th is summer

47
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,740
It's not

48
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:57,740
It's not, you joke, just like July 29th is spooky season

49
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,740
This is lose, lose, lose, lose, lose for me

50
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:07,740
Have you decided on your Halloween costumes?

51
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,740
Um

52
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,740
What will you be doing to celebrate Samhain?

53
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,740
I think we've let enough of this go I need to say something

54
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,740
Don't let a black cat cross your path

55
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,740
Fire skeleton only bones Travis can you just hold on for a second so Justin can say a thing

56
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,740
It's just like really important

57
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,740
Okay

58
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:35,740
I wanted to say if you all were listening to episode 566 of My Brother My Brother and Me

59
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,740
You may have heard me talk about some new Kraft Dinner flavor boosts

60
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,740
Oh my god

61
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:53,740
And I may have said something ill-advised at the end of that episode that I didn't really think through

62
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,740
Briefly this is what I said

63
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,740
If you're in Canada I need you to get as much that fucking Jesus you can just ruin my box

64
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,740
Ruin my box with KD okay? Hey ruin my box with KD

65
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,740
Get all that weird KD and ruin my box

66
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,740
So that's what I said and I kinda forgot I said it until this week

67
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:25,740
When I went to the post office and my friendly post office people were

68
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,740
I'll go ahead and say it not thrilled to see

69
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,740
How flavor blasted was your box?

70
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:39,740
They saw me and one of the dudes walked out of the room as soon as I walked in

71
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:45,740
And I walked to the other dude and I was like box 54 please and he's like oh yeah he's going to go get it

72
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,740
On site they know you on site

73
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,740
They had one of those don't let this shoplifter in photos on the wall

74
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,740
But it was like give this man his cheesy box as quick as you can

75
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,740
Get this cheese out of here

76
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:09,740
And these dudes start piling up boxes and all of them have that distinctive Canada post thing

77
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,740
And I will admit I did have a fleeting moment where I was like whoa a lot of fan mail this week

78
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,740
Guess the J man's back

79
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:25,740
It requires a certain amount of effort to send you macaroni and cheese flavor addition mix ins

80
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,740
That belies an amount of fandom that is staggering

81
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:37,740
I also imagine Justin that there were a lot of tariffs on the postage was probably high

82
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,740
Yeah so let's talk about that aspect of it for a second okay

83
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:47,740
Canada I'm just going to talk to Canada for a second Canada

84
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,740
Should we leave?

85
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,740
No no you guys can be here and you can listen because I want there to be a witness

86
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,740
Oh we're like ambassadors we have diplomatic community

87
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,740
Exactly

88
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:03,740
I asked you to send me all the weird KD and I was not specific enough I am sorry about that

89
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:11,740
You all sent me approximately by my count 83 different packets of flavor boosting

90
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,740
Are you kidding me?

91
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,740
83 different packets of flavor boosting

92
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,740
But Canada you sent me 109 boxes of mac and cheese

93
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,740
Now listen it's the same mac and cheese

94
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,740
Well well well hold on

95
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,740
KD and mac and cheese are the same product

96
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,740
But you don't know the consistency 100% I do

97
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,740
How do you know?

98
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,740
Nobody knows it but actually Travis I would say I Justin McElroy at this point in my life

99
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:47,740
Am uniquely positioned to say that these are the same products

100
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,740
But molecularly I'm saying that what you've got is Canadian cheese dust versus American cheese dust

101
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,740
You can't tell me it's the same cheese dust at a molecular level

102
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,740
You are an infant tickling yourself with a razor

103
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,740
You are speaking to the world's preeminent cheese dust scholar

104
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,740
You don't think I've had cheese dust in my life?

105
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,740
Travis

106
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,740
You don't think I've flavor blasted some nudes?

107
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,740
Travis

108
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,740
What?

109
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,740
Travis

110
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,740
But I also have been shipped

111
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,740
What I'm saying is I've been shipped 109 boxes of Canadian mac and cheese

112
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,740
And I've eaten enough

113
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,740
It's the same

114
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,740
Travis

115
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,740
You've only had these for about a week Justin

116
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,740
How much have you consumed with your human form?

117
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,740
Travis

118
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,740
Here's the thing though

119
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,740
This is not going to waste

120
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:49,740
We are sending around 100 boxes of Kraft Dinner to Harmony House

121
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,740
Travis

122
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,740
They're going to think you're an extreme couponer

123
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,740
Travis

124
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,740
Well the people who are experiencing homelessness currently want to flavor blast

125
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,740
That is up to them

126
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,740
They will get some packets no doubt

127
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,740
So the food will not go to waste

128
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,740
I did make a couple of these to go ahead and sample them

129
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,740
Travis

130
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,740
I'm curious about

131
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,740
Travis

132
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,740
Is it the cotton candy?

133
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,740
Travis

134
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,740
It is the cotton candy

135
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,740
Travis

136
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,740
I bet it fucks

137
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,740
Travis

138
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,740
We've had some different reactions

139
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Travis

140
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,740
I bet Charlie loves it

141
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,740
Travis

142
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,740
I bet Sydney wanted to vomit

143
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,740
Travis

144
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,740
Yeah

145
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,740
Travis

146
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,740
Loved it?

147
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,740
Travis

148
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,740
Yeah, but it's great

149
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,740
Travis

150
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,740
It works in the same way as

151
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,740
Travis

152
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,740
Don't think of it as cotton candy and cheese

153
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,740
Travis

154
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,740
Because neither of those things are present

155
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,740
Travis

156
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,740
It's a new flavor in your ear

157
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,740
Travis

158
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,740
It's actually like Danish

159
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,740
Travis

160
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,740
Think of it more like

161
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,740
Travis

162
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,740
The flavor of

163
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,740
Travis

164
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,740
The flavor of Papa's beard is not very pricey

165
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,740
Travis

166
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,740
Yeah, they call it Papa's beard

167
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,740
Travis

168
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,740
That's why they call it cotton candy

169
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,740
Travis

170
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,740
Because it's like God's beard

171
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,740
Travis

172
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,740
That idea

173
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,740
If you can wrap your brain around that idea

174
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,740
It's sort of like that

175
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,740
Travis

176
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,740
Or like a cheese and apple pie that I learned about from pushing daisies

177
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,740
Travis

178
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,740
The only one that I know that only John Joy didn't like it

179
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,740
Travis

180
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,740
The fifth member of your family is where the differing opinion came in

181
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,740
I'm sorry, I forgot about your son, John Joy

182
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,740
Grown adult man who I believe is older than you

183
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,740
Travis

184
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,740
John Joy is a fellow West Virginia podcaster

185
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
Host of Professor Theo's Mystery Lab

186
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,740
Travis

187
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,740
You're going to love these stories

188
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,740
Travis

189
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,740
But he's a hater of this great mac and cheese product

190
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,740
Travis

191
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,740
He took one bite and this is his entire reaction

192
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,740
Travis

193
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,740
No

194
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,740
Travis

195
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,740
That's his review

196
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,740
Travis

197
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
That's his review

198
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,740
Travis

199
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,740
He can't go into it with an open mind

200
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,740
Travis

201
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,740
The ghost pepper is a threat

202
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,740
There's three other spicy

203
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,740
And spicy with mac and cheese is pretty good

204
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,740
Even the butter chicken had a nice amount of spice

205
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,740
Travis

206
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,740
That sounds good to me

207
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,740
Travis

208
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,740
The one that was rough was poutine

209
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,740
Travis

210
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,740
Really?

211
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,740
Travis

212
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,740
It tastes so much like gravy

213
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,740
Travis

214
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,740
I use the mac and cheese

215
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
You guys know about how to make

216
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,740
I call it der bad mac and cheese

217
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,740
But you guys know about this, right?

218
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,740
Travis

219
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,740
I can't say that I do

220
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,740
Travis

221
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,740
I'm going to tell you this, give me one second

222
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,740
Travis

223
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,740
Are you googling a macaroni and a Kraft dinner recipe?

224
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,740
Travis

225
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,740
It is not my recipe

226
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,740
It's God's recipe

227
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,740
Travis

228
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,740
It's God's conduit

229
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,740
Travis

230
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
It's not my recipe

231
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,740
Travis

232
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,740
So I need a second

233
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,740
Travis

234
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,740
Can I guess whose it is?

235
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,740
Is it Guy Fieri?

236
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,740
Travis

237
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,740
No, it's not Guy Fieri

238
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,740
Travis

239
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,740
When it's called dirtbag something, he has trashcan nachos

240
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,740
Travis

241
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,740
I call it dirtbag

242
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,740
Travis

243
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,740
This method is actually by a guy named Brian Floyd

244
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,740
Travis

245
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,740
Thank you Brian

246
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Travis

247
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,740
We should point out that it took Justin about 7 minutes to find this

248
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,740
Travis

249
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,740
Once you learn this method, you never need to refer to it again

250
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,740
Travis

251
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,740
Listen

252
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,740
You dump into a saucepan

253
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,740
The mac

254
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,740
The cheese

255
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,740
A cup of water

256
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,740
Some butter

257
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,740
And then you just cook on medium till done

258
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,740
Travis

259
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,740
Why is that dirty?

260
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,740
Travis

261
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,740
Better, faster, more delicious

262
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,740
Travis

263
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,740
A little bit of al dente in there

264
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,740
Travis

265
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,740
Yep, you've been wasting your time with your 6 cups of water

266
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,740
You're straining

267
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,740
All of it is a waste of time

268
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,740
You dump it all in the pan at once and then you wait a few minutes and mac and cheese

269
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,740
Travis

270
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,740
That's a great method and I don't want to belittle Dr. Floyd's work

271
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,740
Travis

272
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,740
Well

273
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,740
Travis

274
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,740
When you call something dirtbag, I thought you were going to crush up some Doritos in there

275
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,740
Make it with Mountain Dew or some shit

276
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,740
We're from West Virginia

277
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,740
You can't say dirtbag

278
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,740
And I'm supposed to think it just means a little bit lazy or simple

279
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,740
Travis

280
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,740
That you put milk in it also

281
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,740
Travis

282
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,740
It's great

283
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,740
Travis

284
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,740
Do you think that you could just

285
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,740
Make some artisanal cotton candy

286
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,740
Where you actually go to the state fair, get some cotton candy

287
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,740
Put that bad boy right in there

288
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,740
Travis

289
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,740
Yeah, maybe

290
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,740
Except I didn't even ask

291
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,740
Is there a color element to the cotton candy mix?

292
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,740
Travis

293
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,740
Oh, bud

294
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,740
Are you kidding me?

295
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,740
Travis

296
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,740
Let me see what color maul is

297
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,740
Travis

298
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,740
It looks like Kirby's fucking

299
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,740
Travis

300
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,740
It's wild

301
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,740
Travis

302
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,740
Yeah, it looks like Kirby's balls

303
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,740
Travis

304
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,740
Anyway, as you certainly gather, this is an advice show

305
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,740
Where we take your questions and turn them out into wisdom

306
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,740
And here we go

307
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,740
An aspect of my job involves collecting groundwater samples

308
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,740
Which need to be kept on ice

309
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,740
I usually buy ice a few times a month

310
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,740
From gas stations, liquor stores, etc

311
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,740
At the end of each month

312
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,740
I submit an expense report

313
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,740
With receipts for the ice to collect my cash

314
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,740
The other week it was incredibly hot

315
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,740
But when I went to a nearby gas station to buy ice

316
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,740
I walked past the ice cream chest

317
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,740
And grabbed a Minion popsicle

318
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,740
Normally, I would buy personal items

319
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,740
Separately, but the line

320
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,740
Was long and I panicked

321
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,740
Is it acceptable for me to submit the receipt

322
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,740
With the Minion popsicle on it

323
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,740
Or am I out $2.49

324
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,740
Travis

325
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,740
Wait, that's from Minion popsicle debacle

326
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,740
If it had been like

327
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,740
If it had been like

328
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,740
Some kind of drink, any kind of drink

329
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,740
Travis A pack of lifesavers

330
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,740
If it had been anything

331
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,740
But, fucking, the auditor

332
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,740
Scanning your receipts

333
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,740
Sees Minion popsicle

334
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,740
In all bold

335
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,740
And you can't say I needed it

336
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,740
Travis You all got it twisted

337
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,740
Yeah, you can

338
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,740
How? If they question you on it

339
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,740
Travis And they will

340
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,740
Travis They were out of ice

341
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,740
I needed anything else frozen

342
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,740
Travis So to preserve these scientific

343
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,740
Samples

344
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,740
Travis You jammed, there was like one

345
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,740
Little bit of space

346
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,740
With no ice, and you had to just slide

347
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,740
A popsicle right in there, they can never

348
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,740
Prove otherwise

349
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,740
Travis But then they can trap you like, oh, well how did it taste

350
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,740
You'd be like, it was a Minion popsicle dude, it was delicious

351
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,740
And they'd be like, got you

352
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,740
Damn it Travis It tasted like banana

353
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,740
Honestly, ironically

354
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,740
Maybe on purpose, it tasted like banana

355
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,740
It was great

356
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,740
Maybe you could say, well here's the weird thing

357
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,740
They wouldn't sell me the ice

358
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,740
Unless I bought the popsicle

359
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,740
It was a

360
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,740
Here's what you're saying

361
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,740
Yeah, it was a buy ice

362
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,740
Get popsicle free thing, not according to this receipt

363
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,740
Those motherfuckers Travis They fucking got me

364
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,740
Travis This is

365
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,740
Hey, Joan, this is how they get you, right?

366
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,740
Am I right? Joan pounded

367
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,740
Because we're in this thing together

368
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,740
No one's calling the police today

369
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,740
Right Joan? Pound it

370
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,740
Hey Joan, can you pound it real quick?

371
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,740
None of us have to go to, we're not going to

372
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,740
Debtors prison

373
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,740
When you go to Joan to get reimbursed

374
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,740
Joan's gonna look at the receipt and be like, I don't know

375
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,740
And then you're gonna pull out a second

376
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,740
Minion popsicle and say, do you wanna get your beat

377
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,740
Wet Joan?

378
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,740
Joan, I got a taste for you

379
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,740
Hey Joan, we can make this work, you and me

380
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,740
We're in this together, Minion popsicles

381
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,740
As much as we want

382
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,740
I never ate that Minion popsicle

383
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,740
Oh yeah Joan?

384
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,740
And then you just dump the popsicle part in the trash

385
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,740
And throw the stick at her, prove it

386
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,740
I got a text message here Joan

387
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,740
That looks like you told me to buy the popsicle for you

388
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,740
What? That's from your dad

389
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,740
Yeah, that's what I call you Joan

390
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,740
How could you bring your dad into it Joan?

391
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,740
How could you do this?

392
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,740
You made my dad an accessory

393
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,740
To your embezzlement?

394
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,740
How could you Joan?

395
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,740
There's not a job

396
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,740
On this planet

397
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,740
And I'm including this job

398
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,740
If any

399
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,740
Self-respecting human being can call

400
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,740
What we do that

401
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,740
Where if things aren't

402
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,740
At least a little bit

403
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,740
Shitty enough for you to feel

404
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,740
Okay about stealing a popsicle

405
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,740
From the man

406
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,740
You know what I mean?

407
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,740
I love this work, working with YouTube boys

408
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,740
And I know we gotta balance those books

409
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,740
Because we're family, and you don't fuck around with that

410
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,740
But if I do have the opportunity to steal

411
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,740
A minion's popsicle from

412
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,740
Our bottom dime

413
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,740
I would do it

414
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,740
Even though I love this

415
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,740
If I find out

416
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,740
That you've been getting

417
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,740
Minion popsicles on our dime

418
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,740
I'm afraid of you, I'm sorry

419
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,740
I'm so sorry, so sorry Griffin

420
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,740
Juice, how's the Fredo flavor boost

421
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,740
For the KD dinner?

422
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,740
I haven't tried that one yet

423
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,740
Just because it doesn't exist

424
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,740
Charlie's obsessed

425
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,740
With watching this dude on YouTube

426
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,740
Whose whole thing is perfect popsicles

427
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,740
Have you seen this guy?

428
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,740
He just goes around buying up all the minion popsicles

429
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,740
And all the SpongeBob popsicles

430
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,740
And he's trying to find perfect ones that actually look like the packaging

431
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,740
So it is his

432
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,740
Maybe you could be like

433
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,740
It was a collab

434
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,740
You're trying to sell Joan on it

435
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,740
Like you wanted to get into TikTok

436
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,740
Oh here's what you say, Joan

437
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,740
There was a hot bird outside

438
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,740
And the bird was overheated

439
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,740
That bird was looking at me

440
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,740
I came back out and I had a little water bottle

441
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,740
And it went, no! Minion!

442
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,740
And I was like

443
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,740
What?

444
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,740
And I had to buy a minion popsicle, Joan

445
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,740
Give me cold

446
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,740
Give me minion, minion

447
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,740
You get the

448
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,740
I think you have to report this

449
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,740
Because the

450
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,740
Worst case scenario

451
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,740
Is no one notices

452
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,740
And then the next time you're at the store

453
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,740
You think, well maybe I love two minion popsicles

454
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,740
Slippery, sticky, slow

455
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,740
And then you think

456
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,740
Maybe I'd like

457
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,740
Three minion popsicles

458
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,740
Fast forward six months

459
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,740
You're getting eight minion popsicles

460
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,740
And you're throwing half of them away

461
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,740
You just want to feel

462
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,740
Who knows where this stops, ten?

463
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,740
No

464
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,740
Not until you're fully the grew

465
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,740
Of popsicles

466
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,740
No

467
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,740
A full blown mini ice cream?

468
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,740
Ugh

469
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,740
Come on, man

470
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,740
Come on, here's what you do

471
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,740
You throw yourself at the mercy of the court

472
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,740
You go to the highest boss

473
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,740
You can find

474
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,740
You fall on your knees, you tear your shirt

475
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,740
You cry, you pull your hair out

476
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,740
And you confess in as

477
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,740
Dramatic terms as you can

478
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,740
And you beg for forgiveness

479
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,740
And I guarantee you

480
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,740
The next eight times

481
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,740
They're not going to check your receipts

482
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,740
No way

483
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,740
You can put anything on there

484
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,740
They don't want you to apologize to them anymore

485
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,740
It was really uncomfortable

486
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,740
I think I'm becoming more

487
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,740
And more

488
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,740
Dead set on you just looking them in the eyes

489
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,740
And saying, it's different ice

490
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,740
Yeah

491
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,740
It's just different ice

492
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,740
And in many ways better ice, really

493
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,740
It's boutique ice

494
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,740
It's gross ass water I had to get from

495
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,740
The mud

496
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,740
Excuse me, cause I thought that I could

497
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,740
You said buy ice

498
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,740
And this is ice

499
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,740
Part of my job is going to a liquor store

500
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,740
I bought a minion popsicle

501
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,740
Are you going to judge me for the minion popsicle?

502
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,740
Do you know how much worse this could be?

503
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,740
I could have bought 18 bottles of

504
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,740
Boons Farm, and I bought a minion

505
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,740
A $2.40

506
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,740
Jeff Bezos flew to

507
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,740
Outer space and I bought a $2.49

508
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,740
Popsicle and you're going to get mad at

509
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,740
Me, Joan? What is this?

510
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,740
Unbelievable

511
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,740
Be honest about it

512
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,740
But don't be embarrassed

513
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,740
No, just be honest

514
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,740
But not chagrined

515
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,740
Oh yeah, a sick kid wanted it

516
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,740
That's another good one

517
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,740
Yeah, that's always a great one that feels good to do

518
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,740
And joke about it

519
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,740
Hey, can we approach the wizard humbly

520
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,740
And supplicate ourselves

521
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,740
Before his throne? Yeah, I do

522
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,740
I was hoping to get some courage

523
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,740
No

524
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,740
What about, can I interest you in some

525
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,740
Snow power?

526
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,740
How about hubris?

527
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,740
No, you already have that

528
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,740
Graham Roebuck sent this one in, thank you Graham

529
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,740
This one was

530
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,740
Just updated June 1st of this year

531
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,740
So it's like, you know, it's going to mention

532
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,740
Covid, probably

533
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,740
It's called How to Appear to Have Snow Power

534
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,740
Oh, hey!

535
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,740
Snow power is a form of magic

536
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,740
A character who lives in snow encased environments

537
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,740
Might have, such as Elsa from Frozen

538
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,740
Name one more!

539
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,740
Name another!

540
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,740
The Ice King from

541
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,740
Ice Man

542
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,740
Does Ice Man from the X-Men live in a

543
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,740
Magical snow encased environment?

544
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,740
Nobody is an omega level mutant

545
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,740
I would say that this is like more

546
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,740
It's like less impressive if you

547
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,740
Live in a snow environment

548
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,740
And you have snow powers

549
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,740
And to be fair, WikiWizard

550
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,740
Elsa didn't live in a snow encased environment

551
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,740
It was summer

552
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,740
When she used her snow powers to create

553
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,740
The eternal blizzard

554
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,740
Come on

555
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,740
So here's how to convince people that you

556
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,740
Have snow powers

557
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,740
I think everybody gets it

558
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,740
One, wear gloves that have

559
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,740
Faux snow on them, that's easy

560
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
Glitter, small cotton ball puffs

561
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,740
White rolls of yarn

562
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,740
That doesn't seem convincing though

563
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,740
It's not the only fucking thing you do, Travis

564
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,740
Give me a minute

565
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,740
You can get black gloves for a dollar with snow

566
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,740
Already on them from dollar stores

567
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,740
What? I didn't know that they did that

568
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,740
America's the best country in the world

569
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,740
This is the best, you can get everything

570
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,740
Wear all blue and white

571
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,740
Yeah, that's ice and snow colors

572
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,740
You can't do orange or red or whatever

573
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,740
Also, when you make it snow, wearing a long

574
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,740
Sash on your sleeves will give it a great effect

575
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,740
If the sashes have glitter, even better

576
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,740
Or a simple necklace

577
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,740
With a sophisticated charm

578
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,740
A snowflake with a simple white beads would be nice

579
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,740
Pretty sophisticated

580
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,740
I would say that

581
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,740
I don't know if that's a sophisticated...

582
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,740
Anyway, this is where it gets really hot

583
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,740
By which I mean cold

584
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,740
Showing your snow powers, part two

585
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,740
One, act apart

586
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,740
Try to make somebody curious enough to watch you

587
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,740
Not sure what that means

588
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,740
Who said that? Me

589
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,740
If you were walking

590
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,740
Around a park

591
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,740
With your kid

592
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,740
And you saw somebody

593
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,740
Stride forward, wearing

594
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,740
Blue and white, with black gloves

595
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,740
With glitter on them, and some

596
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,740
Flowing things, and they began to

597
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,740
Sway and swirl their arms

598
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,740
You'd stop

599
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,740
You'd look

600
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,740
These next two sentences are so good

601
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,740
First of all

602
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,740
It said, use white glitter or similar items

603
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,740
To make it seem like snow

604
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,740
It might seem odd, but you could always play Christmas music

605
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,740
To set the tone if you wish

606
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,740
Jingle bells, jingle bells

607
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,740
You just threw glitter

608
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,740
On my fucking

609
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,740
Taco bell, I was gonna eat this

610
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,740
I did snow on it

611
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,740
So these two sentences

612
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,740
If using real snow, this is best done during wintertime

613
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,740
To make it more believable

614
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,740
The snow would melt in summer, excellent

615
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,740
That's excellent stuff

616
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,740
This one's dope, because I don't know what the fuck it means

617
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,740
When you're at

618
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,740
Your secret place

619
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,740
Start to play around in the snow

620
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,740
With your bare hands, if you can bare it

621
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,740
And throw it in the air

622
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,740
Do this for a few times, then look at your hands

623
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,740
Smile and get ready to do your trick

624
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,740
Oh my fuck

625
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,740
It's gotta be wintertime, because if you try to do this in summer

626
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,740
People will be like, um, excuse me

627
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,740
It's the hot season

628
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,740
And that's snow

629
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,740
I don't think so

630
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,740
You're gonna embarrass yourself

631
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,740
But more importantly, you gotta be in your secret place

632
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,740
When you're practicing this

633
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,740
Imagine

634
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,740
These two sentences, that sentence about the secret place

635
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,740
Is referring only

636
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,740
And especially to

637
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,740
Superman and the fortress of solitude

638
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,740
Yes, exactly

639
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,740
Make the snow appear to, quote, come out of your hands

640
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,740
If you have very large sleeves

641
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,740
You can try this neat trick

642
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,740
Get two small fans and secretly put them

643
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,740
Down your sleeves, get some of the faux snow

644
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,740
And put it on top of the fans, turn on the fans

645
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,740
Secretly and open your hands wide so that it goes through your fingers

646
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,740
And appears to come out of your hands

647
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,740
But hey, if you can't get the fans

648
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,740
Don't worry, just stuff some of the fake snow

649
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,740
In your sleeves and twirl around with your sleeves

650
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,740
Down, causing the snow to slip out of your sleeves

651
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,740
But this is not recommended because you'll look like

652
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,740
You're dripping wet afterwards

653
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,740
Slip snow out of your sleeves in moderation

654
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,740
But practice this for a few times

655
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,740
Before the real deal

656
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,740
In a private place

657
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,740
In your secret place

658
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,740
Practice shoving

659
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,740
White cotton that looks like snow

660
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,740
Up your sleeves and then just

661
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,740
Because you're not getting two fans

662
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,740
Up your sleeves, that's fucking ridiculous

663
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,740
So you're gonna do the other way

664
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,740
Where you just let it kind of

665
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,740
Impotently

666
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,740
Jizz out of your

667
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,740
Of your arms to the floor

668
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,740
And people are like, did you just do snow power?

669
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,740
And you say, I don't

670
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,740
I don't know, don't ask me about it

671
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,740
I'm still practicing, I gotta go to my secret place

672
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,740
This is stupid, this is supposed to be my secret place

673
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,740
I don't even know why I chose this power

674
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,740
I could have done fire power and there's a lot of things

675
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,740
You can light on fire

676
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,740
React while you're making snow

677
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,740
Always look like you're enjoying yourself

678
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,740
Laugh a lot and twirl around

679
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,740
Now, alternatively though

680
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,740
You could scream in horror at your own power

681
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,740
That now you wield without

682
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,740
Any kind of responsibility or understanding

683
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,740
That is how I think

684
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,740
It would really work in real life

685
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,740
If I suddenly started shooting

686
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,740
Snow and ice out of my hands

687
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,740
I don't think I'd be like

688
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,740
I think I'd be like, oh no

689
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,740
Why is it conceit that it's the first time it's ever happened to you though?

690
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,740
If you're convincing anyone

691
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,740
You're convincing yourself

692
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,740
True, that's the first step

693
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,740
If you're pretending to hide your snow powers

694
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,740
Do the following, after you run out of snow

695
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,740
Toss the snow on the ground in the air

696
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,740
Then seem to notice the person

697
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,740
Start to look worried, run up to the person and beg

698
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,740
Please don't tell anyone

699
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,740
And you're done

700
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,740
Oh

701
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,740
You're not quite done though

702
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,740
Because step four is try this out on your friends

703
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,740
Before doing it at a fancy dress or cosplay event

704
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,740
I like that trap

705
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,740
What would someone

706
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,740
Have to do

707
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,740
To display ice or snow powers to you

708
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,740
To me?

709
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,740
That would make you believe that they actually had

710
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,740
Ice or snow powers and weren't just faking it

711
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,740
Because I worry

712
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,740
That if we found out magic was real

713
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,740
Or if magic was real in this world

714
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,740
We would all be so skeptical

715
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,740
That no level of

716
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,740
Something would allow us to

717
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,740
Believe it was real

718
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,740
I would demonstrate for you to believe

719
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,740
If the air

720
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,740
Around this

721
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,740
This sorcerer

722
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,740
This warlock

723
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,740
Let's call Elsa what she is, a warlock

724
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,740
A dark ice patron

725
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,740
And legal with the devil

726
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,740
It might be Satan

727
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,740
If the air around them

728
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,740
Became superheated

729
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,740
As they did this

730
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,740
Thus sort of fulfilling

731
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,740
The law of thermodynamics

732
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,740
Then I might buy into this shit

733
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,740
But if somebody just starts throwing snow around

734
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,740
I'll be like, oh, where did the

735
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,740
Heat go? You know what I mean?

736
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,740
Because I got like a scientist

737
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,740
Way of looking at things sometimes

738
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,740
I always actually like that about you

739
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,740
Yeah, I love that too, very analytical

740
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah

741
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,740
A mind of sciences mind

742
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,740
So good questions on this one, but I want to just

743
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,740
Drill down on this one. Can I just say the weird thing is

744
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,740
If somebody had the ability

745
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,740
To make snow, but it only dribbled

746
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,740
Impotently from their sleeves

747
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,740
But that was how the power worked and it was actually magic

748
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,740
I would never believe them

749
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,740
And I would feel terrible

750
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,740
They'd be like, look what I can do

751
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,740
I'm like, that's just fucking, you had some snow

752
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,740
Stuff up your sleeve, I'm like, no, you don't

753
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,740
Understand, this is just how

754
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,740
It works. I think some effort

755
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,740
Would actually make me believe it a bit more if the

756
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,740
Snow just impotently dribbled out of their

757
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,740
Sleeve and they were going like

758
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,740
And I'd be like, whoa, damn, you're working really hard

759
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,740
To make that snow. That's crazy

760
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,740
You look really dehydrated, are you okay?

761
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,740
Yeah, I mean that water's gotta come from

762
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,740
Somewhere. Okay, I want to drill down on this question

763
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,740
Okay. How do I

764
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,740
Make it look like I've got more snow power?

765
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,740
Oh boy

766
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,740
This is always the fear

767
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,740
Isn't it? I mean, this is the danger that you run

768
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,740
Do something else. What?

769
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,740
Oh man

770
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,740
The community answered, try to keep some with

771
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,740
You at all times and while the person isn't looking

772
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,740
Put more in your sleeves to make it look like you

773
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,740
Have unlimited power

774
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,740
27 people found that helpful

775
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,740
60 people found that not helpful

776
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,740
Just loudly announce, now look

777
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,740
At my snow pockets and just start

778
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,740
Pulling snow out of your pockets

779
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,740
This is some snow that I made earlier with

780
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,740
Magic

781
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,740
Snow problem for

782
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,740
Me

783
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,740
That's the crowd clapping

784
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,740
At that pun. Yeah, it was good

785
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,740
You know what I think? I think we've earned

786
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,740
A trip to the money zone. Already? Just for that

787
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,740
Yeah, just with that. Shit, hold on, before

788
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,740
Wait, I gotta step on the brakes for a second because there's

789
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,740
A warning at the bottom here. I've never seen a

790
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,740
Warning on a wikiHow article before

791
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,740
And this is important, I want to cover us

792
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,740
Legally by reciting this

793
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,740
Warning. Don't

794
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,740
Make it obvious that you're faking. Be sure

795
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,740
To use good acting skills

796
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,740
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

797
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,740
Now, this is the kind of wikiHow that irritates

798
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,740
Me because now I have to go read one about

799
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,740
Good acting. I know, damn it

800
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,740
That's what Joaquin Phoenix did

801
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,740
That's it, when he got pooped on by

802
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,740
His buddy. When he really

803
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,740
Became the snoker

804
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,740
That's okay, we can go to the money zone on that

805
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,740
Yeah, now I think

806
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,740
Yeah, why so serious?

807
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,740

That's word for word

848
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,740
That was all in the copy

849
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,740
And it makes me wonder if like somebody at

850
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,740
Squarespace is like

851
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,740
Going through something

852
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,740
Like an ordeal right now

853
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,740

854
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,740
I'm glad we could be here for them

855
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,740
This is Stitch Fix

856
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,740
They send you a box full of clothes

857
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,740
And the clothes is gonna look good

858
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,740
And it's gonna fit good

859
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,740
Pants is one of the things they have in the box sometimes

860
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,740
Jacket

861
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,740
Shoes

862
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,740
Belt

863
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,740
I got a tie!

864
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,740
Yeah, fucking ties

865
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,740
And you don't need to go to the store to buy them

866
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,740
You try the tie on and they're like

867
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,740
That tie on your

868
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,740
Neck? And then you get fucking

869
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,740
Sad and you

870
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,740
Run out of the mall

871
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,740
And you get hit by a car

872
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,740
In the parking lot

873
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,740
All because you got made fun of

874
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,740

875
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,740
Neck? No way, Stitch Fix is here

876

00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,740
Is that I took all

901
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,740
Of the cushions off the couch

902
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,740
Pounded them out, put them back

Squad

913
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,740
Got a Michael Giacchino vibe here

914
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,740
And I'm taking it

915
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,740
Listen, this is the most important

916
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,740
Munch Squad that I've ever done

00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,740
And I'm trying, I want to

918
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,740
You know how before Walter Cronkite

919
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,740
Like you remember when he

920
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,740
Was about to watch them open the moon

921
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,740
Door and he was thinking like

922
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,740
I gotta say fucking something

923
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,740
You know what I mean?

924
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,740
And he said like everybody shut up, everybody shut up

925
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,740
Watch this, watch this fucking thing

926
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,740
I also

927
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,740
Wonder like if he was wondering

928
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,740
If the moon guy was going to say something

929
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,740
That he didn't want to talk over

930
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,740
You know what I mean?

931
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,740
This is like that moment

932
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,740
Popeye's launches

933
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,740
Nuggets

934
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,740
Calls for cease fire

935
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,740
In the chicken wars

936
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,740
Oh my god

937
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:01,740
Let's listen before we comment on this

938
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,740
And get too deep into it

939
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,740
Let's just listen to the

940
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,740
This is what they're going with

941
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,740
Remember what happened when we launched the chicken sandwich

942
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,740
These clips of them

943
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,740
Selling it

944
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,740
Chicken wars

945
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,740
Chicken wars

946
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,740
But now we're ending the chicken wars

947
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,740
Now the chicken wars are over

948
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,740
We come in peace

949
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,740
We come in peace

950
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,740
We come in peace

951
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,740
So what they're saying is

952
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,740
We know we walked into a room

953
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,740
And kicked over the trash can

954
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,740
And then left the room and then came back later

955
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,740
And we're like you guys

956
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,740
Nobody cleaned this up yet

957
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,740
But now we're saying

958
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,740
The chicken wars

959
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,740
Have ended

960
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,740
I will say this is

961
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,740
I'm surprised some of you

962
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,740
But I don't know a lot about war

963
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,740
And how it works and stuff

964
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,740
But can you be

965
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,740
Can you start the war

966
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,740
And now it's done

967
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,740
And be like what

968
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,740
Fine

969
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,740
You can't, no Travis

970
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,740
You can't do that

971
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,740
You can't just say

972
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,740
We did a war

973
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,740
But now we're tired of the war

974
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,740
Because we're doing the different things

975
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,740
I've played Risk enough that I don't think you could

976
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,740
You can't invade some countries

977
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,740
On Risk and then be like

978
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,740
Okay I'm done now so don't like come back at me

979
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,740
Okay

980
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,740
The launch of our chicken sandwich was incredible

981
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,740
And we're humbled by the amount of love

982
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,740
And positive reviews

983
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,740
But at the same time many claim that it started

984
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,740
The chicken wars

985
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,740
Said CMO Bruno Cardinale

986
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,740
In a statement

987
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,740
Now it's time to say goodbye to the chicken wars

988
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,740
And celebrate our new nuggets

989
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,740
Because we come in peace

990
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,740
Eight piece to be exact

991
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,740
To prove it's serious about ending the chicken wars

992
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,740
The Popeye's Foundation

993
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,740
We'll pay a wear guild

994
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,740
To everyone we killed

995
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,740
The Popeye's Foundation

996
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,740
Purchased the cash equivalent

997
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,740
Of one million nuggets

998
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,740
From Popeye's restaurants

999
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,740
As well as competing brands

1000
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,740
McDonald's, Wendy's, Chick-fil-A, and Burger King

1001
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,740
The foundation will donate the funds

1002
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,740
To Second Harvest Food Bank

1003
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,740
Of Greater New Orleans

1004
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,740
And customers may visit

1005
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,740
The Popeye's Foundation website to donate

1006
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,740
And Popeye's will match the contributions

1007
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,740
Of up to $25,000

1008
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,740
What they're saying here

1009
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,740
And it's very tough to parse

1010
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,740
But my understanding is

1011
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,740
That they bought a million chicken nuggets

1012
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,740
And took them to a shelter

1013
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,740
Is that what happened here?

1014
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,740
Could you read it again?

1015
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,740
Because it does sound

1016
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,740
It's so hard to follow

1017
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,740
The Popeye's Foundation

1018
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,740
Purchased the cash equivalent

1019
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,740
Of one million nuggets

1020
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,740
How is that money?

1021
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,740
You bought money of nuggets?

1022
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,740
What are you talking about?

1023
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,740
Because the videos they have to

1024
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,740
Accompany this just shows a single Popeye's

1025
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,740
Employee going door to door

1026
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,740
At McDonald's and Wendy's and all these other places

1027
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,740
Just like, I'd like to buy all the chicken nuggets

1028
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,740
You have

1029
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,740
For some reason

1030
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,740
I don't know, I'll think of it

1031
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,740
I think that they're saying

1032
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,740
The Popeye's Foundation

1033
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,740
Is donating the equivalent

1034
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,740
But to say we purchased the cash equivalent

1035
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,740
Of nuggets

1036
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,740
What could that mean?

1037
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,740
I mean, what are they saying?

1038
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,740
They bought the cash equivalent

1039
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,740
Of a million nuggets

1040
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,740
At different stores

1041
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,740
And then donated the money

1042
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,740
What are you saying?

1043
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,740
Our hope is that today

1044
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,740
Guests who finally try our new

1045
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,740
Chicken nuggets will say to themselves

1046
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,740
Popeye's did it again

1047
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,740
Started another war

1048
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,740
Started another fucking war

1049
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,740
A cuter war

1050
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,740
We would like to call for a ceasefire

1051
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,740
By invading a different country now

1052
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,740
Bruno

1053
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,740
Continued, this is I think

1054
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,740
Where things really start to

1055
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,740
The rails

1056
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,740
Those two things together

1057
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,740
The product quality

1058
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,740
And the strong marketing campaign he's referring to here

1059
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,740
Those two things together

1060
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,740
They're really the recipe for the success of our brand

1061
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,740
And I'm very confident

1062
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,740
We have those two ingredients here

1063
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,740
This time with the nuggets

1064
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,740
The product tastes

1065
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,740
Amazing

1066
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,740
The campaign, I think

1067
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,740
It's very, very timely

1068
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,740
Very relevant

1069
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,740
It speaks to a cultural moment

1070
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,740
An iconic moment

1071
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,740
That happened in America

1072
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,740
Two years ago

1073
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,740
That cultural moment

1074
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,740
And really delivering something that is relevant

1075
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,740
That is unique to Popeye's

1076
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,740
And really puts Popeye's in the

1077
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,740
Center of the conversation

1078
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,740
Hey, the war's over

1079
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,740
Guys, we're bigger than this

1080
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,740
But Popeye's did it

1081
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,740
And we're in the middle of it, and we did it

1082
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,740
And it's us, and the war's over

1083
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,740
And we'll do it again

1084
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,740
I think we all agree the war's over

1085
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,740
And we fucking won

1086
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:17,740
We have annexed cluckers

1087
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,740
We have annexed cluckers

1088
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,740
All cluckers are now Popeye's

1089
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:27,740
Oh my god, the gall

1090
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,740
The absolute wild thing about this though

1091
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,740
Is that in like the late 80's

1092
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,740
There were pizza wars

1093
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,740
Which was like an iconic thing

1094
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:39,740
And it feels like they want that

1095
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,740
Again?

1096
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,740
And it could be

1097
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,740
And I don't fucking know anymore

1098
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,740
I don't know anymore

1099
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,740
Can I talk about something else real quick?

1100
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,740
This is unrelated, but I did want to mention it

1101
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,740
Long John Silvers has partnered with Gathered Foods

1102
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,740
To debut

1103
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,740
Plant-based

1104
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,740
Seafood

1105
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,740
And the ad for this

1106
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,740
There's an ad for it

1107
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,740
And it just says plant-based seafood is now a thing

1108
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,740
Awesome

1109
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,740
That's good

1110
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,740
That's about as much earnestness as I want behind this announcement

1111
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:17,740
Customers will be able to choose from two Long John Silvers classic menu items

1112
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,740
Now with a plant-based twist

1113
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,740
Good catch

1114
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,740
Crab-free cakes

1115
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,740
Which I would argue most cakes are

1116
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,740
Yes

1117
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,740
But not all cakes

1118
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,740
Not all cakes

1119
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:35,740
Are packed with 15 grams of plant-based protein per serving

1120
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,740
Features lump crab meat tastes

1121
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,740
Mmm

1122
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,740
What an appetizing concept

1123
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,740
Okay

1124
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,740
This is what it literally says

1125
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,740
It features lump crab meat tastes

1126
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,740
And texture complemented with sweet peppers

1127
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,740
Green onions, parsley, and a kick of spice

1128
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,740
If a filet is what you're after

1129
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,740
Good catch fish-free filets

1130
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,740
Are crispy breaded

1131
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,740
Tender flaky white fish texture

1132
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,740
You're looking for

1133
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,740
Are they skipping every third word

1134
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,740
In this announcement

1135
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:11,740
Our mission is to make the unique seafood experience from the coasts available to all

1136
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,740
Says Christopher Caudill

1137
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,740
So we're mushing up a bunch of beans

1138
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,740
I guess

1139
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,740
We're mushing up a bunch of beans

1140
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,740
And frying them because our mission is to bring seafood

1141
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,740
To the planet

1142
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,740
We believe plant-based seafood

1143
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,740
Furthers that mission by making Long John Silvers

1144
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,740
Accessible to guests who are hungry

1145
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,740
For more plant-based protein

1146
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,740
Option

1147
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,740
It's also a great addition for fans

1148
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,740
Of our classic sustainably sourced

1149
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,740
Wild caught fish who are curious

1150
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,740
About a new take on their

1151
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,740
Seafood favorites

1152
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,740
We're excited to set sail with good catch

1153
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,740
On this test

1154
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,740
I'm really curious and listeners if you could

1155
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,740
Tweet with the hashtag NBNBAM

1156
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,740
After this episode goes out

1157
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,740
If you're a vegan or a vegetarian

1158
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,740
Or I mean maybe you just don't eat

1159
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,740
Fish for sustainability

1160
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,740
Or whatever reasons

1161
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,740
How many of you have been longing

1162
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,740
To go to Long John Silvers

1163
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,740
But there just weren't options

1164
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,740
You tried my Long John Silvers and you're just salivating

1165
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,740
Oh if only I could

1166
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,740
But there's no options

1167
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,740
You just think about the fact that they'll sell you

1168
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,740
A container of lard cast-offs

1169
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,740
For 75 cents

1170
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,740
Crunchy lard cast-offs

1171
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,740
If only I could get those crunchins but I can't

1172
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,740
Just want to get some

1173
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,740
Crunchins have been vegan this whole time

1174
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,740
I bet

1175
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,740
How many of you hear this news and like

1176
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,740
Before we even finished talking about it

1177
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,740
There was just like a U-shaped puff of dust

1178
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,740
As you ran to your car

1179
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,740
A U-shaped puff of dust

1180
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,740
As you ran to your car and then turned back around

1181
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,740
And ran the other way away from your car

1182
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,740
Creating the U

1183
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,740
That is the U-shaped puff of dust that you have left

1184
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,740
Oh yeah they're committed

1185
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,740
They're in five restaurants

1186
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,740
Yeah

1187
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,740
Five different Long John Silvers

1188
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,740
Have these

1189
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,740
They're in California

1190
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,740
So they're bringing the seafood

1191
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,740
And coastal experience to California

1192
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,740
Thank god

1193
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,740
Give me that bean fish in the bread basket

1194
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,740
You know what I mean?

1195
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,740
Like where we need it

1196
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,740
I would

1197
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,740
And I'm not saying that this is true of everyone

1198
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,740
But there's someone in

1199
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,740
The bread basket, I say this living in Ohio

1200
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,740
That would walk up to the counter and say like

1201
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,740
I'll have the crab cakes and they'd be like

1202
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,740
Do you want that or not?

1203
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,740
And they'd be like what the fuck are you talking about?

1204
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,740
I just want to see that play out

1205
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,740
I just said crab cakes

1206
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,740
What about crab free cakes?

1207
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,740
I said I want the crab cakes

1208
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,740
Yeah but with or without the crab

1209
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,740
Fuck off!

1210
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,740
You know what makes me so mad about this?

1211
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,740
This fucking stupid segment

1212
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,740
I would fucking

1213
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,740
Annihilate some plant based chicken

1214
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,740
Fish nuggets right now

1215
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,740
I would annihilate them, so hungry for it now

1216
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,740
Thinking about that great white fish texture

1217
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,740
We love that

1218
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,740
I love that here

1219
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,740
Flaky

1220
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,740
My partner and I have a habit of stealing interesting coffee mugs

1221
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,740
Especially from people we dislike

1222
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,740
Our crown jewel is a church mug

1223
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,740
We stole from a landlord

1224
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,740
Who took our deposit unnecessarily

1225
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,740
A friend recently asked how we got so many weird mugs

1226
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,740
How do we explain

1227
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,740
Without seeming like petty kleptomaniacs

1228
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,740
This is from mysterious

1229
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,740
Mug mafiosos in Maryland

1230
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,740
And I have bad news

1231
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,740
You steal all the time

1232
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,740
You steal all the time

1233
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,740
For not great reasons

1234
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,740
Yeah

1235
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,740
Yeah

1236
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,740
They got you

1237
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,740
I think this is

1238
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,740
If you can't stand in your truth

1239
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,740
For this

1240
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,740
And be like oh we stole these

1241
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,740
Because it's funny

1242
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,740
These are stolen

1243
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,740
It gives us a little modicum of control back

1244
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,740
Right

1245
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,740
They took something from us so we took something from them

1246
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,740
We know it's not great

1247
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,740
But it's a thing the two of us do together

1248
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,740
And we like

1249
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,740
We like it

1250
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,740
It doesn't hurt anybody except the person who we've stolen from

1251
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,740
Are you guys at this point

1252
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,740
With your mugs where it is a one in one out policy

1253
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,740
It's had to become that

1254
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,740
Yes

1255
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,740
It's become that at our house

1256
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,740
We have now two drawers

1257
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,740
Filled with coffee mugs

1258
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,740
We have a good drawer

1259
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,740
And a bad drawer

1260
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,740
A bad drawer of mugs we don't like

1261
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,740
But can't get rid of

1262
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:25,740
And then the good drawer of the mugs

1263
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,740
This is what I was going to say

1264
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,740
Because I

1265
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,740
God help me

1266
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,740
I have two shelves in a cabinet

1267
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,740
And one shelf is full of mugs we use

1268
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,740
And the other one are

1269
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,740
Just in case mugs I get

1270
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,740
Like in case I open a coffee shop

1271
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,740
Suddenly

1272
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,740
They're like

1273
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,740
I suddenly had that corporate retreat

1274
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,740
In my house

1275
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,740
I got 40 people here from the local bank

1276
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,740
Who decided to have a trust building exercise

1277
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,740
In my living room

1278
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,740
And I have to provide cappuccinos for everybody

1279
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,740
Here's my thing also

1280
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,740
These aren't even mugs I use

1281
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,740
I haven't used a regular coffee mug for 10 years

1282
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,740
I have two mugs that I use

1283
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,740
On alternating days

1284
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,740
I only use travel mugs

1285
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,740
Even though I work out of the house

1286
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,740
I only use travel mugs

1287
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,740
And that way my coffee stays hot and fresh

1288
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,740
All day long

1289
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,740
But then you have no rush to drink it

1290
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,740
Do you do the same damn thing Griffin?

1291
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,740
I love when it gets to be 2pm and I'm like

1292
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,740
Hot coffee

1293
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,740
It's still hot and good

1294
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,740
I'm drinking one right now

1295
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,740
Contigo Autoseal

1296
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,740
Cheers

1297
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,740
He hit the microphone with his cup

1298
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,740
Oh boy

1299
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,740
I just have a big mug with West Virginia on it

1300
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,740
It looks like

1301
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,740
And I am wearing overalls right now

1302
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,740
I feel like a school art teacher

1303
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,740
With this big mug

1304
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,740
And it's kind of spotty and you feel like stoneware

1305
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,740
I love it

1306
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,740
Contigo Autoseal

1307
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,740
Is it stoneware?

1308
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,740
The Contigo Autoseal

1309
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,740
Has a valve

1310
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,740
That you press a button

1311
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,740
That allows the free flow of coffee

1312
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:05,740
This valve is spring loaded

1313
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,740
This valve

1314
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,740
This little release on the lid

1315
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,740
Will flip up

1316
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,740
So you can clean underneath it

1317
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,740
I discovered this

1318
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,740
Far too recently

1319
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,740
Oh no

1320
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,740
Why does the mug smell like that?

1321
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,740
You had baked in coffee goodness

1322
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,740
Why do you have wretched mugs?

1323
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,740
I like the open mug

1324
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:29,740
With no lid or

1325
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,740
Thermal properties

1326
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,740
Because then it encourages me to drain it

1327
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,740
To drain it

1328
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:37,740
I love that

1329
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,740
My mug is

1330
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,740
The brand of it is Zach

1331
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,740
Oh I love Zach stuff

1332
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,740
I have a big Zach cup that I use for all my

1333
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,740
Iced beverages

1334
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,740
But it's weird because it looks like

1335
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,740
It's like

1336
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,740
Not mine

1337
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,740
It's like hey Zach

1338
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,740
And I'm like damn it

1339
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,740
Can I still drink it though?

1340
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,740
I feel like we gave dad too hard a time

1341
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,740
For talking so much about drinkware when we were kids

1342
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,740
We didn't know how good we had it

1343
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,740
To learn about drinkware from a man

1344
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,740
Like a real man

1345
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,740
Who drank all kinds of different things

1346
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,740
Out of lots of different cups

1347
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,740
He would talk to us about Tervis and we'd just kind of ignore him

1348
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,740
And now I'm like won't someone talk to me about Tervis

1349
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,740
Yeah I would love to

1350
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,740
Hey I was sent a mug

1351
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,740
By a fan

1352
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,740
That had like a panther on it

1353
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,740
And it said in big black letters

1354
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,740
Be nice to me

1355
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,740
I have diarrhea on it

1356
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:33,740
And then

1357
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,740
I would say

1358
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:37,740
Six weeks later

1359
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,740
I was sent

1360
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,740
A mug by a fan

1361
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,740
That also had a panther on it

1362
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,740
That said be nice to me I have diarrhea

1363
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,740
On it and it was the same

1364
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,740
Mug and so two different people

1365
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,740
Saw that

1366
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,740
And said that reminds me of Griffin

1367
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,740
So much I'm going to spend

1368
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,740
You know $19.99 plus shipping

1369
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,740
Or whatever to make sure

1370
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,740
He has it so I do have two of those on it

1371
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,740
Sometimes you only know one thing

1372
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,740
About a person and it's like oh they love

1373
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,740
Unicorns or whatever so you get them

1374
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,740
The one thing people know about Griffin

1375
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,740
Is he gets diarrhea a lot

1376
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,740
Not a lot I haven't had it in a long time

1377
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,740
In fact Travis I know for a fact you've had

1378
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,740
Diarrhea more recently than me

1379
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,740
Yes but not as often statistically speaking

1380
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,740
Days out of our lives spent with

1381
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,740
Diarrhea

1382
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,740
In 2021 I haven't had it

1383
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,740
At all

1384
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:29,740
That's because you haven't been exposed

1385
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,740
To the harsh spores

1386
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,740
Of the world

1387
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,740
And this is the truth isn't it

1388
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,740
It's not my fault

1389
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,740
It's the world Griffin doesn't have diarrhea

1390
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,740
The world has diarrhea

1391
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:43,740
It gives it to me when I'm not

1392
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,740
I got a mask up Fauci's like it's cool

1393
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,740
Or is it it's not and I'm like I don't care

1394
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,740
I'm going to do it because the world's got diarrhea

1395
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,740
But if you stay in your

1396
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,740
World's got diarrhea

1397
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,740
As long as you stay in your

1398
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,740
Hormetically sealed home

1399
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,740
No diarrhea can get to you

1400
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,740
Exactly and also no chicken wings

1401
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,740
No chicken wings

1402
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,740
Guys I still I'm really like everything

1403
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,740
We've said after finding out the chicken

1404
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,740
Sandwich wars are over like I've got

1405
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,740
Two sons

1406
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,740
And knowing that they're not going to be drafted

1407
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,740
They're not going to be conscripted

1408
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:17,740
You know what I mean

1409
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,740
They're not going to have to go overseas

1410
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,740
It means the world to me

1411
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,740
Yeah but now they're going to have to

1412
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,740
They'll have to take up arms

1413
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:29,740
In the plant based seafood wars

1414
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,740
It's going to be a lot chiller though

1415
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,740
That's going to be a lot of mostly like

1416
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,740
Like there's going to be a lot of

1417
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,740
Computer warfare there there's a lot

1418
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,740
Yeah a lot of cyber one yeah exactly

1419
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,740
At the end

1420
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,740
This restaurant is by the way it said

1421
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,740
And with the plant based seafood industry

1422
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,740
Expected to grow to a staggering

1423
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,740
1.3 billion

1424
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,740
In the next 10 years Long John Silver's

1425
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,740
And Good Catch are the leading edge of a long term

1426
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,740
Movement I you know what I gotta

1427
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,740
Say if you're going to open up five restaurants

1428
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,740
I don't know if we're going to get there

1429
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,740
If Long John Silver's only has five

1430
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,740
Throw your fucking hat over the ring

1431
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,740
Launch it in every restaurant

1432
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,740
Even ones you don't own

1433
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,740
Make a little kiosk

1434
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,740
Where they can get it

1435
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,740
My favorite fish place is this little

1436
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,740
Hole in the wall called

1437
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,740
Oxide Charlie's

1438
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,740
In West Virginia you mean

1439
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,740
Inside an O Charlie's

1440
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,740
Oh boy

1441
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,740
It's hey if you want the real catch

1442
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,740
You know what I mean

1443
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,740
The real catch

1444
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,740
Is it like a VIP lounge inside

1445
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,740
How do you get into it

1446
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,740
Yeah it's just

1447
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,740
It's a kitchen bun

1448
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,740

Will be benefiting One Tree Planted

1459
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:01,740
Which is dedicated to making it easier

1460
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,740
For individuals and businesses to give back to the environment

1461
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,740
Create a healthier climate

1462
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:07,740
Protect biodiversity and help reforestation

1463

Efforts around the world

Plus you'll get a pin that says work of fart

1465
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,740
On it

1466
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,740
Who the fuck doesn't want that

1467
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,740
Also very excited
