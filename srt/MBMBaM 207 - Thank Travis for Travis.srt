1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:44,480
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,160
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother,

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,280
main advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,840
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm a sweet baby Griffin.

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:01,440
Been an exciting week here at the McElroy Ranch. I'm down fourteeth, got my wisdoms yanked,

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,920
so that's been amazing. Do you not understand that that's like

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,840
this podcast moneymaker? Like Travis and I don't know shit about fuck,

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,960
and you had all the wisdom in the world, and you gave it away just because it was for aesthetics,

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,560
because your mouth was too wide. One of them was too beautiful.

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,440
It was distracting in conversation. People couldn't focus on my ideas.

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,200
My big ideas, my big world-changing ideas. Because of your giant back teeth.

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,760
Because of your beautiful, shining, perfect back teeth, and one broken half,

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,920
so it seemed like the time. Yeah, that's a good time to do it.

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,960
Like you were just burning through your wisdom so quickly doing this show that

19
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,560
that was part of your wisdom tooth had to like rot and fall off because you used it up.

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,120
Mindfulness teaches us the importance of knowing when to let go of things, and for me,

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,600
that knowing when to let go of my wisdom teeth was predicated on one of them breaking in half.

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,560
Shattering. Did you go to your local Zen Center to have it removed?

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,920
Jagged stalactite of chewing. Sorry, Travis.

24
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,320
Did you go to your local Zen Center to have them removed?

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,520
No, I went ahead and went allopathic on this one.

26
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,800
What possible manner could a Zinster rip them bad boys out?

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,080
Listen, anybody can remove teeth from anybody. I'm not recommending it, I'm just saying that like

28
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,920
you get really centered, you focus, you focus on your breathing, pop, pop, pop, pop, teeth out.

29
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
Travis, you had a momentous week too, right?

30
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:29,440
I did. So my friends in LA are Lyft drivers, and I'm a big fan of the idea of Lyft and Uber.

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,960
So like weed delivery?

32
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,040
No, that would be awesome, but it is a service in which it's kind of like a crowdsourced taxi.

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,440
So you sign up to be a driver and then they kind of, it's like Uber, Lyft and Uber, big fans.

34
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,720
Okay, crowdsourced taxi, so it is in effect definitely usually weed delivery.

35
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,480
Yes. And so I said, oh, I want to try that out mostly because I was just curious about

36
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,000
what it was like to be a driver for them. So when I got back to Cincinnati,

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I signed up for it thinking that if I like it, when I moved to Los Angeles,

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,280
I'll start doing it there.

39
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,560
They'll already know you.

40
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,200
Yes. I'll be an experience.

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,160
Lyft and Louie, the world's greatest Lyft driver.

42
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,360
Yes. And they'll be super impressed because my car will be so clean and I'll have the best hard

43
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,560
candy in my-

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,320
Traveling Trav's Gypsy Taxi.

45
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,000
Which is what I spray painted on the car in anticipation for this.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah, you did jump the gun it seems.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,960
Well, so what happened is, what's supposed to happen is you fill out your application and then

48
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,600
you click a button that says like start mentor Lyft now or something like that.

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,480
And then it contacts your mentor and then your mentor drives to you and then you drive around

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,160
and that's kind of your training session. Well, so I filled out the application.

51
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,160
I hadn't cleaned my car yet and I wasn't ready to go.

52
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,440
So I kind of stopped.

53
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,640
I stopped at that point.

54
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,600
And then my mentor called me and was like, hey, let's just set up a time.

55
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,360
So that way I can make sure that I'm free and available and in the area.

56
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,240
And I said, okay, great.

57
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,200
So we set up the time.

58
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,520
So then we met on Wednesday.

59
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,800
I'd scrubbed out my car.

60
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,920
I'd like detailed it.

61
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,600
I'd gone to town cleaning it.

62
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,440
And we met, he gets in my car and he's like, okay, great.

63
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,600
Now just hit the start mentor Lyft now.

64
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,120
And I press it and a screen pops up letting me know that I,

65
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,280
my application has been denied due to my driving record

66
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,280
while Duder is sitting in my car.

67
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,720
And his response was, ah, man, that sucks.

68
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,640
Well, your car smells like farts anyway.

69
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,400
So you wouldn't have passed so bye.

70
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,360
It was just so awkward because he started looking on his phone to find out like the FAQs

71
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,760
of why someone's driving record to be turned down.

72
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,960
And it's like, it's cool, man.

73
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,440
It's fine.

74
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,720
Please get out of my car.

75
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,280
It's all right.

76
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,800
You don't realize this, but we've reached the end of the anecdote.

77
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,040
So you need to move on with your life.

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,000
I would offer to drive you somewhere, but clearly that is not prudent.

79
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,840
I'm amazed that he stayed in the car any longer.

80
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,760
Once he found out about you, I know the car is sitting still,

81
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,280
but you are capable of some pretty wack shit behind the wheel of one of these bad boys.

82
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,320
Well, so then it really, my favorite part was when he said,

83
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,880
do you know why it would say that?

84
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,920
I was like, bro, I'm not just going to run through all my vehicular rampages with you.

85
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,600
That's very charitable.

86
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,400
It's like when you're at the store and your credit card gets declined,

87
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,000
you think it's their computers?

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,840
No, I don't think it's their computers.

89
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,160
You know, this card reader's really been acting up.

90
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,360
I'm sure it's not you.

91
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,840
Did you remember to activate it before?

92
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,920
No, now that you mentioned it.

93
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,520
And I cannot stress enough, I still really like the idea of Lyft and Uber.

94
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
So I'm not at all knocking them.

95
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
Because it was like, as I was sitting there going,

96
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,920
are you still trying to get in their good?

97
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,400
Do you think they did send them an email that was like,

98
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,520
hey, so Travis here, why was that?

99
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,960
I've learned a lot about myself and my body

100
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,960
and like how that pertains to operating a motor vehicle over the past few years.

101
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,520
So if you can look past all the, ah, shit, I wrecked.

102
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,600
Because I was emailing you while I was driving.

103
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,280
I wish it could be like my credit score,

104
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,600
where if I could say like my wife is a way better driver

105
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,320
and she'll be in the car with me the whole time.

106
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,960
Listen, Curbed and Ubo and Lyfting,

107
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,360
if you are listening, please, I love my brother.

108
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,600
If there's a criteria that is more important to you

109
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,520
than has good driving record, I can't imagine what it could be.

110
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,680
Please don't let him smooth talk you into this.

111
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,600
I'm just saying that, you know what I provide?

112
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,760
You know what I provide as a Lyft driver, Justin?

113
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,960
An experience.

114
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Oh God, that's not what anybody wants.

115
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,000
That's what people play.

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,760
Crazy taxi all the time.

117
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,800
They fucking played that level in Die Hard 3

119
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,920
where you drove around the taxi,

120
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,440
which I think was the whole game actually.

121
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,160
Jesus Christ.

122
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,200
No, it's one third of the game.

123
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,720
Cause there was also, nevermind.

124
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,160
No, that was a Die Hard trilogy game.

125
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,360
But listen, but listen, nobody wants an experience in an Uber.

126
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,080
They want absolute silence until they arrive at their destination.

127
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,600
They don't want to get creeped on.

128
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,160
Give them a hard candy.

129
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't fist them at all.

130
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,640
I always get the feeling in Uber

131
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,200
because often they pull up in such nice cars.

132
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,720
I always get the feeling in Uber that the guy is like mid party.

133
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,120
Like he just took someone cool to a party place

134
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,800
and he has to do that again later,

135
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,920
but he has time to work me in to take me to Shake Shack.

136
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,400
Does it smell like Brad Pitt back there?

137
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,800
It should.

138
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,720
And there's a reason.

139
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,680
A good reason.

140
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,320
Maybe I like to, I prefer to think that he was mid drive with Brad Pitt

141
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,400
and said, oh shit, I got an Uber request.

142
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,040
Hop out.

143
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,240
You gotta get out, Pitt.

144
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,120
I'll swing back around.

145
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,920
I don't know.

146
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,880
Pop out, Bradley.

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,160
I'll circle back around in BD.

148
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,040
Let's help people.

149
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,640
Recently, I didn't do anything this week.

150
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,800
Recently, servers at a fast food chain I eat at regularly

151
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,160
are starting to recognize me and know what I will order.

152
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,960
Oh, boys.

153
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,800
Is this a hint that I should back out?

154
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,200
Should I start going to another restaurant?

155
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
It's not that I don't enjoy being noticed,

156
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,360
but eating at a single establishment

157
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,880
so much that various workers who work different shifts

158
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,200
know you and your food preferences,

159
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,640
yet not even your own name seems like an easy way

160
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,800
to a dangerous place.

161
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,360
Should I take my lunches elsewhere?

162
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,160
That's from Nervous in Newport.

163
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,960
I don't ever remember on the show Cheers

164
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,760
when Norm would walk in and everyone would yell Norm

165
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,080
and he would go, maybe I should start going somewhere else.

166
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,320
This is not a norm.

167
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,520
What they're yelling is Filet-O-Fish meal.

168
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,080
That's a stigma that I think is really unfair

169
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,320
because how is that different from going to a local diner

170
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
and they know you're going to get the BLT?

171
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,640
Just because it's McDonald's, like, okay, great.

172
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,840
You like McDonald's.

173
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,520
Don't change your preference

174
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,760
just because you're afraid people will judge you.

175
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,360
That's not a good way to live your life.

176
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,160
That's not a healthy-

177
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,640
Travis, you sound like the-

178
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,760
If you like the fucking Filet-O-Fish,

179
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,040
then get the fucking Filet-O-Fish.

180
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,200
You sound like the fat head guy right now.

181
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,400
You sound like the guy from the hit documentary Fathead

182
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,880
that sought to discredit,

183
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,840
supersize me in everything that I did.

184
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,360
Where you're just like, eat what you want.

185
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,440
It is America and it's freedom.

186
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,400
And I guess it's true.

187
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,640
I guess it is America and I guess it is freedom.

188
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,440
But if you only eat Filet-O-Fish, you're going to die.

189
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,080
You don't say he only eats Filet-O-Fish.

190
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,200
That's what he has for lunch.

191
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,080
Travis, Travis, Travis, you're going to die.

192
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,200
You're gonna die.

193
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,720
Welcome to McDonald's.

194
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,160
We got frozen meat.

195
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,040
Apple pies.

196
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,880
Yeah, I guess McRib is back,

197
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,240
but you're not gonna be.

198
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,120
You're gonna die.

199
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,880
Don't do this.

200
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,160
I will say, okay, let me addendum.

201
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,080
Maybe vary it up.

202
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,560
Doesn't mean you have to stop going there,

203
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,800
but maybe only go there like once a week

204
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,600
or try something different or go there once,

205
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,080
you know, twice every two weeks, something like that.

206
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,720
But maybe it just means that it's time

207
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,560
for a little bit more variety in your life.

208
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,400
I don't think that means you got to feel bad

209
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,040
about wanting to eat there and wanting to have that food.

210
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,680
I wouldn't.

211
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,600
But like maybe change it up.

212
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,080
Okay, I don't under, two points.

213
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,720
One, I've always wanted to have that at,

214
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,040
like in my hometown, I live in a small town.

215
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,440
You would think there'd be places that I could go

216
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,920
where people would say like, hey, it's the J-Man.

217
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,120
How are you?

218
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,480
Do you want the usual?

219
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,200
Hey Hoopster.

220
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,840
Hey Hoops.

221
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,520
That happens at my local pita pit, I guess.

222
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,280
There's probably other places now that I think of it,

223
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,560
but not every place.

224
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,600
I want it universal.

225
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,600
Secondly, why are you going inside a fast food restaurant?

226
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,120
I know we've talked about this before.

227
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,720
It's an old chestnut.

228
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,480
I don't understand why you're not just going

229
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,440
through the drive-through.

230
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,960
Maybe you could do that if you want to keep

231
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,440
your filet-o-fish schedule because you have

232
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
obsessive compulsive disorder.

233
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,000
If you need 131, oh Jesus, 131, I need my crunch.

234
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,520
Maybe you could just go through the drive-through

235
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,680
like an adult.

236
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,800
You know what sucks though?

237
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,920
You know what really puts me off?

238
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,440
It's not just the food that you're eating

239
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,280
that's killing you from the inside out,

240
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,160
like a parasite.

241
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,960
It's that they don't know your name.

242
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
You're in a relationship with this McDonald's

243
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,560
or this, can we say Arby's?

244
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,760
It's just a funnier name.

245
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,280
You're in a relationship with this Arby's.

246
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,240
We have the weirdest sponsorship deal with them.

247
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,440
And like you, they don't give a shit about you.

248
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,000
They just want to force feed their floppy,

249
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,480
sloppy meats down your throat and then get

250
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,080
your money in return for it.

251
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,480
And the fact that they know what kind of meat

252
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,880
you like but not your name, man, they just,

253
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,080
they're not going to put in the effort.

254
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,120
They don't love you like you know.

255
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,320
They're just streamlining the process and saying

256
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,640
like, okay, great, go ahead and start an Arby's McRib

257
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,080
tickler, whatever.

258
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,000
And that way you can just go ahead and like

259
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,480
get your meal faster and be done with the exchange.

260
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,160
Now the Arby's McRib tickler, that's the Arby's sandwich.

261
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,280
With peanut butter on it.

262
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,520
But it has like a stick in it,

263
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,520
like one of those joke popsicle sticks.

264
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,480
Uh-huh, correct.

265
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,800
Because it just, it makes you like wait one more

266
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,840
second for the sandwich.

267
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,480
And that hesitation is what makes it so delicious.

268
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,240
That sweet orgasmic moment.

269
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,520
It's so right.

270
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,280
You're in a bad relationship.

271
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,360
You need to get out of this relationship.

272
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,000
You need to get out.

273
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,080
You need to get yourself a new man.

274
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,320
Strong, strong, proud black man who's going to treat

275
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,760
you like the queen you are.

276
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,440
And that is not this Arby's.

277
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,800
That's clearly, yeah.

278
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,920
Is there a new fast food restaurant?

279
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,200
Can you guys think of like,

280
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,920
have you guys heard of that new hot fast food restaurant

281
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,280
that just hit the scene?

282
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,640
And it's really taken charge.

283
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,040
That new fast food enterprise business that is really

284
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,800
just like hit the scene in 2000, late 2012.

285
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,600
And it's just like fucking growing rapidly.

286
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:51,840
Nope.

287
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,520
It's just pretty much, pretty much just Subway and BK,

288
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,800
Taco Bell, Donald's Jack in the Box.

289
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,560
No, here's what you gotta get.

290
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,040
This is one of the great things about fast food

291
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,560
is where you gotta catch them is that every once in a while

292
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,160
a restaurant will get into their marketing groove of

293
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,480
we're not bullshit anymore.

294
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,000
Like, remember how Domino's, Domino's is like,

295
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,720
hey, listen, we've been bullshit for a long time

296
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,360
and our new thing is we're going to try.

297
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,600
We're actually gonna like make a product.

298
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,160
Carl's Jr. is like, we're doing Angus now.

299
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,880
Get on board.

300
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,760
Well, the Angus revolution hit a lot of different places.

301
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,840
And I feel like the growth wasn't that hard.

302
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,080
I feel like McDonald's even like put their foot down.

303
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,840
Like, no, no Angus.

304
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,120
The line must be drawn here.

305
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,040
We're gonna use the same like earthworm shit

306
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,440
that you idiots have been guzzling down.

307
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,000
All right.

308
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,120
How about a Yahoo?

309
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,360
Yeah.

310
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,720
We need to pick up the pace on these shows.

311
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,320
I feel like we spend too long on questions.

312
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,080
That was a deep well.

313
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,120
There was a lot of comedy in there.

314
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,320
We hit the advice nug and then we like sit on that nug

315
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,440
for a long time.

316
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:55,920
Yeah.

317
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,800
This Yahoo was-

318
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,840
They fixed that in editing.

319
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,440
Our producer fixed that in editing.

320
00:13:59,440 --> 00:13:59,680
Yeah.

321
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,240
Thanks, Jerry.

322
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,800
Thanks, Scott.

323
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,440
Oh, Jesus.

324
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,840
Oh, shit.

325
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,120
Is this thanks, Jerry or Scott?

326
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,040
We should have fucking put in the effort.

327
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,080
This one was sent in by-

328
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm Scott and Jerry.

329
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
I'm Scott and Jerry Paulson.

330
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,480
Are you eating right now?

331
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,240
Or is that just the sound your gums make now?

332
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,560
Your bloated ruined gums.

333
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,880
It's just flappy slappy holes in there.

334
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,760
No, I made some-

335
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,280
I got a-

336
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:30,480
For Father's Day, I got a donut maker from my mother-in-law

337
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,960
who apparently wants me to celebrate Father's Day

338
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,040
by not being around so long.

339
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,280
Yeah.

340
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,440
And so you decided the perfect time to consume said donuts

341
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,160
was when you were six inches away from a microphone.

342
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,840
Well, listen, I didn't know you guys were going to say

343
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,920
all that funny stuff about Scott and Jerry.

344
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,920
Justin, are you waiting?

345
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,840
Are you listening to this podcast while performing it?

346
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,520
Listening for pregnant pauses in which to sneak tiny hidden

347
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,280
kisses into your donut?

348
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,880
Here's the other thing that is occurring to me

349
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:10,640
is that I did take that opioid about 20 minutes ago.

350
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,280
Oh no.

351
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,200
So I think the show is starting to turn on that axis.

352
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,640
You riding the lightning right now.

353
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,840
You're riding the dragon.

354
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,880
The dragon made of lightning.

355
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,120
Remember when I compared fast food chains

356
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,200
to strong proud black men?

357
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,200
That may be, I think at that point, the worm I have turned.

358
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,320
Yeah.

359
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,040
Let us continue.

360
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,320
Sorry, Scott and Jerry.

361
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,000
That's kind of making a lot of work for me.

362
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,240
Yeah.

363
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,560
He's really earning his paycheck this week.

364
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,040
Is Yahoo sent by a diamond member level 150 shaman

365
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,320
of Yahoo's Drew Davenport?

366
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,800
Thank you, Drew.

367
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,120
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Michael, who asks,

368
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,720
is there anything I should know about before going

369
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,040
to a nudist resort with family and friends?

370
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,800
I'm 13 and my friend and his family are nudists.

371
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,320
When I'm at his house, I strip down.

372
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,680
So I'm perfectly comfortable with being

373
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,200
around other people in the buff.

374
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,520
My family aren't nudists, but they invited us to go

375
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,600
to a resort with them and we all agreed.

376
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,480
It will be me, my dad, my mom and my younger brother.

377
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,080
He's nine if that provides help.

378
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,320
I've read the official rules online,

379
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,960
but I want to know about the social etiquette there.

380
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,480
Now I thought a nudist resort or a nudist colony

381
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,360
would go like outback steakhouse style of no rules just right.

382
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,240
But apparently there are boundaries that exist.

383
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,240
Okay, and I want to be really careful here.

384
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,960
Like, hey, if you're a nudist, that's totally cool.

385
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,600
Like that's your deal and I'm not going to judge you for that.

386
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,400
It is weird to me.

387
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,440
Do you think there are nudists that listen to our podcast?

388
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,040
Yeah, all they've got is a smile and a pair of headphones

389
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,000
and I respect them.

390
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,880
They don't even have the headphones.

391
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,080
It's just like everything.

392
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,480
There's a rich subculture with rules that we'll never

393
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,160
be able to understand or be respectful towards

394
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,840
in the context of our show.

395
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,560
We can respect them.

396
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,760
I don't think anything's wrong with this.

397
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,440
I'm just, and maybe this is like anathema to those people,

398
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,480
but I feel like the idea of the nudist camp I'm into.

399
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,040
Oh yeah, I'm way into that.

400
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,320
Yeah, and I'm sure it's just hard bodies.

401
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,440
Just sexiest hard bodies as far as the eye can see.

402
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,400
Here's the thing.

403
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,760
You kind of lose me with the kid angle.

404
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,240
Yeah, I feel like a nine year old.

405
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,800
What's that thing that the Amish do where like you hit

406
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,720
a certain age and you go off into the world

407
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,840
for like a couple of months.

408
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,160
Rummikub, bagging, something like that.

409
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,920
I feel like that should happen once you pass age 10

410
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,120
to like age 18.

411
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,360
Those eight years, you're not allowed to be there.

412
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,800
Yeah, oh no, because you're going to be leaking fluids

413
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,560
that you or I don't understand.

414
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,920
Yeah, it should be like once you get old enough to realize

415
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,520
that this is like a strange thing,

416
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,120
you're not allowed there anymore.

417
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,640
Until you get to a point where like,

418
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,560
I've seen this in other contexts.

419
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,360
If you are old enough to where you don't drop your pants

420
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,200
around your ankles at the urinal,

421
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,240
if you're older than that, I feel like you can't be there.

422
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,160
It's a certain level of awareness, right?

423
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,000
Like, oh, now I'm suddenly aware,

424
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,280
but not comfortable enough.

425
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
You know what, that's exactly it, Travis.

426
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,120
But sometimes when a kid does that at the urinal,

427
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
I feel like it's a power play.

428
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,480
Oh, it's the biggest power play.

429
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,400
That's where we lost it.

430
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,440
Like the moment I stopped doing that is the moment

431
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,160
I let go of something primal and savage in myself

432
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,560
that connected me to Gaia.

433
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,720
I feel like the moment I stopped dropping trowel completely.

434
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,920
And like, just to pee at the urinal.

435
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,200
Your primal scream to the sky as you pee in the urinal.

436
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,240
And you know what the problem is?

437
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,920
For me, I would do it.

438
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,800
You know me, I don't have anything to hide down there.

439
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,240
Right, and you don't have anything.

440
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,840
I don't have anything in my zone.

441
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,880
It's not even smooth like a Kindle.

442
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,480
It's just negative space.

443
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,800
You look and it's like your eyes drift to the right.

444
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,960
You can't look directly at it.

445
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,760
Chest, belly, you get a little bit of hip bones poking out

446
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,800
and then there's nothing.

447
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,040
Like, I'm like Rayman down there.

448
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,120
Just like my legs connect through some mysterious magic.

449
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,240
Anyway, I would do it, but bathroom floors are so dirty

450
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,000
and I don't want my pants butt to touch that.

451
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,360
True.

452
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,000
If your pants butt gets wet from the floor,

453
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,920
the wetness on the floor, you're done.

454
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,080
You gotta stay in that bathroom forever.

455
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,680
You have to leave those pants there.

456
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,440
The image that I can't get out of my head

457
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,360
because it's incredibly funny to me

458
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,160
is this 13 year old dude rolling up to his friend's house

459
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,600
walking in the door and just like,

460
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,200
finally I'm free.

461
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,720
Been a hard day at the old salt mines.

462
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,480
Doris, you got any cupcakes?

463
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,560
Naked Doris, my friend's naked mom.

464
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,480
Did you make cupcakes for us?

465
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,640
For the last time, Steven, we're not nudists.

466
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
You walked in on us having sex once.

467
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,200
One time.

468
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,960
That's cool.

469
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,600
That's cool.

470
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,760
These ants on a log sort of a public thing

471
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,440
or you save these for a private snack?

472
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,480
Get out of our house.

473
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,600
Okay, see you tomorrow.

474
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,760
That's how Matthew McConaughey met me.

475
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,720
This is the best how I spent my summer vacation report

476
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,800
I've ever read, Mr. Macaron.

477
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:18,880
And in closing, I'm Mark Twain

478
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,640
and that's the last thing I ever wrote.

479
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,960
And now I die.

480
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,080
So please sign up for my Patreon.

481
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,600
This may be a contentious statement,

482
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,120
but I think if your family agrees to go on a journey

483
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,920
with this other family that will involve your whole family,

484
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,760
getting their dicks and their vaginas out,

485
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,440
then they are in fact nudists.

486
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,760
They have crossed the Rubicon, the nudicon.

487
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,920
Yeah, I don't think there is a partial nudist.

488
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,520
I'm gonna dip into it publicly for a weekend at this resort

489
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,800
and just see how I feel.

490
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,440
And I know we're talking, I know it's a complex subject

491
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,840
and I'm sure that we are frustrating a lot of people right now

492
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,400
because you can like be into it for like a week

493
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,800
and then hop out and say like, well, it's just not for us.

494
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,400
There's probably a lot more to that lifestyle

495
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,880
than just like, oh, these people are naked.

496
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,080
Cool, cool, cool.

497
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,840
There's a lot more to it than that, I'm sure.

498
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,200
But like, I don't know, man.

499
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,000
I think about like, that is not something

500
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,720
that I think I would ever do

501
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,680
unless I was like fully into the lifestyle.

502
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,960
I don't know, maybe I should go full 30 days.

503
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,880
Maybe you should be nude at home first

504
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,160
and then invite like one friend over.

505
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,120
I don't even do that.

506
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,120
I can't be nude by myself because the cat's here.

507
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,440
And he'll judge you.

508
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,480
Sometimes when my dog watches me poop,

509
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,840
I know she's judging me.

510
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,120
There is a moment that I wish I could be there

511
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,320
for at nudist camp and that is you drive there

512
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,440
with clothes on and then you park

513
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
and you get your key to your room.

514
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,880
When does everyone sort of look at each other

515
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,360
and say like, well, I guess now we should take our clothes off.

516
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,840
Especially if it's your first time and you don't know

517
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,280
and it's like general knowledge

518
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,080
that like you get undressed in your room and come out

519
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,680
and like the front desk isn't cool

520
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,680
with just naked people walking in,

521
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,520
but you don't know that because it's your first time.

522
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,360
So you're sitting in the car doing that awkward,

523
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,880
like we're not gonna get out of the car,

524
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,320
get naked, we're gonna do it here in the seat.

525
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,520
I'm sure there's like a prison processing room

526
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,640
where they take all their clothes.

527
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,440
All their clothes with the lousing powder and everything.

528
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,440
Sydney and I went to a murder mystery weekend last year.

529
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,800
I'm worried about this story.

530
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,240
No, no, no, hanging with me.

531
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,840
We went to a murder mystery weekend last year.

532
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,040
We've been a few times since then.

533
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,080
Scraps went with us one last year.

534
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,800
It was a lot of fun.

535
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,560
But our first time, you go in character,

536
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,720
you have your costume, you have your old backstory.

537
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,480
So we did the first two nights

538
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,280
and then the last day you show up to find out who killed who.

539
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,520
We always solve it.

540
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,600
So there's Rob some of the drama,

541
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,440
but we showed up in costume, in character

542
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,000
and found out once we arrived there

543
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,880
that on Sunday morning, nobody's in costume

544
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,840
or character anymore.

545
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,520
So like all bets are off.

546
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,320
I tell this story as a way of illustrating

547
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,000
that something like that would almost certainly happen

548
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,840
in a nudist camp.

549
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,760
And that's what genuinely terrifies me about it.

550
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,800
There would be some thing where no,

551
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,400
we're never naked for this.

552
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,040
We're not naked for the church service.

553
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,640
This is church.

554
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,760
This is church.

555
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,080
You can't take communion.

556
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you perverts.

557
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,360
You, are you genuinely right now naked

558
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,280
on cinnamon roll Saturday?

559
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,080
You know that's the one time none of us get naked

560
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,560
because it's so sticky.

561
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,560
Did you not read the welcome pamphlet?

562
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,920
It's the one day.

563
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,080
That's the one stickiest day.

564
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,160
One sticky day that we don't get naked

565
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,520
and it's counterintuitive

566
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,640
because otherwise we could just go down to the sex host

567
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,720
and blast off after we get sticky.

568
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,640
Do you think there's a possibility

569
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,760
that this 13 year old boy's family does not know

570
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,480
that they are going to prison camp?

571
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,040
No.

572
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,880
That it's like, hey, mom and dad,

573
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,720
the Stevens invited us to a weekend vacation with them.

574
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,800
Oh, and you're thinking they discover when they get

575
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,440
that you're making kind of a Jim Belushi movie now.

576
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,680
Yeah, it's like, hey, hey son,

577
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,480
why are there so many dicks and balls everywhere?

578
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,520
Where's the balls come from?

579
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,920
Why am balls?

580
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,120
This summer, Brian Cranston falls from grace

581
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,440
in his new movie, OOPS! Red and Nudist Camp.

582
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,720
And I took my whole family-

583
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,840
OOPS! Balls!

584
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,200
Wayne Zelinsky is back in Honey, No One's Wearing Clothes.

585
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,200
Honey, I blew up my-

586
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,040
I blew up my spot.

587
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,760
How about another question?

588
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
What if Brian Cranston took over for Rick Moranis

589
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,120
in the role of Wayne Zelinsky in a-

590
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,320
I would watch that so fucking hard.

591
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,920
Of Honey, I Shove the Kids.

592
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,040
The third actor after Peter Scoleri to play the role.

593
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,320
Who did an excellent job.

594
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,760
Doesn't get enough attention for that role.

595
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,160
You know what?

596
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,680
He really captured the Wayne Zelinsky spirit.

597
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,480
Really did great.

598
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,560
Sorry, go ahead.

599
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,080
No, read a question.

600
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,960
You're going ahead.

601
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,600
Oh, I do this.

602
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,900
Okay.

603
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,960
What if this episode becomes everybody's favorite

604
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,640
and I have to keep-

605
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,400
Doing Kyra Kojo?

606
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,200
I have to keep taking opiates.

607
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,480
I don't know if I can get behind that.

608
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,240
Do you want me to read the question, Bubby?

609
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,080
This is our behind the music, isn't it?

610
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,400
So a while ago, I got a large TV to put

611
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,520
in the living room in my apartment

612
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,600
so my roommates and I could enjoy hosting people

613
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,560
for movie nights and such.

614
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,960
One of my roommates is a mechanic

615
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,320
and while fixing an engine,

616
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,200
the living room started to fill up with engine parts.

617
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,160
So because I did not expect to do much hosting

618
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,520
while the living room was a mess,

619
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,280
I moved the TV up to my room.

620
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,080
Now the engine is fixed, the living room is clear,

621
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,120
but I've gotten used to having a big TV in my room.

622
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,400
Yeah, it's nice.

623
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,520
Yeah, it's right.

624
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,000
Should I give up having such a nice luxury item

625
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,600
in my bedroom and return the TV

626
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,800
to the public area or should I revel in my greed

627
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,080
and hoard it up for myself?

628
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,880
And that's from TV hoarder on the Illinois border

629
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,360
who judging from his name has already made his choice.

630
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,200
What are the other people in the house even do now?

631
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,000
Do they just like draw a picture of a TV on the wall

632
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
and they just like stare at it and sigh?

633
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,560
They paint.

634
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,680
They have conversations with each other

635
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,960
and read fine novels.

636
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,080
No.

637
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,720
No, they really embrace life to its fullest

638
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,840
and they don't engage in distraction behavior

639
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,400
or they sit quietly and hate you

640
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,360
for taking away the TV box every time they look at you.

641
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,040
He's the one with the glowy screen.

642
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,920
I mean, I would do it just because like,

643
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,160
I mean, I get in pretty unhealthy patterns

644
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,680
of watching TV for a day, like all of it,

645
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,240
like from the moment I wake until the moment I reach

646
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,520
my sweet slumbers.

647
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,160
Oh my God.

648
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,800
We discovered that there's a surprise,

649
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,680
you know, I did not know this,

650
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,760
but there's a surprising amount of TV on YouTube.

651
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,280
Oh yeah.

652
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,080
And you can look up like, especially international stuff.

653
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,480
Sydney and I accidentally discovered

654
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,520
that all of the Canadian version of Shark Tank,

655
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,720
which is called Dragon's Den,

656
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,200
as it is most of the world is on YouTube.

657
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,360
Except for America where we do not fear dragons.

658
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,320
We don't fear dragons.

659
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,080
We conquer them.

660
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,600
We conquer the dragons.

661
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,720
So now we have shocks.

662
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,560
But yeah, there's like eight seasons

663
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,960
of Dragon's Den on YouTube.

664
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,560
And apparently there's a lot more where that came from.

665
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,720
So that has been a problematic situation for us

666
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,680
knowing that there's fresh, fresh Dragon's Den.

667
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:41,840
Right.

668
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,440
I wanna address a bigger problem here,

669
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,000
which is why the fuck did your roommate bring engine parts

670
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,280
in your goddamn living room?

671
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,320
Yeah, it's where you live.

672
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,680
It's not where you engine.

673
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,120
You wouldn't say like my roommate is a veterinarian,

674
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,960
so he's neutering cats here.

675
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,560
No, he's expressing anal glands in the kitchen.

676
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,960
Tell him to keep that shit outside where engines blow.

677
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,920
Where they go.

678
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,440
It's outside exclusively.

679
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,760
And then you would never take the TV box away.

680
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,200
What I was saying before is like,

681
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,880
I'll watch TV in an unhealthy way,

682
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,720
but as long as I'm doing it with my wife,

683
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,840
then it's an activity and not a vice.

684
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,040
Well, there's also something like,

685
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,440
until I moved in with Teresa,

686
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,000
I always had a TV in my bedroom,

687
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,360
and she is not a fan of that.

688
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,280
At first, that was really off-putting to me,

689
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,640
but now it's kind of nice because for the times,

690
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
like when we get sick or one of us is ill

691
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,560
and we move the TV into the bedroom,

692
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,800
it really does become an anchor.

693
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,600
Oh, yeah.

694
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,240
Keeps you in bed or brings you to bed early

695
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,840
and you don't really do a lot of shit.

696
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,560
At least in the living room, you do more stuff.

697
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,120
Like I can work on the computer while the TV's on,

698
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,840
or I feel like at least I'm sitting up or walking around.

699
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,040
What about the terrifying-

700
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,240
What if the darkness creeps up on you

701
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,280
while you're in your bedroom

702
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,480
and you're trying to get dressed?

703
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,280
What do you do then?

704
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,840
I sing a little song to myself

705
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,360
about how lucky I am to be alive.

706
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,040
How's that go?

707
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,840
How's that song go?

708
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,200
Thank God I'm not dead

709
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,280
because the world would be empty without me.

710
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,600
Okay.

711
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,560
It usually kind of then devolves from there

712
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,360
into how awesome I am.

713
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,720
About how great you are, yeah, sure.

714
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,800
Boy, I think we're all pretty lucky.

715
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,920
Trios is still kicking.

716
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,160
I just assume everyone sings a song like that.

717
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,400
Thank you, God, for Travis.

718
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,640
Where would I be without-

719
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,600
He's the sun in the sky and the stars at night

720
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,560
who guides me home on the choppy seas.

721
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,080
Thank Jesus for Travis.

722
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,200
Travis is Jesus.

723
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,480
And then it just kind of keeps going.

724
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,680
Thank Travis for Travis, his all-seeing power.

725
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,320
Thank Travis for Travis.

726
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,320
People don't write enough hymns about themselves, you know?

727
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,880
Oh, but up to the first stanza of hymn 341.

728
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,320
Thank Travis for Travis and Travis is Travis.

729
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,200
Our hearts are all Travis and brains are Travis too.

730
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,880
Third stanza.

731
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,960
Oh, man.

732
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,640
I need some thank Travis for Travis propaganda posters.

733
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,600
You know, Travis, I feel like there's been this narrative

734
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,560
among some of our listenership that you don't get the respect

735
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,480
that you deserve on this show.

736
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,680
So I'm all about, I don't know, canonizing you.

737
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,200
I also want to point out one of the reasons that happens is

738
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,160
I don't really need it.

739
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,280
I take care of that on my own.

740
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,160
The other thing is that a little bit of that on Travis

741
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,920
goes quite a long way.

742
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,560
So visit travismacaroy.com for all your Travis Macaroy needs.

743
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,760
Let's go to the Money Zone.

744
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,240
Yeah, yeah.

745
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,440
Is it Money Zone time already?

746
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,280
You've had so much fun.

747
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,320
Boys, I want to tell you about your face.

748
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,000
Please do.

749
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,440
You're not boys anymore.

750
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,800
You're not old children.

751
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,280
You're men.

752
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,800
And as men, you need to start taking care of the gift

753
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,000
that God gave you, your visage and your your shavables.

754
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,920
We're going to help you out with that by telling you

755
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,840
about harrys.com.

756
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,560
Now, I also want to make I want to make one more thing clear

757
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,840
before we move on, Justin.

758
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,640
Men are not the only human beings that shave.

759
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,040
Yeah, women also have shavables.

760
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,960
I know they shave their shavables.

761
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,080
You didn't even let me finish.

762
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,400
I was talking to you first and then I was going to branch out

763
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,040
from there.

764
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,320
How come the men got to go first?

765
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,520
How come the men got to go first?

766
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,040
Because I was talking to you.

767
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,520
Just talk about us as mammals with hair on our bodies.

768
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,800
I have two brothers.

769
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,920
I don't have any sisters.

770
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,440
You have two humans.

771
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,600
To my siblings who can shave whatever the hell they want to,

772
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,680
I want to tell you about harrys.com.

773
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,840
I've been waiting for permission from you for so long

774
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,840
to get my toes did.

775
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,800
Buying razors sucks.

776
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,880
Razors are really expensive.

777
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,640
They keep them behind glass.

778
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,240
They treat you like a criminal.

779
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,360
If you buy them, you have to come over and they'll unlock them

780
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:03,760
for you.

781
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,440
They're in a clamshell and they cost $100,000 and they're the

782
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:07,840
worst.

783
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,960
Why do they protect?

784
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,760
Like that's yeah, there are other things in this Walgreens

785
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,760
that could kill people with way, way, way easier.

786
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,640
Is that it?

787
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,280
But you know why?

788
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,200
Because they're so expensive.

789
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,320
Like $45.

790
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,120
But Harry's is going to give you a better shape of experience

791
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,120
for a fraction of the price.

792
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,840
They got these great German engineered blades.

793
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,840
They sent us some and they were great.

794
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,400
I had a great shave with them.

795
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,800
It actually, no kidding, got me off of I had been using safety

796
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,440
razors.

797
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,640
I've been doing wet shaving.

798
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,320
It actually got me off of that because I was enjoying the

799
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,600
Harry's experience so much.

800
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,800
And not only did they give you a great shape, they look really

801
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,280
classy.

802
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:47,760
Yeah, they do.

803
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,360
They have some really good looking blades.

804
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,840
And it's the kind of thing where anybody like who's in your

805
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,000
bathroom, snooping through your stuff and finds out it's going

806
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,080
to be like, oh, I bet this is a really expensive razor.

807
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,400
Then they'll probably steal it because you have shitty friends.

808
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,000
But it looks really nice.

809
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,960
And doesn't it all look like the cheap razors you buy at the

810
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,800
store that cost you $45 for a package?

811
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,600
Nicely weighted.

812
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,000
For $15, you're going to get a box that includes a handle,

813
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,920
three blades, and shave cream shipped to your door.

814
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,720
That is less than like a refill of just safety blades.

815
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,640
And one of the co-founders is the guy that started Warby

816
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,360
Parker.

817
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,840
Oh, shit.

818
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,280
That dude's taking over.

819
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:25,680
Yeah.

820
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,560
So he's blowing up.

821
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,360
He's a rich guy.

822
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,920
Go give him more of your money by ordering online.

823
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,480
It's super easy.

824
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,960
Just go to harrys.com and you're going to use the promo

825
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,120
code, my brother, all one word.

826
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,680
And they're going to give you $5 off your first purchase.

827
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,080
So that's a crazy deal.

828
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,040
That's $10.

829
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,000
So for that basic kit.

830
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,960
So I'm still using the shaving cream, by the way.

831
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,680
It's great.

832
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,720
Very luxurious.

833
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,120
I mean, I'm using the other stuff too, but I'm still on

834
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,720
that initial tube of shaving cream.

835
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,600
It lasts quite a while.

836
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,400
Does it have a scent?

837
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,960
Not overpowering.

838
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,560
It's just sort of a general.

839
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,280
Just clean.

840
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,400
I would say unisex.

841
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,600
I would say a man or woman could use it.

842
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,160
Fresh.

843
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,720
Freshness.

844
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,480
And I'm a bearded gentleman, but I still use it on my neck

845
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,280
and the back of my neck.

846
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,800
And my wife used the razor as well, and she's a big fan.

847
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,600
So go check it out.

848
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,760
If you're looking for a new, affordable, classy shaving

849
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,680
experience, go to harrys.com.

850
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,160
And use the coupon code, my brother.

851
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,240
As long as you're upgrading your life, why not upgrade your

852
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,280
finances too?

853
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,400
Go to simple.com.

854
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,840
It's the way banking should be.

855
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,400
They're rebuilding banking from the ground up.

856
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,160
There's no minimum balance.

857
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,600
There's no monthly fee.

858
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,440
There's no overdraft charge.

859
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And there are 55,000 fee-free ATMs.

860
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,000
And they have photo check deposit.

861
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,120
I'm a simple customer.

862
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,920
I signed up.

863
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,560
It is really, really an easy way to manage.

864
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,280
Like, just this week, I didn't have to go to the bank because

865
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,760
I took pictures of my checks.

866
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,120
And then once the checks were, like, deposited, I actually got

867
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,760
a push notification telling me that they were in there.

868
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,480
Can I ask you a question real quick?

869
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,160
Without the minimum balance and the monthly fees and the

870
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,600
overdraft charges and the ATM charges, how do they fuck me?

871
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,240
Hey, here's the crazy thing about it.

872
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,440
They don't fuck you.

873
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,480
How about that?

874
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:20,960
Huh?

875
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,360
That's yeah, but like, how do they operate?

876
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,400
Cause it's like, if you give me an option on like, on the app

877
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,160
that you can select, fuck me.

878
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,800
Yeah.

879
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,200
Cause like, if you give me $5, right.

880
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,280
And then you say, yo G man, need that $5 back.

881
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,720
And I just give you $5 back.

882
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,120
I didn't get anything.

883
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,680
Right.

884
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,800
So they, it's complicated, but interest is involved.

885
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,360
I bet.

886
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,000
I don't know.

887
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,880
It's a real bank though.

888
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,240
They're FDIC insured and they don't sell your data and stuff.

889
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,040
I would almost trust.

890
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,160
It's weird that I am having a hard time trusting it because

891
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,360
they don't want to fuck me every day, every moment of my life

892
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,200
for like half the shit that I have.

893
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,520
The, uh, the other cool thing about it is if you have

894
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,440
spending goals, Sydney and I are saving up for a down payment

895
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,720
on a house and we tell simple how much we want to save and

896
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,600
where we want to get to.

897
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,160
And it'll actually automatically save that much and tell us how

898
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,400
much we can spend to stay on track.

899
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,760
So it's a bank that's like not actively trying to fuck you,

900
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,320
which is heartbreakingly revolutionary.

901
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,560
And that was the original tagline, but they couldn't get

902
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,120
past the sensors and also Obama.

903
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,120
So simple.com slash my brother.

904
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,040
You can, uh, uh, fix your shit.

905
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,080
I got a message.

906
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:35,040
Uh, I don't make me say it for big daddy Hoffman.

907
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,640
What was that accent?

908
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,840
For big daddy.

909
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,640
Okay.

910
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,800
Big daddy's got to get his piece of the pie.

911
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,440
Okay.

912
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,040
Elizabeth Taylor and kind of hot.

913
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,360
Yeah.

914
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,400
Kind of, uh, we got to celebrate big daddy.

915
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Hoffman is from Eric.

916
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,120
Can you do anything?

917
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,680
Eric.

918
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:49,920
Okay.

919
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,320
Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric says he needs to get his piece of the

920
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,920
pie to smaller piece for a smaller name.

921
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,520
Um, Eric says to big daddy Hoffman.

922
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,800
Happy birthday, big guy.

923
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,520
Although you're just one malpractice suit away from

924
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,760
losing your license and you probably should have become a

925
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,360
cobbler or a dog cobbler.

926
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,480
Instead, people and dogs love shoes.

927
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,400
It says in this message, it feels like this guy is trying

928
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,640
to push his like his agenda on his cobbling agenda.

929
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,120
Yeah.

930
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,960
For dogs, dog cobbler.

931
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,160
Um, it's been great having a doctor friend to buy drugs from

932
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,240
is dog cobbling a viable career choice.

933
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,080
What I really mean to say is I miss my dad and then it gets

934
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,640
cut off here.

935
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,440
What it says.

936
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,320
100 years.

937
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,600
You ran out of characters.

938
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,200
100 years choices.

939
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,840
Happy birthday, big daddy Hoffman.

940
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,160
Um, listen, big daddy Hoffman.

941
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,040
We're very proud of you.

942
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,800
Uh, please don't sell drugs to your friends who will then brag

943
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,040
about it on, uh, on this radio.

944
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,480
Something big daddy would do now to get a little bit of

945
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,120
something on the side joke that Eric is making.

946
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,160
Yeah, you're gonna have a you're gonna have a sore throat.

947
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,800
Travy, if you keep that up, no, it actually is loosening up a

948
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,760
lot of the flim in there.

949
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,240
Gross.

950
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:12,960
I have another message.

951
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,880
Oh, happy birthday, big daddy Hoffman.

952
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,400
Um, your friend, Eric, sounds like he might not be the best

953
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,200
influence on you.

954
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,960
Real choice friend there.

955
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,680
Got another message for Ruth from Brent.

956
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,360
You want to do anything fun with that traveling like a

957
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,040
different Ruth friend.

958
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,600
Okay.

959
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,960
I said it with a smile.

960
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,480
Can you hear the difference here?

961
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,120
Okay.

962
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,600
Ruth.

963
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,160
That's a frown.

964
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,440
This is with a smile.

965
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:33,920
Ruth.

966
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,400
Yeah.

967
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,320
It can start the intonation changes.

968
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,880
Can you do it with like a like a really sad frown?

969
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,240
Ruth.

970
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,480
Yeah.

971
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,720
I'm Ruth.

972
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,080
That's how you sound, Ruth.

973
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,360
Happy birthday, Ruth.

974
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,720
Why do you sound so sad all the time?

975
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,560
Hope you have an excellent year in which you discover how Babby

976
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,280
is formed.

977
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,200
Maybe you'll also have adventures in which you learn

978
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,480
exciting things like the fact that dolphins are not mammals

979
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,400
and the dark truth about Canada.

980
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,600
I better stop before the brothers segue to horses, ghosts

981
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,640
or ghost horses.

982
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,680
Much love, Brent.

983
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,120
You know, we haven't talked about in a while.

984
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,240
Dolphin.

985
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,800
Dolphins.

986
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,280
Dolphins.

987
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,840
What's up with those things?

988
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,040
It's pronounced do fan.

989
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,840
Are they do fan?

990
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,560
Are they fish?

991
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,000
The horse.

992
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,320
There is a fish called the dolphin and is delicious.

993
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,600
That's confusing, right?

994
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,240
I remember being a little kid and they had dolphin and I was

995
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:20,720
eating it.

996
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,000
I had this really like smug, shitty eating grin on my face.

997
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,160
Like, take this, you adorable bitches.

998
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,640
And then someone told me it was a fish and not the mammal.

999
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,400
Why would they name two things dolphin?

1000
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,800
Ruth, we're very happy for you.

1001
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,320
Sounds like you got a big ear out of you.

1002
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,760
Yeah, it also kind of sounds like you're 12.

1003
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:38,800
Why?

1004
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,640
Well, cause she's going to learn how, how Babies are made

1005
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,240
and she's probably about dolphins.

1006
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,120
She's pregnant.

1007
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,000
Oh, okay.

1008
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,400
Yeah.

1009
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,080
Oh, she's fucking dullard.

1010
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,520
I don't think she's about to go into sixth grade where they

1011
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,680
have like sex ed and also dolphins.

1012
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,240
And Canada class.

1013
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,280
You learn your times tables.

1014
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,480
You go to Canada class and then you learn how sex works.

1015
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,240
I don't think that's true, Travis.

1016
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,880
I think when you've been to that new club sex works, hi,

1017
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,080
my name is Ruchika Sherway.

1018
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,400
And I have a podcast called song explorer.

1019
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,040
In each episode, a musician takes apart one of their songs

1020
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,840
and piece by piece tells you the story of how it was made.

1021
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,480
You get an inside look into the creative and technical process

1022
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,720
and a unique view of a song by hearing just the drums

1023
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,480
or just the guitars or say just a world.

1024
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,120
It's a piano.

1025
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:33,840
If you're a fan of music, if you make music, or if you just like to learn how things are made,

1026
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,000
come check it out on maximum fun.org.

1027
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,320
Thanks.

1028
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,680
Y'all want to Yahoo?

1029
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,600
Yeah, I guess I do.

1030
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,040
I guess I always did.

1031
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,640
This Yahoo was sent in by John.

1032
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,240
Then I had a lot of growing up to do.

1033
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,480
Yeah.

1034
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,000
But the magic was in you all along.

1035
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,040
It wasn't in the question.

1036
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,160
That's been the Wonder Years series finale.

1037
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,040
Thank you.

1038
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,600
Good night.

1039
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,040
Sent in by John Severs or Severs.

1040
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,200
What if at the end of the Wonder Years, the camera panned back

1041
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,520
and it revealed that it was not an older version of Kevin,

1042
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,360
but rather an older man that had been following him around for six years.

1043
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,120
The camera just pulled back one like just six inches

1044
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:18,560
to show Daniel Stern there looming by the entire time.

1045
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,440
And then the last shot is just him stabbing him.

1046
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,680
The end, the end of the show.

1047
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,560
And you've been talking behind this kid's back for six years.

1048
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,640
Good show.

1049
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,640
Those, yeah, wonderful, wonderful years.

1050
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,320
Did you guys watch Wonderful Years?

1051
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,400
John Severs or Severs sent this in.

1052
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,200
Thank you, John.

1053
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,600
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Todd Blown, who asks,

1054
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,600
why does Domino's need to do a quality check on their pizza?

1055
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:54,640
I ordered a pizza from Domino's online and they gave me an up to the minute report

1056
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,000
of what they were doing.

1057
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,960
Order placed, prep, bake, quality check, and delivery.

1058
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,200
Well, it's kind of nice to get immediate feedback of just where my order is in the process,

1059
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,320
but I wonder, what is the quality check stage?

1060
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,960
After they bake it and before they deliver,

1061
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,080
do they really do a quality check on the pizza?

1062
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,160
This is actually a really good question.

1063
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,360
It's an amazing question.

1064
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,280
It's a really fantastic question.

1065
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,200
What I love about this is that Tony's saying like,

1066
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,920
let's be honest, guys, I'm just going to shove it in my face.

1067
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,880
Well, no, it's not just that.

1068
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,640
It's like, I've never worked in a pizza place.

1069
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,520
It might only like, I guess I worked concessions at a theater.

1070
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,240
It doesn't really count.

1071
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,840
I did work at a yogurt place.

1072
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,520
I mean, frozen yogurt.

1073
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,480
And it was, I became like a fucking cog in the machine.

1074
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,200
If somebody would be like, I want vanilla with the sprinkle, dinkle, tink, tink.

1075
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,480
And then I would like put all that shit on it without thinking.

1076
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,480
And then it would be the same every fucking time.

1077
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,240
How much variation is there on these Domino pizzas,

1078
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,280
which I imagine is an even like more mindless process.

1079
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,400
Like it is just a assembly line that like,

1080
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,880
you need somebody to like scope out each pizza and be like,

1081
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,840
oh, you forgot to put sauce on this one.

1082
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,440
How the fuck did you forget to do that?

1083
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,160
Quality check.

1084
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,920
This pizza is upside down.

1085
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,800
That's not going to fly.

1086
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,160
Much more likely is they have to have something on the pizza tracker

1087
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,760
and they don't want to have like arguing over who's going to drive it to you.

1088
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,680
Jim takes a smoke break.

1089
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,320
Yeah, we put the thing on the little conveyor belt

1090
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,240
and we go smoke of the fattest blunt.

1091
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,000
And we are going to drive to your house.

1092
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,480
There was-

1093
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,680
Jim scratches himself and then debates whether to wash hands.

1094
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,680
Jim sneaks off to the break room to study for his GED

1095
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
because he's finally busting out of this joint

1096
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,400
and he's going to make something of himself and start a new life.

1097
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,680
There's no room for that.

1098
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,560
I'm just hungry.

1099
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,920
I, on the pizza track, speaking of, speaking of which,

1100
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,520
on the pizza tracker at Domino's,

1101
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,080
it not only says what activity is being performed on your za-

1102
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,440
It says who does it.

1103
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,400
It says who does it.

1104
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,160
And we got into, when we were, when that first started,

1105
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,400
we noticed when like we would have friends over

1106
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,120
and we'd order some Domino's,

1107
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,360
that it was always a guy named Daniel that made the pizzas.

1108
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,480
Oh, pizza Daniel.

1109
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,320
Pizza Daniel, as we referred to him.

1110
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,280
Yeah, so pizza Daniel, I had some friends.

1111
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,360
This was like literally mid-

1112
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,160
Whenever Domino's decided to stop sucking.

1113
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,440
So like four or five years ago,

1114
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,480
we ordered Domino's last weekend

1115
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,680
and who should be preparing the pie?

1116
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,360
But pizza Daniel.

1117
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,480
Daniel, if you're listening, you're doing a great job.

1118
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,200
I just need you to like advance in the org.

1119
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:35,760
I feel like-

1120
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,720
No, hold on, what if this is like an undercover boss thing

1121
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,520
where Daniel now owns, his last name is Domino,

1122
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,440
like Daniel Domino, but he still comes back

1123
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,560
because he cares about you

1124
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,040
because you gave him his start in the pizza industry

1125
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,800
and he's like, did Justin order a pizza?

1126
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,280
I got this.

1127
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,320
I got this one.

1128
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,960
Listen, I'm gonna see, I make bank,

1129
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,200
but if my boy J-Man needs him a slice, I will do-

1130
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,160
I know how he like it.

1131
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,880
That's probably not how it actually happened.

1132
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,360
He do know how I like it, to be fair.

1133
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,800
Daniel do know how he like it.

1134
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,400
I think he's stuck underneath that crust ceiling

1135
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,640
and I think he needs to bust through it.

1136
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,360
I think you're being an enabler, Justin.

1137
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,560
Although I do love like,

1138
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,080
I remember every time I would come over

1139
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,160
and we would order Domino's at your place

1140
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,080
and we were usually doing something else

1141
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,760
like playing board games or something like that.

1142
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,200
You would load up that pizza tracker screen

1143
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,440
and you would turn it towards to face all of us

1144
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,040
like it was the fucking scoreboard

1145
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,480
at a fucking football game.

1146
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,200
Or like a countdown for a nuclear launch.

1147
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,560
Yeah, and we would get like really nervous.

1148
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,240
Like it's been in quality check for like five minutes.

1149
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,160
What could the fucking possible issue be?

1150
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,680
You know, it's funny, it's funny.

1151
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,600
You always see them in quality check.

1152
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,840
You never see one get bumped back though.

1153
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,200
They don't update, start it over.

1154
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,040
Start it over, it was not good.

1155
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,320
Had odd number of pepperonis, would not pass.

1156
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,280
Was bad pizza.

1157
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,160
Trying new.

1158
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,800
There's a secret spot on the tracker line

1159
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,080
right behind quality check

1160
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,440
that just says trying harder.

1161
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,680
Look deep within ourself and realize wasn't our best.

1162
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,280
Sometimes they'll go back to quality check

1163
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,640
and then get bumped back again.

1164
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,720
And it's like, we are just not on our game today.

1165
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,840
Please forgive.

1166
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,800
Somebody grilled it.

1167
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,800
Where the fuck did they even find a grill?

1168
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,480
Forgot to bake it.

1169
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,200
Forgot to bake.

1170
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,800
Forgot to bake.

1171
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,240
Made pizza soup.

1172
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,360
Mildly poisoned.

1173
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,200
I'm 25 and I have a small tight group of friends.

1174
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,760
You're the worst, you're the worst man.

1175
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,120
And my sister.

1176
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,040
I used to say when I get married,

1177
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,520
my best friend from high school would be my maid of honor,

1178
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,520
but lately we haven't been best friends.

1179
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,640
She now only calls my sister to hang out

1180
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,640
and I only see her if we're all together.

1181
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,440
I also am becoming closer with other friends.

1182
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,440
I'm getting married and I don't know

1183
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,520
if she still expects to be my maid of honor,

1184
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,120
but I no longer want her to be.

1185
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,920
Should I talk to her about this

1186
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,200
or just make the decision?

1187
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,080
Thanks so much.

1188
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,400
I'm a new listener and I've got a lot of episodes

1189
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,080
to catch up on, but I love the show.

1190
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,040
That's from Fighting Friends in Philly.

1191
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,840
There is easy, easy answer for this.

1192
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,240
Okay, I'll see if we agree

1193
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,120
because you've been through this more recently.

1194
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,000
What do you think?

1195
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,080
Okay, Justin, write your answer down on a piece of paper.

1196
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,920
Well, no, it's not something I personally went through

1197
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,000
because I don't think there was any question

1198
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,040
for who it would be.

1199
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,280
We had that triangle solution figured out

1200
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,160
pretty far in advance.

1201
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,920
And it took a lot of the legwork out of it.

1202
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,920
But there is some similar level to this

1203
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,200
in terms of who you invite,

1204
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,960
who you include in your bridal party.

1205
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,640
And I will say this, if you have a friend

1206
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,040
who you are no longer super, super close with,

1207
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,640
that friend is probably also cognizant of that distance.

1208
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,040
And if you ask them to be your maid of honor,

1209
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,960
it is going to put them in a genuinely

1210
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,120
super, super weird position.

1211
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:51,600
You know what I mean?

1212
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,480
Where you say, we don't talk anymore,

1213
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,840
but I want you to be my maid of honor

1214
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,600
because of some arbitrary pact we made when we were 15.

1215
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,080
That's going to make them feel very uncomfortable.

1216
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:02,800
That's the thing.

1217
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,400
Sometimes you're kind of putting the cart before the horse

1218
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,720
because this should be one of those moments

1219
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,760
where it's not an opportunity for you

1220
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,120
to rekindle a friendship.

1221
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,600
It should reflect where you're at in your life

1222
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,920
and who you would want in that position.

1223
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,600
So it should be exactly who you want.

1224
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,440
The fact that you are not choosing her

1225
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,400
is a statement on where your relationship is at,

1226
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,720
but now is not the time to try to repair it.

1227
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,760
You should put who you'd feel most comfortable with there.

1228
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,960
I mean, that's the honest reflection of your relationship.

1229
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,240
I really feel like there's a statute of limitations

1230
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,680
on that kind of discussion and promise.

1231
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,000
Kids who pretended marriages when they were eight

1232
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,840
and had their best friends be their maid of honor,

1233
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,160
I don't think that best friend is rolling up at 28

1234
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,840
going, you picked your sister?

1235
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,960
But we had a deal.

1236
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,440
I feel like if you haven't talked about it in the last year,

1237
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,960
she probably isn't thinking about it either.

1238
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,480
Or if she is, it's like,

1239
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,320
oh, I remember when we talked about that once.

1240
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,760
Man, I haven't seen her in forever.

1241
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,920
But if you're getting married at 27

1242
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,480
and you made somebody a promise at 21,

1243
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,440
Jacob Dunkel, that maybe they would be included

1244
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,920
in a special way on your special day, Jacob Dunkel,

1245
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,800
promises were made on the river that night

1246
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,280
that apparently I'm the only one that remembers.

1247
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,880
Um, does she actually say that her sister

1248
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,000
would be the maid of honor

1249
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,160
should she not choose the best friend?

1250
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:32,480
Is that-

1251
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,600
No, she does say she's becoming closer with other friends.

1252
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,320
Yeah, you know what, honestly,

1253
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,160
and this is kind of pragmatic of me,

1254
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,440
but like, I say have your sister do it

1255
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,760
just because you're gonna keep knowing your sister

1256
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,880
and you're never gonna regret that.

1257
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,000
And it sounds like you're not like,

1258
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,120
like, great with friendships right now

1259
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,560
at this point in your life.

1260
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,360
And maybe you just-

1261
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,280
It's kind of a rebuilding year for friendships.

1262
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,440
Yeah, it sounds like you're kind of a rebuilding year.

1263
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,600
Maybe just stick with the one relationship

1264
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,360
that you are gonna continue to have.

1265
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,520
Because the other side of that is

1266
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,160
if you don't have a clear front runner

1267
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,000
for your maid of honor or matron of honor,

1268
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,120
best man or whatever-

1269
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,040
Then have a reality show about it.

1270
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,200
Yeah, going with the relative,

1271
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,720
especially a sibling,

1272
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,520
is usually like no one in your friend group

1273
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,240
is going to be upset that they weren't picked.

1274
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:20,480
Sure.

1275
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,760
I feel like everyone kind of goes,

1276
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,960
well, yeah, it's a sibling.

1277
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,600
Well, yeah.

1278
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,520
I just think, I think there's like,

1279
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,640
the thing everyone thinks about

1280
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,160
when they're having a wedding is,

1281
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,480
will this person be offended

1282
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,680
if I don't include them in some way?

1283
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,960
What you don't think about,

1284
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,400
and what you absolutely should,

1285
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,520
because it's the thing that,

1286
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,680
it's the only thing you think about the day of,

1287
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:45,280
is this like giving this person too much authority

1288
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,920
or credit or involvement in this wedding

1289
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,280
that does not reflect

1290
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,920
where our relationship actually is.

1291
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,640
Like if you invite somebody

1292
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,280
that you've hung out with twice,

1293
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,040
they're going to feel kind of weird,

1294
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,920
and you might feel kind of weird having them there.

1295
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,920
That's not to say that any of us

1296
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,680
necessarily did that for our weddings,

1297
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,520
but it was like we realized

1298
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,960
while we were inviting people,

1299
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,600
oh man, it's going to be weird

1300
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,960
if that person's there.

1301
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,640
That will be weird for us.

1302
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,400
Yeah, I'm usually mister keep everybody happy,

1303
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,400
but weddings specifically

1304
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,240
seem to me an opportunity to really be honest,

1305
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,240
and not punitively honest.

1306
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,560
It's just not an opportunity to play politics.

1307
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,840
It is a perfect, honest statement

1308
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,520
of where your relationship is at,

1309
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,520
and if they want to fix that later or whatever,

1310
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:41,920
that's fine,

1311
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,400
but no one has a right to get hurt by that.

1312
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,120
It is literally the most honest thing you can say.

1313
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,560
There are other people in my life

1314
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,680
that I want with me,

1315
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,360
and it is perfectly reasonable

1316
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,880
for you to be as selfish as you want

1317
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,480
and not consider other people's feelings

1318
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,160
because it is your wedding.

1319
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,680
It is your day to do it.

1320
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,600
One of the criteria Teresa and I used

1321
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,440
was 20 years from now,

1322
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,240
30 years from now,

1323
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,920
when we look at our wedding pictures,

1324
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,000
who will be the people

1325
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,600
that we would regret not seeing in them,

1326
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,720
and who would be the people

1327
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,480
that we would still be hanging out with

1328
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,240
and reminiscing about the day with,

1329
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,000
and not like,

1330
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,960
hey, who in this moment

1331
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,320
have we had a really good time with?

1332
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,920
Who sells us weed right now?

1333
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,520
When you're 70 and you're thinking

1334
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,480
about your memories

1335
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,920
before both of you are shuffled off

1336
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,120
this mortal coil,

1337
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,120
you don't want the last thing you see

1338
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,880
is you don't want that to be weed, Brian.

1339
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,160
You don't want it to be karaoke Kim

1340
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:38,640
or whatever.

1341
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,120
Who is the person that if you went

1342
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,080
through some shit,

1343
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,040
that's not your weed deal,

1344
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:43,600
unless it is.

1345
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,200
What if you have a really solid connection

1346
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:47,840
with your weed deal

1347
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,320
and you're like,

1348
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,520
we want weed Brian up there.

1349
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,880
Or what if you have a very tenuous,

1350
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,840
you have a tenuous connection

1351
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,560
with weed Brian,

1352
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,200
but then he turns out,

1353
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,160
hey, you know who we should

1354
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:56,880
hang out with more?

1355
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,680
Weed Brian.

1356
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,120
Yeah, I like him a lot.

1357
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,080
And then you're 70,

1358
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,600
who's sitting next to you

1359
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,960
as you're flipping through

1360
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,920
your photo album?

1361
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,680
It is weed Brian and he's 70

1362
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,200
and he's still fucking parties

1363
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,200
harder than any of you motherfuckers.

1364
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,200
But in a really like conscientious,

1365
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,560
like I always feel closer

1366
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,920
when I'm partying with weed Brian.

1367
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,320
I feel closer to my chosen deity.

1368
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,520
Safe way.

1369
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,200
He plays shuffleboard with me

1370
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:19,920
on Thursdays

1371
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,440
and he sells me the dankest kush.

1372
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,000
It's tight, tight bud.

1373
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,720
I love Brian.

1374
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,720
I love Brian and I love his product.

1375
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,400
Here's a Yahoo.

1376
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,680
It was sent in by Drew Davenport.

1377
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,160
Thank you Drew.

1378
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,760
It's by Yahoo answers user bunny

1379
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,320
who asks,

1380
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,880
have you ever felt someone's body heat

1381
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,760
when they were near you

1382
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,120
but weren't touching you?

1383
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:43,520
It's so cool.

1384
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,480
Sorry, sorry.

1385
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,120
What were you saying?

1386
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,320
I was too busy throwing up.

1387
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,320
Dear listeners,

1388
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,600
if you are ever aware

1389
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,240
that you were having

1390
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,440
this experience with me,

1391
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,120
please do not make me aware of it.

1392
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,320
But that's not their fault

1393
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,280
because you run hot

1394
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,200
and you it's true Justin.

1395
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,280
You're a fucking hot chassis,

1396
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,640
especially post show

1397
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,080
when I'm in my kimono.

1398
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:02,720
Oh my God.

1399
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,960
The makeup's coming off.

1400
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,880
That's pure sexuality there.

1401
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,160
It's not about sexuality.

1402
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:08,800
We're talking about

1403
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,360
literal physical heat Celsius Kelvin.

1404
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,000
I'm nothing.

1405
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:12,560
I'm nothing.

1406
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,840
But I run cool.

1407
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,360
I get like a lizard up on that stage.

1408
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,520
I gotta, I gotta think fast.

1409
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,000
I have quick.

1410
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,400
That's true.

1411
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,600
Griffin doesn't show up

1412
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,560
on the thermo scan.

1413
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,280
No, I don't.

1414
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,000
I'm invisible.

1415
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,200
Can't be targeted by drones.

1416
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,480
Nice try Obama.

1417
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,520
Never tell you at the time

1418
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,800
Griffin killed predator.

1419
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,680
I killed predator

1420
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,880
with my cold, cold body.

1421
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,520
I did a show.

1422
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,320
What did you do?

1423
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:30,960
He says, he said,

1424
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,960
I hear jokes and I love these jokes.

1425
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,920
I did.

1426
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,480
Got behind you.

1427
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,200
And what's funny,

1428
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:35,920
Justin runs hot.

1429
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,720
Griffin runs cool.

1430
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,520
I run just right.

1431
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,160
You run just right.

1432
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,560
I feel it.

1433
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,800
Is this, but is this like kind of,

1434
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,320
I think this is one of the many,

1435
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,000
many things on this earth

1436
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,080
that science just can't explain.

1437
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,320
Body heat.

1438
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,920
Well, I think they got it.

1439
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,720
I think they've probably

1440
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,200
figured that out.

1441
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,480
This is just one of those.

1442
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,680
It's just one of those things

1443
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,560
like chakras.

1444
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,000
It's like Kim trails.

1445
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
It's like ESP.

1446
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,240
It's like.

1447
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,160
It's like why someone's hair

1448
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:06,720
smells good.

1449
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,440
EDM.

1450
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,640
Why does hair smell good?

1451
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:10,880
It's just, it's,

1452
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,600
you know what it is?

1453
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,000
It's my, it's my aura

1454
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,200
and it has a color

1455
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,160
and you can look at that color

1456
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:16,800
and you can tell what my

1457
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,680
astrological sign is.

1458
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,800
And that color is warm.

1459
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,320
Well, no.

1460
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:20,800
Well, yes.

1461
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,240
The color is warm,

1462
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,600
but it has nothing to do with the,

1463
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,280
has nothing to do with feeling it

1464
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:25,920
and picking it up

1465
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,960
with your thermoreceptors.

1466
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,280
You can, there's an extra receptor.

1467
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,000
You're saying that

1468
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,680
we interpret it as body heat,

1469
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,480
but that's just because

1470
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,840
we're reacting to the aura

1471
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,480
that this person has.

1472
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:34,720
Yeah.

1473
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,920
You're feeling my color.

1474
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,520
Uh-huh.

1475
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,240
It's an ochre.

1476
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,960
You just don't understand.

1477
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,160
I feel like these concepts

1478
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:42,880
that I'm giving you.

1479
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,240
I mean, body heat is a concrete thing.

1480
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,360
You have a temperature

1481
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,160
and if someone's close.

1482
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,280
What causes that temperature?

1483
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:49,520
What?

1484
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,480
Right now I'm sweating.

1485
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,880
Blood burning of calories.

1486
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:53,840
Okay.

1487
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,040
But what are those?

1488
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:56,400
Come on.

1489
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,200
Let's do this too.

1490
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,320
Let's, you started this.

1491
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,520
Let's finish this together.

1492
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,720
I will take you down this road.

1493
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,200
All right.

1494
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,280
What's, what even is a calorie?

1495
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,200
A calorie is a unit of energy.

1496
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:05,760
Okay.

1497
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,200
What's, where does that energy

1498
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:07,760
come from though?

1499
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,840
From the food.

1500
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,080
Right.

1501
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:11,600
Okay.

1502
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,680
I made a loaf of beautiful

1503
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,360
sunflower oil bread yesterday

1504
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,760
and I don't remember.

1505
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,320
Let me think.

1506
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,400
I put sunflower in it

1507
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,440
and I had ancient,

1508
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,480
I had reclaimed grains

1509
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,360
that I put in there.

1510
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,640
A vegan egg that I put in there.

1511
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,080
I don't remember the part

1512
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,200
of the recipe

1513
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,080
where I sprinkled on some energy in it.

1514
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,240
So just food for thought

1515
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,120
and food for food.

1516
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,160
Well, Gervin, I feel like

1517
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:38,960
you've won this one.

1518
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,720
Really put Justin in this place.

1519
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,000
I don't remember putting energy

1520
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,640
in my bread.

1521
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,920
No, I mean, it's Justin.

1522
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,720
You look like a dumbo.

1523
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,080
You look like a dumb piece of shit

1524
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,200
right now because you tried

1525
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,080
to step to me.

1526
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:50,960
I'm just saying there are things

1527
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,240
out there science can't explain.

1528
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:52,880
And I'm saying heat.

1529
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,680
And when they try to,

1530
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,480
they look like stupid assholes.

1531
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,760
They look like dumb assholes.

1532
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,120
I'm saying heat, energy,

1533
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,720
hair smells.

1534
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,480
Yeah.

1535
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,440
That good feeling you get

1536
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,800
when you dance with a loved one.

1537
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,560
Can you explain that feeling

1538
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,280
to me, Justin?

1539
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:05,920
Dr. Science?

1540
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,520
Hey, Dr. Oz,

1541
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,240
because that's what you sound

1542
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,200
like right now, a fraud.

1543
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,440
Got them.

1544
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,480
I guess I just,

1545
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,040
maybe Justin's just buying

1546
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,000
into some of those,

1547
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,440
quote, text books,

1548
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,880
end quote, I've heard about.

1549
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,600
It's just like a,

1550
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,680
it's like a unit of energy.

1551
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,320
Oh my God.

1552
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,360
Yeah, according to what,

1553
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,320
what studies have you done,

1554
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,360
Justin, that have proved that?

1555
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:26,880
What have you seen with

1556
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,920
your own goddamn eyeballs?

1557
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,080
I've burnt food.

1558
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,040
You burnt food.

1559
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,080
Well, that seems wasteful.

1560
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:32,960
Take that Africa.

1561
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:33,120
Yeah.

1562
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,640
Hope you guys,

1563
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,520
I hope you guys didn't need that.

1564
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,080
Oh, what's that?

1565
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,280
You super needed it.

1566
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,400
You super needed that

1567
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,680
cereal that I burnt.

1568
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,320
Interesting.

1569
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,600
Well, at least Justin

1570
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,240
learned something.

1571
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,560
Oh, people are dying in the streets.

1572
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,720
Well, Justin learned one thing

1573
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,520
that it doesn't,

1574
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,640
doesn't even actually exist.

1575
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,600
Cause how did the energy get

1576
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,040
in the cereal in the first place?

1577
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:51,920
You figure that out

1578
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,960
and then you can come talk to me

1579
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,360
and tell them,

1580
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,000
why don't you think

1581
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,200
about making some donations?

1582
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,680
They fortify it.

1583
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,400
Oh my God.

1584
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,440
Fortify it.

1585
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,160
It's calories.

1586
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,640
I would, I'm going to,

1587
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,840
I'm going to just dissolve you

1588
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,600
with all your logic's

1589
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,720
gonna come crumbling around you.

1590
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,600
You're going to dissolve

1591
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,560
at the molecular level,

1592
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,360
which is something I'd say

1593
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,880
if I believed in molecules.

1594
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,080
So this has been my brother,

1595
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,880
my brother and me.

1596
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,800
It's been our last episode.

1597
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,000
It's been our final episode.

1598
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,800
I hope everybody,

1599
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,840
reject science.

1600
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,600
I hope everybody learned something

1601
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,560
and I hope that you heard me

1602
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,080
do the quotation marks

1603
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,760
when I said that just then.

1604
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,040
I think those are scare quotes.

1605
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:27,840
Is that what those are?

1606
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,040
Um, thank you for

1607
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,160
listening to our program.

1608
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,560
Uh, we hope you had

1609
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,080
some fun listening to it.

1610
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,520
Uh, it is optimal

1611
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,200
for you to listen to it

1612
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,400
while you're on Norco.

1613
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,840
So I would highly suggest

1614
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,040
taking some of that

1615
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,000
to really get it.

1616
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,160
This is our most 4D episode.

1617
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,000
Yeah, uh, yeah,

1618
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,040
it's got sense around

1619
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,400
and D box and everything.

1620
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,040
Um, so we've got like,

1621
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,800
uh, Travis,

1622
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,720
you've got new merch written here.

1623
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,920
I don't see any new merch

1624
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,960
up on the store.

1625
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,880
So the new merch should be up this week.

1626
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,160
Um, keep an eye out at it.

1627
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,840
We're not exactly sure what date,

1628
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,720
but hopefully soon.

1629
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,240
And that merch is, uh,

1630
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,200
new tote bags,

1631
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,960
buttons, uh, stickers,

1632
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,920
bumper stickers.

1633
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,120
Uh, it's really, really

1634
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:09,920
put up the patch.

1635
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,960
I love that patch.

1636
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,920
Yeah, the patch,

1637
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,680
the fraternal order of brothers patch.

1638
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,320
It's so, so, so done by Justin Russo,

1639
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,120
who, who had,

1640
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,320
we haven't thanked him in a long time,

1641
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,040
but he did so much of our artwork

1642
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,880
and he's, he's so goddamn talented.

1643
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,480
Um, that's our visual,

1644
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,840
our visual identity

1645
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,000
is Justin Russo.

1646
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:28,960
Thank you very much, Justin.

1647
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,960
And thanks, thanks to Bob Ball

1648
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,600

1649
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,120
We haven't thanked him in a long time either.

1650
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,320
Yeah, thank you, Bob Ball.

1651
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,240
Um, and Bob Ball VO is his website.

00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,480
incorrectly, topatico.com.

1664
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:56,960

And my smooth face.

.com

1685
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,360
I want to thank John Roderick

1686
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,160
and the Long Winters

1687

for the use of our theme song.

1688
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,800
John Roderick and the Long Winters

1689
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,680
for the use of our theme song

1690
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,640
into Departure off the album,

1691
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,440
Putting the Days to Bed.

1692
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,200
It's a great album.

1693
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,400
Great people.

1694
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,680
We got a lot of positive response

1695
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,080
from, from when we had John on the show.

1696
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:42,640
It was really great for us.

1697
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,800
A lot of people said that he was much funnier.

1698
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,720
One guy said he was much funnier than us,

1699
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,440
that we kind of didn't do a good job.

1700
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,400
Interesting.

1701
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,320
Kind of showed us up a little bit.

1702
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:52,560
Interesting.

1703
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,920
He's one of the best humans.

1704
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,480
He's a good human.

1705
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,120
He's a good human.

1706
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,320
You know where he was last night?

1707
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,240
He was seeing

1708
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,040
Fucking stalking him now?

1709
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,120
Fucking Presidents of the United States of America.

1710
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:03,680
Playing out.

1711
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,800
Aw.

1712
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,600
I know.

1713
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,160
I know.

1714
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:06,640
I know.

1715
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,040
I know.

1716
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:07,360
I know.

1717
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,240
That's pretty incredible.

1718
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,880
You can follow us on Facebook.

I'll try to post funny stuff.

1726
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,200
We have a fan group on Facebook

1727
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,200
that's actually kind of been popping off lately.

1728
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,200
I've been trying to be a little bit more involved in it.

1729
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,120
But, and what's great about it is

1730
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,640
you have to request permission to be in it.

1731
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,880
So it's not just like spambots and dickheads.

1732
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,880
Cause if you see a spambot or a dickhead,

1733
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,000
we can just like boot them.

1734
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,400
And then-

1735
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,440
They won't let me in.

1736
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,240
I've been requesting.

1737
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:38,480
Yeah.

1738
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:38,960
You know why?

1739
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,080
I joined it for like three years.

1740
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,000
You're always trying to fucking sell us shoes.

1741
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,720
That is true.

1742
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,040
Yeah.

1743
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,440

1753
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,520
listen to Oh No, Ross and Kerry.

1754
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,640

I'm oil pulling.

1765
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,280
Do you guys want that final Yahoo?

1766
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,240
Yeah.

01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,000
Thank you, Drew.
