1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,240
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother mean advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,840
My name is Justin McElroy and I'm your oldest brother?

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,280
My name is Miller's brother and I and I'm Travis your brother.

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,640
I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin rock and roll McElroy.

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,480
I have an emergency that needs to be addressed immediately.

10
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,400
Is it Travis's microphone?

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,080
Should we Travis's microphone is fine don't see you fucking draw people's attention to it now

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,440
they're now they can't unsee.

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,080
I think they'll figure out that he's talking to us.

14
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,440
No you did the same thing with the person mowing the lawn and you're like they'll hear it they'll

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,040
hear it and then we got a million complaints and now I'm gonna get a million tweets saying

16
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,600
why was Travis recording on a fucking talk boy why was he recording on a goddamn yak back?

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,240
Can I get to my emergency?

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,280
Do your bit.

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:41,440
We all it's not a bit it's life or death uh we are recording we have one hour to record

20
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,720
the best show of our lives uh it's kind of like the movie Speed we're under a deadline

21
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,200
uh and right before we like right once the call had started and we had started the recording

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:01,040
I reached for my can of crisp refreshing pepsi max and realized that it was empty.

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,880
Oh my god brothers I have no beverages can you hear it already?

24
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,880
I can you're getting all creaky and croaky like some sort of mountain man like some sort of man

25
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,880
made it like cleft into a mountain face.

26
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,680
Oil can pepsi max.

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,680
Yeah pepsi max me.

28
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,680
It's not inaccurate because once while living in Chicago I had to change my license plate but the

29
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,040
screws were rusted on and I fucking used pepsi max to dissolve the to dissolve that that rust

30
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,520
right off there and it works that's a thing you can do but I'm like I'm you're putting that you're

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,040
putting that in your shit box Justin so just for thought I'm freaking out though like I'm freaking

32
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:44,240
out because I have no beverage and I must record a comedy podcast with no drink at all yeah as

33
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,120
those of you who are at the Midwest live shows know I need a certain sort of drink for those

34
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,080
but I'm just talking about like a general beverage yeah like a wet like a wet fluid I'm freaking out

35
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,840
I'm already thinking about exit strategies.

36
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,400
Hey Justin we're gonna make it through this together and I just I know that you're in a

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,720
panic state but I do have to point out that the movie Speed did not involve them having to drive

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,920
for an hour or else the film would have been called Duration.

39
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,880
Well it would have been great though if it was like we have to drive for an hour because that's

40
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,680
the closest store that has Pepsi Max. I have two other qualifying factors to this uh one I ate

41
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:29,600
three spicy buffalo wheat thins before I realized the beverage situation and also I have a bowl of

42
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,280
leftover Honey Nut Cheerios milk that is next to me and this episode for me is about not

43
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,800
drinking it because I am I'm worried I'm gonna get desperate you know what I mean like without

44
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,440
a beverage. So when we hear the sound the telltale sound of sloppy slopping coming from your oh

45
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,880
and there it goes. Not yet not yet I'm not I can't do it. Jesus take the wheel

46
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,440
as specifically from Justin's hand. And when you say leftover Cheerios it's five o'clock

47
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:06,240
it's five p.m somewhere specifically sitting sitting for a while. Oh god damn it don't

48
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,440
don't do it just do it I'm not gonna ask your question instead. This is an advice show for

49
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,520
the modern era I should have mentioned before uh also a quick thank you to everybody who came to

50
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,600
those shows we'll be um trickling those out uh over the next few months I'm assuming uh so if

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,360
we make like recurring jokes they were recorded in three nights in succession but thank you to

52
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,720
everybody who came out that was a lot of fun. I think the I think the only thing we'll probably

53
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,360
end up referring back to from the trip was the time that we did a live show that two people

54
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,680
two and a half people got engaged well sorry four and a half people five people got engaged at our

55
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,000
live show. Also speaking of live shows I believe we'll be announcing a new batch of those at the

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,400
end of this episode. Holy shit will we that is correct yeah we will yes we will serendipity

57
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,800
wow god damn stay tuned where's it gonna be ah they're already gone they all fast forwarded

58
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,960
you guys want to kick it for a little while yeah yeah let's just get do I so I have time to go

59
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,600
grab a drink fuck no you don't let's get some answers dog all right let's get some answers

60
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,560
going here we go first I want to tell you guys about I was watching Survivor last night you

61
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,840
guys watched Survivor oh fuck yeah well we got time to chat um the it there was an amazing moment

62
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,880
last night Survivor where Jeff was like it was the reward challenge and Jeff Probst says and once you

63
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,960
get to the end of that zipline what's gonna be waiting for you is a picnic and these adults were

64
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:38,640
like whoo and then Jeff Probst adds a pizza picnic and these 13 adults lose their minds like the idea

65
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:45,520
of a pizza picnic was so thrilling to them that they that they were willing to climb or or solve

66
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,640
or whatever Jeff has swallow whatever Jeff had in store for them they had to get to that pizza and

67
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,560
when I get it they were trying one guy was trying to decide somebody else to take on the trip and

68
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,520
this woman was like super fan of what pizza picnics yeah all of us are yeah all of it that

69
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,240
describes all of us super fan of pizza picnics or do you mean Survivor as in like as if to say

70
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,240
that somehow qualifies you more what's your favorite part of Survivor ooh definitely when

71
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,960
they eat pizza on it I like the parts of Survivor when they visit like uh developing nations and

72
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,480
they bring school books to the kids so enriching this cultural exchange you're welcome and then they

73
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,320
have a secret meal they always have a secret meal before or after that they don't invite the native

74
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,840
peoples too that's just the secret uh secret american meal anyway here's the questions I have

75
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,440
several jobs where I lost and found bins would fill up with pretty nice clothes that stayed there

76
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:49,360
for months on end my question is twofold first oh oh that cotton mouth first what is the statute

77
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,000
of limits what if I got like really good at pronunciation my problem that's the secret your

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,760
mouth has been too wet in case a moist mouth though myself what is the statute of limitations

79
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,520
on lost and found items how long do I have to wait until I can claim one as my own second what

80
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,800
is the statute of limitations on wearing clothes to work that I scored from lost and found at work

81
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,320
that's for free clothes in California there's an important factor here do you think and of course

82
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,720
they can't answer because that's not how this communication system works but do you think that

83
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,040
this is a job in which they are pretty sure that the clothing are left by customers or left by

84
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:39,600
other people that work there or it is left by the ceo or whatever boss-like figure exists

85
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:46,240
in this establishment um who just stocks the lost and found with tight looking clothes

86
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,160
to make them think that they have a certain level of clientele coming in that can just

87
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,080
lackadaisically leave their their clothes lying around and so they think the business is doing

88
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,320
very very well is that a mark echo hoodie nice nice summit we we're doing great we're pulling

89
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,920
in that mark echo money apparently I know we laid off 14 people last week but I guess we're doing

90
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:16,320
mark echo good are those are those Dolce and Gabbana jams who wore those into the store we

91
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:23,520
we are attracting quite the clientele here maybe it's a test what what what how could this be

92
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,640
brothers how can how are people leaving their fucking clothes behind but that's what I'm saying

93
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,360
because if it's customers I totally get it because like that's the kind of thing where it's like did

94
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,080
I leave it at the movies today we went out for coffee at where did I leave my hoodie you know

95
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,800

115
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:52,240
a ball python or corn snake update I have a budget of four hundred dollars or update please help

116
00:10:52,240 --> 00:11:02,240
snake attack okay slightly less on the expertise scale something between ball python and the

117
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:09,280
ball python and the anaconda from anaconda maybe you go with snake pliskin he requires a lot of

118
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,840
care and feeding and he's always trying to escape uh-huh that's a different that's a challenge his

119
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:21,760
depth perception is terrible so don't try some sort of solid snake yeah just one long solid snake

120
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,200
yeah don't try and get any liquid snakes I always wondered about that that's not a good code name

121
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:34,160
for like a super super duper spy because I'm out of rats Timmy hasn't come back to feed me yeah

122
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,160
do you think that was a subtle reference to like solid thing was like a boner

123
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,880
like I saw Debbie last night she was looking real good I got a real solid snake I'm not

124
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,640
gonna fucking yes and this shit if you want to see it through to its natural conclusion that's

125
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,960
on you no I'll help you out I'll do a whole self-dialogue about it you're saying Hideo

126
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:59,520
Kojima was like what can we do what can we name this person that will be the most dude studliest

127
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,040
name imaginable and it's like how about Guy Hardcock and no can we get something with a

128
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,880
little bit more illusion than that something a little bit more a little bit more prairie home

129
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,560
companion a little bit less jerky boys I really like the idea of somebody like looking at somebody

130
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,480
else with a ball python and being like uh can I can I ask an important question though how do you

131
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,880
measure snake expertise how do you how do you here's here's my snake expertise you want to know

132
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,600
what it is I've never been bitten by a snake so I think I'm pretty fucking good at it right I think

133
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm pretty good at snakes I live in Texas it's not out of the the realm of possibilities I've seen a

134
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,160
snake when you uh when you buy a snake they actually give you a little counter that you hang

135
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,800
on the wall and says like day since swallowed right and if he and it ticks up every day and

136
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,200
if you get to like a hundred that seems like a pretty good streak you're ready for the next level

137
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,600
you get to cash that card in and they're like oh in 100 days okay here's a king cobra but you well

138
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,840
well king cobras can be sweethearts actually if you milk them properly I think the the hardest

139
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,280
thing about owning a snake would be learning to overcome the urge like when you see the snake

140
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,560
when you walk into your room like give me an axe yeah it's a snake I gotta kill it well I bought

141
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,920
you do you guys want to hear a fun a fun true snake anecdote is it even remotely funny yeah

142
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,400
Bob and Bradbury and Teresa and I we went to the Cincinnati zoo okay and we were walking around we

143
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:37,040
were drinking some beers we were getting a mild zoo drunk they have that yeah and we walked into

144
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,360
the reptile house and as we walked in I passed this tiny bearded gentleman who who was wearing

145
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,920
a zoo staff shirt panicking at a door and he just turned to me with no preface and said hold this

146
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,760
and dumped a giant snake in my arms that's and turned back to the door and his key had gotten

147
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:02,400
stuck in the door and he was panicking which did not put me at ease but then you left me standing

148
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:08,720
there with no explanation there is no way this happened this did not happen at a professional

149
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,680
proof of it was it was it a zoo or was it like a dream zoo in your mind that you dreamed no this

150
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:23,840
was real and I it was fucking terrifying what kind of snake was it it was a yellow one oh maybe a uh

151
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,800
San Francisco garter snake maybe it's a corn snake no it was bigger than that he seemed he had a mean

152
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,080
look in his eye how um what do you do with your old snake when you because you obviously can't

153
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:42,000
keep these snakes together snakes hate each other so much you know why snakes are so fast is they

154
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,320
have to be fast as soon as they're born their mom turns around like a swallow gulp they are the

155
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,880
gulpinest animals around and for that reason I I have a sinister love for them um but what do you

156
00:14:52,880 --> 00:15:00,720
do when you get a new harder snake you have to pass your snake to a novice I guess that's true

157
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,360
yeah there's probably a craigslist like chapter a chapter of craigslist just full of old snakes

158
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,360
just old basic snakes you got a real basic snake there do you get snake trade-in credit

159
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,360
if you trade in here at snake stop do you get snake trading credit for your all-use snakes

160
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,680
hey I guess you'll never believe it we got a western hog nose dropping next month that's

161
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,840
really gonna blow your mind you want to reserve it and we also can sell you a subscription to

162
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,640
snake informer for 15 a month it's a really great deal and that's going to get you 10 off

163
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,920
the taiwan beauty snake start brushing up on your flute because we've got some of those scary vipers

164
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:45,680
and baskets you ready for the next level mario's at it again I'm bad at this yeah my girlfriend

165
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,960
and I attend planet fitness regularly the first monday of every month they provide free pizza

166
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:59,680
pizza okay due to my worst okay okay wait do my my girlfriend and I attend planet reading

167
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,640
it again is not gonna make this goddamn sentence make any more fucking sense of every month they

168
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:10,240
provide free pizza why does a gym have a fucking cheat day built I guess I get it like make them

169
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,920
feel like pizza garbage and then get them up on those fucking ellipticals or whatever people

170
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,120
I guess it's literally like people who are like god it's so hard to get to the gym and someone's

171
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,240
like well once a week it is not once a week once a week is very easy there is a pre-scheduled

172
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,680
pizza picnic anyway due to my work schedule we can only get there at the tail end of the

173
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,840
pizza offerings and we don't want to eat then work out so is it okay to just go eat some pizza

174
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:42,480
and leave are we good that's from planet pizza in pennsylvania what is happening what the fuck

175
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,360
I mean you're lying to us hey guys 420 you're lying to us which I don't appreciate um because

176
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:57,040
there's no way that why would it no there's no unless it's like fucking flat bread you know

177
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,600
what what did they call it squid pizza it's like square flat pizza it's like a pizza flat bread

178
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,960
yeah flat bread I'm pretty much over it by the way there was flat bread at every hotel we went to

179
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:16,560
uh that's pizza you're you're either pizza or shit like just be pizza flat bread stop trying to

180
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,360
sound healthier than you are yeah there was a flat bread at one of the hotels that had marinara

181
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:30,640
pepperoni and cheese on it hey hey you're a pizza Travis has sent us an image Travis wants to send

182
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,320
us an image file gonna look at this and Travis has just sent us a picture of him with a snake

183
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,160
sorry Travis didn't mean to doubt you that wasn't a lie but this fucking workout pizza

184
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,040
definitely still is uh I don't understand wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute

185
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:52,320
what if this isn't like a planet fitness promotion because that again is fucking patently insane

186
00:17:53,040 --> 00:18:00,240
maybe one person who works at planet fitness uh buys a pizza for themselves every week to enjoy

187
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,080
and then leaves the room and comes back is like again

188
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,560
man yogi I'm gonna get you pizza thief somebody keeps like teenager ninja turtles in me

189
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:18,080
they scarf my za I have a more sinister theory and that is that there's a sort of

190
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:26,800
panopticon that exists in the planet fitness um universe where it's probably the most personal

191
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:35,760
panopticon a personal panopticon a network of surveillance for mr fitness himself the owner

192
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:43,920
of the whole franchise uh once a month can just watch people just slam down on some pizza in his

193
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:50,800
place of business and like the denial of pizza from himself gives gives him like the raging

194
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,520
a solid snake like you could ever imagine a human being and it's like fucking it's just

195
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,160
super fit and muscular boner um and it's like the best one that you could that anyone can

196
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,960
possibly get and the only way he can get it is through his big brother style pizza surveillance

197
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,840
system is it possible that this is a honeypot that they're trying to keep you needing the planet

198
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:17,040
fitness services for longer how's his progress going jeremy it's going pretty good fill fitness

199
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:24,000
i think he's just about really fit well unleash the za and then you order he orders pizza from

200
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,160
a store right that's by unleashing it he gets another place to make it don't tip very well

201
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:38,000
planet fitness isn't doing super great i'm not made of money jeremy is it possible single topping

202
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,680
jeremy is this a uh is this like a muscle confusion like a tummy confusion type of thing

203
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,080
whereas your tummy's like oh fuck yeah thanks griffin we're taking it to pizza town why are you

204
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,960
running why are you running i want to watch all the episodes of parks and recreation and just

205
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:04,080
chill for once i thought we were gonna play persona on the couch and now you're running

206
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:11,040
you confused me oh man i just lost 30 pounds thanks griffin i i i think that the the problem

207
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,200
with that is that your tummy upon sensing the workout this is the way the body works

208
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,520
your tummy upon sensing the workouts like oh no the pizza i gotta hold on to it stay with me

209
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,560
pizza don't run away so your tummy's gonna hold all that pizza it's not gonna digest it

210
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,720
because it's so worried about losing those precious pizza calories exactly that's exactly

211
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,400
right justin because when you're like running on a treadmill you know what's happening that pizza's

212
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,720
just fallen out of you just falling out of your tummy and so your tummy's gotta hold on tight

213
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:47,520
oh good stay in me stay in me i love you pizza you guys i think you've picked a bad place to

214
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,720
get fit i think you should change this question should end with should i change gyms because this

215
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,560
is a bad one apparently where they serve pizza i think it sounds like the best possible gym uh

216
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:04,000
i can't believe that wasn't a yahoo yeah that's a really weird situation to find yourself in that

217
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,040
was a human being question wait wait we didn't actually answer it oh uh fucking absolutely not

218
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,840
it's like you can't go to church on doughnut sunday and slam those doughnuts and then say

219
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,640
i don't need to hear the lord's word this week later i got my doughnuts and like through them

220
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,600
i channeled the lord's good blessing this yahoo was sent in by recognize the game of rachel

221
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:39,040
sperling thank you rachel it's by yahoo answers user sdx zxz didn't even try who asks ladies

222
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:46,320
i bring my guitar almost everywhere to impress women does this work for example if i go to a

223
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,800
party or a store i'll usually bring my case with me and if i see a woman i like i will get it out

224
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,240
and play it hoping she hears what i don't understand is why it doesn't seem to work

225
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,960
the other day i was at target the most attractive woman i've seen in years was shopping

226
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,120
and got my guitar out and played wonder wall but she didn't come over i went and asked her out and

227
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:16,880
she said no frigid jerk don't women love guitar players confused right now it's work a few times

228
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:24,640
but not as often as i thought my co-workers like it at least i think my co-workers at the weed store

229
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,960
love it i think the problem is song choice you have to pick the right song that's going to lure

230
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,960
them in i uh personally have always found that bob dylan's i know how to use this thing between

231
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,200
my legs real good would you like to try it out sometime uh off of bob dylan unplugged and

232
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:50,560
unrecorded give me a good it's just a person that album is just a person telling you about

233
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,840
how great that album was yeah can you give me a few bars of i know how to use this thing between

234
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,360
my legs between my legs and you're gonna see the thing that i'm talking about it's so this

235
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,920
is an early one i'm guessing this is before he goes electric but right around when he went

236
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:12,800
eclectic uh he did a lot of novelty hits i know how to use this thing between my legs

237
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:19,680
and then do you want to see how i use it on you it's good this is a song about vaginas too

238
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,760
all right it's all inclusive no matter what you want to use i know how to use it on you

239
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,520
so bob don't hang all up in blue oh see okay what happened there later that song no that

240
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,960
actually that was a mishap with a blue cable his penis got tangled up into it

241
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,640
it could be removed surgically his penis and his vagina he gives me a great idea

242
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:52,240
yeah your your dylan sounds a little urkely just a little bit you sound like billy bob from the

243
00:23:52,240 --> 00:24:09,440
rocket fire explosion can i get some cheese please did i do that did i do that tangled up in carl

244
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:24,080
you're gonna make me stephan when you go

245
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,000
i'm trying to i'm trying to uh uh i'm trying to figure out if i uh don't know more dylan

246
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,280
songs or don't know more urkel references really it's hard to make the two apparently i know

247
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:43,680
exactly the same that means you just store them in the same filing cabinet in your brain right

248
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:51,120
oh this over here uh let's see what's stored in here oh looks like uh this is dylan references

249
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:58,080
and urkel quotes i don't know why these got filed together i'm so thirsty should we go to

322
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,360
we're answering important questions like can you build a space suit in your living room

323
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,520
i went to my brother's place in beaverton and he has a swimming pool and i pressurized the suit

324
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,360
and sat down there underwater for about 10 minutes the thing that i built was supporting my life

325
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,040
that felt really good what does it sound like when you play a polka record through a styrofoam cup

326
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:58,080
and what happens when an airport carpet gains a cult following oh my goodness the carpet

or wherever you like to listen to podcasts i've been doing comedy for about a year now and i find

329
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,960
that more and more i'm being introduced to people as a comedian how do i deal with the dreaded oh

330
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,280
you're a comedian tell me a joke let me try again oh you're a comedian tell me a joke and that's

331
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:25,040
from that's from mrs big head from rocco's modern life obviously i don't feel the need to prove my

332
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:30,960
merits to the boorish people who ask this you sound funny but uh what i like to hear you three

333
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,400
do in this situation you must get this crap once in a while uh what am i a joke jukebox is the name

334
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:42,080
of that question asker you actually don't get a lot when you say like i'm a podcaster right oh

335
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:48,720
then podcast for me i i have literally in my life never described myself as a comedian in my fucking

336
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,560
life i would never do that no not a crazy thing to say like no one's like oh i'm a baker and like

337
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,520
no one's like oh you're a baker bake something for me right now i need some fucking banana bread

338
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:07,440
now let's see what you got motherfucker here's some yeast oh you're a butcher kill this dog kill

339
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:15,840
this dog in front of me you can't just say shit butcher wait you're a sociopath here prove it on

340
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:25,760
this bird sicko uh i mean i never would say like i don't let anybody know that i'm supposed to do

341
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,560
jokes on the internet like i just never tell anybody that's my workaround i tell people i uh

342
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,200
people ask what i do i say i write about video games and then i just watch as the interest drains

343
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:42,560
from their face you can it's like sand from an hourglass yeah the conversation just fizzles out

344
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,360
like i can't fire someone just dump gatorade on sometimes i'll just start explaining the rules

345
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:53,520
to magic the gathering until they walk away in excruciating detail great question great

346
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,240
here's how resources work you're gonna want to tamp the tap your mana and then um oh man i feel

347
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,680
like the appropriate response to this is if someone's like oh you're a comedian tell me a

348
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,880
joke you just go like no and then you like say anything else that seems good trev well i mean

349
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,120
like what are they gonna say if they're like no i said tell me a joke this has been classic

350
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:20,800
conversation enders which i was mcroy who who is this person who who is this person that is

351
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,560
this is not a joke by the way it'd be great if you busted out like some seinfeld shit

352
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,640
like i'm about to but um who is who is this person that hears your comedian and then responds with

353
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:39,120
tell me a joke what what person exists that does that no i i can't it's beyond the fucking pale

354
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:45,520
that anybody would ever do this to you enough to to give you this psychosis that you've obviously

355
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,280
developed i i imagine not being a comedian myself that it's the kind of job title that when you say

356
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,280
it people are immediately incredulous because it's not like you could say like i'm a teacher

357
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,520
and people are just like okay why would you lie about that but imagine if you say like oh i'm

358
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,960
i'm like a comedian professionally i think as people have a hard time believing that they might

359
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,000
actually meet somebody who is funny professionally you know what i mean so they feel the need to like

360
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,720
oh really prove it which is like the worst i had an experience along these lines yesterday i called

361
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,680
the uh uh sort of like a customer service place about something that's too boring to recount

362
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,200
and uh a guy asked you know how how i was doing and i said well i'm a little tired just got back

363
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,120
from uh i was doing a uh i was in these cities you know in the midwest he said what are you doing

364
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,680
he said what are you doing it and it was like a little tour my brothers and i do a comedy show

365
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,840
because he said he was in minneapolis right so that's what prompted it now i remember

366
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:49,120
and uh he said well um i wish i'd heard about that i would have tried to make it out

367
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,760
really really i think that would have been a weird show for you to come out to but like i

368
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,240
appreciate it and then he adds yeah i mean everybody needs to laugh and i was like yeah

369
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:09,120
yeah it's especially you it sounds like i guess yeah like how how bad do you need to laugh where

370
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,640
you hear about a comedy show from three chuckleheads you've never heard of and thought

371
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,080

372
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:22,080
that thing with no context whatsoever i know it was just a pleasantry but man i it was a bridge

373
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,320
too far you should have held them to it i'm like can i get your contact info yeah we might be

384
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:28,320
it's by yahoo answers user josh who asks what would you do if an arby's manager punched you in

385
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:37,360
the face all right ironically if you're about to eat arby's it's not the worst thing to have

386
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:44,800
happened to you in that moment uh so uh buckle in it's a little bit long okay so my friend and i

387
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,520
go into an arby's to get some food last night not gonna lie kind of short on cash so we don't order

388
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,160
any drinks instead ask for a water cup when our food is ready you know the manager tells us in a

389
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,200
real douchebag way that the water isn't working and no we can't have a water cup it was like we

390
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:06,720
were asking him anything outrages just a cup i ask for something else and he just continues to be

391
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,440
way too concerned about his job i'm a server i work in a restaurant so i think this guy's crazy

392
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,240
one for being so rude too he has to be able to supply us with something to drink we finish our

393
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,720
meal and i decide it would be funny if i knock a rather large stack of cubs that are sitting on the

394
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:30,400
counter oops jesus now this real chuckle fest now this is where it gets interesting my friend and i

395
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,200
proceed to the exit there's a guy at the door he's using the usual fuck you blah blah blah verbal

396
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,240
fighting stuff we kind of laugh and continue walking towards the car halfway to the car i get

397
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,480
clocked in the face from behind you someone punched you through the back of your skull and punched

398
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,080
you the front of your face bones off my manager ran out of the store with two other employees

399
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,520
punched me in the face and the other employee shoved my friend to the ground

400
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,720
i got hit pretty good this guy had a running start and i was completely blindsided

401
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,480
i was what you didn't see is if you looked to your left you would have seen tyler durden like

402
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,800
yeah that's right how do you feel like a man uh feel like a strong man i was knocked over your

403
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,720
cups my friend jumped right up from being shoved he saw me get whacked so naturally he's defending

404
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,080
me i didn't really see that part but i know he got him a few good times the guy ended up running

405
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,360
in with blood all over his lip and shirt the other two guys are just talking shit to me surrounding

406
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,520
me trying to scare me a man pulls up and breaks up the fight we go straight home i have a huge fat

407
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,160
lip my jaw won't even close right my teeth hurt really bad friend's shirt is ripped up blood all

408
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,160
over it we talked about it for a while figure we should call the cops so we do arby's had called

409
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,760
the cops too exaggerated the story told them we threw stuff and fought them first whatever you

410
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:56,400
know we called we told the cops our story but what do we do now what would you do if an arby's

411
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:03,920
manager punched you in the fucking grill don't you guys feel like listening to this story that

412
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:11,840
that this person telling the story like is about to say oh i guess i should also mention we were

413
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:18,240
really belligerently drunk but i don't think that has any impact on the story whatsoever

414
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:26,480
i should mention we were very high on um uh hallucinogenic mushrooms and we may have been

415
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,120
at our home the entire time this may be a fiction like the time we might have been fighting each

416
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,440
other this might have been like the time the world's worst zoo employee handed travis a snake

417
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:41,760
in his mind yeah he hastily photoshopped a picture of it and then i called the police and the police

418
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,040
said travis you've been home all day because you've called us 20 times also the snake called

419
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:53,040
us beforehand and told us inside of this said i'm worried about travis he's been locked in his house

420
00:41:53,040 --> 00:42:00,160
all day also you're still high and you'll never not be high travis whoa um what do you i'm not

421
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,880
interested in talking about the fight if fucking happened it's wrong violence is not the answer

422
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,880
it's not funny we shouldn't laugh at the violence what is hilarious gut buster is how you seek

423
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,280
justice for this act call the cops the cops said they called us first and told us their side story

424
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,040
we have no proof it's an arby's the fucking beef oils all over the place just completely get rid

425
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,920
of any fingerprints we could have used to figure out this crime uh it's gonna be hard to csi this

426
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,040
one so it's your word against theirs and they work at arby's so you lose just sort of de facto

427
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:39,840
right do you do you know how decrepit you have to be for the cops to say well i hear what you're

428
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,840
saying but this arby's manager is giving us a different story and we're gonna have to go with

429
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:50,720
him because he it's an institution yeah why do we always have to be so hard on arby's i like arby's

430
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,200
they serve fine food everyone i've ever interacted with there has always been pleasant yeah i'm sure

431
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,360
we have people listen they're working on arby's so they so they fucking cold clock every 10th

432
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:05,120
person that comes so you punch the occasional dildo who cares they shouldn't have been in the

433
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:09,840
store knocking over your cups and throwing things and fighting with people and starting fights

434
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:16,640
that's right i i bought the arby's story too i don't buy this email you're an arbypologist

435
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,120
this sounds like you're trying you're angling for a class action lawsuit get everybody together

436
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,800
who's ever been punched by an arby's manager and you guys are gonna try to bring down big beef

437
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,800
and i'm not having it but the sheer number of people who've been punched in the fucking grill

438
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,680
by an arby's manager is so enormous at this point that you'd end up getting like a buck 16

439
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,560
maybe you have to you would ironically have just enough to buy some jalapeno hush puppies and

440
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:44,720
arby's and you promised yourself never again never again because you bought some and you got fucking

441
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:50,240
cold clocked and then you ate one of them and oh the capucin what if your what if your settlement

442
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,560
came in the form of an arby's gift certificate and it just had like a picture that manager like

443
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,840

456
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,440
the problem with the curly fries at arby's is it's very hard to judge how many fries you've eaten

457
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,960
no because i like to eat about 20 fries a day and if with the arby's uh fries they're very

458
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,800
curly and long sometimes they're like four or five fries in there just like a fry you know come on

459
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,720
obama yeah come on obama it could be it could be more accurately described as a bouquet yeah as a

460
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:44,320
fry arrangement that's where you have to judge it by weight or tummy feel are we done with the
