1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,200
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,880
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:04,240
All right. A little self-edit there. Cut it out. Yeah, so it's time for another favorite part of

9
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:12,080
the favorite show, everyone's beloved segment, Travis McElroy's Touched by the Hollywood Angels.

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,640
Yeah. Touched by a Hollywood Angel. Travis, just let her rip. I'm just going to sit back

11
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,520
and let it wash over me. I'm so excited, boys, because I went to the New York Comic Con. I had

12
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,280
a lot of good times, met a lot of cool people. Most of them were my listeners. Did you meet

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,800
the Doctor Who? Oh, no, Croggy. I did. I met Matt Smith. Step in my time box, Wibbly Bibbly.

14
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:45,440
I met the Matt Smith. Time box, Wibbly Bibbly. I can't die, can I? I don't. Just come back

15
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:55,520
somebody else, Wibbly Bibbly. Hey, do you guys think that random people just show up

16
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,080
at a former companion's house and be like, it's me, the Doctor Who. Hey, get in my car.

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,400
My tart has exploded. Get in my Datsun, quick. I'm in the back. I'm the Doctor now.

18
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,160
Billy Piper has been kidnapped 18 times. Yeah. I don't have any British money. Can you take

19
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:23,280
me out for a nice burger and chips? You know what I love? Fish fingers and custard. And then also

20
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,960
like steak and vegetables and some scotch. And maybe some diamonds. I eat diamonds now.

21
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:35,520
I eat diamonds from my two hearts. Oh, my time box said it needed $1,400, Wibbly.

22
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:43,280
Listen, I owe $1,000 on my time box, but I'm going to sell it for a million.

23
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,440
My time box just ran out of gas and I'm trying to get to me sisters.

24
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:55,360
To pick up more money. So if you give me a thousand quid, then I will be back

25
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,120
with 500,000 quid through time and space. I'm going to go back in time and invest in

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,880
Apple, ain't I? But I need 1,000 quid from you. I got the sports betting

27
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,280
almanac and all I need you to do, crikey. Travis, that was not the celebrity angel

28
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,000
you were touched by. No, sorry.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,680
Day one, as I was walking into the building through the, and I'm not going to brag you,

30
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,240
but talent entrance. Thank you.

31
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:30,880
I walked side by side with one Mr. Mark the Ruffalo Buffalo Ruffalo.

32
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,000
What's the smell? Describe it. Everything.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,960
Okay. What do you think he smells like? Old books? Oh, shit.

34
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,400
And here's the thing. You know how sometimes you see someone and you're like,

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,240
I think that's a celebrity. Who is that? Oh, is that the, I have never more quickly,

36
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,920
like, like, yeah, that's Mark Ruffalo. Like there was no-

37
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,080
Yeah, sure. He looks exactly like-

38
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,320
Singular. And he is, in fact, Mark Ruffalo.

39
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,200
Was he, was he a little kind of like all celebs or like-

40
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,760
No. No, he was exactly-

41
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,400
Picture what height you think Mark Ruffalo is. Yes.

42
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,440
Do you think that could be part of the fact that, I love the Ruffalo Buffalo,

43
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:17,680
you know this about me. He kind of is just doing him a lot of the time.

44
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,560
A lot of the time.

45
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,320
A lot of times he's not necessarily buried in the character.

46
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,840
You're getting some permutation of, it's different sides of the same coin,

47
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,480
but it is that original Ruffalo shaped coin.

48
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,720
I just had the idea of a century. The Mask 2 or 3 starring Mark Ruffalo,

49
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,360
who puts on the mask and becomes a sort of wild sort of physical comedy antics clown man.

50
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,520
I actually think, Griffin, if Mark Ruffalo put on the mask, the mask would be like, you win.

51
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,080
Oh, I see. Now I'm Mark Ruffalo.

52
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,800
Sure.

53
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,480
And here's the amazing thing is, I turned to him and I said,

54
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,880
I'm a huge fan of the Avengers in the Marvel universe. And he said, thank you.

55
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,200
And I said, I loved all the cliffhangers. I can't wait to find out what happens.

56
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,800
And he said, well, what do you want to know?

57
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,360
And I kind of jokingly said, everything. And he told me everything.

58
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,320
He told you all the secrets?

59
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,360
Yeah.

60
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,360
And I don't know how much I'm allowed to tell you guys,

61
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,400
how much you want to know.

62
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
I'd love to know a little bit of it though.

63
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,760
Okay. Well, of course, heavy spoilers for this point forward.

64
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,440
These are all real and true, right?

65
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,080
Yes, absolutely.

66
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,960
Not goofs.

67
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,080
No, absolutely 1000%.

68
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:45,120
A big majority of the next movie takes place in Stanley's coma.

69
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,000
Where Stanley is like a character in it.

70
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,360
Oh, this isn't ripped. This is not ripped from the headlines though, right, bud?

71
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,640
No.

72
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,920
Is he in a coma?

73
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
I don't know, bud, but you said it so confidently.

74
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:05,280
No, no, no. He is a character in it as he's talking with Captain America and the Hulk and stuff.

75
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,480
Just remember that this podcast is a mummy's tomb,

76
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,120
just full of curses for every celebrity we name.

77
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
So Mark Ruffalo also should be on it.

78
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,880
There's a lot of stuff in which Thor is looking at Stanley saying,

79
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,400
why did you create his father? And there's a lot of that stuff.

80
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,120
Sure, sure, sure.

81
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Sure. Spider-Man becomes a spider, a tiny spider, and he does save a piglet's life.

82
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,960
Interesting.

83
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,400
That's what Mark Ruffalo told me about.

84
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,080
Yeah, is there anything you guys want to know?

85
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,920
Well, I want to know if you felt sort of guilty immediately after this interaction

86
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,360
that you approached him and said you were a fan of the Marvel universe,

87
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,040
because I bet you Mark Ruffalo is just always waiting for somebody to come up to him

88
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,360
and ask him about the Foxcatcher-averse.

89
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:51,760
Yeah.

90
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,000
Just sort of the extended Foxcatcher canon.

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,640
I mean, I led with the spotlight-averse.

92
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,160
Yeah, I said, are the kids all right? And he said, the kids are all right.

93
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,720
They're fine.

94
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,520
And I said, oh, cool, cool.

95
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,800
And I said, I love how the spotlight of the mind goes on eternally.

96
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And he got that. He thought that was very funny.

97
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,840
Was he in that one?

98
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,600
Yeah, and then I said-

99
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,480
He was in that one. He was one of the science guys, right?

100
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,440
He was in that one. He was one of the science guys.

101
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,000
And then I said, so what's up with Spider-Man and Purpleface guy?

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,920
Mark Ruff, the science buff.

103
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,000
Mark Ruff, the science buff.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,800
Okay.

105
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,840
Did you ask him how he-

106
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,440
He played- I don't know if you guys remember this.

107
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,200
He played Beakman in Beacon's World.

108
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,760
Interesting.

109
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,120
Yeah, that was Paul's Allume.

110
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,160
Jesus Christ.

111
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,520
Well, it was Tomato Tomato.

112
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,800
Did you ask him how pre-production was going on 14, going on 31?

113
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,040
Yeah.

114
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,120
He said it's going well.

115
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,920
Okay.

116
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,560
He has to go through a lot of prosthetics to look that young again.

117
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,040
Sure, sure.

118
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,400
And by which I mean 14.

119
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,840
14 years old, yeah.

120
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,080
This one is actually 30 going on 13.

121
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,440
Whoa.

122
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,160
Yeah, where he plays the 30, but he didn't want a child actor to play him

123
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,520
because he thought that would be weird.

124
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,200
And he was looking for a chance to be transformative like we talked about earlier.

125
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,160
So he is playing the 13-year-old too.

126
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,120
Sure, and he's like, I'm going to go invest in some Apple stocks.

127
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,560
Yeah, yeah.

128
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
Should we do advice now that we're done talking about-

129
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,320
You don't want to know any more about Mark Ruffalo

130
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,400
and what he told me about the Marvel Cinematic Universe

131
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,760
and the direction they're taking it?

132
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,080
It's going to be lies from your own mind.

133
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,520
They're going to do Avengers Babies.

134
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

135
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,240
That's for sure happening.

136
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,160
Avengers Babies is locked in.

137
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,560
But also Avengers Oldies, where it's all of them in a retirement home together.

138
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,920
Okay.

139
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,480
Yeah.

140
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,360
I don't hate it.

141
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,080
Avengers Teens, and they're going like a Riverdale kind of thing.

142
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,920
Yeah, and then Adults Avengers.

143
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,120
Avengers Vampires, they're doing that one.

144
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,400
Yo, have they ever avenged even anything?

145
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,920
It's just like aliens are coming.

146
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,640
Let's get them.

147
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,560
You're not Avengers, you're sort of Defenders.

148
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,200
You know what I mean?

149
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,400
That would be a way better name for the movie.

150
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,440
They're going to change the name.

151
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:03,920
To Defenders.

152
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,280
He did say they're changing it to Defenders.

153
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,280
And they're going to do that retroactively and re-release all the movies.

154
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,640
For $40, you can watch Defenders.

155
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,760
You can get Defenders,

156
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,560
but also it's going to be packaged with the Lord of the Rings movies

157
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,000
because they're tying that into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,880
Defenders has the incredible Mulk and Guy.

159
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,040
Now, why would they change their names, Griffin?

160
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,040
I don't know, man.

161
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,320
I just really want to do advice.

162
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,920
I've been like excited to do advice all week.

163
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,360
I didn't think we'd get it a lot.

164
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,560
I've been excited to talk about Paul Zaloom and that went nowhere.

165
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,280
That was a real lead balloon on a real red Zaloom.

166
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,880
By the way, that show is huge in Latin America.

167
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,920
And you can see pictures of…

168
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,520
He's still like down there grinding it out in the wig and everything.

169
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,160
All right.

170
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,200
Because he's huge down there.

171
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,840
You got to see…

172
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,280
Folks, get online.

173
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,480
See pictures of Paul Zaloom doing the Beakman thing still

174
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,040
and watching kids in Latin America like flip their shit.

175
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,400
It's just so inspiring.

176
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,440
Like so ripped.

177
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,240
So ripped.

178
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Also, if you got a MeTV affiliate, Sunday's at 8am.

179
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,320
They're fucking cranking Beakman's world again.

180
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
If you want to see Beakman, he's back.

181
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,360
He's on at 8am.

182
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,960
Anyway, let's help people.

183
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,480
This first question says,

184
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,520
Justin, I want a great book as a gift for the special doctor

185
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,800
or really anybody in my life.

186
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,360
Do you have any suggestions?

187
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,400
Well, it's funny.

188
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,240
The Sawbones book is out.

189
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,920
This came out last week and folks, it's flying off the shelves.

190
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,880
You can find a copy.

191
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,320
You got to pick this thing up.

192
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,640
Bit.ly forward slash the Sawbones book.

193
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,080
And here's our next…

194
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,120
Well, that's so funny, Justin.

195
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,400
The next question says,

196
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,040
I'm not in the mood for a book right now,

197
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,640
but in six months, I think I would like to read a graphic novel.

198
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,800
Oh, well, good news.

199
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,480
Theadventurezonecomic.com.

200
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,560
You can pre-order a book too.

201
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,960
We're never going to make it six months, folks.

202
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,440
Theadventurezonecomic.com today.

203
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,560
Get a book for now and a book for later.

204
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,120
Well, this is the third question.

205
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,440
It says that in 18 months,

206
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,280
I'm in the mood to read a Griffin McElroy's parody book

207
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,720
of 700 Sundays called 701 Fun Days.

208
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,840
Well, good news.

209
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,040
Pre-order it now at books.dog.

210
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:31,840
Hey, I want a book that's going to pick up my spirits

211
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,000
and lift my mood, folks.

212
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,280
There's one you can get right now by Jomni Sun

213
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,120
and Lin-Manuel Miranda,

214
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,880
and it is called Good Morning, Good Night,

215
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,440
Little Pep Talks from Me to You.

216
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,560
Shouldn't you go pick up this number one bestseller

217
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,120
in the self-esteem category?

218
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,400
I think you should.

219
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,680
That's going to be out October 16th as the crow flies.

220
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,880
Make sure you get your copy.

221
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,320
I know I did.

222
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,080
Put a little pep in my step for sure.

223
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,640
Absolutely.

224
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,960
How, just side note, how much,

225
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,360
what's our cut of every sale of that?

226
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:07,760
100%.

227
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:08,880
Whoa.

228
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,960
That's a good deal.

230
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,360
I mean, for us, it's a terrible deal for them.

231
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,840
For sure.

232
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,000
What's the first real question from like

233
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,320
the God's Honest Truth real question on this list?

234
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,320
My university students, damn.

235
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,840
Try again, bud.

236
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,400
Oh no, we didn't even make it four words.

237
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,680
Three words in, Daniel, damn.

238
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,360
You've done it again, Daniel.

239
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,080
Damn, back at it again with the white fans.

240
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,760
Hey, how come that kid was allowed to cuss

241
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,880
that much at school?

242
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah, I know, right?

243
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,960
He was like yelling curse words a lot at school.

244
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,800
If Vine was seven seconds,

245
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
you would have seen the principal be like,

246
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,760
uh, excuse me, Philip, excuse me.

247
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,800
Detention.

248
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,360
Detention, back at it again with the attention.

249
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,040
Summer school.

250
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,960
Dag, daggum it, Daniel.

251
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,720
Gosh darn it, H-E double hockey sticks, Daniel.

252
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,480
H-E double hockey sticks, Daniel,

253
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,920
back at it again with the white van.

254
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,360
Ah, piss, Daniel.

255
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
I think that still counts as-

256
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,080
What's the first question?

257
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,800
I'm dying, I'm in hell.

258
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,720
My university requires students

259
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,040
to pick up packages at the bookstore,

260
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,320
and thanks to my kind friends and family,

261
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,200
I find myself at the bookstore once or twice a week.

262
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,640
You know why you're there?

263
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,720
Shit, there was like a whole fucking thing

264
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,480
built into this one, fuck.

265
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,240
Recently, the woman who is always,

266
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,440
and this is all caps here,

267
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,200
running the bookstore told me,

268
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,880
you're in here every day.

269
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,960
I assumed she was exaggerating

270
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,160
to make me self-conscious.

271
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,880
It worked.

272
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,000
Until a couple of days ago,

273
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,160
when she told me matter of factly,

274
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,240
this is your second time coming in here today.

275
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,520
Uh-oh.

276
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,160
It was not.

277
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,800
Is the package lady confusing me for another student,

278
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,480
or is she stuck in a time loop?

279
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,080
How do I face her next time?

280
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,120
That's from Frazzled in Fredonia, New York.

281
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,600
I really enjoy that the question asker's assumption here

282
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,320
is that this woman working at the bookstore

283
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,920
was, of course, doing this

284
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,680
just to make them self-conscious.

285
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,880
Yeah, and now it's making them think

286
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,200
that they do have a twin, or,

287
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,080
because that can be like,

288
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,120
you work at a bookstore,

289
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,880
really any sort of retail gig,

290
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,240
you gotta make the fun.

291
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,040
You know what I mean?

292
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,680
And so maybe that means

293
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,680
you bring some Sudoku books in with you,

294
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,160
and sometimes it means trying to convince people

295
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,920
that they do in fact have twins,

296
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,080
or maybe that you try to convince people

297
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,240
that they have been John Malkoviched,

298
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,080
which it sounds like maybe that is what they're trying,

299
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,160
the game they're trying to pull right now.

300
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,660
Uh-huh.

301
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,400
And maybe it's not a lie.

302
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,440
It might not be a lie,

303
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,240
it may not be a game.

304
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,000
You may have been John Malkoviched.

305
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,040
Ugh.

306
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,800
That's, it's so important.

307
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,360
Okay, listen, when you sit down to read a book,

308
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
or lay down to go to bed, or something,

309
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,040
take one hair off your head,

310
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,760
lick both ends,

311
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,800
stick it across the doorframe and the door.

312
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,680
And that way, if it's gone when you wake back up,

313
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,120
you know you've been John Malkoviched.

314
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,680
You've been John Malkoviched.

315
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,080
So go ahead and balance it on the bridge of your nose.

316
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,580
Yeah.

317
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,920
And if it moves, you have the John Malkoviched door.

318
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,840
I've not seen the film,

319
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,600
but the John, they get in there, I guess.

320
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,760
You haven't seen the film?

321
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,080
Uh, no, it seems a little too, I don't know, adult.

322
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,880
Is there a point in the John Malkoviched

323
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,080
being John Malkoviched film,

324
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,040
where John Malkoviched goes in his own John Malkoviched door?

325
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,280
I think famously, famously, yes.

326
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,960
I think that does, in fact, happen.

327
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,120
You guys know that, you guys ever been on SNL

328
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,760
where John Malkoviched read Twas the Night Before Christmas?

329
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,240
Yes.

330
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,480
And y'all had all kinds of spooky sides.

331
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,400
If I was gonna be John Malkoviched,

332
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,680
and I ducked in, and I was like,

333
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,000
hey, hi, this is John Malkoviched.

334
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,200
Is this my manager?

335
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,040
Good, that's why you saved it on my cell phone.

336
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,240
Hey, listen, I'm a little fuzzy on timeline.

337
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,080
Have I already done that great bit on SNL?

338
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,240
Okay, well, I'm gonna leave then.

339
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,440
I just wanted to duck in for that.

340
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,560
And you just wanted to make sure that it happened?

341
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,880
No, I wanted to experience that.

342
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,840
So like, I would hang out in John Malkoviched for,

343
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,560
I don't know, I would say at least five days,

344
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,680
to be able to do that bit on SNL.

345
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,880
Sure.

346
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,080
Do you ever think about the fact

347
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,320
that they just completely missed the opportunity

348
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,160
to make a series of movies that were like,

349
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,520
being John Malkoviched, being Samuel L. Jackson.

350
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,400
Sure, sure, sure.

351
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,960
Being Maya Rudolph, I would say.

352
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,920
That's what he is always on the lookout for, is a franchise.

353
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,080
Spike Jonze loves a franchise.

354
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,320
There are so many conversations happening

355
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,600
about how Get Out is unofficially a part of the,

356
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,640
being John Malkovich-versed,

357
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,240
but that's neither here nor there.

358
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,720
What is going on here in this exact situation

359
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,080
in Fredonia, New York?

360
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,240
I think this person is probably confused.

361
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,560
I mean, that would be my best bet

362
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,320
that they've just made some sort of non-funny error.

363
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,640
Yeah, can you have them take a picture of you

364
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,280
every time you, quote unquote, you come in?

365
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,800
So then you can at least know

366
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:11,600
if you do have a doppelganger or a twin separated at birth.

367
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,560
It can happen, folks.

368
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,360
It has happened.

369
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,400
It does happen all the time.

370
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,880
It does happen.

371
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,280
I've seen it probably on like ABC Family.

372
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,680
I think it's on there probably.

373
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,400
Every third set of twins get separated at birth.

374
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,640
Here's a good, okay, I got a good test.

375
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,560
I got a good test.

376
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,680
Tell this person the next time that they see,

377
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,040
every time they see you in the store for the next week,

378
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,200
to force feed you a bunch of peanuts.

379
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,800
Oh, all right.

380
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,320
Okay, but think about this.

381
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:44,560
If that person balloons up or has an anaphylactic response,

382
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,320
then that's your twin.

383
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,920
Because that stuff is like, that's genetic.

384
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,040
Wait, but hold on, Justin.

385
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,560
Nowhere in this question does the question asker say

386
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,160
that they are allergic to peanuts.

387
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,840
Yeah, but if they're not allergic, it won't work.

388
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,640
Yeah.

389
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,120
Okay.

390
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,400
Did you even fucking think of that

391
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,440
before you opened your big mouth?

392
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,080
You know what?

393
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,760
Look, I'm the asshole here, I guess.

394
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
Say the next time, tell the person the next time

395
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,960
that you, quote unquote, you come in,

396
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,680
have them hold her or them in like bookstore jail.

397
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,780
Yeah.

398
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,600
Arrest them, you're saying.

399
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,840
And arrest them in the prison section.

400
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,800
I see, I see, I see.

401
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,040
Yeah, so have the bookstore worker person hold your twin

402
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,880
until you can get there and investigate.

403
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,760
Listen, for me, that might as well be the cookbook section

404
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,440
because good luck getting me out of there

405
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
once I find my way in.

406
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,240
I mean, it's also-

407
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,280
Can you check their fingerprints?

408
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,720
Have the librarian of the bookstore check their fingerprints

409
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,400
to see if it's a match for theirs.

410
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,640
You know they got that ink for when they do the stamps

411
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
in the book, do people still do that?

412
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,280
Probably not because-

413
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,440
At bookstores or-

414
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
Probably not at a bookstore, Griffin.

415
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,240
No.

416
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,080
Bring this back in two weeks.

417
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,640
Wait, what?

418
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,520
Yeah, you're not allowed to keep this.

419
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,000
It also could be, you know, a hurricane heist

420
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,480
where they know that you're getting your packages delivered

421
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,000
there every other day.

422
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,600
And so they know you're a rich target.

423
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,640
They have Mission Impossible 3D printed on a mask of your face

424
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,200
and they will go in and they'll get all the packages.

425
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,120
That's another, there's so many reasons

426
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,360
why you need to install a series of webcams

427
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,360
all around this bookstore or library.

428
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,960
No one's quite sure what it is.

429
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,480
There are rumors it could be either one.

430
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,760
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

431
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,800
I'd love one, thank you.

432
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,360
I got this one sent in by lots of people.

433
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,480
It's Yahoo Answers user, Billy, who asks,

434
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,760
do you think Neil Armstrong filled his space diaper

435
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,880
during the moonwalk?

436
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,400
Serious answers, please.

437
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,520
I'm working on my dissertation related to the moon.

438
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,240
Let that first sentence sink in.

439
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,280
All right, one more time.

440
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,200
I'm working on my dissertation related to the moon.

441
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,680
We now know that the moon's weak gravity

442
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,840
loosens astronauts' bowels.

443
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,680
Did early astronauts know this

444
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,280
or did they find out the hard way?

445
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,960
I'm, okay, listen.

446
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,480
This is a peer-reviewed knowledge source

447
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,000
that you can find on Nexus Lexus.

448
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,880
Is this Yahoo Answer?

449
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,480
I need it for my dissertation.

450
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,400
So there are many things that I am not.

451
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,880
One of them is a gastrointestinal, yeah, a tummy doctor.

452
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,840
One of them.

453
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,720
And two, scientists, like in any way, really.

454
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Science, I think, covers that as well.

455
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,360
Sure.

456
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,960
But my, no pun intended, gut reaction

457
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,280
is that this is not true.

458
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,480
About space loosening the bowel?

459
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,120
Yes.

460
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,600
Okay.

461
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,720
Because I have been on like roller coasters

462
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,920
and rides and stuff that spun me around in such a way

463
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,520
that I imagine in a less fun way

464
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,920
they do when they're training you to be an astronaut.

465
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,000
And it has never made me shit myself.

466
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,960
This is amazing.

467
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,460
Okay.

468
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,800
What's wrong?

469
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,640
Are you telling me, Travis, that the fact

470
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,040
that you have been on a roller coaster

471
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,440
uniquely positions you to comment on the effects

472
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,200
of space travel on the human body?

473
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
Is this what you just said, not as a joke,

474
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,960
but as a real thing?

475
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,000
Well, more than that, Justin, I started originally

476
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
before I thought of the roller coaster thing

477
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,080
with no evidence to back it up.

478
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,680
And then the roller coaster thing occurred to me

479
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,080
and I was like, wait, hold on, I'm onto something here.

480
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,560
And now I do, yes, I do feel very strongly

481
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,320
about the fact that I've been on a tilt swirl

482
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,080
and I have not shit my pants.

483
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,800
And so I think that probably Neil Armstrong

484
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,240
was probably fine.

485
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,560
All right.

486
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,240
I did it just to cursory Google

487
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,360
and we will get back to the question

488
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,480
because it merits discussion.

489
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,360
It's a hot subject.

490
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,120
This is our first man watch.

491
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,800
But I did find that low gravity, being in low gravity

492
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,640
makes it difficult to tell if your bladder is full

493
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,080
because the bladder's stretch receptor

494
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,760
nerves don't feel the weight of the liquid.

495
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,600
Astronauts are trained to empty their bladders

496
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,520
every two hours because of this.

497
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,480
So these are the world's most elite scientists,

498
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,560
the world's most bravest explorers,

499
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,000
space pioneers risking their lives

500
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,760
and just everything to go up into the dangerous,

501
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,280
endless expanse of outer space

502
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,280
to further our scientific pursuits.

503
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,640
They are geniuses.

504
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,080
They are brave.

505
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,600
They are the best of us.

506
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,840
And also they have a little special watch they wear

507
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,560
to let them know it's tinkle time every 120 minutes.

508
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,640
Because when they have to go potty,

509
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,400
they stop and go right away.

510
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,840
Yeah, exactly.

511
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,320
Houston, I've learned the cells have separated up here

512
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,360
in zero gravity, furthering the research

513
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,200
into curing cancer.

514
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,320
I think we've finally got it.

515
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,120
Oh, beep, beep, beep.

516
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,920
Time for me to go pee pee in the space potty.

517
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,800
I need to go tinkle, tinkle and make yellow, Houston.

518
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,080
So give me a bit.

519
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,120
It's yellow time.

520
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,880
Now, Griffey, to be fair, not knowing if you have to go

521
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,200
to the potty versus like automatically uncontrollable

522
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,160
going to the potty is two different things.

523
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,680
Is it possible that this is not actually having an effect

524
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,200
and they're just bored?

525
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,040
It's like, I would imagine trying to use a space toilet

526
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,440
is the highlight of space travel.

527
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,160
When you're just floating up there in the dark, who cares?

528
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,760
You're looking forward to that next time that you,

529
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,280
like you're just twiddling your thumbs,

530
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,360
hoping that you're gonna have to take a dookie

531
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,240
any moment now.

532
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,800
Yeah, that's the thing, Justin.

533
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,760
We are talking about this,

534
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,520
and I think the question asked who was talking about this

535
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,840
in such way of like, do you think Neil Armstrong

536
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,560
might've like lost control of his belt?

537
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,480
But I think the opposite is true.

538
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,560
We're probably like after five minutes

539
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,280
of being on the moon, Neil Armstrong was like,

540
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,520
I'm gonna be the first man to shit on the moon.

541
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,040
Yeah, he definitely did that or cranked,

542
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,720
but there's something that happened up there.

543
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,240
Have you ever listened?

544
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,800
Pulled his arm inside the sleeve of his space suit.

545
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,240
He could, and he didn't know.

546
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,200
Plant the flag, Neil.

547
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,240
He's like, oh, I'm doing that in a manner of speaking.

548
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,200
You ever listened to,

549
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,360
yeah, y'all ever listened to that tape

550
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,440
where he's talking about how he did it?

551
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,440
Talking about how he cranked it?

552
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,080
No, he's talking about how he's taking one big step for guys.

553
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,360
One big step for guys.

554
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,640
He says one big, he says one huge leap for boys,

555
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,600
and he does it.

556
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,480
Have you listened to it?

557
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Hey, everybody check out my moon cave.

558
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,560
I mean, man cave.

559
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,920
This is me and my other dudes hanging out here in space.

560
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,600
He did declare when he planted the flag,

561
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,880
the moon is for boys.

562
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,200
I remember him saying that really loudly.

563
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,920
But do you ever listen to it?

564
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:23,520
Welcome to the big radical white rock just for boys only.

565
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,160
He said, Neil, you have to come back now.

566
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,560
And he said, I'm playing on the moon, leave me alone.

567
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,760
You can't boss me around.

568
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,200
I'm a boy and I'm on the moon.

569
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,480
And the first time an eclipse happened,

570
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,920
he went around apologizing to everybody.

571
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,320
Sorry guys, my boy rock got in the way of the sun.

572
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,240
I apologize, it shouldn't happen.

573
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,640
So have you listened to the tape?

574
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,160
I mean, I've seen it in like alien movies.

575
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,840
Dad described it to me.

576
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,960
Well, if you listen to it,

577
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,280
it's on Library of Congress website,

578
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,480
which I'm on all the time.

579
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,560
He sounds sheepish a little bit.

580
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,720
He sounds a little bit,

581
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,880
and for lack of a better term, just kind of naughty,

582
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,840
like while he's doing it.

583
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,120
And he wouldn't say it, right?

584
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,360
Like that was being broadcast to the whole world.

585
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,800
The world's eyes were watching the stars, the cosmos,

586
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
as we took our first, you know,

587
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,640
intrepid steps into our destiny in the galaxies beyond.

588
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,840
He did have poop on his butt when he said it, probably.

589
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,920
If you listen to the tape, if you really listen to it,

590
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,760
and I mean, really, really listen to it.

591
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,240
And the way that he walks in the video,

592
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,240
if you watch it, is the way that BB walks

593
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,280
when she's got poop in her butt.

594
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,880
Exactly, exactly.

595
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,380
Yeah.

596
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,980
Do you think it was, like obviously,

597
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,580
he gets out there, he gets out there,

598
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,340
he's walking around, steps in the moon.

599
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,620
I'm the first man on the moon, amazing.

600
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,100
Do you think it took him a little while

601
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,460
before he let Buzz get out?

602
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,860
Because he was trying to think of other things

603
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,460
he could be the first one to do.

604
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,660
Like, I don't know how it would,

605
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,380
I would want to be the first person to do

606
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,060
so many different things on the moon.

607
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,340
It would be so irritating to know that I had to let Buzz out.

608
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,820
Like, I want Buzz to be like,

609
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,380
hey, hey, look at me, I just did,

610
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,860
I just did, you know, this, I don't know,

611
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,860
the hand jive, you know, from Grease.

612
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,980
Yeah, yeah, sure.

613
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,340
And he's like, no, I just actually did that,

614
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,580
like two minutes before you came out.

615
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,300
I totally did that.

616
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,460
This makes so much sense to me, Justin,

617
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,420
because if you remember when Buzz Aldrin stepped on the moon,

618
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,780
he said, I'm the first second person on the moon.

619
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,660
And Neil Armstrong immediately murdered him.

620
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,260
Yeah, killed him dead.

621
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,140
Man, I bet, do you think Buzz had a moment where he was like,

622
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,340
I'm not even gonna get off.

623
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,020
Fuck it.

624
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,500
Fuck it, he's the first man on the moon.

625
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,580
He saw Neil doing armpit farts on the moon,

626
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,660
and he was like, man, there's nothing left.

627
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,220
Let's go home.

628
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,340
There's nothing left for me to do.

629
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,100
I will say, I have-

630
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,460
Is this Damien Chazelle?

631
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,740
I'm ready for our interview.

632
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,620
How's the script come along for First Man and Buzz?

633
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,260
You're still gonna call it that, right?

634
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,340
Like you promised First Man and Buzz?

635
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,140
I have been very excited to go many, many places in my life.

636
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,060
And I would say nine times out of 10,

637
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,460
you build it up really big, and then you get there,

638
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,300
and you're like, oh, okay.

639
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,140
So how long do you think they were on the moon

640
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,700
before they were just like, all right, there's nothing here.

641
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,380
There's nothing to do.

642
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,660
There's no TV or movies or anything.

643
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,020
I'm gonna get back in and just head on home.

644
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,260
You know Neil was hoping there'd be some big worms

645
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:30,900
he could fight.

646
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,380
That's half of First Man is them working on all the science

647
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,100
and Ryan Gosling helping invent the big rocket ship

648
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,940
and doing the zero G training.

649
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,700
And then there's a scene where he goes

650
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,300
and he learns how to master the katana

651
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,220
so he can fight the big worms that he knows.

652
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,700
He knows, I know there's gonna be big worms.

653
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,980
He's arguing with his wife.

654
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,420
His wife is like, why is it you?

655
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,420
Why do you have to go and leave our family behind?

656
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,180
He's like, I'm the only one that can kick

657
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,700
those big worms' asses.

658
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,900
I'm the chosen one.

659
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,020
I'm the chosen one.

660
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,620
Buzz still came out swinging with his katana just flying around.

661
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,140
No, Buzz, I already got all of them.

662
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,260
Don't worry, Neil, I'm here.

663
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,820
Before you came out, I killed all the worms.

664
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,580
I was the first man to kill a worm on the moon.

665
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,860
I killed all the worms.

666
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,620
Neil, you missed it, bud.

667
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,740
I got worm blood all over me and it gives me powers.

668
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:23,060
How often do you think during training for Neil and Buzz

669
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,020
and probably someone else that they talk to

670
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,500
like the head of NASA and they're like, okay,

671
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,660
and so just in case, what do we do if there are moon men?

672
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,420
And they're like, there's not, Neil, Buzz,

673
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,780
there's not gonna be moon people.

674
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,100
Like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

675
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:43,220
But if there are, what do we do?

676
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,220
Neil, Buzz.

677
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,700
No, no, no, I get it.

678
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,420
There's probably, yeah, probably, probably.

679
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,980
But do we like join their society and like integrate?

680
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,620
Every Gimlet show I listened to this week

681
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,180
has had first man ads on it

682
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:09,540
and we just absolutely gave them a free promo spot.

683
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,220
So you all wasted your money.

684
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,620
I don't actually think that's true

685
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,660
because we actually described a way more bad-ass movie

686
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,060
than is almost certainly going to be presented to you

687
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,860
on the silver screen.

688
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,020
Also want to congratulate myself

689
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,700
as we are sort of nearing the end of this bit

690
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,700
and sort of approaching the precipice of the money zone

691
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,300
for not ever saying Lance when describing Neil Armstrong.

692
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,580
I've done that pretty much every time

693
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,260
I've talked about space on podcasts before.

694
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,100
Good job.

695
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,820
And actually, now that I say that, I'm not sure it's true.

696
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,700
Yeah, if we're gonna finance our own movie

697
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,460
about Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong

698
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,660
fighting warrants on the moon,

699
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,700
we're gonna need some money.

700
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,980
Let's hear the money zone.

701
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:58,980
I would like to tell you about Bowl and Branch.

702
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,260
Go nuts.

703
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,060
Well, here's the thing.

704
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,260
Even before we've talked about like,

705
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,020
oh, they make great sheets and they do.

706
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,980
Listen, their sheets, amazing.

707
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,540
Not only comfortable, but affordable.

708
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,420
I love them.

709
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,500
But you know what else I love that they make?

710
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,380
Towels.

711
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,900
Oh, the towels are so good.

712
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,380
My favorite towels I've ever used in my entire life.

713
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,300
Oh, game changers.

714
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,660
They also make blankets

715
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,020
and everything is made from pure 100% organic cotton,

716
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,700
which means they start out super soft

717
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,260
and they just get softer over time.

718
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,180
They have thousands of five-star reviews

719
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,740
and Forbes, the Wall Street Journal and Fast Company

720
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,660
are all talking about Bowl and Branch.

721
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,700
Shipping is free and you can get them for 30 nights,

722
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,620
try them for 30 nights even.

723
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,260
And if you don't love them, send them back for a refund.

724
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,020
But I doubt you want to send them back

725
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,460
because you'll just want to buy more.

726
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,540
You're not sending them back.

727
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,740
You will not send them back.

728
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,540
You will buy more.

729
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,180

How dare you?

739
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,820
Yes.

740
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,020
I am Stitch Fix.

741
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,460
Okay.

742
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,460
No, it's a service and not a person.

743
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:20,980
Oh.

744
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,740
Yeah, it's a clothing.

745
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,020
That's their motto.

746
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,260
We're a service, not a person.

747
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,300
Stop mixing us up.

748
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,140
Stitch Fix is an online personal styling service.

749
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,700
What's that mean?

750
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,900
Well, you're going to give them your measurements.

751
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,980
You're going to tell them a little bit about your taste

752
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,900
and they're going to send you clothes

753
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,580
that they think will look great on you

754
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,700
and be a great fit for sort of your own personal style

755
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,900
in a big box.

756
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,620
You try on the clothes, you keep only the stuff you like

757
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,300
and the stuff you don't like, you send it back

758
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,420
in a pre-addressed envelope.

759
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,420
The postage is obviously already paid.

760
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,580
You just throw it in a bag and ship it back to them

761
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,220
if you don't like it.

762
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,980
But you're going to like all this stuff.

763
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,060
I have used this service for a long time.

764
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,020
I love it.

765
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,420
Basically all of our garments that we wear

766
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,500
at like live shows or anything are Stitch Fix.

767
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,660
And the cool thing is you work with your stylist

768
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,820
to give them feedback about the stuff that they send.

769
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,860
So if you don't like a particular shirt

770
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,860
or too pricey, whatever, they can customize the next box

771
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,540
to be a little bit better fit.

772
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:24,180

One more time, stitchfix.com slash my brother.

778
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,380
Got a gumbo charm here.

779
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,340
This one's for Alex and it's from Stan who says,

780
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,580
happy birthday or close to it.

781
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,660
Thanks for being such a great friend, role model

782
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,180
and for carrying me in every game of Halo we've ever played.

783
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,660
Our whole community is so lucky to have you in our lives

784
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,340
and we are certainly all better for it.

785
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,500
Keep on killing it in everything you do.

786
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,820
Here's to many more game nights, concerts

787
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,580
and McElroy live shows.

788
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,140
It's a sweet message, but it's a shame

789
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,100
you can't really chip in more for the Halo matches.

790
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,020
So I think each of us are going to give you

791
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,700
our top number one sort of Halo tip.

792
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,540
And we're going to start with Travis.

793
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,780
Travis, what's your number one Halo strategy for victory?

794
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,460
You got a romance the aliens.

795
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,300
All right, Justin.

796
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,540
Stegosaurus gun, baby.

797
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,220
Which one's that?

798
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,220
It's the one that looks like a stegosaurus

799
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,140
with all the needles coming out of the top.

800
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,140
Yeah, okay.

801
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,540
That was a trap.

802
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,860
Halo is for jokers, Xbox is for dum-dums

803
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,060
and PlayStation's where it's at.

804
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,580
I can't believe you guys fell for it.

805
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,780
Jesus Christ.

806
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,060
Dang, you did get me.

807
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,660
You got me again.

808
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,180
I have a message for Chris from Bonnie.

809
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,260
Thank you for being my other half for the best 15 years.

810
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,220
I think they meant it when they said you can't buy love.

811
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,220
Now I know you can rent it

812
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,940
and I'd like to renew our lease indefinitely.

813
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,460
Happy anniversary year.

814
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,340
I love you pants and wherever life has taken us

815
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,180
when this airs, I'll cover you.

816
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,140
That was extremely sweet.

817
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,380
When they said you can't buy love.

818
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,500
Yeah, you did need to sing that.

819
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,100
Now I know you can rent it

820
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,100
and I'd like to renew our lease indefinitely.

821
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,620
That's good.

822
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,260
There we go.

823
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,860
Oh, like in rent.

824
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,380
Yeah, it's a lot like rent.

825
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,420
There's also the matter of you said-

826
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:28,660
I long to discover something as true

827
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,300
as this is.

828
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,140
He's off mic so we can keep talking.

829
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:33,460
It's fine.

830
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,340
We don't have to cover this.

831
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,380
We don't have to pay for it

832
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,660
because it's off mic.

833
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,020
It's off mic, so it's fine.

834
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,260
Oh, now he's going to get a glass of water,

835
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:40,820
it sounds like.

836
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,500
Okay, he's using the bathroom.

837
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,220
Okay.

838
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,420
Now he's changing Cooper's diaper.

839
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,220
Okay.

840
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,460
Just let him finish.

841
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:03,540
Okay, okay.

842
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:04,980
All right.

843
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,820
Travis, let him go.

844
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,780
But it's a medley.

845
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,980
I know, you got to let him go.

846
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,340
You know how he gets when he's like this.

847
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,460
You have to let him finish.

848
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,980
I keep waiting for you guys to move on.

849
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,500
I'll just kind of be in the background

850
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,460
and then we'll wrap it up.

851
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,900
I refuse to give him that relief.

852
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,780
I'm going to just let him.

853
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,100
Oh, like a bat out of you know where.

854
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,140
We're out of it, we're done.

855
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,020
That's right, damn Yankees.

856
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,620
It's a history of Broadway.

857
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:32,820
Yeah, sure.

858
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,540
It's super good.

859
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,380
In what order?

860
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:41,700
You went from rent to damn Yankees.

861
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,060
Thanks for coming, everybody.

862
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,100
Now do Pippin.

863
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,340
Rivers belong where they can ramble.

864
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,380
Eagles belong where they can fly.

865
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:51,700
Anybody else?

866
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,260
Who is this for?

867
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,780
What do you look for in a book?

868
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,980
Literally if on the back it said like,

869
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,180
this book made me shit my pants.

870
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,780
I'd be like, I'm buying this book.

871
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,260
I think the problem with blurbs a lot of times.

872
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,140
I like that we both want to crap ourselves over books.

873
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,060
What's the best way to e-read in the tub?

874
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,260
Listen to that noise.

875
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,940
I'm reviewing a plastic bag today.

876
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,420
How do you find a good book?

877
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,580
This is the most fucked up weird shit you've ever read.

878
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,060
You're like into it, hand it over.

879
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,420
Take my money.

880
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,300
I'm Breah Grant.

881
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,340
And I'm Mallory O'Mara.

882
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,140
We're reading glasses and we solve all your bookish problems.

883
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,740
Every Thursday on Maximum Fun.

884
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,780
We got one more Gumbotron, right?

885
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,500
Just lingering, waiting to be read.

886
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,140
And it goes a little something like this.

887
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,260
Justin, this is from all listeners to us.

888
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,260
Damn, I loved it.

889
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,340
The part with Justin saying,

890
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,180
shit, I wish that had gone on for many more hours.

891
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,420
Well, thank you so much, dear listener.

892
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,340
You're so appreciated.

893
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:56,340
A lot of fake questions in this episode.

894
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,100
It's kind of a little bit of a trend.

895
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,180
So what do you guys want to do now?

896
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,380
I want you to read a question.

897
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,340
I'm kind of hungry.

898
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,140
I've got, oh.

899
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,020
Oh, you're kind of hungry?

900
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,740
Oh my God.

901
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,180
Well, I don't know if it's going to be a junior or a big boy.

902
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:10,740
What's it going to be?

903
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,220
I want a munch.

904
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,660
Squad.

905
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,540
Squad.

906
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,260
That's a big boy.

907
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,060
I want too much.

908
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,060
Squad junior.

909
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,540
Oh, damn it.

910
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,020
Mickey's.

911
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,500
We've never featured Mickey's on the show.

912
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,580
I don't even know what a Mickey's is.

913
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,300
It's a deli.

914
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:29,800
Holy shit.

915
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:36,100
This year, they're creating a spicy, spooky Cheeto pizza.

916
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,580
The popularity, the eerie Halloween food trend.

917
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,780
I'm sorry.

918
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,780
No, I don't think, is it?

919
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,420
They had the black whopper the one time, the spooky black bun whopper.

920
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,780
But that's about it that I know of.

921
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,140
That was an accident, though.

922
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,020
That was an accident.

923
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,740
They fucked up.

924
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,620
They let some typewriter ribbons fall into the bun maker machine.

925
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,740
They just burned the buns real bad.

926
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,420
This is a wild press release here on QSR.

927
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,940
This is one sentence.

928
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,380
With the popularity of the eerie Halloween food trend,

929
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,820
combined with the popularity of flaming hot Cheetos, period.

930
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,340
I don't know.

931
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,180
Is this 2009?

932
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,460
What the fuck are you talking?

933
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,340
Wait, that's not a complete sentence.

934
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,860
Have you guys seen this awesome, have you seen this hot Cheetos and talkies video?

935
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,500
It's new from 2000 and, it's just 2000, from the year 2000.

936
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,540
Here's another sentence.

937
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:31,060
Mickey's deemed it fitting to be the first pizzeria to combine the two, period.

938
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:31,780
Next sentence.

939
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:32,980
The result?

940
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,420
The spicy, spooky Cheeto pizza.

941
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,100
Why spooky?

942
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,660
Don't be fooled by its burnt like appearance.

943
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,260
Upon first glance, the pizza is actually very tasty.

944
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,860
What a press release.

945
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,980
Hey, I know this looks like shit, but I promise we didn't fuck it up.

946
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,820
It fucking looks like garbage.

947
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,380
The black.

948
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,380
Oh my God, I am looking at a JPEG of this.

949
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,300
It looks like fucking garbage.

950
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:05,540
The black hue is created by kneading activated charcoal into their fresh homemade dough.

951
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,340
But don't worry.

952
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,860
That's good, I'll clean your teeth.

953
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,260
This is a press release for a pizza to eat.

954
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,540
But don't worry.

955
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,980
In terms of flavor, activated charcoal doesn't have much.

956
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,900
Too much.

957
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:21,940
It's got a little bit of charcoal flavor, but not much.

958
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,780
Oh my God.

959
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:29,300
Next, two type of cheeses with that possessive apostrophe cheeses are added.

960
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,340
Oh my God.

961
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:36,660
Mickey's first pizza to have multiple kinds of cheeses is in a complete sentence in this press release.

962
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:43,860
The mozzarella provides a creamy, mild taste, while the cheddar gives the pizza a balance of flavor and sharpness.

963
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:50,420
To top it off, flaming hot Cheetos are baked on top, adding a bit of spice to every bite,

964
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,180
while perfectly complementing the various flavors.

965
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,460
This is my favorite line.

966
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,860
The spicy, spooky Cheeto pizza only comes in a size large.

967
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,180
We know half measures.

968
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,980
We know half measures.

969
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,220
Yeah, you can't dip your toe in this monstrosity.

970
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,300
You're going to eat a large and you're going to like it.

971
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:18,820
I will say, we talk about food in MunchSquad a lot that I'm like, but you know what?

972
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,780
I'd fucking eat it.

973
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,580
I'm looking at this pizza and it looks like a crime scene.

974
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,740
I would not eat it with my worst enemy's mouth.

975
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:29,620
Speaking of which, the last sentence of this is, make sure to come by to get your, quote,

976
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:33,380
Instagrammable food posts before the month ends.

977
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:38,420
I don't know that we should be, and I know that we are, and the ship is sailing.

978
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,380
We're all doomed, right?

979
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:46,340
But I don't know that we should be designing foodstuffs for the visual novelty.

980
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:53,140
I'm not sure we want the to be verb of all the food that we're trying to eat to be,

981
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,420
you all have to see what I'm about to put in my body.

982
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,340
The word I think you're looking for is ogled.

983
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,100
Right, exactly.

984
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:00,500
No.

985
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,540
I want my dinner to be rubber-necked by passers-by.

986
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,780
Like, how could you?

987
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,660
Come have a chomp of our yucky stunt pizza is basically what they're saying here.

988
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,860
Yeah, the Presley, it should just be one sentence.

989
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,060
Is this anything?

990
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,700
Question mark.

991
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,940
My boss loves buying-

992
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,740
My boss.

993
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,980
My boss loves buying expensive imported snacks from all around the world.

994
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,540
And then he ships them to me once a month.

995
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,580
It's a new subscription service and I'm offering it to you.

996
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,620
Called Ted Snacks.

997
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,420
Ted Snacks.

998
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,260
He picks his finest delicacies.

999
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,820
He picks them up from all around the world.

1000
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,060
Unfortunately for me, he loves to share.

1001
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,780
The problem is whenever he goes to share a snack, he asks me to put out my hand

1002
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,780
so he can toss me out a portion.

1003
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,540
He then waits until I take my hand away.

1004
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,040
What?

1005
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,820
This is sort of an unwritten ritual as I've gotten comments like,

1006
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,420
oh, so you were just humoring me when I take too little and

1007
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,260
okay, that's enough when I have pulled away too late.

1008
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,820
Brothers, what the fuck?

1009
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:12,180
What is the perfect boss pleasing snack portion and dear God, how do I achieve it?

1010
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,300
That's from Panic!

1011
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,500
A Snack in Toronto.

1012
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,140
I liked it.

1013
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,100
So you stick out the hand.

1014
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:30,420
The boss upends a bag of German crunchums and starts pouring in your hand

1015
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,540
and then doesn't stop until you opt out.

1016
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,380
Until you have decided you have received a fair amount of German crunchums.

1017
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:44,020
That's the issue and sometimes you take too little, the boss thinks you think they're yucky.

1018
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,540
You take too much, the boss thinks you're trying to rob them of all their crunchums.

1019
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,540
I would say that if the boss said to me,

1020
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:53,300
okay, that's enough, I would look them dead in the eye and say, no, it's not.

1021
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,100
It's not enough.

1022
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,220
I love these things.

1023
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:55,720
More.

1024
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,140
I bet I love these and you don't want to deny me, do you?

1025
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,060
Here's one option.

1026
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:07,940
You can have every snack at your desk all the time

1027
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,540
and so when your boss is like, hey, you got to try these.

1028
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:15,540
They're Australian Pringles and he just upends the can, right?

1029
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,700
And he starts dumping them into your hand.

1030
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:22,100
You reach into your desk, take out your can of Australian Pringles

1031
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,260
and start dumping them onto the boss.

1032
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:30,820
And then it's like you've turned into a water feature of reconstituted potato granules.

1033
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,020
He's dumping them on you.

1034
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,820
You're dumping them on him and then will he pull away?

1035
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,100
Will he be the coward?

1036
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:36,660
I don't know.

1037
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,460
Ball's in his court because you can take them all day long.

1038
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,060
Maybe that's it.

1039
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:45,220
Maybe keep a bunch of gallon-sized Ziploc bags at your desk

1040
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,580
and when he comes out, you just open it up and hold it out like it's trick or treat.

1041
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,140
You know what I mean?

1042
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,980
You're just like, yep, yep, fill her up.

1043
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,940
I don't like those, but my kids will love them.

1044
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,340
Yeah, my daughter.

1045
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,820
I don't have kids, of course, but someday.

1046
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,460
My girls will love these.

1047
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:04,180
It sounds like your boss maybe doesn't like the snacks.

1048
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,580
The boss just likes feeling powerful and has done, right?

1049
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,860
Because if the boss did this with like, you know, some lifesavers gummies

1050
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,460
and you take a bunch of them, it's not a big deal.

1051
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:17,620
You just run down to the, you know, the Super America downstairs and grab some more.

1052
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,140
But these are irreplaceable.

1053
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,500
These are irreplaceable treasures.

1054
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,700
Yeah, finite.

1055
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:26,180
I think what you got to do is one of these times is take all of them.

1056
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,780
And so they don't take all of their, you know, chocobooms,

1057
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,580
their chocolate chocobooms, and then you take all of them.

1058
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,780
He doesn't have any more.

1059
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:40,740
And then you say, sorry, I took too many.

1060
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,140
And the boss says, well, shoot, I don't have any more chocobooms.

1061
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,740
And then the next time your boss probably won't even give you any more snacks.

1062
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:52,500
And I would say also, like, take them all and then display no remorse or shame.

1063
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,260
Because if they want to, like, shame you, like, oh, you took all my snacks.

1064
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,180
And you say, like, well, you gave me all your snacks.

1065
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,060
Yeah, I thought you were, I thought you wanted, when you came over here,

1066
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,140
I thought you wanted to give me all your chocobooms.

1067
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,340
Because I noticed that you did not reserve any for yourself.

1068
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,380
So I guess.

1069
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,900
Yeah, I thought you hated them.

1070
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,400
I guess.

1071
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,180
I just had a great idea.

1072
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,340
Next time your boss comes to you and offers you a snack,

1073
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,740
look at them in the eye and repeat this extremely powerful phrase.

1074
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,980
Does it contain saffron?

1075
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,900
I'm extremely, extremely allergic to saffron.

1076
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,580
I recently discovered that and it's made my life a lot harder.

1077
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,540
But, you know, as long as I'm smart about it, it's not usually a problem.

1078
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,500
So I will die if I eat any saffron.

1079
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,260
So how much saffron do these have in them?

1080
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:42,500
Can you swear on my literal life that there's no saffron in these snacks?

1081
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,740
And then you're fine.

1082
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,660
Yeah, you'll never eat another snack again for as long as you live.

1083
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,780
Yeah, but it's fine.

1084
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,820
Now, listen, y'all, can you imagine though, like, I think-

1085
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,540
What if they look good?

1086
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:53,860
I think Griffin's right.

1087
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,140
What if they look like really good snacks?

1088
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,100
Well, one, if they look really good.

1089
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:56,900
Yeah, sure.

1090
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,700
And everyone in the office is just like, mmm, these crunchums.

1091
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,380
But imagine, I think Griffin is right, but this is a power move, right?

1092
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:08,980
But imagine if you did, like, stick the landing, because it's like, I don't know,

1093
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:13,460
two and a half seconds of, like, chocums pouring is the right amount.

1094
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,900
And your boss is, like, so ready to, like, shame you one way or the other.

1095
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,860
But then you nail the amount and it's like, well, fuck.

1096
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,140
That is the perfect amount, shoot.

1097
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:21,700
Damn it.

1098
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,740
The boss, like, and then everyone lifts you up on their shoulders and, like,

1099
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:29,540
chants you out of the building as your boss dissolves into just chocums.

1100
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:33,700
The only way to make sure you get the perfect amount is to make your boss be the one that

1101
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,420
cuts it off.

1102
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:38,020
And I think the way that you can do that is when the boss comes over and says,

1103
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,380
hey, I've got some chocobooms.

1104
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,980
You want to you want to try some?

1105
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,340
You say, sure.

1106
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,180
Ah, and you just open your mouth.

1107
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,780
Yeah, yes.

1108
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,620
And the boss has to put them right in the mouth.

1109
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:50,740
And when he stops, you've had an I think you've had enough.

1110
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,900
And you always have your hands full.

1111
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:53,380
Yeah.

1112
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,900
And he reaches in your mouth to put a chocoboom on your tongue.

1113
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:01,380
And you chomp down and he pulls his hand back and kind of giggles like a pretty woman.

1114
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,820
Mm hmm.

1115
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,020
Or maybe he puts them in your mouth and you say, too many.

1116
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:06,980
You say too many.

1117
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,900
And now it's on him.

1118
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,100
Now he's the fuck up.

1119
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,300
Now he's the Malkovich.

1120
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:15,220
You could also just eat as many eat too little.

1121
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,260
Take too little.

1122
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,880
And he says, oh, seems like you didn't like them and you eat them and you go,

1123
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,980
Scrummy!

1124
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,060
And then you also never get snacks again.

1125
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,300
There's just so many things you could do.

1126
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,400
This is an easy one, Jesus.

1127
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,200
This one's really easy.

1128
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,240
This one's so easy.

1129
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,000
There's like 15 things you can do.

1130
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,360
It's so easy.

1131
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,180
Do you have a scapegoat in the office

1132
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,600
that you could make go first and see how many they take?

1133
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,900
And then just always take?

1134
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:43,800
Dial it in.

1135
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,640
Yeah.

1136
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,480
Interesting.

1137
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,340
I got a Yahoo here, y'all want it?

1138
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,180
Yeah.

1139
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,060
It was sent in by Logan, thanks Logan.

1140
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:56,020
It's Yahoo Answers user Tentacles87 who asks,

1141
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,660
if you want an extra cheese slice at a fancy restaurant,

1142
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,060
what is the least embarrassing way of saying it?

1143
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:10,580
You're at a fancy restaurant, like Bucca di Beppo,

1144
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:16,340
and you want, I guess I included this one mostly

1145
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,420
because I was trying to sort of split the needle,

1146
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,340
thread the needle.

1147
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,540
Well, no, I wanted to split it

1148
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,960
because I'd like to have two needles,

1149
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,660
of knowing what is a fancy restaurant

1150
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:32,620
that does deal in cheese slices, in slices of cheese.

1151
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,060
You can request an extra one.

1152
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,420
The only thing I can think of is like on a burger.

1153
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,760
Like a fancy, like a, yeah, yeah.

1154
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,780
Like a dude burger made out of like human meat.

1155
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:48,400
And that's the only sort of fancy burger I can imagine.

1156
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,300
I can't, because I can't, listen,

1157
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,140
I don't want to brag,

1158
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,660
but I'm an adult and I've ordered a cheese plate before.

1159
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:54,980
I don't think a cheese plate has ever come

1160
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,540
and I've said, could I get more of this,

1161
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,980
but without paying for it, please?

1162
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,580
Also, I don't think a cheese plate

1163
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,700
ever comes with slices of anything.

1164
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,920
You may get little chunks,

1165
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,500
but I don't think you can get like,

1166
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,220
I don't think they have like Kraft singles

1167
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,060
on a cheese plate.

1168
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,520
Although that would be dope.

1169
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,780
How thick does a chunk of cheese have to be

1170
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,260
before it stops being a slice?

1171
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:19,260
Anything thicker than a slice, it's an orientation issue.

1172
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,820
I'm just now thinking about it.

1173
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:27,660
Squad, why don't they have Kraft singles on cheese plates

1174
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:32,500
so that you know how fancy the other cheese is.

1175
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,940
You get those Kraft singles and you-

1176
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,740
Oh, a baseline cheese.

1177
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,740
They make you eat that,

1178
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,980
because whenever I eat a cheese plate,

1179
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,300
I always pretend like,

1180
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,800
mm, that one was harder to eat

1181
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,260
because of the pungent flavors.

1182
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,080
I guess that means it was good,

1183
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,460
but I don't know what makes good cheese, right?

1184
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,300
Because I'm not always-

1185
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,680
I noticed there's some weird colors

1186
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,020
and speckles in this one, is that?

1187
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,180
Oh, perfectly normal.

1188
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:59,020
Yes, of course, I thought it was well, good.

1189
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,620
Good and fancy, my very favorite.

1190
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,440
I ate this one and it was,

1191
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,620
it stank the inside of my mouth so bad

1192
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,280
that I started to cry a little bit,

1193
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,120
so I guess it's very good.

1194
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,300
I think the best way that you can know

1195
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,980
if the cheese is good is if you do have a Kraft single,

1196
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:16,060
and now you know, like, all right, that's the bar,

1197
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,900
let's see if you can clear it.

1198
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,740
I noticed that there's some skin left on this,

1199
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:25,500
boy, did you mean, okay, that is as intended.

1200
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,540
Do I eat that, do I eat the skin?

1201
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,140
I see here on the plate,

1202
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:32,060
there's a bunch of things that aren't cheese,

1203
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,100
and I assume some of them are supposed to go

1204
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,480
with some of the cheese and some of them aren't.

1205
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,060
If you could stay here and just coach me

1206
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,460
through this experience together like a doula,

1207
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,740
that would be amazing, thank you very much.

1208
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,060
It's just like, I wanna go in the back room

1209
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,540
with some of these fancy restaurants, gang,

1210
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,860
and see if the fucking Riddler is the one

1211
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:53,020
putting these cheese plates together.

1212
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,540
I put olives and berries on there.

1213
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:58,980
Okay, well now, what am I supposed to do with that?

1214
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,740
You know, you never really order soup

1215
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,900
and get a tray of cut up potatoes and chicken and stuff

1216
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,700
and a can of broth, and the chef's like,

1217
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,340
I don't know, you figure it out,

1218
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,340
whatever tastes good to you. Good luck.

1219
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,760
I'm going to give you a large chungu cheese

1220
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,620
and three crackers, and it'll be up to you

1221
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,460
to determine the portions.

1222
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:20,660
There should be six of everything.

1223
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,260
How are you gonna play me like that?

1224
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,780
That's what they do with Lunchables.

1225
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,620
Thank you.

1226
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,400
Run the math.

1227
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,060
Lunchables are my favorite cheese tray.

1228
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:31,820
For sure, how do you ask for extra cheese slice

1229
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:32,940
at a fancy restaurant though

1230
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,100
without being embarrassed to say it?

1231
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,220
I think you have to say like, the person next to me,

1232
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,540
they're in the bathroom right now,

1233
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,340
but they were interested in another,

1234
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,300
if you can believe it, another cheese slice.

1235
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:47,320
This asshole right here wants extra cheese.

1236
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,820
In slice form, please.

1237
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,020
Sliced, please.

1238
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,740
She specifically said, excuse me,

1239
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,300
I'm getting lactose intolerance tomorrow,

1240
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:58,860
and I want to live it up tonight.

1241
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,220
I have super lactose tolerance,

1242
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:05,060
and if I don't get a slice of cheese, I could go into shock.

1243
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,480
I'm gonna lose it.

1244
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,860
My body loves this stuff.

1245
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,420
My body just goes crazy for this stuff.

1246
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:14,180
I'm just gonna do, I have lactose intolerance,

1247
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,740
and I'm gonna do a Nicolas Cage

1248
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,460
and leaving Las Vegas thing tonight,

1249
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,860
so if you could just pile it on.

1250
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:22,460
I'm going to Ben and Jerry's after this.

1251
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,820
I just want to get fucking,

1252
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,180
I just want to lactate.

1253
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,340
I'm doing a lactating Las Vegas thing.

1254
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,780
We found the episode title, good.

1255
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,460
Blow me out.

1256
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,820
I was worried we weren't gonna find

1257
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,140
the episode title, but we did.

1258
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:43,380
Here, it's just the six minutes to midnight.

1259
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,300
You didn't even really crush it.

1260
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,180
Good work, Juice.

1261
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,540
Folks, thanks so much for listening to our show.

1262
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,820
We did our dumb book plugs at the beginning,

1263
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,580
but if you could go to bit.ly forward slash

1264
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,820
the Sawbones book and buy my book.

1265
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,260
It's out of stock in most places,

1266
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,940
but if you put it in order on Amazon,

1267
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:00,860
as soon as that next printing comes through,

1268
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,980
we're gonna get y'all taken care of,

1269
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,300
and that second printing is in the works,

1270
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,460
so make sure you grab one of those if you can.

1271
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,220
I will brag about it for a second and say

1272
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,980
it is an absolutely beautiful book,

1273
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:16,020
super fun, very well written,

1274
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,860
and even if you know someone who has never listened

1275
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,140
to the podcast before, but you know that they're interested

1276
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,580
in weird history or medical stuff

1277
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,460
or just things that are funny and good,

1278
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,340
get this book for them, for yourself.

1279
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:32,060
It's perfect, and we're heading towards the holidays.

1280
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:32,900
Oh, thank you.

1281
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,220
And it's a great holiday gift.

1282
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,420
The Adventure Zone Murder on the Rockport Limited

1283
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,460
is the other big news this week.

1284
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:44,700
It is available for pre-order at theadventurezonecomic.com.

1285
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,100
You pre-order your copy now,

1286
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:50,060
you'd be, honestly, criminally evil

1287
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,060
to not do so immediately.

1288
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,500
We've got the, we've been working on the script for a while

1289
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,020
and have started to see art from it,

1290
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,440
and this book is gonna beat ass.

1291
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,620
It is so fucking, I'm so stoked for this one to come out.

1292
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,340
This is a good one. Whipped Tushy book.

1293
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,860
You're gonna love it.

1294
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,040
So, thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1295
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,560
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1296
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,380
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1297
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,820
Good old album, good old guy.

1298
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,100
Thanks to MaxFun, also, for having us on the network.

1299
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,300

1300
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,580

1301
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:22,220

00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,980
And so many more at maximumfun.org,

1304
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,660
and we have shows at macklerayshows.com.

1305
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,140
Anything else, fellas?

1306
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,340
Also, at macklerayshows.com,

1307
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:36,100
I think there's still a few tickets

1308
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,820
for our November shows in Austin and Denver,

1309
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,940
if you wanna count those,

1310
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,020
both My Brother, My Brother, Me and The Adventure Zone.

1311
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,060
I know for a fact that My Brother, My Brother, Me

1312
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,140
in Austin and Denver are almost sold out,

1313
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,260
like 2% away from being sold out,

1314
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:53,660
and I think there's still, I don't know,

1315
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,140
some tickets for The Adventure Zone,

1316
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,060
but it is also very close to sold out.

1317
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:00,640
So, if you're in the Austin or Denver area in November

1318
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,700
and you wanna come to those,

1319
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,340
we are also working on a Candle Night show.

1320
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,340
We don't quite have the date yet,

1321
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,300
but that's gonna come probably

1322
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,900
around the third weekend in December.

1323
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,220
We will let y'all know, yeah, we'll firm that up.

1324
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,780
Yeah, we'll leave it over show when we have it.

1325
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:14,820
One more thing.

1326
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,340
Shit.

1327
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,640
At the Barnes & Noble Tribeca in New York, New York,

1328
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:24,140
on October 17th, Justin, Sydney, and probably Taylor, yes,

1329
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,220
are going to be doing a signing of the Sawbones book.

1330
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,380
You can see a link to that

1331
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,180
at macklerayshows.com slash tours as well.

1332
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:32,020
Here's that final.

1333
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:32,980
It's sent in by Michelle Smith.

1334
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:33,820
Thank you, Michelle.

1335
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,620
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

1336
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,180
I'm gonna call them.

1337
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,500
Bubsy asks,

1338
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:43,180
is lettuce basically crunchy water?

1339
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:46,940
My name is Justin McElroy.

1340
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,380
I'm Travis McElroy.

1341
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,460
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1342
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,240
My brother, my brother, may kiss your dad's square

1343
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,080
on the lips.

1344
00:55:52,080 --> 00:56:09,080
Hey girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna.

1345
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,060
Maximumfun.org.

1346
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,100
Comedy and culture.

1347
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,180
Artist owned.

1348
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:14,380
Listener supported.

1349
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:16,620
Welcome.

1350
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:17,460
Thank you.

1351
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,280
Thanks.

1352
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,340
These are real podcast listeners, not actors.

1353
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,420
What do you look for in a podcast?

1354
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,260
Reliability is big for me.

1355
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,100
Power.

1356
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,660
I'd say comfort.

1357
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,660
What do you think of this?

1358
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,500
Oh.

1359
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:33,980
That's Jordan Jesse Go.

1360
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,080
Jordan Jesse Go?

1361
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,540
They came out of the floor?

1362
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,060
And down from the ceiling?

1363
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,860
That can't be safe.

1364
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,340
I'm upset.

1365
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,500
Can we go now?

1366
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,340
Soon.

1367
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:49,340
Jordan Jesse Go, a real podcast.
