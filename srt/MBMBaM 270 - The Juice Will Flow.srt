1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,480
Welcome, my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,640
My name is Justin McElroy. I'm your oldest brother. My voice sounds like this today.

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,000
My name is Travis McElroy, your middlest brother.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,200
And I'm Griffin. Guys, what the fuck even is going on anymore?

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,560
It was a rough weekend. There was much ribaldry to be had.

10
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,200
There was a lot, as they say, going on.

11
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,440
There was a lot of folks.

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,240
Turn my ceiling fan off. Forgot to turn that off,

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,640
and there's a little bit of sound in the studio. Gonna be a rough one.

14
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,640
I think that this one's gonna be a rough gem.

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,320
No, I think there's gonna be some true diamonds to polish.

16
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,040
This one's gonna be a jagged little pill.

17
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,840
This is the diamond in the rough. We have located the diamond in the rough for you.

18
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,720
Now the impetus is on you to detect its dimonosity.

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,840
Count the carrots. Observe the purity.

20
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,240
You must constantly recut it and recut it as it grows smaller and smaller,

21
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,000
and yet you grow more and more unsatisfied with its perfection.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,800
Recut it with the diamond cutting tool of apology and also making excuses in your mind

23
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,360
for our comedy and learn to appreciate this diamond in the rough.

24
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,600
Because that's what growing up is. You're an adult now. Congratulations.

25
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,040
That's what growing up is. Here's a certificate.

26
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,880
Life is just a series of shittier and shittier diamonds.

27
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,880
No, that's not what I'm saying. That's awful negative.

28
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,880
I didn't get it. I didn't get the metaphor that you were crafting.

29
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,160
I'm just saying this is an episode that only the true fans will appreciate.

30
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,960
I think all of our last like six to seven episodes have been for true fans only.

31
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,840
I feel like maybe we're becoming a little bit insular.

32
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,680
I felt like our last six to seven episodes were for Trueblood fans only.

33
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,720
Well, that's because we talked a lot about Trueblood, Travie.

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,520
A lot about Trueblood.

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,840
A lot about Trueblood. It was exclusionary. Guys.

36
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,320
Yes?

37
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,820
Yeah.

38
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,360
This podcast is killing me.

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,240
Let's drill down.

40
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:02,880
I can't keep, I can't, the pace, the breakneck pace at which we are traveling and doing shit,

41
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,800
doing other shit. It's like-

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,320
The rockstar lifestyle of the, I remember reading about this in David Lee Roth's biography

43
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,560
when he talked about how rough podcasting was on him.

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,520
This episode, can we finally just cut the shit?

45
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,640
Let's cut the bullshit.

46
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:28,560
Can we cut the bullshit and just like talk to each other about how tired we are?

47
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,000
We got a lot of irons in the fire and it's our fucking fault.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,280
We left those irons here like, I'll get it later, but now it's like,

49
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,560
hey, you got until Monday to get all those fucking irons out and it's like,

50
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,760
oh, but they're so hot and I left my iron gloves.

51
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,760
We're being evicted from our blacksmith room.

52
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,240
Yeah. I mean, whatever.

53
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:56,400
I mean, fuck it, whatever. This is our welcome to the privilege hour.

54
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,200
I love it.

55
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,440
I'm so fucking beat, dog.

56
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,920
I mean, it was a big ass weekend.

57
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,920
And we're not, here's the thing though, like I think a lot of like, I think a lot of the

58
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:15,680
mistakes that true entertainers, the real, you know, tears of a clown types to make is

59
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,560
they go on stage and they try to do a great show and it's just not in them.

60
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,960
And then people say they've lost it and it's like, well, that's hurtful.

61
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,000
So what we're saying is we've lost it, but we'll get it back.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,480
We just want you to be invested in the journey with us.

63
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:41,040
We're not going to lie to you and say, hey, this is like, you know, what best show,

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,000
but maybe it might be, we make it up every week, every week.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
A man falls in a hole.

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,400
You know what I mean?

67
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:48,880
Yeah.

68
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,800
And guys guy walks by and he's like, you're in a hole.

69
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,200
Miners fall in the hole with him.

70
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,200
And then there's, and then they find a TV down there and they just start like,

71
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,720
hanging out for a while while they hide from their jobs.

72
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,600
And it's pretty cool.

73
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,360
This is our reboot of roundhouse.

74
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,160
It's called ground hole and it's a kid's club, a subterranean kids club.

75
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,200
Hey, that was pretty good.

76
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,880
It's turning around already.

77
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,000
I got home last night from the West coast.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,120
I woke up at 5 30 AM West coast time.

79
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, then I went to sleep at 1 AM this time and then my baby woke up at 5 30 AM this time.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,520
Then I went back to sleep.

81
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,320
I am doing jet lag the worst anyone has done it.

82
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,600
I found a secret new jet lag inside jet lag.

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,040
Justin, Justin somehow set his internal clock to like Korea.

84
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,560
I woke up and I saw the leprechauns like dart back under like,

85
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,160
there's no way he's awake right now.

86
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,680
Now you know where all your shoes come from.

87
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,720
Now you know where all your left socks have gone.

88
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,160
They've been on.

89
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,880
It's impossible.

90
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,960
But like, I woke up and my stuffed animals were still like singing and talking and interacting.

91
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,640
No, Justin, it's impossible.

92
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,400
There's no way you're awake right now.

93
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,240
What the fuck, dude?

94
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,320
The teddy bear picnic.

95
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,880
How could you witness the teddy bear picnic?

96
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,240
There's no way you're awake.

97
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,200
But like, come to think of it, I don't know when you would be asleep either.

98
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,400
You're pretty fucked up right now.

99
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,280
You didn't see the shit before the teddy bear picnic, right?

100
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,960
Because that's when it was wrong.

101
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,080
You just saw.

102
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,200
I'll be honest, the teddy bear picnic is kind of a cool down.

103
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,840
Teddy bear picnics like our chill out tent.

104
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,360
And that's the day the teddy bears had their fuckfest.

105
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,080
You didn't see our eyes wide shut homage, did you?

106
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
Do you remember when I just yell saying,

107
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,480
and that's the day the teddy bears had their fuckfest?

108
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,080
Because that is the exact time that my mailman decided to drop off my mail right outside my office.

109
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,680
We've got a complicated relationship, me and this dude.

110
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,240
Let's do some questions though.

111
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,200
He's a good man.

112
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,400
Get that mail to you, rain or sun.

113
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,720
Or someone yelling about teddy bear fuckfest, sleet or snow or horrifying imagery.

114
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,320
The mailman just keeps chugging on.

115
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,600
Look out on your lawn and see if he's just like seated out there with his head in his hands.

116
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,880
He's calling his wife.

117
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,320
No, this is my last day.

118
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,960
You know what?

119
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,240
I can't do this anymore.

120
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,200
I'm out the game.

121
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,000
Let me check real quick.

122
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,080
Yeah, he's baiting.

123
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,840
Your mailman's dirty.

124
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,080
He's a dirty little postal boy.

125
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,520
I travel for work a lot.

126
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,560
Usually with one particularly clingy and incompetent colleague.

127
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,320
I thought I was going to sing this whole question.

128
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,160
I got five words in and bailed.

129
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,760
I need a fair amount of alone time in order to function.

130
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,520
And also I find her to be extremely annoying company.

131
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,840
She's just the opposite and expects to eat every meal together.

132
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,960
A few times I've gotten away from her for dinner, but the next day she complains about loneliness.

133
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,760
How can I get more meals alone without alienating my colleague?

134
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,640
That's from desperately seeking solitude.

135
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,400
Fuck, that sucks.

136
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,440
Damn, that's a hard question to start with.

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,560
I might try to make a proposal.

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,360
I propose that what you need to do is upon one of these forced dinners,

139
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,360
you need to invent another friend who's very clingy and say,

140
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,360
oh yes, I have this clingy friend, Susan.

141
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,720
And she doesn't seem to understand that I need some alone time.

142
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,840
You know what I mean?

143
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,160
To function and oh, she's great and all, don't get me wrong.

144
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,840
I like Susan, but sometimes you just need some time to recenter yourself

145
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,160
and really think about now this may or may not solve the problem.

146
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,760
Maybe your clingy work colleague gets the hint and goes like,

147
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,000
oh, okay, I'm getting now that this is a person.

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,280
But what it does provide you is in the future, if this person is clingy again,

149
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,640
you're able to say like, you know, like I said, I just need a little alone time.

150
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,000
And you've already, like in the past,

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,120
brought up the subject makes it easier to bring up a second time.

152
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,560
But what if you're like, what if like your friend's like,

153
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,600
she sounds fun.

154
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,120
What's her number?

155
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,760
Give it to me.

156
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,640
I'm going to hit her up.

157
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,840
You can't, sorry, Justin, let me just step in here.

158
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,800
You can't do an impression of any woman that sounds like that.

159
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,080
You cannot do-

160
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,880
That is the embodiment of the cartoon Cathy.

161
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,200
Yeah, that's, you just did a Cathy, my dude.

162
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,600
I mean, there's like, I love all people.

163
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:41,840
Yeah.

164
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,480
I give due respect to everyone regardless of-

165
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,200
Didn't just-

166
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Like literally anything at this point.

167
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,080
There are still Cathys in the world, Griffin.

168
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,040
The earth still doth contain Cathys.

169
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,920
I would give them the emotional right of way that I give to all peoples.

170
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,960
They still exist and have voices.

171
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,600
But I'm saying historically-

172
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,920
I am giving voices to the Cathys.

173
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,680
Why should you silence them?

174
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
Do not silence the Cathys.

175
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,120
But he who is without Cathys throws the first stone.

176
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,040
Historically, that is a voice you do of a bad person.

177
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,520
On the Justin McElroy voice-o-meter scale,

178
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,280
it's when you do a good person, he sounds like you.

179
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,760
But when you do a bad person, it sounds like Cathy.

180
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,800
I'm just saying you have a confirmation, a Cathy confirmation bias.

181
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,480
You're saying that I've got kind of a

182
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,720
Jekyll and Hyde Justin and Cathy situation.

183
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,880
You do, you do, you do.

184
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,360
That is my favorite morning show, by the way.

185
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,760
Yeah, Dr. Jekyll and Cathy.

186
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,520
Listen, listen.

187
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:52,640
Can you do anything to sort of sell the merits of loneliness chill out times?

188
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,400
Maybe get her on geocaching.

189
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,760
Well, I don't spend my lonely times geocaching, although I should.

190
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,480
Oh, you don't?

191
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,800
I should fill those hours with a little treasure hunts for spoons and whatnot, coupons.

192
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,120
I have wondered my entire life who the fuck would eat at community tables at restaurants.

193
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,000
I think I have just cracked the case.

194
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,720
It's you.

195
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,200
You have to find restaurants that have shared tables, family style dining,

196
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,560
and then you are muting the blows.

197
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,280
She can talk to other people there at the table.

198
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,920
You know what I'm saying?

199
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,720
You're refracting the attention.

200
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,720
So strangers sitting at community tables at restaurants

201
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,160
are just friends whose dinners you haven't ruined yet.

202
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,920
With Cathy.

203
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,280
With your fucking nonstop horseshit chatter.

204
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,280
They're trying to enjoy their steak frites.

205
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,880
Can I tell you guys what I actually do about the scenario in my real life?

206
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,520
Uh, back when I used to be in a lot of different work environments,

207
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,960
I would often have these situations.

208
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:03,440
Uh, sometimes it was in a car traveling to news events with a person I found

209
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,040
particularly distasteful or unpleasant to be around,

210
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,640
but was not a malicious sort of person that did not deserve my, my scorn.

211
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:19,280
What I would do is I would find a subject that this is, this is, I don't know if this is terrible or genius.

212
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,320
You guys got to help me.

213
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:29,520
I would find a subject that I had some passing interest in that the person was an expert about.

214
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,440
Like I would talk to them until I found something that they knew a lot about

215
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,400
and then just decide that I was going to absorb all of their knowledge about this specific topic.

216
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,880
I like that.

217
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,480
So maybe they grew up in, in Wisconsin, for example.

218
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,480
Uh, and I was like, I don't know fucking shit about Wisconsin.

219
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,680
Tell me about the tales.

220
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,480
I'm going to learn fucking everything you know about Wisconsin.

221
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:04,720
I'm going to like put a, put my, my, my little sucker onto your medulla oblongata and absorb all of your knowledge.

222
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,160
I want to know Wisconsin in the biblical sense and that's all we're going to talk about anytime we're together.

223
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,160
You're the big fat worm from Starship Troopers.

224
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,360
Exactly.

225
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,520
You just jack right into the brain matrix.

226
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,160
I love this because it's mutually beneficial.

227
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,520
You get to learn about a subject that you're, you're interested in.

228
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:27,200
You get a little bit better and they get to like feel like they're, you know, having the interaction with you.

229
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,320
This is great.

230
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,120
But then you say, but then you say, I, you're all used up, Jerry.

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,520
Jerry, no, you don't got nothing.

232
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,200
You're all used up, Jerry.

233
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,040
And then you eat his head.

234
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,840
Sorry, Vicky.

235
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,520
I don't have anything else to learn from you.

236
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,800
I'm closing this Wikipedia page and I'm going to learn from somebody else.

237
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,000
What about this?

238
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,680
Make plans with them for like a specific, like we'll have dinner together, right?

239
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,720
And then the other 23 hours of the day are yours.

240
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,880
Oh, that's a good idea, Trav.

241
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,840
Like you could say, well, listen, I got some errands I gotta run, but I'll see you at nine for our dinner and McDonald's, right?

242
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,880
So that way they get to feel like they get the interaction with you.

243
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,120
They don't get to complain about loneliness, but it's not this weird, amorphous hanging out could last forever.

244
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,520
Yeah.

245
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,200
Do you guys want a yahoo hand?

246
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,480
Yeah, that like fixed it.

247
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:24,880
Thank you.

248
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,560
Here comes the yahoo.

249
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,040
Between those two advices, I think there's some good advice here.

250
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,000
Here comes a fresh one.

251
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,000
Flip it.

252
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,680
Fresh new bio one flipped it off the dome.

253
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,280
It's from Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

254
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:35,840
Thank you, Zoe.

255
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,240
It's by yahoo answers user Archie who asks.

256
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,840
I think I swap bodies with my goldfish at night.

257
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,160
Help.

258
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,160
I think I swap bodies with my goldfish at night.

259
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,480
Help.

260
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,440
When I go to sleep, I keep seeing flashes of an image of blurred water.

261
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,720
Eventually when I go to sleep, all I can see is the inside of my goldfish's goldfish bowl.

262
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,640
And when I swam to the end of the bowl, I could see my body flapping around.

263
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,400
I think I swap bodies with my goldfish.

264
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,520
This happens most nights.

265
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,160
Your body was flapping around.

266
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,000
So the goldfish was in your body freaking the fuck out.

267
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,520
Yeah, you would fucking hate him.

268
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,120
You it's bad for you because because you're a goldfish.

269
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,520
Imagine how bad it is for your sweet goldfish though.

270
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,560
The goldfish is getting the short end of the stick.

271
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:34,240
Like up till now, the only world this fish has known has been a purely water based one.

272
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:42,960
But it wait, what if you look over through the watery water of the tank and you see your goldfish.

273
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,600
Goldfish is touching your wife.

274
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,600
No, goldfish, that is my wife.

275
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,960
No, you mustn't.

276
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,120
And it's emptying your bank account.

277
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,200
While touching your wife.

278
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
While touching your wife.

279
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,880
Your goldfish is ambidextrous.

280
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,240
One hand on your wife, one hand on the keyboard of your computer.

281
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,520
How is that goldfish not a type?

282
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,480
I don't know.

283
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,000
He was watched you do it.

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,600
How long has this been going on?

285
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,760
What if you look over and your goldfish is in your cat and your cat is in your body and

286
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,280
you're in the goldfish?

287
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,320
Yeah, everybody just jumped one to the left.

288
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,040
I like that.

289
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:29,120
And, but then your wife jumped into your dog and then, oh man, this is getting crazy.

290
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,240
Justin, you there?

291
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,600
Yeah, I'm here.

292
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,160
What happened?

293
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,880
Just listening.

294
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,160
Just doing some fan art.

295
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,680
Doing some fan art of this classic bit.

296
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,560
No, I thought that thought maybe there was an incredible Mr.

297
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,280
Limpet goof in here somewhere.

298
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,840
Fuck, dude.

299
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,880
I could hear the gears turning, but then they didn't turn.

300
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,440
Well, I kept waiting for the moment and then there wasn't one.

301
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,840
So I went to the Wikipedia page for the incredible Mr. Limpet.

302
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,520
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

303
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,280
I knew there was some sort of ghostwriter web surfing going on.

304
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,120
I knew that we caught you in a genuine web surf sequence and I'm glad that we got to

305
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,000
the bottom of it.

306
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,280
Can we talk about Mr.

307
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,560
Limpet for a second?

308
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,960
This is the equivalent of podcast juicing, is what you've discovered.

309
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,400
Like you've caught me with a bag.

310
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah, if juicing made you fucking worse at a thing.

311
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,200
No, it's like you knocked me over.

312
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,920
If juicing distracted you from baseball.

313
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:33,840
You knocked me over in the locker room and a bag, a little Ziploc baggie of Wikipedias

314
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,160
fell out of my juicer.

315
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,320
No, you were actually next in the order.

316
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,640
You were up to bat, but you weren't fucking there because you were too busy buying the

317
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,360
juice.

318
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,000
It was, I was next to bat and you couldn't find me and then you looked into the crowd

319
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,840
and saw me wandering up and down the aisle.

320
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,000
I was like, does anybody have some steroids?

321
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,480
Yeah.

322
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,200
Hey, does anybody have some steroids before my quick up at bat?

323
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,360
But you're here now and we're back together again and it, ooh, reunited and it feels so

324
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,080
good.

325
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,320
Say something funny about this situation, Justin.

326
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,680
Talk about Mr. Limpet.

327
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,880
Did you know in the film The Incredible Mr. Limpet, he falls in the water and is changed

328
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,800
inexplicably into a fish.

329
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,960
I love that writing, by the way.

330
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,800
It was always my favorite thing about that movie.

331
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,440
It happens.

332
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,840
Nobody questions it.

333
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,280
There's no justification.

334
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,000
It just happens.

335
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,160
Now, the crazier thing, though, is that he falls in love with a fish.

336
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,040
Like how quickly he abandons his humanity.

337
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,960
Okay, so those two explain each other, right?

338
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,120
He falls in the water and he's a fish and for a split second he's like, oh no, my life,

339
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,920
I got to leave it behind.

340
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,240
But then he's also like, but I can finally fuck a fish.

341
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,440
I'm gonna fuck that fish and no one can say shit about it.

342
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,720
And you know the groundwork he's been down with that his whole life secretly.

343
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,220
Yeah.

344
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,640
Can I just say, I remember watching that movie when I was like 10 years old and like, no

345
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,200
joke, the thing that occurred to me when he turned into a fish was, oh, he's dead.

346
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,560
Like he died.

347
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,760
This is like his heaven.

348
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,840
His heaven is like being a fish.

349
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,920
And this movie is about a man who fell in the water and drowned.

350
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,160
Yeah.

351
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,320
And this is all like, as the blood drains from his brain, this is like his fleeting

352
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:25,680
images of like perfection as he drowned because he becomes a fish and helps fight a war.

353
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,840
Worse, worse, worse than that, Travis.

354
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,280
He falls in the water as he's drowning.

355
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:39,120
He sees a fish, swaps bodies with it, traps that fish in the prison, in the husk of his

356
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,480
dying human form.

357
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,640
That fish that swaps into his body is probably like, fuck yeah, it's human time.

358
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,160
Wait, dead.

359
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,880
Oh no, body stealer.

360
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,480
Oh, he's like a jumper.

361
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,720
He's a switcher.

362
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,120
He's one of those switchers.

363
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,480
One of those fish switchers I read about in biology class.

364
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,000
So there was nothing in there, huh?

365
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,200
Yeah, it was kind of a, but you know what?

366
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:18,640
The one thing that I will say is that it's like five minutes closer to not to be, like

367
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,160
there's five more minutes of audio on the recording.

368
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,640
No, they definitely heard us say shit for five minutes.

369
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,480
That is undeniable.

370
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,160
Well, it'll probably be a tight three and a half.

371
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,920
Oop, and there's a sneeze.

372
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,840
That was a second and a half.

373
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,960
Deposit it in the time bank.

374
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,240
We have to keep sneezing.

375
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,280
It's like the burping in Willy Wonka.

376
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,320
Like, if we just keep sneezing, we'll get to the end of the podcast.

377
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,280
I'm working on it.

378
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,400
I'm trying.

379
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,640
God, I have to sneeze.

380
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,080
It's so hot up in this office, and I'm gonna have to have an awkward conversation with

381
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,600
my mailman tomorrow.

382
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,960
I have to sign for a lot of packages, so it's not like I can just hide.

383
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,000
You might have thought you heard me say Teddy Bear Fuckfest, but what I really said was

384
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,120
I said County Fair Fuckfest.

385
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,080
Shit, no way.

386
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,280
How about another question?

387
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,480
Justin, I need you to dial back in.

388
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,280
I need you to hit the internet eject button, my boy.

389
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,880
Three weeks ago, I went with a group of friends to Miami to celebrate a birthday with a surprise

390
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,200
trip.

391
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,800
Bullshit ensued.

392
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,400
So the birthday boy and his GF were left without a room for the weekend.

393
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,640
The GF asked me to front the money and said she was expecting a large sum of money in

394
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,040
a few days and would pay me within five days.

395
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,040
I charged that $350 to my credit card, expecting a prompt repayment.

396
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,840
So far, this sounds like an email for someone asking us to refund a purchase that we did

397
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,640
not contribute to in any way, shape, or form.

398
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,560
It sounds like you're about to hit us up for cash.

399
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,160
But let's press on.

400
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,040
Got $350?

401
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,000
How do I ask for that money without asking for it?

402
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,640
This is not a good question.

403
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,480
Like, there's that app now, Vimmo, where you can just send them a little e-message.

404
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,960
It's like, beep boop beep beep, $350, please.

405
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,920
Pay up.

406
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,280
Beep boop beep beep beep beep beep beep.

407
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,080
You owe me.

408
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,560
I'll cut you.

409
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,800
Can you send them a PayPal invoice?

410
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,880
That's exactly like, yes, you can do that, too.

411
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,920
You have so many options.

412
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,960
You have so many technical options.

413
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,720
Send them a singing telegram.

414
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,160
Well, no, because that's going to cost money.

415
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,480
Although you do have to spend money to make money, as Jay-Z said, vis-a-vis singing telegrams.

416
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,520
That's how you got to start.

417
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,120
Not a lot of people know that.

418
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,600
Yeah.

419
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,240
Would you be able to cut down on the initial expense by becoming a singing telegram person

420
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,200
yourself?

421
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,080
I don't think it would be effective if you got, if you, like, did the singing telegram

422
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,880
asking for money.

423
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,000
But I'm assuming there is an employee discount that you could get somebody else and find

424
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,560
out who is, like, the best one because you would be intimately familiar with the organization

425
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,600
to get a cheaper singing telegram to ask for the money.

426
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,880
So you're saying we solve this from the inside.

427
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah, you go inside.

428
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,960
You go deep.

429
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,720
But that's company, that's theft.

430
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,640
That's theft from the company.

431
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,680
It's embezzlement?

432
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,880
I think it's embezzlement.

433
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,120
If you use up the singing telegrams for your own gains, I think that's embezzlement.

434
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,760
Yeah, for sure.

435
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,000
No, no.

436
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,680
You, I mean, you would still pay, but you'd pay the employee rate and it would be cheaper

437
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,680
for you to hire a singing telegram.

438
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,440
Or maybe they would do it as, like, you would go to them and they'd be like, listen, every

439
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,640
singing telegram person gets one for free as a professional courtesy through the union

440
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,800
and the long, long history that we all share together as a career because it's the oldest

441
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,600
profession.

442
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,080
Yes.

443
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,240
And they say, this is your one favor.

444
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,600
Are you sure you want to expand it on this?

445
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,280
But then it's like, God, I don't know.

446
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,600
Maybe what do you do next time you're trapped under a boulder and you need to get a message

447
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,640
to the outside?

448
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,040
Yeah, sure.

449
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,640
And you can't rub that little medallion that they gave you when you got hired.

450
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,280
Valar Morghulis, sing for me.

451
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,840
A man will sing one time to one name that you tell him to sing to.

452
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,880
Do you want to use that to get the $350?

453
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,600
Because I get it.

454
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,000
I do.

455
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,120
Times are tight.

456
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,240
A fucking blind crow flies up to you and it's like, happy birthday, Susan.

457
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,120
All right.

458
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,440
Bye.

459
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,360
How many minutes was those?

460
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,840
Listen, I'm sorry.

461
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,960
I have to use the restroom.

462
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,520
That's fine.

463
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,400
We're going to keep on.

464
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,240
Keep this goof train rolling.

465
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,880
Keep going.

466
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,280
Is there an answer to this?

467
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,920
No, we should wait for Justin to get back from the bathroom.

468
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,160
Okay.

469
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,560
You know how uncomfortable it gets when it's just the two of us.

470
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,360
God knows.

471
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,320
It's just that we have nothing in common.

472
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
How are, how's the wife?

473
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,080
That's not true.

474
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,880
We, you remember, you remember breakfast at Denny's?

475
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,400
I think I remember the time.

476
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,000
And I said, what about breakfast at Denny's?

477
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,320
Breakfast at Denny's, you said.

478
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,640
I got diarrhea for three years.

479
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,880
I said, that sounds like that might have killed you.

480
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,120
And you said, that's right.

481
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,480
Because now I'm a ghost.

482
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,280
Yeah, all right.

483
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,400
That one could stay in.

484
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,480
For this episode, I'm going to be less like an editor and more like a bouncer.

485
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,600
Like, all right, all right.

486
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,160
You're cool.

487
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,680
Sorry, man.

488
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,120
We got too many sneezes in here.

489
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,240
You got to wait outside.

490
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,560
What's that?

491
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,480
A song parody of breakfast at Tiffany's?

492
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,880
What is it?

493
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,000
Breakfast at Denny's?

494
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,960
Diarrhea jokes?

495
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,760
Yeah, man.

496
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,520
Bring in, you can come in, bring your three friends back.

497
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,800
Hey, all right.

498
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,520
Let's get back into it.

499
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,640
Justin, we did a good bit about breakfast at, I sang breakfast at Denny's.

500
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,320
Like, it was breakfast at Tiffany's.

501
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,360
It was fucked pretty great.

502
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,320
That sounds funny.

503
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,040
Yeah, it was good.

504
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,760
You missed it.

505
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,360
You can listen to it later.

506
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,120
We have, did we finish that last one?

507
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:06,880
I don't know.

508
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,920
I was in the bathroom.

509
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,600
We did not, but I can right now.

510
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,280
You have to ask and it sucks and it's the worst.

511
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,560
No, you don't.

512
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,160
I'm saying you have Venmo now.

513
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,600
I don't have Venmo, by the way.

514
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,880
So I, like, friends send me money for like meals and stuff.

515
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,240
Like, I buy for the group and it's like, Jeff has sent you 10 bucks.

516
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,960
You want it?

517
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,560
And I say, no Venmo.

518
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,160
You're not going to get your fucking hands on me.

519
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,880
And no, Griffin, but what I'm saying is all of that obfuscation,

520
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,120
all of that avoidance behavior of like, oh, I'm going to gently ask

521
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,720
if you want it, right?

522
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,920
And you want there to be no confusion.

523
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,840
Like, you just have to say like, oh, by the way, when you get a second hit,

524
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,680
I'm going to need that $350 back.

525
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,800
I need to pay my credit card.

526
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,000
With the juice.

527
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,160
Maybe that's what you do.

528
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,920
You sneak up behind her and just sort of whisper in her ear,

529
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,280
the juice is running.

530
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,560
What did you say?

531
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,360
What did you just, what did you say?

532
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,800
I didn't say anything.

533
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,120
What happened?

534
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,800
I literally like, I literally, I understand you're like asking for something,

535
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,600
but I don't understand.

536
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,120
The juice, the juice is running.

537
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,440
You have very nice kneecaps.

538
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,320
I would hate to, the juice is running.

539
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,320
You know how people put hits out on people like,

540
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,560
that owe them money, right?

541
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,360
The juice, as we've mentioned previously, the juice is running.

542
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,800
There should be, and then like, if you know, it's a real nice place

543
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,600
you got here, it'd be real shame if something happened to you.

544
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,560
I'm melting.

545
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,320
And you like, knock a painting off the wall.

546
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,880
Like, oh, God, I hate what actually happened.

547
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,920
It'd be a real shame if, and then you get like more threatening,

548
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,320
so you get up like the Nancy Kerrigan level of like,

549
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,760
it's a real nice ice you got here, be ashamed if you fell on it.

550
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,040
And then, yeah, like that's, that's, that's terrible,

551
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,120
but there needs to be something like that for more sort of like,

552
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,920
manageable, trivial amounts of trivial things.

553
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,520
What I want is like, it's a real nice friendship.

554
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,960
It'd be a shame if like, he stopped taking you to movies.

555
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,920
I want somebody to run up to this girlfriend and throw a pie in her face

556
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,000
and just whisper like, the juice is running.

557
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,760
The juice will flow.

558
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,200
There will always be more pies.

559
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,760
Real nice pies I have at home.

560
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,560
It'd be a shame if something happened to them.

561
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,040
It'd be a shame if they got a face at them.

562
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,800
It'd be a shame to get some faces in these nice pies.

563
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:11,120
My husband is a baker, the juice flows.

564
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,680
My Brother, My Brother, Me has brought it to you in part by Squarespace,

569
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:52,560
I made a website called, it's at SheetsShow.com with a Z, Sheets with a Z, Show.com.

570
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,840
I made it with Squarespace. It's a fucking, you could probably do even better than that.

571
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,280
Maybe with Squarespace.

572
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,080
I just had a brilliant idea for Squarespace tie-in.

573
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,800
We need to create a website called thejuice.com.

574
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,480
And basically when you loan someone money, you log into thejuice.com

575
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:21,120
and it starts a reminder chain until you turn it off that you still owe that person 350.

576
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,440
And it starts just like after 72 hours, you get an update.

577
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,640
And then pretty soon, it's like every hour.

578
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,120
And every missive is read by Gary Sinise.

579
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,440
Yep.

580
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,920
Very threatening presence.

581
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,840
Yeah, but he gets more and more threatening as thejuice.

582
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,200
Threatening, but like seemingly like, you know, like logical.

583
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah, when it starts out.

584
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,720
Not like a crazy person, not like he's gonna be like,

585
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,680
I'm gonna kill you no matter what, but like very reasonable as long as the juice continues to flow.

586
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,560
Yeah, it starts out, he's your friend.

587
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,080
Listen, the juice is fine, but I know you're good for it.

588
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,760
So just bring whenever you can.

589
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,000
Maybe it's Gary Sinise and William H. Macy, a little like good cop, bad cop.

590
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,440
Oh man, which one's which though?

591
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,520
Well, they take turns.

592
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:09,920
Yeah.

593
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,960
Let's finish the commercial.

594
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,360
Squarespace, build it beautiful.

595
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,640
Beautiful.

596
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,760
Did you read the offer code?

597
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,240
Yeah.

598
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,640
You did?

599
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,240
Yeah.

600
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,280
You pretty sure?

601
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,640
I think everyone remembers that it's my brother, all one word.

602
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,480
And you get 10% off your first purchase.

603
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:30,720
Okay.

604
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,040
Yeah.

605
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,760
All right, that's fine.

606
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,080
I also want to mention that my brother and my brother Mia supported in part by Casper,

607
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,200
an online retailer of premium obsessively engineered mattresses,

608
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
which you can get for a fraction of the price.

609
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,680
It doesn't say a fraction of the price of what, but I'm going to guess other mattresses.

610
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,640
But there's probably a lot of things that is a fraction of the price of.

611
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,440
A full home.

612
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,800
A Bugatti.

613
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,680
A Bugatti.

614
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,760
I don't know what that is.

615
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,800
I love it though.

616
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,280
I love it too.

617
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,360
It's like a mole man gangster.

618
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,080
It's like he swallows certain consonants, but they change.

619
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,000
Anyway, Casper has a risk-free trial and return policy.

620
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,800
You can try sleeping on a Casper for a hundred days.

621
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,720
That's six and a half months with free delivery and painless returns.

622
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,760
These are mattresses that are made in America so that you know that they're full of liberty.

623
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,080
And my brother, my brother and me listeners can get $50 towards any mattress purchase.

624
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,160
You just go to Casper.com slash my brother and use the promo code my brother.

625
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,000
That's all one word at the checkout.

626
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,200
Terms and conditions do apply on that particular transaction.

627
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,880
I sleep on a Casper mattress.

628
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,240
I love it very, very much.

629
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,400
It replaced my old mattress and I've never looked back.

630
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,840
They're fine products.

631
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,920
You are, you're going to be pleased with these.

632
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,560
I guarantee.

633
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,400
We have another message.

634
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,320
Let me tell you about Wild Speculation.

635
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,080
Wild Speculation is a comedy podcast hosted by Henry and Brandon, two childhood friends

636
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,280
turned 20-something Portlanders who explore a vast world of hypotheticals ranging from

637
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,480
which superhero would make the best lover to what will the next big health fad be to

638
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,920
which American president would win in a 44-man cage match.

639
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,880
It's a lively romp through time, space, sarcasm, and what would happen if Liam Neeson had to

640
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,640
fight a wolf in all of his movies.

641
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,400
I'm pretty sure that already happens.

642
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:22,400
But anyways, go to wildspeculationpodcast.com and check out the sam- you can check out the

643
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:29,840
sampler bit.ly forward slash wildspeculation or find Wild Speculation on iTunes or Stitcher

644
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,640
and subscribe.

645
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,080
There's lots of ways to listen to it.

646
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,960
You should go check it out.

647
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,520
All right, listen.

648
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,160
I gotta- wait, listen, listen, wait, listen.

649
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,400
You probably- yours is probably more pressing.

650
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,920
It's very pressing.

651
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,520
There are a lot of subplots in the movie Love Actually.

652
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,680
I don't think anybody would notice if we added one more.

653
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,200
Maybe after Liam Neeson sees off his son who's falling in love with the girl who sings the

654
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,720
song at the end of the movie, spoiler alert for Love Actually, he had to fight a fucking

655
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,520
wolf.

656
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,040
I- I've never seen it.

657
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,240
But Griffin, is it about all the storylines signed together?

658
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,880
Yeah?

659
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,080
Yes, and the wolf-

660
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,200
Wait, wait a minute.

661
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,840
Stop the podcast.

662
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,600
You've never seen Love Actually?

663
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,320
That is correct.

664
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,080
I'm- I'm waiting for the right moment.

665
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,800
That's it.

666
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,200
You're waiting for the-

667
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,320
I want it to be perfect.

668
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,800
You're waiting for the Lupine director's cut.

669
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,720
Yep.

670
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,080
I just want a wolf fight to be going on in the background of one scene.

671
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,600
I'm proud of you.

672
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,880
I'm proud of you, son.

673
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,120
Ah, fuck.

674
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,600
Not again.

675
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:35,120
I have to go fight a wolf now, and then you just see the wolf fight in the back of a different

676
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,240
scene, and it's just like, oh, it all ties together.

677
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,840
That was the wolf from before.

678
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,600
But then, he doesn't kill the wolf, he just beats the shit out of it, and the wolf limps

679
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,520
off, and Mr. Bean from that movie finds him, because Mr. Bean doesn't get, like, a romantic

680
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,480
resolution in that film.

681
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,560
He falls in love with the wolf, they have fucking crazy looking wolf children.

682
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,800
We just read an ad for a podcast that at the end of the ad described what I assume

683
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,200
is, perhaps, a signature bit for this program, and then we were like, oh, sounds funny.

684
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,880
We'll take that.

685
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,040
Let's see if we can steal from these people, too.

686
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,680
That's fair.

687
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,520
We got a special message from Michelle D. from Kevin H.

688
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,000
Dear Shell Bell, I want to wish you happy birthday, and you're first as my wife.

689
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,800
I love you and the time we spend together with all my heart.

690
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,880
Make fun of that, assholes.

691
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,920
Yeah, I don't think we can.

692
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,440
What if they had to fight a wolf?

693
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,040
Kevin, Michelle, your union and love is a constant sense of

694
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,520
disappointment, joy, and optimism.

695
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,720
I think there should be another storyline in Love Actually.

696
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:40,880
Yeah.

697
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,800
That's you guys.

698
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,240
Just, like, you know what?

699
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,120
We should just keep, like, George Lucas-ing people into Love Actually.

700
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,800
Right, no, no, it's not George Lucas-ing.

701
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,200
It's, like, there's so many fucking subplots in that movie.

702
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,400
Let's keep adding stuff in, and I think we can add one in that's, like, those books that

703
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,520
your parents would buy you as a kid.

704
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,200
It's, like, this is a story about Gregory the space boy.

705
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,320
You know what I mean?

706
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:00,640
I do.

707
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,520
You know what would be fucking, like, the most lucrative business ever is if you told

708
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,440
people that you would make them, like, for an anniversary or wedding gift or what have

709
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:19,120
you, a custom version of Love Actually with their storyline intercut in between the different

710
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,240
storylines.

711
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,400
What would you pay for Love Actually?

712
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,440
To have Armie Hammer play you in a movie today.

713
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:25,920
Fuck.

714
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,800
Well, I don't think you're going to stage the scenes with Hollywood A-listers.

715
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,040
I don't think-

716
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
Well, then how else would you do it, Justin?

717
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,520
You would have, like, everybody's got iPhones.

718
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,840
You've probably got a whole dramatic arc on your iPhone that we could cobble together.

719
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,200
That's fair.

720
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,800
What if you, but then you do that, and then you get too deep in the art, and you're like,

721
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,080
listen, listen, these scenes aren't working.

722
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,920
I'm sorry, Kevin and Michelle.

723
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm cutting you back out of the movie.

724
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,400
I'm putting you back on the cutting room floor.

725
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,760
I'm too deep into my new director's cut of Love Actually.

726
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,200
I can't believe you haven't seen Love Actually.

727
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,440
This holiday season, Travis, get ready to set sail to the island of joy and love as

728
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,760
we watch Love Actually together as a family.

729
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,000
Okay.

730
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,360
We're Dave and Graham, and we host Stop Podcasting Yourself.

731
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:21,120
We started this podcast back in 2008 before podcasts had to have any kind of concept,

732
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,040
so we don't really know how to describe it.

733
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,480
It's kind of like going to the barbershop if your barber knew all about the first season

734
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,760
of the show Elf.

735
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,160
It's like a 90-minute massage where the masseuse is two people talking to each other with a

736
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,040
third person.

737
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,400
It's like the Monsters of Metal tour, only quieter, no music, and just talking.

738
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,880
It's like a makeout session, but without the lips touching, they just talk a lot.

739
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:52,800
Download Stop Podcasting Yourself from iTunes or MaximumFun.org.

740
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,680
The elevator Yahoo.

741
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,440
Okay.

742
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,400
We've only done two actual questions.

743
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,520
This Yahoo is how this usually goes.

744
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,080
This Yahoo is sent by Drew Davenport, and I'm gonna be honest with you guys.

745
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,560
This one's mostly for me, and it's more of just sort of a jumping off point for a discussion

746
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,920
I've been meaning to have with the two of you.

747
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:18,240
This Yahoo was asked by an anonymous user who asks, will there be any gyms when Pokemon

748
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,280
Go comes out?

749
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,760
What is Pokemon Go?

750
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,120
Is there any talk of official gyms being opened?

751
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,480
How weird would it be if my hubby and I started a gym?

752
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,960
We have an idea of handing out little badges if someone can beat us and our actual gym

753
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,280
junkie friends, scary looking personal trainers who are secret mega nerds.

754
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,720
Good idea, bad idea, is there going to be an official gym?

755
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,240
Pokemon Go, Travis, is an upcoming mobile game that is location-based where you collect

756
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,960
Pokemon, but on your phone.

757
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,560
Oh, that sounds interesting.

758
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:58,880
My question is this, can I turn my house into a Pokemon gym and then children would come

759
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,400
to me to try and best me?

760
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,440
Of course, they don't stand a fucking chance, but it's good to have aspirations.

761
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,720
It's good to have aspirations.

762
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:14,400
The key here, Griffin, you need to have 15 friends all standing facing different directions

763
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,720
within your home that when they walk through, they get engaged in a fight with your 15 friends.

764
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:26,000
I'll need to make paths out of garbage cans or something to force them to-

765
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,400
Or maybe some trees growing up through the floor that they might have to cut through.

766
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,280
Yeah, we're basically talking about a kid maze in my house.

767
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:40,800
Yes, you have to build a kid labyrinth, a kid dungeon in your home that they have to

768
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:47,200
fight a bunch of adults to fight a big adult to get a bath.

769
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:53,360
Griffin's just sitting at the end juggling two glass balls and super tight pants just

770
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,320
waiting for his kid delivery once he bests his minions.

771
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,000
They would be pokeballs, and also it's not a kid delivery, there's no fucking guarantee

772
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,240
that a kid that comes into the beginning of my crucible makes it to the end of it undefeated.

773
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,080
In fact, I'm going to stack this gym with fucking pros.

774
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,320
It's going to be brutal.

775
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,320
It's going to be a torture chamber.

776
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,200
What's the theme?

777
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,960
Are you like- Is it a bug theme?

778
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,440
Is it-

779
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,000
Yeah, Travis.

780
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,480
Yeah, Travis.

781
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,720
I'm going to open up a bug type Pokemon gym, you idiot.

782
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,040
Yeah, that's what I want because I want to give out- I want to shit out badges for every

783
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,960
ham and egg-er that comes to my front door.

784
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,040
Yeah, that's right, Travis.

785
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,920
Go, Caterpie.

786
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,920
That's me, you fucking imbecile.

787
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,400
Yeah, go.

788
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,560
Do your best, Kakuna.

789
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,840
What are you fucking talking- Yeah, bug type gym.

790
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,680
All right, I'm going to go.

791
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,280
I've embarrassed myself.

792
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,000
Maybe fire.

793
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,440
Fire type?

794
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,560
Could you do fire type?

795
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,040
Maybe a fire-

796
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,040
Yeah, that's a good idea, Justin.

797
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,080
I'll probably just do a fire type one so that one kid with one Blastoise can fuck up my

798
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,720
whole shop.

799
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,080
Killed all of us with one Blastoise, huh?

800
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,560
Wow, shit.

801
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,520
I should have-

802
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,480
Just do rock then.

803
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,000
Just do rock type.

804
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,400
The same Blastoise would fuck my rocks.

805
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,240
What sense does that make, by the way?

806
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,040
Why is rock weak against water?

807
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,880
Are they talking about erosion?

808
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,200
Erosion, yes.

809
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,840
Because that happens over thousands of years.

810
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,080
Yeah.

811
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,480
It's a long grift, no doubt.

812
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,320
What about a grasp type gym, Griffin?

813
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,760
You guys are fucking killing me.

814
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,200
Poison type.

815
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:31,760
Stabbing type.

816
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,040
Now, poison type is not a bad idea.

817
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,680
You know there really is a poison type.

818
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,160
Yes, I do.

819
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,520
That one's kind of tough.

820
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,600
Nobody can really keep straight what does good yet.

821
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,440
I think ground, but that one I think I might trip up a few kids.

822
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,680
That one I think I might catch a few kids in my web.

823
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,280
Just poison some kids.

824
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:55,920
I love that we open the show talking about how fucking stupid and awful our schedules

825
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,720
are now and now we also have to account for many nights of the week.

826
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,600
Griffin will be sitting in like a secluded room in his home

827
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,080
waiting for children to beat him at Pokemon.

828
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,880
Well, no, there's also going to be, I mean, I got to get the fucking things.

829
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,240
There's going to be a lot of-

830
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,200
Well, there's other people there.

831
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,280
There's going to be a lot of me going around gathering.

832
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,840
Yeah, I'll have some sort of secondary Pokemon.

833
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,880
No one ever talks about that in the Pokemon world until a child shows up to challenge

834
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,720
this building full of adults.

835
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,720
Are all the adults just standing around going, man, I hope somebody shows up.

836
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,280
Boy, it'd be great if you get some fucking kids up in here.

837
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,400
I am fucking-

838
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,120
I am bored.

839
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,680
There is literally nothing else in this gym.

840
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,000
That's how they stick their heads out the door like, hey, are there any local kids?

841
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,920
Any local kids in the neighborhood want to come over and play Pokemon?

842
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,280
That's definitely, definitely going to be me though.

843
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,200
Where's Griffin?

844
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,640
We haven't heard from him in a while.

845
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,560
Last I heard, he was in the Mojave Desert and he was just walking around catching sand

846
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:56,960
shrews.

847
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,880
That's going to be me.

848
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,880
When that shit drops, I will be a distant memory to the two of you.

849
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,480
This podcast will be golden oldies because it will be canceled because they don't get

850
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,440
Wi-Fi in the Mojave.

851
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,200
I quit coffee a couple of weeks ago and I basically gone through all the withdrawal

852
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,920
symptoms and no longer have headaches.

853
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,400
However, whenever I smell coffee, I still really want it and last night I had a dream

854
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,440
about drinking coffee.

855
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,520
Have any of you ever quit coffee?

856
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,360
And if so, are there any tricks you use to convince your brain to stop wanting coffee?

857
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,200
And that's from Laura and the answer is never in a million bajillion years.

858
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,200
I have recently cut back from five cups in the morning to two.

859
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,120
Gotta have my cup of mud.

860
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,080
Gotta have my joe.

861
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,200
I gotta have my joe.

862
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,280
I basically have a symbiotic relationship with caffeine at this point.

863
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,720
I don't think of it as a drug.

864
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,480
I think of it as a partnership.

865
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,840
Let me tell you how I feel.

866
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,640
This is my feelings towards both coffee and beer.

867
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,520
They are the closest things to magical potions that exist in real life.

868
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:09,520
They are the closest thing to like a Zelda, Legend of Zelda style, drink this red thing,

869
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,560
drink this blue thing and feel instantly different that exists in the world.

870
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,000
A five hour energy drink.

871
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,200
It's the fact that you have like one thing that you can definitely control.

872
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,200
You have one thing that you can definitely do and that's make yourself feel a little

873
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,320
less sleepy.

874
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:34,240
Only now in my life, I started morning caffeine when I was like sophomore in high school,

875
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,880
drinking a Diet Mountain Dew every morning to just get the engine revving.

876
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,400
I had a lot of what you would describe as high octane fuel.

877
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:52,720
Yeah, I had a lot of what you could charitably describe as bowel issues, but I've been doing

878
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:52,960
that.

879
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,720
I wouldn't know how to...

880
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,400
I'm never gonna do that and it's kind of nice to make your peace with that because

881
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,640
then you can stop sweating it, right?

882
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,680
Like I'm never gonna stop ever.

883
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,400
I'll never quit.

884
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,120
It's not a test.

885
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:09,600
Like there's not somebody when you're 40 who's gonna go, still drinking coffee, huh?

886
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:11,920
Don't talk to me.

887
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,680
Don't talk to me until I've had my coffee.

888
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,240
Guys, I don't exercise.

889
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,440
It makes my coffee spill.

890
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,640
Now say something about wine.

891
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,240
Hey guys, I don't have a problem with coffee.

892
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,840
I have a problem without coffee.

893
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,160
Okay, so now that we've locked this person in their life decisions.

894
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,680
No, it's a bad decision.

895
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,240
Just get...

896
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,400
Okay, but listen, you're in a rare...

897
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,360
Let me just tell you, this is probably not what you came to hear.

898
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:49,120
So you can stop listening now if you're worried about your resolve wavering.

899
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,000
We're gonna make some goofs and you can stop listening to them.

900
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,480
It's okay.

901
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,000
And there's no harm done.

902
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:00,800
You are in like a righteous position that I wish I was in where you could drink coffee

903
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,000
now and feel it.

904
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,400
I only feel not coffee.

905
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,080
Like I can't feel coffee.

906
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,760
The only feeling I have is not coffee and Justin.

907
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,360
Those are the two different settings I have, okay?

908
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,520
I don't have a feeling of like, wow, I'm drinking coffee.

909
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,040
Like I can't feel anymore.

910
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:27,360
You are in a position to get like a mild, a PSL.

911
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:33,680
Just to really dial into the message we're putting out here right now is we are making

912
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,160
this person who has shown that they possess a level of willpower that the three of us

913
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,360
couldn't even imagine.

914
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,560
Combined.

915
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,200
Combined.

916
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,160
We are trying to sell them on just how fucking good a relapse is gonna feel.

917
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,440
Oh my god, it's gonna feel so...

918
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:58,000
Do you guys know how like, how many things in my life, like how many choices I would

919
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,720
need to undo before coffee was the bad guy?

920
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,520
Like if I got to a point where coffee was like, well, all I've got left is this coffee,

921
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:12,160
I would have ascended to like a Buddha-like state of transcendence at that point.

922
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:18,880
Like I have infinite like just life cruft that I would need to dust off of myself before

923
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:24,800
I even saw coffee in the emotional wreckage that is my current day to day.

924
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,760
Like I can't even find coffee right now.

925
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,960
I don't even know where, I'm not even aware that I'm drinking it because I'm doing so

926
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,960
many other terrible things.

927
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,000
Number one, doing eight podcasts every day.

928
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,320
Yeah.

929
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,920
Like that's taking a pretty hefty toll on my spirit.

930
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,160
Um, I'll see, I mean, we could all eat healthier.

931
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,160
I was eating, I was eating turkey bacon at breakfast with dad and Justin during LA Podfest

932
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,120
and they looked at me like I was fucking on fire.

933
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,160
What are you, what?

934
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,400
That's some really good bacon there though.

935
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,560
It had a rich smoky flavor.

936
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,080
I enjoy a turkey bacon.

937
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:06,880
There, I said it.

938
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,600
I enjoy it too.

939
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,400
Not like this.

940
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,360
This looked terrible.

941
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,280
This was like, this looked like meat by the foot.

942
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,040
It was meat by the foot.

943
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:13,280
Yeah.

944
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,640
That's six feet of meat for you.

945
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,040
Not this.

946
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,040
These were pork roll ups is what these were.

947
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:19,280
Yeah.

948
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,280
And they were, they weren't even pork though.

949
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,160
They were a nightmare.

950
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,000
Gristle tape.

951
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,200
They were gristle tape.

952
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,080
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

953
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,360
Uh, sure.

954
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,160
Yeah.

955
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,680
Which ones?

956
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,560
Good for you, by the way.

957
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,920
I meant, we should have mentioned that earlier.

958
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,520
Yeah, I'm sorry to be such dicks about it.

959
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:39,120
Like honestly, I drink an unhealthy amount of coffee and it's going to make my fucking bones disintegrate.

960
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,160
It's going to nothing.

961
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,360
It's going to rule.

962
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,360
It's going to give you a great bowel movement in about 15 minutes.

963
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:45,680
Yeah.

964
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:46,560
Yeah.

965
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,520
Here's a Yahoo sent in by Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

966
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,240
Zoe Kinski, thank you.

967
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:50,880
It's by Yahoo.

968
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:59,360
Answers user Mayda B who asks, do all people who get LASIK eye surgery see ghosts?

969
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:05,120
My, my brother's getting one and I am afraid he might see ghosts.

970
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,120
Update LASIK with a K.

971
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,400
Sorry, they misspelled LASIK in the title, but then they fucking got it.

972
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:11,840
Update two.

973
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,560
They laughed at something somebody said.

974
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,040
So.

975
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,160
Update two.

976
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:16,720
Yes.

977
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,600
Yes is the answer.

978
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:24,720
Do, do, do now, now, now do all people who get LASIK eye surgery see ghosts?

979
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,680
What percentage?

980
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,280
What is the, what's the spread?

981
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,840
What's the vaguest odds on whether or not this LASIK will give us ghost vision?

982
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,680
It sounds to me like this person heard of the movie The Eye.

983
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,280
But did not trouble themselves to go see it in theaters or on DVD or Blu-ray.

984
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:49,200
And so I feel like the question should be worded, does getting LASIK-

985
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:49,840
Yeah, do any.

986
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,160
Has there ever been a single time in recorded history that the movie The Eye happened in

987
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,560
real life, except that that's not what happened in The Eye.

988
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,040
And The Eye wasn't like-

989
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,560
But not the fear of like, can I do just this once?

990
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,520
Can I get LASIK and not see a fucking ghost for once?

991
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,640
For once, please.

992
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,880
I'm so tired.

993
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,960
What if you only see it in one eye?

994
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,480
What if you get LASIK and just odds like one eye sees ghosts and one eye does not?

995
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,800
So that would be sweet because you would be able to walk around with an eye patch and

996
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,920
people would be like, what's up with that?

997
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,800
And you're like, ugh, don't get me started.

998
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,240
But you would have horrible depth perception and keep walking into ghosts.

999
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,600
I'd have horrible depth perception, but you'd have great depth perception.

1000
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,320
That's a good one.

1001
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,160
Write that one down.

1002
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,200
Okay, I'm tired, I'm gonna lie down.

1003
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,800
Send it into humor in uniform.

1004
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,600
Humor in uniform?

1005
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,040
I don't think it would fit in.

1006
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,120
No, because it wasn't-

1007
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,400
No, but it was the only magazine I could think of that might take the-

1008
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,280
Playboy?

1009
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,640
I don't know, not a big joke.

1010
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,800
While humor in uniform is in a magazine, it would be a segment in Reader's Digest.

1011
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,840
I think what you're looking for is Justin's Say the Darnedest Thing.

1012
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,200
Yeah, it's a section of Reader's Digest that's in that tier.

1013
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,480
I have a bit of a lazy eye in my partially blind eye.

1014
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,880
Is that because there's a fucking ghost in there?

1015
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,000
Just starting to knock on them.

1016
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,080
Maybe you just saw too many ghosts and it burned it out.

1017
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:08,800
That's possible.

1018
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,200
Do you remember any ghosts, Griffin?

1019
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,000
Close your eyes.

1020
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,880
Sorry, it got real.

1021
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,360
Did you see a ghost inside your eyelid?

1022
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:15,600
Yeah.

1023
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,880
It just, shh!

1024
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,680
Yeah, he's in there.

1025
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,120
What if, in order to-

1026
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:27,200
Like, when you close your eyes, you saw ghosts, and there was just one ghost that lived in

1027
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,640
your eyes when you closed your eyes.

1028
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,240
Can you imagine trying to go to sleep?

1029
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,520
What?

1030
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,560
Jesus, Justin.

1031
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,920
Justin, you just wrote a Yahoo Answers question.

1032
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,240
You just wrote a fucking heroin trip.

1033
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,680
What if there were ghosts in your eyes?

1034
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,840
What if you read these two-sentence ghost stories and you won't sleep tonight?

1035
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:50,480
Is the laser that they use in LASIK eye surgery just concentrated ghosts?

1036
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,000
Is that all?

1037
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,120
It's powered by ghosts.

1038
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:53,920
Open it up.

1039
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,960
It's a ghost prison in there.

1040
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,240
Is that all that lasers are?

1041
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,640
Because that would make the Star Wars movies pretty fucking spooky, if you ask me.

1042
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:07,200
Is the laser from LASIK just a proton pack that they shrunk down, and it was originally

1043
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,040
used to capture ghosts, but instead, like, summons them?

1044
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,760
Wouldn't that be a horrible revelation from Ghostbusters that the technology they use

1045
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,040
to trap ghosts is powered by, like, ground-up ghosts?

1046
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:19,520
Oh, fuck.

1047
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,400
That's sick.

1048
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,360
That's fucking sick.

1049
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,200
That's fucking disgusting.

1050
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,320
You should be ashamed of yourself, Egon.

1051
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,720
That's my memaw that you're blasting out there.

1052
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,040
You ground up my memaw to turn her into a laser beam.

1053
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,680
You use my memaw to catch my people, you dick.

1054
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,880
Hold up.

1055
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,520
Wait a minute.

1056
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,040
When I die, if I could get the option to be ground up and turn into a laser beam, that

1057
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,440
is absolutely what I would want to be.

1058
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,080
Are you kidding me?

1059
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,760
That would be sweet, yeah.

1060
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,480
Maybe they didn't figure out a way to power their weapons with ground-up ghosts.

1061
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,440
Maybe they found a way to power themselves with ground-up ghosts.

1062
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:05,040
By which I mean, they accidentally ate a ghost once and just, like, got the fever.

1063
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,240
And even before the Ghostbusters and stuff-

1064
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,680
A Pac-Man fever?

1065
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,360
Because he eats ghosts.

1066
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,520
Pac-Man fever, yes.

1067
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,080
Count it.

1068
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,920
Griffin say the darndest things.

1069
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,680
Page 34 of the New Reader's Digest.

1070
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,240
Check it out.

1071
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,800
What if they eat ghosts?

1072
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,480
Like, what if that's what, like, when you-

1073
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,080
If you were to sneak up on the Ghostbusters during off-hours, you would see them sitting

1074
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,000
down to a big plate of ghosts.

1075
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,240
That's horrible.

1076
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,080
I hate that.

1077
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:32,720
I hate it too.

1078
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,040
But the good news is, we've done an hour.

1079
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,040
Yes!

1080
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:39,920
We made it!

1081
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,360
Folks, listen.

1082
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,400
Fuck me.

1083
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,920
I hope this episode is okay.

1084
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,520
Folks, it's, like, not a joke.

1085
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,640
We have completely overbooked ourselves for the month of September.

1086
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,320
Not just with podcast stuff, but with, like, a bunch of live stuff too.

1087
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,280
But thank you for sticking with us.

1088
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,120
You've all been really cool.

1089
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,240
I know it sucks when we put up episodes late and they're delayed and stuff.

1090
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,400
Like, we don't enjoy doing it either.

1091
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,280
But you guys have been pretty chill about it and really understanding.

1092
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,320
I promise we'll get back to it.

1093
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,520
We'll get back to it.

1094
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,720
Things are gonna calm down.

1095
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,440
Have we even talked about the Switcheroo episode that's coming up in October, what, 5th?

1096
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:16,880
That Monday?

1097
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,560
Yeah, that week.

1098
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,200
For that week, as a Max Fun special event, all of the shows on the Max Fun Network are

1099
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:23,920
switching shows.

1100
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,920
So, uh, the Adventure Zone is swapping with the Flophouse.

1101
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,320
We're doing each other's shows that week.

1102
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,200
That'll be real fun.

1103
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,840
And my brother and my brother and me is switching with Jordan Jesse Goh.

1104
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,920
And are you ready for this?

1105
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:44,720
The three hosts of my brother and my brother and me that week, Dave Holmes, Cameron Esposito,

1106
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,520
and Jesse Thorne.

1107
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,200
So we're fucked, basically.

1108
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,680
Because we're gonna come back and people will be like, where did the...

1109
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,120
Where the fuck?

1110
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,240
Where did the confident, beautiful, hilarious people go?

1111
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:54,800
What happened?

1112
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,200
Now I'm back with these three goblins.

1113
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,240
But anyway, that's gonna be real fun.

1114
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,480
You can hear us that week over on Jordan Jesse Goh.

1115
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,520
And then here...

1116
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,240
What are you guys?

1117
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,640
Sawbones is swapping with Ono, Ross, and Kerry.

1118
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,080
Bunker Buddies, who are y'all?

1119
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,000
Bunker Buddies is doing Baby Geniuses.

1120
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,360
That'll be fun.

1121
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:19,440
And then... Oh, and Baby Geniuses is doing Lady 2 Lady.

1122
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,960
Oh, so a little triangle swap there.

1123
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:21,840
Yeah.

1124
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:22,720
That'll be fun.

1125
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,000
Anyway, it's gonna be a fun week.

1126
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,240
That's October 5th is the...

1127
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:26,960
When I think the...

1128
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,160
When the Mabim Bam's going up.

1129
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,160
So yeah.

1130
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,200
It's gonna be a crazy game of poker.

1131
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,440
It's gonna be a crazy game of poker, but then things are gonna calm down.

1132
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,920
We've never done as many live shows as we've done this year.

1133
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,720
We've done a pretty ridiculous amount of live shows this year for us.

1134
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,000
Not for, you know, like normal...

1135
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
When we plan on doing those live shows, we said, you know, at the beginning of this year, like,

1136
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,600
guys, we have to get out there and do more shows and get on the road.

1137
00:55:53,600 --> 00:56:01,760
What we didn't really consider is, like, we use those same human bodies to do the podcast every

1138
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,480
week, right?

1139
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,520
So we can't...

1140
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,160
We're not like...

1141
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,440
We didn't do clones.

1142
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,120
We can't, like, you know, partition that off.

1143
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,440
Like, we have to use these same bodies to do all of it.

1144
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:11,840
Yeah.

1145
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,640
That's right, Justin.

1146
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,080
So someone could invent surrogates.

1147
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,440
That would be so dope.

1148
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,720
Anyway, thank you.

1149
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,960
I'm not completely non-complaining about how successful we are.

1150
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,400
I'm not complaining about how successful we are.

1151
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,600
I'm saying, like, I know it's been, like, weird.

1152
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:23,920
Not weird, but...

1153
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,840
I'm just taking ownership of the fact that we've, like...

1154
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,440
That it's hard.

1155
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,720
There's, like, a lot of...

1156
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,840
Like, we're trying to keep a lot of plates spinning, and there's just three of us,

1157
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:38,800
and we're doing our fucking best, and we're so appreciative to you for continuing to listen

1158
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,640
and hang in there with us and be so, like, cool and enthusiastic about everything,

1159
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,440
because it's, like...

1160
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,560
It's all fun stuff.

1161
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,440
I just never want, like, you know, the...

1162
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,480
You, the Bim Bambinos, the originals, the listeners, like...

1163
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,320
You guys are always going to be our number one fan.

1164
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:00,160
I would like to give you guys a reward for sticking with us and for being so cool,

1165
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:00,880
and it is this.

1166
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,280
Our buddy, Emmanuel Miranda, they're streaming Hamilton the Musical.

1167
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,360
You can listen to the entire cast recording right now.

1168
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:12,640
I'm gonna...

1169
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,040
If you just...

1170
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:13,440
I'm actually...

1171
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,480
Like, just basically...

1172
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,280
Just Google it.

1173
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:15,440
Yeah.

1174
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,400
Just Google, like, Hamilton live stream, and you can, like, listen.

1175
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:18,800
It's good.

1176
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,000
You know I've been bumping that shit all day, but what I will say is,

1177
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,480
if you haven't seen the show, I'll actually tell you not to do it.

1178
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,720
Not till you can go see it and enjoy it in person,

1179
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,800
and then you have earned the right to enjoy it with your ear holes,

1180
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,680
because you missed a lot.

1181
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,040
There's a lot of good choreography.

1182
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,680
Also, you should stream it and buy it.

1183
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,560
You should buy it on iTunes.

1184
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,600
Buy it, but don't listen to it.

1185
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,960
Buy it, but save it for yourself.

1186
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,840
But if you do listen to it, there's a secret My Brother, My Brother and Me goof in there.

1187
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,120
Yeah, that's pretty wonderful.

1188
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,560
Arguably one and a half.

1189
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,640
Yes, the judges are still out.

1190
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,080
The judges are still out.

1191
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,400
There's definitely one that you will definitely get.

1192
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:57,120
We also want to thank everybody who came out to watch L.A. Podfest and everybody who joined.

1193
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:57,920
Y'all, it was a fun...

1194
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,600
It was exhausting, but it was a fun fucking weekend.

1195
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,800
We just basically...

1196
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:05,840
It was us doing shows and fucking kicking it with Tim and Guy from Worst Idea of All Time,

1197
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,120
who are the coolest dudes.

1198
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,240
It was great.

1199
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,360
And we know that there were some issues with the live stream, and we're sorry.

1200
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,560
We had no control.

1201
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,760
We had literally no...

1202
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,920
It was just frustrating for us being up on stage,

1203
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,600
seeing people on Twitter talk about how they couldn't get access to this thing.

1204
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,840
They had bought a ticket for it and played an event around it.

1205
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,600
I know it sucks, and we're...

1206
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,760
It will still be up on the archives, though, even though it didn't work on the weekend.

1207
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,480
So you still do get a chance to see it, even though it's not live.

1208
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,640
I think for the audio for that one and for Adventure Zone,

1209
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:41,920
we're just going to put up as a donor bonus instead of just putting it up in the regular feed.

1210
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,800
So if you're a MaxFun donor, that'll just pop up eventually once we get the audio from it.

1211
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,440
It's weird.

1212
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,520
There are certain restrictions what we can do with it because it wasn't our thing.

1213
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,800
It was part of the festival.

1214
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,920
So I think that might be what we have to do with it.

1215
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,120
Yes, but we'll figure out something, but just bear with us.

1216
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,520
Check out all the other amazing MaxFun shows.

1217
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,640
As we said, coming up in two weeks is going to be the Switcheroo episode.

1218
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,040
So you may want to start kind of preparing yourself.

1219
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,680
Check out all the other shows that you haven't checked out yet.

1220
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,880
Why haven't you checked them out yet?

1221
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,680
They're all very good.

1222
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,920
And thanks to John Roderick in the Long Winter's Feast for a theme song

1223
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,080
instead of Parchoff, the album putting the days to bed.

1224
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:20,880
It's a great album.

1225
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,280
Oh, I have one more thing.

1226
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,480
We did a My Brother, My Brother, Me Fantasy Football League.

1227
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,560
It's me and like 11 other really awesome people.

1228
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:32,960
And I started a podcast to update if that's something you might be interested in.

1229
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,680
If you want to hear Travis talk about his fantasy football teams

1230
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,040
in a league you're not a part of.

1231
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,920
If that's a thing that you might be interested in,

1232
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,080
it's the My Brother, My Brother, Me Fantasy Football League.

1233
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,600
It's on iTunes now.

1234
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,480
I don't know.

1235
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,280
We do like Tuesday and Wednesday episodes.

1236
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:47,840
I don't know.

1237
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,600
Maybe check that out if you want to.

1238
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,080
It's not.

1239
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,280
You say we, it's you.

1240
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,480
It's just, it's just me.

1241
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:52,960
Yeah, it's me.

1242
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,080
It's me.

1243
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,160
So like, I don't know if you want to.

1244
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,760
The show should just be called My Brother.

1245
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,080
Well, I tried to get you on it, Griffin, but you have informed me

1246
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:02,720
you do not care about fantasy football.

1247
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,080
Yeah, don't give a fuck, dog.

1248
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,960
Don't give a fuck because I beat your ass.

1249
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,440
All right.

1250
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,120
Well, this episode is gonna come to an end now.

1251
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,280
Thanks to Matt Gifford who sent in this Yahoo.

1252
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:13,760
Thank you, Matt.

1253
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,040
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

1254
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,320
Sorry, something has gone wrong.

1255
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,840
I'm gonna call him Broccoli Bill.

1256
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,320
Broccoli Bill asks,

1257
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,280
when did the phrase get jiggy with it become extinct?

1258
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,040
My name's Justin McElroy.

1259
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,840
I'm Travis McElroy.

1260
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,120
I'm Broccoli Bill.

1261
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,440
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1262
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,480
Kiss your dads.

1263
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,280
Wear on the lips.

1264
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,640
Maximumfun.org.

1265
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,680
Comedy and culture.

1266
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,800
Artist owned.

1267
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,760
Listener supported.

1268
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,440
Welcome to Oh No, Ross and Carrie.

1269
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:01,920
Ross.

1270
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,400
Hi, Carrie.

1271
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,080
What do you think is creepier?

1272
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:04,560
Okay.

1273
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,360
You jump into a swimming pool.

1274
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:10,640
All of a sudden, the water goes away and instead of water,

1275
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:15,680
there is the bones of your dead ancestors or our show.

1276
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,120
That's pretty tough because we visited a live exorcism.

1277
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:23,040
We joined the Ordo Templi Orientis where we had to worship a naked lady.

1278
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,880
Oh, and we joined that Tony Olomo cult.

1279
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:25,840
They were scary.

1280
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:26,560
Super creepy.

1281
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,320
We joined the Ethere Society.

1282
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,920
We joined the Ethere Society.

1283
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,160
We tried penis enlargement, or at least I did.

1284
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:32,560
Oh, boy.

1285
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,760
I tried breast enlargement.

1286
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,400
We have basically done every creepy,

1287
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,600
weird, fringe thing except for thousands more,

1288
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,440
which we will get to if you listen to our show.

1289
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,160
I'd still say the swimming pool with my ancestors' bones.

1290
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,920
Well, then I don't even know if people should listen.

1291
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:46,720
I guess they shouldn't.

1292
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,280
But if you want to, we're at Maximum Fun,

1293
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:58,880
and the show's called Anna, Ross, and Carrie.
