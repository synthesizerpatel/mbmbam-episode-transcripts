1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,200
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,440
modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,600
I'm your babiest baby brother Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,400
It's Summertime!

9
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,360
Billy Stewart of course with that version of Summertime. It was me

10
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,880
in my Billy Stewart impersonation, but Island Boy rises right now. I'm on that island time.

11
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,040
The Island Boy returns.

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,600
Some people just want to watch the world sunburn.

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Yeah, he's not the boy we want, and that's the end of the sentence.

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,200
Island Boy has returned to you. I'm continuing my tour of the

15
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,520
islands of the southeastern United States. I have fully sown my seeds of party throughout

16
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,080
Tybee Island, and Georgia's Tybee Island. I've moved on to Pawleys Island, South Carolina,

17
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,160
and I am here, uh, just living. Is that Island Boy?

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,720
My island phone's going off. One second. Hello?

19
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,200
Hi, it's, uh, wow, it sounds like I'm talking to you on two coconuts that are just kind of

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,880
stapled together. Is that true?

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,440
That's right. Go for Island Boy.

22
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,880
Hi, Island Boy. This is Pawley. Um, just, I heard you're staying on my island this weekend

23
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,600
and this week, and I hope you have just a great time. Be careful of those jelly sharks,

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,960
and just wanted to ask you, did do want to ask you to please just stop sowing your seed

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,040
all around my island. That'd be terrific, thanks. I would hate to remove you from the island.

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,000
I, uh, I can't help it.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,880
By the way, is Pawley Jimmy Stewart's brother?

28
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,920
Yeah, it's me, Jimmy Pawley, and I own an island, and it's covered in cum.

29
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,200
And I'm calling you specifically about the cum, Clarence.

30
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,440
I, uh, I, uh, have been living that island lifestyle so deep. You know me, right? I get

31
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,600
here first things first. I jump right into the ocean to just start to renew and replenish,

32
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,120
and then I got stung by a jellyfish, and then I came back in, and that was about 10 minutes of

33
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,520
good, just like good, solid ocean time I've had since I've been here.

34
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,960
Have you been visited? Have you been visited by the Sunshine Man?

35
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:14,080
Uh, he is, he has kissed, his sweet solar kisses all over my body, uh, and by which,

36
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,680
I mean, the very tops of my shoulder blades that got, that could be, uh, reached by the sun

37
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,640
through my, uh, chair with a built-in umbrella.

38
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:22,960
Okay.

39
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,800
So that, that's, none of that's a joke.

40
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,920
Hey, has Cra, has Crabbington come around these parts in a bit?

41
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,360
Uh, what?

42
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,920
Crabbington? I'm, I'm starting to sort of develop out the island boy fiction. I'm

43
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,960
imagining sort of a Gullah Gullah Island situation.

44
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,440
Sure, yeah.

45
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,560
Is Crabbington like the Alfred of this scenario, where he is a fairly large,

46
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,960
but not quite man-sized crab?

47
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,800
I think he's just a small crab, and he wants to steal your snacks from your beach picnic.

48
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,960
Oh, Crabbington's like the Swiper.

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,440
Yeah, Swiper, no swiping.

50
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,240
I was just picturing Crabbington with like, maybe like a, uh, uh, uh, like a,

51
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,040
one of those Jimmy Buffett beers in each claw.

52
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,840
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

53
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,520
Bringing it out to you, and maybe one's for you and one's for him after a long day of

54
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,800
crabbing around.

55
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,360
Okay, so sort of a, sort of a party crap.

56
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Oh, and that is, that is, by the way, his catchphrase, just crabbing around.

57
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,320
All right, very, very lucrative.

58
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,880
I want to tell you, I had an island boy adventure this morning I want to share with you guys.

59
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,600
I, uh, went, I went out for, I threw on my sneaks and went out for my run,

60
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,960
because I got to keep my couch to 5k streak going.

61
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,200
Getting camera ready for this September.

62
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,480
Should I be doing that?

63
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,840
Oh, I've been going the other way.

64
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,720
I've been eating a lot more fried chicken to bulk up.

65
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,640
Wait, am I doing this wrong?

66
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,280
I'm trying to get camera ready, so I went out on the beach, because what better place

67
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,560
for a run than the beach?

68
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,920
One thing I do have to note, it's very hard to run on sand.

69
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,400
Yeah.

70
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,960
So after I did, I ran about, um, a mile and a half, and I felt like I was going to die

71
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
there, so I decided to come back.

72
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,600
And as I came back, I realized that I did not pay very close attention to what the back

73
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,800
of this beach house looked like.

74
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,160
Uh oh.

75
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,360
Oopsie daisy.

76
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,320
So, fucking island boy had a little adventure of his own, where he was just slogging through

77
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,440
sand, half dead, up to like the back doors of houses, trying to peer in there to see

78
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,960
if this is the place he would stay.

79
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,200
Oh no, island boy was arrested this week.

80
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,440
Who's that, who's that at the back door?

81
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,720
Oh, it's just island boy.

82
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,440
Come to give us some of that good news.

83
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,640
Long story short, I had to use Google Maps to navigate back to my house on the beach.

84
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:32,960
Island boy.

85
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,280
You would survive well in the apocalypse, Justin.

86
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,400
Island boy, I thought you had a strict no tech rule when you were out enjoying the ocean's

87
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,360
bounties.

88
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,720
Well, solar powered only.

89
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,480
That's the one thing about it, is that they have to be solar powered.

90
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,680
Solar phone.

91
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,000
The only kind of phone I-B uses.

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let me juice that up for you, I-B.

93
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,000
Thanks, sunshine man.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,840
Do you want some of these drugs?

95
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,280
No, sunshine man.

96
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,320
Tell me some of that good news.

97
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,800
Okay, I'm gonna go now, sunshine man.

98
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,480
I'm a little uncomfortable.

99
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,720
Please stop kissing my shoulders, sunshine man.

100
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,600
You're tan now, I can see those freckies.

101
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,640
Okay, I'm gonna go be with my family now, sunshine man.

102
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,840
I have to go.

103
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,920
Please move away from the door.

104
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,040
You got a few unfreckled bits left.

105
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,480
Okay, I guess I can stay for a couple more minutes.

106
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,120
Hate this, you're ruining that island boy style.

107
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,280
How did you feel about Crab-

108
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,720
Let's do a quick focus test.

109
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,240
How did you feel about Sunshine Man and Cravington, the new characters introduced

110
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,400
from the island boy canon?

111
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,280
I liked the gritty reboot of Sunshine Man.

112
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,560
Yeah, did you-

113
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,840
Sorry, my phone broke up.

114
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,360
Did you say shitty reboot?

115
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,860
Yes.

116
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,420
I like the original Sunshine Man when it's Frank Gorshin.

117
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,580
He was the way better Sunshine Man.

118
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,220
They switched them and you thought they wouldn't notice.

119
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,700
Let's do some advice maybe.

120
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,500
I'm faced with a bit of a dilemma.

121
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,620
I have two daughters, 12 and 15, and for their entire lives, I've been doing my utmost

122
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,100
to convince them that unicorns are real and that they live in a secret reserve in Florida.

123
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,620
I approve.

124
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,900
It's been getting progressively harder as they get older, but they still love me.

125
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,980
It's been getting progressively harder as they get older, but they still believe and

126
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,140
they often get into arguments with their friends on the issue.

127
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,340
They already know about Santa and the Tooth Fairy.

128
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,660
I want to keep their childhood as magical as possible.

129
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,700
So my question is this.

130
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,900
Do I maintain this facade of a unicorn laying earth in their eyes until they grow up and

131
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,020
go out into the world on their own?

132
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,140
Or do I break the news to them now and hope that I haven't done irreparable damage already?

133
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,460
And that's for Hunting for Magic in Huntington, England.

134
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,460
Huntington, Huntington, England, not West Virginia.

135
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:47,860
Sorry.

136
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,340
So the location here is actually extremely helpful.

137
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,100
Because I think if you live in England, you are allowed to say anything lives in Florida

138
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,700
because you'll never you'll never get like who in England is like got to get to Florida.

139
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,660
Yeah, Florida has swimming tiny dinosaurs in it.

140
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,980
So why the fuck would there be unicorns?

141
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,980
Yeah, here's a here's a new character working on.

142
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,820
It's called British person that's been obsessed with going to Disney World their

143
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,500
entire life and finally gets to go.

144
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:16,820
All right.

145
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,860
God blimey, Mickey's so big, isn't he?

146
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,660
He's so tall with the little daycaps.

147
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,700
I'm going to spin around.

148
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,940
Can we make this more of a broad character who and apparently this is the episode just

149
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,860
a lot of character work.

150
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,740
But I would love to hear a version of that.

151
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,820
And it's just but it's just a British person just like psyched to just sort of generally

152
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,940
go to Florida.

153
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,620
Yeah, oh, oh, my, there's lots of water taffy down there in there.

154
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,980
Lots of orange.

155
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,340
You know, when you come in the state, they give you free orange juice, don't they?

156
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,740
I feel like you're doing a lot of Eliza Doolittle is very excited to go to Florida.

157
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,020
That does that, Travis.

158
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,460
You jumped ahead in the narrative.

159
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,620
It does parallel Pygmalion in many in many regards.

160
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,780
That's my favorite part of My Fair Lady when they go to Florida for one episode.

161
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:13,460
That one episode of My Fair Lady where they do the Disney World special and they do a

162
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,140
crossover with Boy Meets World.

163
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,460
Find that haunted tiki doll.

164
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,300
That's my favorite My Fair Lady episode.

165
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,980
Just taking some lessons with My Fair Lady.

166
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,980
My Fair Lady is filmed for a live studio audience.

167
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,860
Yeah, back up the suitcase, Eliza.

168
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,300
We're going to Florida.

169
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,900
What I like about-

170
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,780
Starring Renee Zellweger as Eliza Doolittle.

171
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,740
Now what's up, Florida?

172
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,580
I think that Florida is the perfect place because I live in West Virginia and I would

173
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,780
believe fucking anything you told me about Florida right now.

174
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,220
Anything you told me is down there, I would absolutely believe it.

175
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,700
Island Boys only nemesis, Florida, ma'am.

176
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,780
I don't see.

177
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,220
I think if you're on a different continent, anything goes.

178
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,260
That's that's that's fact that you can't like there's you have plausible European

179
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,300
deniability.

180
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:12,500
And not only that, this is one of those that like I have known parents and I have known

181
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:20,340
the children of parents who have been convinced of way like more detrimental things that like

182
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,740
they realized weren't true when they got older or like they hit 20 and they're like,

183
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,340
wait, that's how cars work?

184
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:34,580
Oh, no, like this is I think there are unicorns in Florida is is in no way a detrimental thing

185
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,380
for someone to believe as long as possible, unless like you have convinced them that those

186
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,780
unicorns will also like save them from any danger or something.

187
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,060
I think that right.

188
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,460
I think it's OK to be like, yeah, there's totally unicorns.

189
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,180
Don't worry about it.

190
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,300
There's magic in the world.

191
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,260
I love you very much.

192
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,140
Please experience life through rose colored glasses for just one day more before you realize

193
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,340
how shitty stuff can be.

194
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,140
I mean, I don't see why we have to say that corns don't exist.

195
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:10,500
Maybe they because like there's there's quadruped horse like animals with horns on them.

196
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,380
Yes.

197
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,580
And they sometimes they probably only have one.

198
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:20,500
Listen, there's whole like there's billions of miles of ocean we haven't explored.

199
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,140
Exactly what I keep coming back to, Travis.

200
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,740
Absolutely, for all we know, there's a biosphere down there that like and I'm not even talking

201
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,460
about like ocean, you talk about like land unicorns that have retreated to below the

202
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,500
ocean to be safe from our prying human eyes.

203
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,260
Oh, because, you know, we discover unicorns on a Monday.

204
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,180
By Thursday, we have figured out a way to eat those horns.

205
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,060
Oh, yes, very much.

206
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,700
No question.

207
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,660
We're making corn nuggets and we don't we don't want that.

208
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,340
So I'm saying that I think that there is listen, there's a lot.

209
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,540
Maybe there were unicorns and like everything got real messed up in the dark ages.

210
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,420
And the unicorns like, well, we're going to the moon now.

211
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,140
Maybe one day we'll return when you stop being shitty and stuff.

212
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,780
And they're just I look at us every night from the moon thinking, I hope soon.

213
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,420
Not yet.

214
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:12,900
I hope soon.

215
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,980
We're running out of oxygen.

216
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,900
Quick thought exercise.

217
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,260
We find unicorns.

218
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:18,820
They're real.

219
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,740
Yeah, we cut off the horn.

220
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,660
How do you guys think we do eat the horn?

221
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,100
How do you think you eat the horn?

222
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,220
Because I could see the two that immediately leap to mind is slip it onto your finger

223
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,460
and eat it like a bugle.

224
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,540
Or maybe you have to peel that like conical sort of design down.

225
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,700
I thought grated onto nachos.

226
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,540
Sorry?

227
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,980
Grated onto nachos.

228
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,700
Oh, yeah.

229
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,900
Grated onto nachos.

230
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,140
Sure.

231
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,900
That's definitely like a hard cheese, like a so the outside is more of a rind.

232
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,020
Yeah, inside.

233
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:59,540
OK, I'm into I'm into the bugle idea, but I'd like to do it my preferred way of doing bugles,

234
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,620
which is sort of like a fun little aperitif.

235
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,300
Just get some some stuffed witch fingers, just like get a can of easy cheese and you

236
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,340
put the nozzle in there and you sort of you sort of deposit it directly into the receptacle.

237
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,500
And then you eat the whole kit and caboodle.

238
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,740
Of course, with a unicorn horn, I wouldn't want to just put spray can cheese in there

239
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,220
and also like some sort of cryptozoological thing in there.

240
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:31,060
So maybe like a maybe just like sort of chupacabra jelly.

241
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,820
Or like a sasquatch cheese.

242
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,620
It's a mammal.

243
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,580
It has nipples.

244
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,300
If I learned anything from Meet the Parents, you can milk it.

245
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,340
Some yeti butter.

246
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,100
Yeti, yeti, yeti sauce.

247
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,260
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

248
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,220
Sure.

249
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,660
Oh, were we not just doing one?

250
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,340
Oh, yeah.

251
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,140
Oops.

252
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,500
This one was sent in by level 9000.

253
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,540
Yahoo Drew, Drew Devonport.

254
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:51,940
Thank you, Drew.

255
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,140
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

256
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,860
They are anonymous.

257
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,660
We will call them.

258
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:02,580
Frankfurt asks, how do I choose between two barbers?

259
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,460
I have two barbers that normally cut my hair, but usually only one is available because

260
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,900
the other is busy.

261
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,740
The last time I went, both were available and I just chose the one who said hi to me

262
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,700
first, but the other one looked sad.

263
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,820
What do I do next time?

264
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,260
Well, there's an obvious answer.

265
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,820
There always is with you.

266
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,460
Well, you need some sort of barber off.

267
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,500
You know that classic scene in Sweeney Todd where they have the shave off and the Sweeney

268
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,620
Todd goes against the flashier guy?

269
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,940
To save the rec center that the big bank is trying to close down?

270
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,780
Yeah, you know that scene in Sweeney Todd where Old Man Carrothers is trying to shut

271
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,380
down the rec center and Sweeney Todd is like, not today, come on teens.

272
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,980
And Sweeney Todd and all the other teens get together to save the rec center and they have

273
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,940
the shave off.

274
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,700
Yeah, I remember that.

275
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,340
And if I remember correctly, there was a little bit of comedic nudity in that scene.

276
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:58,820
Little bit.

277
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,300
That's a light tasteful comedic nudity.

278
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,660
You know what I would do next time is just get all the barbers.

279
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:09,860
Tell them you'll pay an exorbitant tip and get all the barbers in the place to work on

280
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,340
you at once and pretend you're in like a montage.

281
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:17,700
Like a She's All That style or like a Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, you know, upon their

282
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,820
arrival to the Emerald City.

283
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,620
That kind of vibe.

284
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,460
Yeah, that one.

285
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,020
That's the one.

286
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:32,340
Could we get them to do sort of pay all the barbers to cut each other's hair in like a

287
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:37,620
circle and then you just look at who's got the best do out of that whole thing.

288
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,820
And then you have them.

289
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,180
Well, you have the person immediately.

290
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,380
But well, shit, that's the problem.

291
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,340
And and because you'd be like, oh, man, Michael, it's you.

292
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,540
You've got the best haircut.

293
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,900
Oh, wait, who did you?

294
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,060
And a few of the boys are going to raise their hands.

295
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,140
And it's like one of y'all's lying more than one of y'all's lying.

296
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,220
Only one of y'all really cut Michael's hair.

297
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,220
We're going to have to cut Michael into three pieces.

298
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,340
Wisdom of Solomon.

299
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,740
Is this how is this not a reality show?

300
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,740
Or like America's Next Top Barber?

301
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,940
How is this not a thing?

302
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Guarantee 100% it definitely, definitely, definitely is right.

303
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,100
This has to be a thing.

304
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,180
I really like the idea of a barber being sad that you didn't pick them.

305
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,100
Like, oh, I wanted to cut his hair.

306
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,420
I wanted to work for 30 minutes.

307
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,580
We call it Barber, Barber, Barber.

308
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,300
Uh huh.

309
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:26,980
And the host would be Barbara Bush and Tiki Barber, who I think is a football player.

310
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,580
That is a fucking dynamic, dynamic duo.

311
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,420
Um, guys, sheer, sheer genius.

312
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,020
Ah, there it is.

313
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,740
Sheer genius.

314
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,020
Fuck that.

315
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:44,180
TM, TM, TM, TM, TM, TM, TM, the Bravo Network.

316
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,180
Oh, I thought you just came up with that whole clause.

317
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,060
I thought that was a Justin McElroy Ridge.

318
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,220
Yeah.

319
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,860
I wish I could cold scope something like that out of nowhere.

320
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,980
No, it's like an exist, an extent Bravo property.

321
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:03,300
Um, hey, I, how did you all pick your hair person?

322
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,940
I went to Cameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher and I said, who cuts your hair?

323
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,980
Yeah, that's exactly, that's exactly the right answer, Travis.

324
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,700
There's many answers and a lot of them are kind of right.

325
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,020
That's the only undeniably right answer.

326
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:23,380
And the fun thing is now my barber pony at Folklore Salon here in Los Angeles has a Cameron

327
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,500
Esposito and Rhea Butcher calendar, like promotional calendar.

328
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,140
So every time I get my hair cut, like I'm just like staring at Rhea Butcher like, yep,

329
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,260
that's why I'm here.

330
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,060
You did great.

331
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,540
Great job.

332
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:41,540
I, uh, I have, usually I'll go to my man, Sonny at Fantastic Sam's, uh, or sorry, my

333
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,660
man, Sonny at Master Cuts up at the mall, but a lot of times I don't have time to go

334
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,300
to the mall.

335
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,820
So I'll go to Fantastic Sam's, which is really a fucking wild west of hair cutting.

336
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,260
I'll just walk in and like throw my arms open.

337
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,300
Like I'm Scott Stab and just be like, who wants, who wants to take it on?

338
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,980
Who wants to ride the tornado with me?

339
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,500
And everybody just rushes.

340
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,420
They pile on each other to get to you.

341
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,140
They want to get their hands in this beautiful, lustrous mane.

342
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,980
I'm actually planning.

343
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,340
Now that's been Sunkissed, can you imagine when I go in there, the fucking stand there,

344
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,620
I'm going to have to call the HPD ahead of time to give them like a heads up.

345
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,700
Or it's going to be like that scene from 300 where everyone's just piling on top of

346
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,380
each other to form a human shield.

347
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,660
Is that a thing that happens in that movie?

348
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,180
Probably.

349
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,380
You could have these two barbers each cut one half of your head and then look at yourself

350
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,620
in the mirror and say, I look ridiculous, but and then you leave and then you become

351
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,940
Riff Raff, the rapper man, Riff Raff.

352
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,100
You become the new Riff Raff.

353
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,860
I'm so terrified of now at almost 33 years old having to find yet another new barber

354
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,740
when I move back to Cincinnati that as part of my like move, I'm already planning to

355
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,260
fly back to Los Angeles whenever I can to do like work stuff.

356
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,940
And I think I'll just schedule all my haircuts while I'm here so that way I can just keep

357
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,620
getting my haircut in Los Angeles.

358
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,540
And even as I say that, it sounds like the bougiest thing I've ever said.

359
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,500
Yeah, it's really rough.

360
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,500
I saw that coming early, you know, like as you launched into it, I thought, oh, this

361
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,620
is going to be pretty bougie.

362
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,700
This is going to be a really bougie thing to say.

363
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,500
Yep, I'm traveling to Los Angeles to get my haircut.

364
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,020
Are you guys using pop filters?

365
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,580
Because when you say douchey, it sounds like you're saying something else.

366
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:20,260
How about another question?

367
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,860
I live in a building with several other apartments and is this from an apartment?

368
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,500
I live in a building with several other apartments and my neighbors are constantly putting their

369
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,340
own junk mail in my mailbox.

370
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,460
Fucking sap.

371
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,260
Is there a good way to get them to stop?

372
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,660
That's from Nate in New Hampshire.

373
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,700
Everybody okay.

374
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,380
You know who would like this information on moving boxes?

375
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,220
Nate would like information on boxes.

376
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,340
Here you go, Nate.

377
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,380
Yeah, fuck Nate.

378
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,060
That's the question, right?

379
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,820
That's the real question behind the question.

380
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,700
The sub question, the sewer system of this question that allows this question to operate.

381
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,780
What'd you do, Nate?

382
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,780
What Nate doesn't tell you is when he has a full bag of trash, he just throws it in

383
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,780
whatever window is open in his building and just decides he's done with it.

384
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,260
Hey, Nate.

385
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,940
What'd you do, bud?

386
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,020
Cause you did something or else this would not be a coordinated effort.

387
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,140
Yeah, it would be evenly spread out.

388
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,380
But the fact that everybody in the building is like, hey, we can all like, listen, we

389
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,300
call the meeting without Nate here.

390
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,340
We can all agree.

391
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,140
Fuck Nate, right?

392
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:27,940
Right?

393
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,900
Yeah, yeah, fuck Nate.

394
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,340
No dissenters.

395
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,460
Everyone's on board.

396
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,020
Okay.

397
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,700
What did you do, Nate?

398
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,060
What'd you do, Nate?

399
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,100
Hey, Nate, what'd you do?

400
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,900
What didn't you do?

401
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,820
Oh, that's another good one.

402
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,060
This might be an omission thing where maybe Chris was rolled around and everybody gave

403
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:51,700
like $20 to like get a present for the super and you had no idea and you didn't chip in

404
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,100
and everybody had to pay for you and everyone's like, Nate hates everyone, including the super

405
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,540
and the super cried a lot.

406
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,780
Cause you know, he seems tough when he's fixing your pipes, but he's a very gentle soul.

407
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,180
And everyone went, I can't believe that he made super Dave cry because that's what they

408
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,140
call the super.

409
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,020
Oh, man.

410
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,820
And so now everyone's just like, Nate is a cruel Ebenezer Scrooge type and I don't trust

411
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,300
him.

412
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:13,540
Yeah.

413
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,140
And then, and then after Christmas, New Year's Day rolled around and he took the decorations

414
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,100
off his Christmas tree and he just left it in the stairwell.

415
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,900
That's another thing.

416
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,580
Also that, and it caught fire.

417
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,180
Yeah, it caught fire and a whole building burned down.

418
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,820
Stupid Nate.

419
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:33,700
Nate, I'd like to introduce you to a man named, his name is Burke Plimpton.

420
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:39,300
And he lives in your, he lives in your building now and there's two sort of defining characteristics.

421
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:44,020
He's got a big pair of glasses, big nerdy glasses and a big bushy beard.

422
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,980
And he's got the mailbox directly under yours.

423
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,140
And also one more thing you should know about Burke Plimpton is he's you, Nate.

424
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,220
What a great pull, Harvey.

425
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:55,780
Wait, hold on.

426
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,980
That thing you did there.

427
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,900
Is this like a fight club thing?

428
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:06,260
He, it's like a new mailbox thing and then Burke Plimpton is going to, is going to, well,

429
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:06,660
I don't know.

430
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,700
Maybe Burke Plimpton is going to have to be even more of a villain to get this.

431
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,020
They're not going to deliver Nate's mail to Burke Plimpton is the problem.

432
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,100
Well, not at first.

433
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:23,060
What if, what if Nate reinvents himself as Burke Plimpton beloved, beloved elderly neighbor

434
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:27,460
and he's just walk around like, I've made too many snickerdoodles.

435
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,900
Would you like some?

436
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,460
And then like, but it sure smells like dog shit in Nate's apartment.

437
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,020
I never met him, but I hate that fucking.

438
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,420
Yeah, he's got to hate Nate.

439
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:38,980
Yeah.

440
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,820
I think we can all agree.

441
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,300
Fuck Nate, right?

442
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:48,020
We're just strangers learning each other's likes and dislikes, but I think I get a pretty

443
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,420
strong fuck Nate vibe from you.

444
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,300
And you know what?

445
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,820
I'm on board with it.

446
00:22:52,820 --> 00:23:01,060
I'm going to stuff all of my advertisements for the local grocer in that sad fucker's

447
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,500
mail slot.

448
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:09,300
Wait, did Burke Plimpton take Nate's apartment or did he rent a second apartment?

449
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,140
I rent a second one.

450
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,420
I mean the first one.

451
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,100
I mean the first one.

452
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,260
It's my only Burke Plimpton pad.

453
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,780
Damn Burke Plimpton's place is better than my place.

454
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,700
I wish I could just live in Burke Plimpton's place.

455
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,540
I wish I was, but everybody likes Burke Plimpton.

456
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,580
I wish I was Burke.

457
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,860
You are Burke Plimpton.

458
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,460
Sometimes I don't even know.

459
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,540
Sometimes I don't know when he begins and I begin.

460
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:35,140
You know, when I was masquerading as Burke, I met a really sweet lady named Beulah.

461
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,460
She's 70, so she's just six years younger than me, Burke Plimpton.

462
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,860
I think I could have a real shot of happiness with her.

463
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,940
I think we could have really something really special.

464
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,780
Hey Nate, this is me, your wife.

465
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,060
What are you talking about?

466
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,060
Okay, but that has nothing to do with Burke's life.

467
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,580
You're not Burke's wife.

468
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,780
That's Burke's law, baby.

469
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,620
You can't talk to me about Burke's life.

470
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,140
You don't see a ring on this finger.

471
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,420
That's your right hand.

472
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,180
Yeah, that's where the European.

473
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,060
Yeah, Burke's European.

474
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,500
That's the one he puts it on.

475
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,020
God, Beulah would never do me like this.

476
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,740
Him, Burke.

477
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,300
Burke, not me.

478
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,500
Not Nate, never Nate.

479
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,420
Here's one thing you could do.

480
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,780
Go to your box and after you get your mail for that day,

481
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,460
you put a little jelly on it.

482
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,940
And if you put some jelly on your mailbox,

483
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,420
then the next person who comes to stuff junk mail in there,

484
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,820
they're gonna get a big mitt full of the goopy stuff.

485
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,180
And I think that's gonna be a real down part of their day.

486
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,060
Now, issue with this, Justin, is if the next person-

487
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,620
No issue.

488
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,060
The only issue is that I can see is that if the next person

489
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,060
that comes to put the mail in the slot,

490
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,500
if that person is the mailman and they get a big mitt full

491
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,940
of the goopy stuff, you've just assaulted a federal employee

492
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,860
and that's hard time, bud.

493
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,300
That's a federal felony.

494
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,460
Maybe Nate tried this already

495
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,980
and that's why he gets all the junk mail.

496
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,940
It's not his neighbors.

497
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,140
It's just the mailman like,

498
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,820
huh, fuck Nate, right, everybody?

499
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,540
Hey, everybody.

500
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,980
I think we can all agree.

501
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,620
See you at the Christmas party that Nate's never invited to.

502
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,740
I love this Burke Plimpton guy though.

503
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,140
He gets extra good mail.

504
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,780
He gets all of Nate's checks.

505
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,620
Wait, hold on.

506
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,100
And then you have to kill the mailman to keep it covered up.

507
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,900
No one must know your dirty Burke Plimpton secret.

508
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,460
I would suggest getting a trash can,

509
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,540
put it under your mailbox and label it Nate's new mailbox.

510
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,460
Please don't put junk mail in here.

511
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,260
That's good.

512
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,780
It's really good.

513
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,540
Nate mailbox overflow.

514
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,820
Nate's favorite can.

515
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,580
Please don't steal.

516
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,540
Don't steal.

517
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,980
Don't destroy it.

518
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,140
Don't disgrace with junk.

519
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,580
This is Nate's favorite can.

520
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,260
You can put a picture of your face on there

521
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,980
just so people are really into throwing trash at it.

522
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,980
And also maybe shitting in it.

523
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,260
Yeah, maybe they will shit in it.

524
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,500
Another question.

525
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,540
Yahoo, what do you guys want to do?

526
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,040
Yahoo.

527
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,860
How about this one?

528
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,420
It was sent in by Morgan Davey.

529
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:06,980
Thank you, Morgan.

530
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,260
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

531
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,860
Another anonymous user.

532
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,780
Fucking stand in your truth, folks.

533
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,060
It's by, I'm going to go down the list.

534
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,700
Kelvin is a respondent to this question.

535
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,820
Let's pretend like they asked it.

536
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:28,020
Kelvin says, will the dentist be able to tell I smoke weed?

537
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,300
I smoke weed every once in a while.

538
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,420
I'm going to the dental checkup in two days with my mom.

539
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,660
Does dentist know I smoked weed?

540
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,860
Since I am 12, I think if he finds out, he will tell my mom.

541
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,640
Oh, no.

542
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,300
OK, this got more complex about halfway through.

543
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,900
12 is probably too young.

544
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,940
Yeah, 12 is too young for most things.

545
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,060
Yeah, most things.

546
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,780
Most cool things.

547
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,740
So OK, let's establish some of the science.

548
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,140
OK.

549
00:26:59,140 --> 00:26:59,640
Up front.

550
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,380
Does weed?

551
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,740
Yes.

552
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,780
Do you think you can smell like teeth or?

553
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,900
One of the most fun stuff, like the most fun stuff ever.

554
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,420
Teeth are porous, right?

555
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:09,860
Too porous.

556
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,020
Definitely there's weed smell in there.

557
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:19,540
But I don't know how confident I, as a dentist, I don't know how confident I would have to be

558
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:24,980
in that weed tooth smell to look at a 12 year old's mom and say, hey, I think this,

559
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,460
I think this preteens smoking some of the kind.

560
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,540
I think he's been hanging out with the sunshine man.

561
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,220
You know what I mean?

562
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,020
And I think you do.

563
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:39,940
But if there's one person in this world who knows mouths better than like your dentist

564
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,460
knows your mouth better than like your than your lover.

565
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,580
Yeah, that's for definitely for sure.

566
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:52,980
Because your dentist is not only like up in it, they're looking so hard at your teeth

567
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,180
and they might even be able to see that you've been smoking weed.

568
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:00,500
They might just look at your porous ass teeth and be like, there's microscopic weed in here.

569
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,620
Yeah, I see that.

570
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,020
I see little flakes that good of that kind kind.

571
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,540
Have you been smoking?

572
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:11,220
Oh, Miss, Miss Kelvin, your son has been smoking weed.

573
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,540
What?

574
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,100
Yes.

575
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,700
But the bad news continues.

576
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,380
He's been smoking shitty weed.

577
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,500
It's really bad, bud.

578
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,140
Bad weed.

579
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,260
This is shitty weed.

580
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,460
Have you not talked to your son about good weed versus shitty weed?

581
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,780
Do you want to buy good weed from your dentist?

582
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,900
Because we can make that happen.

583
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:26,980
Is it possible?

584
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,980
Also, it's just like the teeth are very orange.

585
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,820
It's like this is too many Cheetos for an un-intoxicated 12 year old to consume.

586
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,580
How many crunch wraps did you have?

587
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:45,060
I don't think the dentist will be confident enough in his diagnosis to bring it up to mom.

588
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:50,980
I do think, though, that if it was me, like I would work in sneaky ways of hinting to the kid

589
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,620
that I knew because I want this motherfucker to scare.

590
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,300
OK, so how would you do this?

591
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,860
I'd be like, well, we just need to schedule you for a follow up.

592
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,220
Would you be free at 420?

593
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,340
And then the parents would be like, that's not ideal for me

594
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,340
because I would have to pick him up after work and it would conflict.

595
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,740
Yeah, I think Kelvin's probably busy, too.

596
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,620
That's the weed time.

597
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,660
That's the time that all of us get super high as a family.

598
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,380
Oh, OK.

599
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,300
Well, in that case-

600
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,420
All my jokes are ruined.

601
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,220
Thank you, mother.

602
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,940
Yeah, I also think that as a dentist, I doubt that there's a dentist in this world

603
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,580
who, like, if they figured out one of their kid patients was smoking weed,

604
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,820
would not only like want to say something.

605
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,900
I don't think that's a dentist's job at all.

606
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,620
I don't think you take a dentist oath that's like,

607
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,780
and if you figure out that that kid says that, you have to say something.

608
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,860
Like, I don't know that there's a dentist's life who feels obligated.

609
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,380
It's more like, yeah, kids smoke weed.

610
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,100
Well, I'm a dentist.

611
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,980
I don't care.

612
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,460
Like, this doesn't affect me at all.

613
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:59,380
But if the stink is so overwhelming, that kid just opens up their mouth

614
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,620
and it's just like my first apartment's carpet.

615
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,380
Like, I feel like morally, ethically,

616
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,860
what's the code of do no harm and also narc on your kid patients?

617
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,340
I don't know that dentists have to take that.

618
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:16,580
No.

619
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,380
The Hippocratic oath.

620
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,820
I don't think they have to do anything.

621
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,260
I think as a dentist-

622
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,620
I have a dentist appointment next week.

623
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,860
I'm going in and I'm being like, did you take the Hippo?

624
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,140
Because I don't want you in my mouth if you're not like prohibited from doing harm

625
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,220
because you could do mad harm in there.

626
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,140
Griffin, I tell you a secret.

627
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,100
I tell you a secret.

628
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,420
They just rent the space.

629
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:38,020
It comes with the tools and the chairs and the diplomas.

630
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,580
They don't have to worry about anything.

631
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,140
They're all up in there doing as much harm as they want.

632
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,740
Then I'm going into every dentist appointment from now on with a fucking-

633
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,340
with a holy Bible, King James edition.

634
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,460
I'll be like, put your hand on this right now and give me the Hippo

635
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,660
because you're not going to get in my mouth until you give me the Hippo.

636
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,300
I'm going to start doing this-

637
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,980
You should actually be doing that with all doctors.

638
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,020
Yeah, I don't know.

639
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,340
How the fuck do I-

640
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,300
Swear to me.

641
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,900
Swear to me you're not going to kill me.

642
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:08,500
Like, they save me from the boat accident, but I'm horribly injured

643
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,820
and I'm in the ambulance and I'm like, hold up.

644
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,140
Got a pocket KJV.

645
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,100
Do the Hippo.

646
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,140
No. Sir, you're bleeding a lot.

647
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,220
Do the Hippo.

648
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,420
Do it once.

649
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,660
If you're the kid, just fucking stand in it.

650
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,460
Yes, I did.

651
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,780
I was very stressed about coming to the dentist.

652
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,060
Is that not understandable?

653
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,340
Like, yeah, I was very anxious about this visit.

654
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,140
So, yes, I did.

655
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,180
And also, I listened to the-

656
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,500
Statistically, at this point, if the dentist is like,

657
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,540
did you smoke weed?

658
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,660
Look at him like, did you?

659
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,060
Alright, fair enough.

660
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,540
We're done.

661
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:48,980
So, I think we should take a quick trip to the money zone.

662
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:54,660
Tell me how paranoid about the Hippo now.

663
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,580
Do doctors have to do that, like, before they graduate?

664
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,660
Like, they walk on stage to get their diploma and they're like,

665
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,340
all right, here goes.

666
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,820
I solemnly swear to do no harm.

667
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,460
They also have to list off all the doctors before them

668
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,900
that begat what doctors before them all the way back

669
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,540
to the first doctor.

670
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,980
Yeah, it takes a wicked long time.

671
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,300
Yeah.

672
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,620
Yeah, well, whichever one had their white coat.

673
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,020
Yeah, they find out what the name of their white coat is,

674
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,740
and then it goes all the way.

675
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,900
Yeah, they have to take it as part of their, like,

676
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,460
indoctrination ceremony.

677
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,180
Like, when they get there, it's like the-

678
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,660
All right.

679
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,460
The last thing they have to do.

680
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,300
So, they have all done it, theoretically.

681
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,660
All right, but, Dennis, I'm fucking watching y'all.

682
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,940
I want to take a second to talk to you all about Warby Parker.

683
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,860
They support our show, and they're offering

684
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,060
contemporary prescription glasses starting at $95.

685
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:43,140
Prescription sunglasses start at $175, including lenses.

686
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,220
They make buying glasses online easy, risk-free, and enjoyable.

687
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,020
My wife, Sydney, just needed new glasses,

688
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,100
and we didn't even have, like, a promo or sponsorship

689
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,700
or anything going with them at the moment.

690
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,580
And I said, we got to do Warby Parker.

691
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,140
It's really fun.

692
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,780
You go online, you look through all the different styles,

693
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,940
and then they have this home try-on program

694
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,500
where you order five pairs of glasses,

695
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,460
they ship them to you, you try all the frames on,

696
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,260
and so you actually see what they look like,

697
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,460
and then you buy based on, you know, how they look,

698
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,020
which ones you want.

699
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,060
So, you actually get to give them a shot,

700
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,340
then you ship all the frames back.

701
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,140
Wait, I- Oh, I have- Oh, guys, let me try this on.

702
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,020
Tell me what you think.

703
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,100
And Warby Parker, if you like it, you can keep it.

704
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,340
Your face and Warby Parker glasses, I ship that.

705
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,220
And so do they.

706
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,060
Okay, that's-

707
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,020
Well, hold on.

708
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,140
I think maybe you didn't-

709
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,420
I think maybe let me try it again.

710
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,100
No, no, I'm just going to get through this.

711
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,700
Try all the frames on, get a feel for them,

712
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,220
get feedback from others, and you know what?

713
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,060
They'll actually give you feedback if you tweet at them,

714
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,860
and they'll tell you what they think.

715
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,580
Because ship can have two meanings.

716
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:47,940
Is that clear?

717
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:54,500
Go to Warby Parker, that's W-A-R-B-Y-P-A-R-K-E-R.com

718
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,540
slash my brother, and start your risk-free

719
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,060
try-on experience today.

720
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:03,060
That's Warby Parker dot com slash my brother.

721
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,980
I ship that, and so do they.

722
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,580
So it's pretty much anybody that ships anything, huh, Trav?

723
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,860
Well, no, no, listen.

724
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,180
I'm giving it to Warby Parker.

725
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,180
Okay, because the next sponsor also ships things.

726
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:18,680
Fuck.

727
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,980
I need you on your best behavior.

728
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,380
I'm going to tell you about Blue Apron, though,

729
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,580
because Blue Apron's really great.

730
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,420
We all use it.

731
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:30,820
They taught me how to cook and cook some really amazing meals,

732
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,500
including this, I don't know if you guys did the Korean chicken noodle dish

733
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,140
with like those big rice noodles.

734
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,540
Holy shit, it was so good.

735
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,500
Oh, you're missing it.

736
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,100
I'm on vacation, I had to give my Blue Apron away.

737
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,300
Oh, dude, it was so good.

738
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,020
Anyway, for less than 10 bucks a meal, Blue Apron delivers

739
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,340
seasonal recipes along with pre-portioned ingredients

740
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,780
to make delicious home-cooked meals.

741
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,060
I'm talking about stuff like spiced pork burgers with goat cheese

742
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,580
and cucumber corn salad.

743
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,500
Talking about summer vegetable quinoa bowl

744
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,700
with fairy tale eggplants, shishito peppers, and corn.

745
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,460
Talking about chicken tinga tacos with summer squash and tomato salsa.

746
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,460
They're so very, very good.

747
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,940
The ingredients are all, you know, fresh

748
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,740
and they can be flexible depending on what your dietary preferences are.

749
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,340
It's so great.

750
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,020
I adore Blue Apron.

751
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,740
You can check out this week's menu and get your first three meals for free

752
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,700
with free delivery.

753
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,140
Damn it.

754
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,020
By going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

755
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,900
You're gonna love how good it feels and tastes to create incredible home-cooked meals

756
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,260
with Blue Apron, so don't wait.

757
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,260
Blueapron.com slash my brother.

758
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,700
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

759
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,820
I have a, okay, I'm just gonna put this tagline out there for Blue Apron.

760
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,620
Blue Apron, now you're cooking.

761
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,340
This is the new, this is the new jingle.

762
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,220
This is the new jingle.

763
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,580
This is the new service I provide.

764
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,340
Do you want another shot at Warby Parker since that one was so bad?

765
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,500
I'm not specific to them at all.

766
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:54,820
Yeah.

767
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,020
Oh yeah, okay.

768
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,340
Glasses half full, but half the price.

769
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,460
I was gonna say that.

770
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,100
That's so good.

771
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,460
But the thing, the problem is that makes it sound like they just ship you one lens

772
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,180
and one glasses leg.

773
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,900
Oh, that's right.

774
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,660
See the world through rose colored glasses.

775
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,380
No, that's nothing.

776
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,020
How about just, just see the world is really good.

777
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,300
Oh, that's pretty good.

778
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,500
Yeah, all right.

779
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,500
Because if you don't have the glasses, you probably aren't seeing the world very good.

780
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:26,740
Yeah.

781
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:31,620
I got a Jumbotron message here for Anthony and it's from Jason who says,

782
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,900
happy birthday, buddy.

783
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,860
Hope you enjoy a shout out from your favorite brothers.

784
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,900
We seriously got to play some disc golf while the weather beautiful.

785
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,700
There's no, there's no punctuation, which I fucking adore.

786
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,660
I was reading a New York Times article about how the period is over.

787
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,780
And just like pretty soon, we're all just going to communicate and beautiful,

788
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,580
poetic E.E. Cummings-esque run on sentences like this one.

789
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,460
Happy birthday, buddy.

790
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,300
Hope you enjoy a shout out from your favorite brothers.

791
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,900
We seriously got to play some disc golf while the weather beautiful.

792
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,020
Love it.

793
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,900
And celebration of life and sunshine and summer and summer boy.

794
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,780
And Anthony, you do seriously need to play some disc golf while the weather beautiful.

795
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,300
What the fuck are you waiting for?

796
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,260
What the fuck?

797
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:24,420
Gather ye, gather ye rose buds and six sling-ins while ye may.

798
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:30,660
Because fall's a-coming and behind that, it's that dastard winter.

799
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,700
Listen, if there's not a disc golf of the afterlife, I ain't going.

800
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,740
That's all I'm saying.

801
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,700
Who's this message for?

802
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,460
It's for Josh and it's from Jill.

803
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,140
Jill says, Josh, it was just your birthday.

804
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,780
Jill wanted us to wish you a happy birthday.

805
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,980
Here's to another year of love, Hamilton and me undies.

806
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,780
That's from your number one lady, Jill.

807
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,660
And Jill says, I'd love for this to be on the May 2nd episode.

808
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:56,180
Well, Jill, it's important to want things, Jill.

809
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,380
That's what keeps us going.

810
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,940
But just because you didn't get what you wanted this time

811
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,460
doesn't mean you won't all the time.

812
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,900
Now, I do like that Jill says it was just your birthday,

813
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,260
which speaking in the broad expanse of time is very true.

814
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:14,100
Compared to like, you know, the prehistoric era

815
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,340
and the time it's taken us to get here from there,

816
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,260
this was just a minute ago.

817
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,220
You know, if the entire world was a calendar,

818
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,380
the entirety of time was a calendar,

819
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:28,660
we would be in the last 30 seconds before New Year's

820
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,380
and we would have just missed your birthday by like,

821
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,380
I don't know, the time it takes to blink.

822
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,860
We'd still be very late though.

823
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,860
Yeah, still would be a long time

824
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,380
because that's just perspective

825
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,180
and not really a scaling or changing of time.

826
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,500
Welcome to Cosmos.

827
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,460
I'm Travis.

828
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,300
Welcome to the dumb Cosmos.

829
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,820
I'm popular idiot, Travis.

830
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,780
Welcome to Cosmos.

831
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,340
Welcome to the Cosmos episode that explains to me

832
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,860
how you missed important things.

833
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,660
Use this anytime you need to justify being a shitty friend.

834
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,900
I'm Hal Loveland.

835
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,860
I'm Danielle Radford.

836
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,820
I am Michael Eagle.

837
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,500
And we are the hosts of Tights and Fights,

838
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,260
Maximum Fun's newest podcast dedicated to all things wrestling.

839
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,060
We'll be talking about Sasha Banks, the women's revolution,

840
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,580
Sasha Banks, the brand split and Sasha Banks' wigs.

841
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,900
And we'll also be talking about wrestler fashion.

842
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,820
Some wrestlers wear too many clothes.

843
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,660
Some wrestlers don't wear enough clothes at all.

844
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,100
And I'll be doing impressions of all your favorite wrestlers.

845
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,980
New episodes, Thursdays on Maximum Fun

846
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,060
or wherever you get your podcasts.

847
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,820
Oh yeah, dig it.

848
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:45,300
Tights and Fights podcast, Tights and Fights.

849
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,260
I'm a good boy and I always say my pleases and thank yous.

850
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:52,180
However, I have never been able to commit to saying thank you.

851
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,140
Seriously.

852
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,100
I always dip my head or say it in a silly voice

853
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,180
and it attracts from the genuine gratefulness

854
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,060
I'm trying to convey.

855
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,900
Brothers, how do you give people the thanks they deserve?

856
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,060
Thank you in advance.

857
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,220
Lots of love, Johnny from England.

858
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,660
I think you read that wrong.

859
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,860
You think you read that wrong, Justin.

860
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,220
I think it should have been like, thank you.

861
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,340
Thank you.

862
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,780
Thank you in advance.

863
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,580
This is better.

864
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,780
It's arguably better than the way that I say thank you.

865
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,380
Which is if somebody like somebody,

866
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,140
one of you two like pretend to hold the door for me.

867
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,260
Okay, I'm doing it.

868
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,620
Okay.

869
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,060
What do I say when I do?

870
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,020
After you.

871
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:36,180
Yeah, I would just be like, thank you.

872
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:39,300
Like I just kind of, thanks, thank you.

873
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,980
I just kind of whisper it,

874
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,900
just kind of make the moves with my mouth.

875
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,140
Yeah.

876
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,540
But it doesn't, thank you, thanks.

877
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,700
I'm so sad that I know exactly what you're talking about

878
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,340
and I do the exact like where I just can't,

879
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,020
my mouth wants to make the word,

880
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,380
but like my heart is like,

881
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,980
please don't speak to another human being.

882
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,140
Thank you, thanks.

883
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:02,660
Yeah.

884
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,940
Are you a parcel tongue?

885
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,660
What are you doing?

886
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,740
Harry Potter.

887
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,740
Thank you for holding that door, Harry Potter.

888
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,580
Yeah, this is a, I mean, this is a problem

889
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,740
I think most people suffer from

890
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,980
because otherwise like, hey, thanks.

891
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,180
Like that's not the right way to do it.

892
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,020
Well, here's what the problem is, right?

893
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,220
What are you saying when you say thank you?

894
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,460
Well, you're saying I'm in your debt.

895
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:29,940
Yeah.

896
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,380
I'm debted to you now.

897
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,660
I mean, I'm a debtor to you.

898
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,820
That's very hard to admit to someone

899
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,380
because you immediately have to make it up to them.

900
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,100
Maybe instead of saying thank you,

901
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,060
you can immediately say what you're going to do

902
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,340
to counterbalance it.

903
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,740
So you will not have any debt.

904
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,180
Like someone holds open the door for you.

905
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,780
You say, I'm falling into your car

906
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,900
and I'll do the same there.

907
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,540
So that way you'll be like, even.

908
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,540
I'm going to hold the door open for your car.

909
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,740
Let's go.

910
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,540
Or maybe you don't have time

911
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,980
and you just say like, now if you ever need anything,

912
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,860
you call me and you hand them like a business card

913
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,540
with just like your name and phone number.

914
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,340
It's like, if you ever need anything, you call me.

915
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,620
Well, on the business card, it just says thank you.

916
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,500
So that way you've like-

917
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,540
Thank you, I've done it.

918
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,620
You win a better one.

919
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,220
It is, okay, what's better?

920
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,940
Thank you, silly voice.

921
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,620
Or someone holds the door and you just go,

922
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,700
hey, thank you.

923
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,820
No, thank you.

924
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,860
This is why hats were invented.

925
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,380
It's because, it's like cowboys,

926
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,460
they didn't fucking thank any man.

927
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,780
No, they didn't say things out loud.

928
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,020
No.

929
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,180
Cause when you do that, you're distracted

930
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,860
and then they gun you.

931
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,660
Gotcha.

932
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,140
Yeah.

933
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:54,260
What they would just do is just a little tippity do,

934
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,700
a little tip a canoe.

935
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,900
And then that's all that you need.

936
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,860
And I miss that.

937
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,300
Let me pitch this, Griffin.

938
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,540
You're both heading for the door.

939
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,900
They get there first, they open it.

940
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,660
You kind of arch one eyebrow,

941
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,500
tilt your head to the side and do a slight nod

942
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,420
as if to say, you win this one.

943
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:13,620
Okay.

944
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,900
Like you just acknowledged like,

945
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,100
I would have held the door for you,

946
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,380
but you got here first.

947
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,020
Well played.

948
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,740
See Travis, when you said raise one eyebrow,

949
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,180
I thought you were kind of going like,

950
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,300
what's your angle?

951
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,340
Hey, what are you trying for right now?

952
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,460
What traps have you laid in this building for me?

953
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,260
No, you go.

954
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:30,900
Well, hold on.

955
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,740
What if they want you to think

956
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,820
that they want you to go first?

957
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,220
Hold on.

958
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,100
Inside there's really treasure

959
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,620
that they want to get to first.

960
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,020
Damn it.

961
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,220
They're all inside my mind.

962
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,340
That's why you just turn around

963
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,460
and walk away from the door.

964
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,900
So if someone gets to the door

965
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,860
and holds the door open for you,

966
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,380
you just go, no, not today.

967
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,500
And you just walk away.

968
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,620
Well, first you stand there

969
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,300
and you try to read their intent.

970
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,860
It's a psychological,

971
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:56,980
it's that Yomi,

972
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,580
that psychological warfare.

973
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,380
What are you doing, my opponent?

974
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,300
No, not today.

975
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,580
The only way to win against a true Yomi master

976
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,420
who's playing in the Japanese style

977
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,860
is to just turn and walk away

978
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,620
and leave them to their duties and their business.

979
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,220
Griffin, do you have some kind of pop filter on?

980
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,740
Cause when you said yo-yo master,

981
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,540
it sounded weird.

982
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,140
They might also be a yo-yo master.

983
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:19,860
Yeah.

984
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,380
Can you start following them around

985
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,820
like they owe you a life debt

986
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,940
and now you're bad to them?

987
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,820
And then eventually word would get around

988
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,740
that like, oh, don't do anything nice for him

989
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,420
cause he considers it a life debt

990
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,660
and then he'll like stock your house

991
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,420
and protect you from intruders and what have you.

992
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:34,820
That's good.

993
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,580
Cause then you can learn true independence

994
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,340
for once in your life, you know?

995
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,900
Cause the world's not going to give you things.

996
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,100
So people shouldn't give you.

997
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,020
Listen, the world is a cruel place

998
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,100
where people are constantly trying to convince us

999
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,340
that there are no unicorns, right?

1000
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,980
And so if everyone keeps holding the door open for you,

1001
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,220
you'll never learn to hold the door open for yourself.

1002
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,060
That's a good point, Travis.

1003
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,340
How do you even open doors?

1004
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,140
I don't know.

1005
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:02,100
Each one has a different sort of rule set about it.

1006
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,020
And it's like, can we just get,

1007
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,540
what's the deal with doors?

1008
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,620
Can we not just get together on this one?

1009
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,020
Some of them go out, some of them go in.

1010
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,500
You push, you pull, who even knows anymore?

1011
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,380
I saw a car door went up.

1012
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,740
Shut up, stop it.

1013
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,020
Roman Mars says that if there's a revolving door

1014
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,420
and you use the one next to it that isn't revolving,

1015
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,780
then you're a monster.

1016
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,620
Cause they're so efficient and great.

1017
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,540
Can I ask you a question, Justin?

1018
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,740
I've been meaning to ask you this for a while.

1019
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,620
Why don't you just go do a podcast with Roman Mars?

1020
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,940
If he would have me, I would love to get over there.

1021
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,420
I have a lot of good ideas for like,

1022
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:41,780
not like this show, but like his show, like smart stuff.

1023
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,420
You know what I mean?

1024
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,860
Like real thinkers.

1025
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,780
Not like, I can't stress this enough.

1026
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:49,860
Like, not like this show, but like smart,

1027
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,260
like erudite podcasting.

1028
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,180
That's, I feel like my true calling,

1029
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,260
where I really feel like my light's under a bushel.

1030
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,580
Justin, do you want to do like a weird backdoor pilot

1031
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,220
for smart stuff with Justin and Robin right now?

1032
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,260
And just like give us a topic you might discuss on smart stuff?

1033
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,300
Yeah, like what's the-

1034
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,100
I'll give you an example.

1035
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,620
And this would be like co-hosted by me and Roman, okay?

1036
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,940
So I'll kind of leave blanks for his part.

1037
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,700
I can do Roman.

1038
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,100
No, I'm just going to leave blanks for his parts, okay?

1039
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,300
You don't even want to hear my Roman?

1040
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,340
You can try later, but I'm just going to leave blanks for like-

1041
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,180
Hey guys, it's me, Roman Mars.

1042
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,380
I'm going to steal your brother.

1043
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:23,780
Got him.

1044
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,420
Okay.

1045
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:24,980
That's kind of-

1046
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,780
Now you just have to high five.

1047
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,140
So it'll go something like,

1048
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,500
it's kind of, remember, it's like an erudite kind of smart podcast.

1049
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,220
Like yeah, yeah.

1050
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:36,420
Like a podcast where you know the host knows the word erudite.

1051
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1052
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:37,860
That kind of thing.

1053
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,780
So here's kind of what it would go like.

1054
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:47,540
Okay, please.

1055
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,340
Hello, everybody.

1056
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,940
Welcome to Smart Stuff.

1057
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,740
I am your host, Justin McElroy.

1058
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,380
I'm joined as always today by Roman Mars.

1059
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,620
Roman, what smart thing are we discussing today?

1060
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,020
Uh-huh.

1061
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:00,580
Oh, I see.

1062
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,120
Uh-huh.

1063
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,600
Speak on that.

1064
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,100
Uh-huh.

1065
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,200
Huh.

1066
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:16,680
Now, did it-

1067
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,000
Oh, Roman really interrupts you a lot.

1068
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,280
Yeah, he's being a real turd.

1069
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,400
When's it Justin's time to shine?

1070
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,180
Huh.

1071
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,140
What?

1072
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:29,500
And then-

1073
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,500
Oh.

1074
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:37,420
Well, folks, that's all we have time for on Smart Stuff today.

1075
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:49,980
If someone can get Roman Mars to cut out this bit of the podcast and actually try and fill

1076
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,220
in the blanks there, that would be fucking stellar.

1077
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,140
So that'll be- but it'll be basically like that.

1078
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:54,860
Yeah, Smart Stuff.

1079
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,300
It's like our erudite.

1080
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:56,860
You know what I mean?

1081
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,220
Like smart.

1082
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:06,300
Has anyone made a companion podcast called 1% Visible that just fills in the rest of it?

1083
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:07,980
Just think about it.

1084
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,100
And it's just like, don't believe a word this guy says.

1085
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,140
These are fucking lies.

1086
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,100
Look at the sidewalk.

1087
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,060
It's just a sidewalk.

1088
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,180
Don't worry about it.

1089
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,500
It's hosted by Rip Taylor.

1090
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,180
It's like, look at all the things you can see.

1091
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:21,420
Buildings are big.

1092
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,060
Buildings are so big.

1093
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,780
Wait, no, mine was the guy from the B-52s.

1094
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,540
I apologize.

1095
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,420
I think I got into Fred territory as well there.

1096
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:34,380
And now my favorite recurring bit, chemtrails.

1097
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:44,540
1% Visible would be a very good name for a conspiracy theory podcast.

1098
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:44,780
Yeah.

1099
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,020
Look below the iceberg.

1100
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:49,020
It's more iceberg.

1101
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,500
You got another one star review on iTunes.

1102
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,780
Thanks, Rothschilds.

1103
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:58,700
Rothschilds, on to you.

1104
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,740
How about another Yahoo?

1105
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,020
Yeah, let's do a quickie.

1106
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,660
This one was sent in by Julie Kim.

1107
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:06,220
Thank you, Julie.

1108
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,500
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

1109
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,500
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

1110
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,220
No, I refuse.

1111
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,260
I'm going to refreshing.

1112
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:16,620
No, it's asked by Parbamall.

1113
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:21,020
It's a medicine I take for my neck.

1114
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,100
It's mostly larbamol.

1115
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:27,900
Yeah, Parbamall asks, how do I get back into the zoo?

1116
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,580
He's just passing by and asking you.

1117
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,100
He left the zoo accidentally.

1118
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,300
A funny story.

1119
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,300
I was at the zoo, saw some turtles.

1120
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,100
They were doing it.

1121
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,820
I looked around to see if there were any kids around.

1122
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,020
And when I saw none, I jokingly made some hip thrusting motions

1123
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,220
about three or four times.

1124
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,220
My friends thought it was funny.

1125
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,340
You had to be there, OK?

1126
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:52,780
No, I didn't.

1127
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,140
That's funny right now.

1128
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:54,700
That's good for me.

1129
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,540
No, you are painting me quite the word picture.

1130
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:00,780
Well, some security guard didn't and threw me and my friends out.

1131
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,020
Said not to come back for three months.

1132
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,620
Thought it was a bit of an overreaction.

1133
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,140
Should I just wait the three months out

1134
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,820
or actually go back and say something?

1135
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,340
There's a lot of good stuff here.

1136
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:14,780
There's no way that's true.

1137
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,740
Not to the degree.

1138
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:19,020
This is like, I think if we could push Parbam here,

1139
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,100
I feel like Parbam would be like, OK,

1140
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:25,500
when I said three or four times, maybe I meant like 40 or 50.

1141
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,020
Like, it was continuous.

1142
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,100
And I humped the security guard himself.

1143
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,620
It might have been a half hour of sustained humping motions.

1144
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:36,140
And like, there might have been a lot of kids around.

1145
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:40,380
Yeah, and also I was making like Jack Black sex hand motions.

1146
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,340
Like, you know the ones.

1147
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,580
And maybe I climbed into the enclosure

1148
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,420
and was doing it behind the turtles.

1149
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:46,700
With my dick out.

1150
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,060
With my dick out.

1151
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:48,860
Inside, inside.

1152
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,540
And maybe like a knife in my hand.

1153
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,380
The greatest fiction of this question

1154
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,740
is that the sort of person who would make

1155
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,660
suggestive hip thrusting motions at turtles having sex

1156
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,820
could also simultaneously be the sort of person

1157
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,380
that checks to make sure they're not children around

1158
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,420
before performing it.

1159
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,900
I want to make this hilarious ball and ball.

1160
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,180
Yeah, hmm.

1161
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:17,020
Any kids around that want to appreciate my hip sensibilities?

1162
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:21,740
These adult themes I'm about to joke about?

1163
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:22,140
No?

1164
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,500
Well, here I go.

1165
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,620
The character I like even more in this story

1166
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,540
is the security guard who says,

1167
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,620
well, looks like you're on a time out

1168
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,660
till you can learn not to make sex motions.

1169
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:34,380
Three months.

1170
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,340
So November 15th.

1171
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:40,380
I don't want to see you around here till November 15th.

1172
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:41,580
And then you can come back.

1173
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,780
Who's this person who's like,

1174
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,700
I want to go to the zoo more frequently than every three months.

1175
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,300
Well, now it's a thing.

1176
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,220
Like when the zoo's there every day

1177
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,980
and you can go anytime you never want to.

1178
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,220
But as soon as someone says, no, you can't,

1179
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,980
that's when you want to go to the zoo.

1180
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,220
Yeah, you want to bang out those quarterlies,

1181
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,180
but now you can't.

1182
00:51:59,180 --> 00:51:59,900
I mean, think about it.

1183
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,140
He's going to miss the birth of that baby turtle.

1184
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,580
That's what he wants to get back for.

1185
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,500
The live birth of the baby turtle.

1186
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,620
The live staged birth of the baby turtle

1187
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,780
and all the pyrotechnics that encompasses.

1188
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:13,100
Of this mistake and a half shell.

1189
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,580
What in what?

1190
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:18,860
Okay, one, I don't think those are

1191
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,020
within the powers of security guards.

1192
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,460
I don't think they could just hand.

1193
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,060
I mean, they can say it,

1194
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,740
but like, I don't think security guards

1195
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,580
just hand out bans like that.

1196
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,100
There's not a master list.

1197
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,780
Is there a zoo president who's like,

1198
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,780
no more, not for three months.

1199
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,540
I saw your dirty deed.

1200
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,060
So decreed.

1201
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,100
That's, I mean, that's fair.

1202
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,220
That's a good point, I guess.

1203
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,060
If anybody could ban you from the zoo.

1204
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,020
Here's the thing.

1205
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,900
I went to the Cincinnati Zoo about a month ago.

1206
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,660
I'm pretty sure not a fucker who was there

1207
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,100
that they could tell you my name.

1208
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,900
Like I wasn't like introducing myself to anybody, right?

1209
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,220
They're not checking IDs to bust you.

1210
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,820
Just go back to the zoo.

1211
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:00,620
How many, okay.

1212
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:04,380
What zoo has this comedian attended

1213
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,540
that has enough security guides?

1214
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:10,060
There's a security guard watching the turtle enclosure.

1215
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,380
What are you gonna do over there?

1216
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:14,220
Maybe this is a recurring problem.

1217
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,180
He just had enough.

1218
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,420
Listen, we know those two turtles like to fuck.

1219
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:17,980
We get it.

1220
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,380
The turtles fuck all the time.

1221
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,100
We get it.

1222
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,500
We cannot keep those two turtles apart.

1223
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,060
I know.

1224
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,260
That's a hard job to hire for, right?

1225
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,900
Because like the job duties involve spraying down

1226
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,140
these two turtles with a hose when they get too randy

1227
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,180
and too loud, man.

1228
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,060
Turtles yell.

1229
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:36,700
Problem is you really gotta be careful

1230
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,380
because I think there's like a 1% chance

1231
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:41,340
you will hire some sort of reptilian nasty boy

1232
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,820
who loves it, who loves this stuff.

1233
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,100
The thing is that both the turtles are guys

1234
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,020
and the guard is super conservative.

1235
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,260
So it's like, yeah, there's nothing funny about this.

1236
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,140
What's happening here.

1237
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:53,660
This is an abomination.

1238
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:00,540
You know, I think it is also a huge misjudgment

1239
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,340
of human nature that the sort of person

1240
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,900
that makes funny turtles having sex.

1241
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,220
I can't, I'm trying to be snide about it.

1242
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,180
I cannot think about a person doing this and not laugh.

1243
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,700
No, it's good stuff, man.

1244
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,580
It's funny.

1245
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:17,820
But I don't think that like, I don't think that you can tell

1246
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:21,740
someone like that that they have to change in three months.

1247
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,220
I don't think that you could just like tell the sun

1248
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,980
not to shine in that sort of sense

1249
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,380
and accept the person to like deny their nature.

1250
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,980
This guy's the Lenny Bruce of turtle sex hip motions.

1251
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,180
You know, he got dragged out.

1252
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,220
He's a martyr now.

1253
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:38,060
He's a hero to like everybody who's ever gone to the zoo

1254
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,420
and seen animals doing it.

1255
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:42,300
And they wanted to comment, but they know that like

1256
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,500
in our puritanical society, we're too uptight

1257
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,220
to acknowledge the fact that like, we're all animals.

1258
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,220
You know, we all do it, right?

1259
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,420
But this one, and I'll say it, hero.

1260
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:58,860
Like he was willing to be the voice

1261
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,020
that we all feel we don't have to say like,

1262
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,060
doing it's funny.

1263
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:02,700
I get it.

1264
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,580
Doing it's great.

1265
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:04,780
Doing it's great.

1266
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:05,260
That's me.

1267
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,940
I'm at the zoo just yelling at the turtles.

1268
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,140
Doing it's great.

1269
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,300
Is it possible you had a look on your face

1270
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,980
that made it seem as though you were pretending

1271
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,260
that you were up in there?

1272
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,620
That you were, it's just like turtle on turtle on you action.

1273
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,620
And you're like kind of having a little bit of a fantasy

1274
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,580
right there in the middle of the zoo.

1275
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,340
Cause I would probably pay somebody for that.

1276
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:21,820
I get it.

1277
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,340
If you didn't commit to the joke enough.

1278
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,220
Come back for three months.

1279
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,980
Cause I'm retiring in two and a half

1280
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,500
and I just don't want to deal with this.

1281
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,420
I can't handle this again.

1282
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,020
Thank you all so much for listening to our program.

1283
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:36,860
We hope you've had enjoyed yourself

1284
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:39,100
and had a pleasant time here in our company.

1285
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,020
Thank you for everybody who pre-ordered

1286
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,940
our card game monikers.

1287
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,020
You should have that in your hot hands

1288
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:48,940
by the holiday season.

1289
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,260
So we're really looking forward to that.

1290
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,900
Thank you for your support on that front

1291
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,860
because it was really, it was great.

1292
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:59,980
I wanted to say over the last like month or so,

1293
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,460
basically as I've been preparing to leave

1294
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,060
to move back to Cincinnati,

1295
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,380
I've been guesting on a lot of podcasts

1296
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,500
that everyone should go check out.

1297
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,660
I was just on an episode of join Jesse Goh

1298
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,420
that was so much fun to record.

1299
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,820
Like we all laugh with headaches from laughing so hard

1300
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:14,780
to go check that out.

1301
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,740
Did an episode of Alison Rosen is your new best friend

1302
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:18,780
that I had fun doing.

1303
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:23,260
Did the linoleum knife with Alonzo and Dave

1304
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,460
where we talked about movies

1305
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,700
and I gave my review of Pete's dragon.

1306
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:29,020
Like that just went up yesterday.

1307
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,420
Did less than live with Kate Leth

1308
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,260
where we talked about like comic books and stuff.

1309
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:37,980
Yeah, I did a whole bunch.

1310
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,780
I'll update travismaccroy.com to have a bunch of links

1311
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:43,180
to all the shows I did, but go check that out.

1312
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,740
I also wanted one more plug.

1313
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:48,060
We just changed the format of bunker buddies

1314
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,580
to make it a lot more like segments

1315
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:55,500
and trying out products and reviewing like survival food

1316
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,380
and that plus the interviews with guests

1317
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,860
and I'm a huge fan of our new format.

1318
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,860
And so if you've never checked out the show

1319
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,220
or if you checked it out and you're like,

1320
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,820
this is all right, but maybe it's not for me.

1321
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:09,340
I would love it if you could give it another shot

1322
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,260
and check it out and see what you think of the new format

1323
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,020
and then let me know what you think of it.

1324
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,020
You can find all our shows on mccroyshows.com too.

1325
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:17,820
We got a lot of programs that we make for you.

00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,580
You can also find a bunch of other great podcasts

1327

1328
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,500
Jesse Goh, like Travis mentioned,

1329
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,700
talking about shows like Can I Pet Your Dog

1330
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:30,780
and One Bad Mother and Baby Geniuses

1331
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,700
and Stop Podcasting Yourself.

1332
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,700
A bunch of good shows up on there.

1333
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,900
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1334
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,420
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1335
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:40,940
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1336
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:41,820
It's a good, good album.

1337
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,380
We appreciate them letting us use it for our theme song.

1338
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,460
And I wanna thank everybody who sent in questions

1339
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,300
for our CISO show that we're making.

1340
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,420
We are gonna start making that in September.

1341
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,500
We're actually gonna film it and stuff

1342
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,340
and do it and make the thing.

1343
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,420
And we're so excited about it

1344
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:03,580
and we're gonna have that for you real soon.

1345
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,500
And so go get up on CISO.

1346
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,500
Oh, Take My Wife just went up on CISO.

1347
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,340
That's Cameron and Rhea's show.

1348
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,460
It's fucking fantastic.

1349
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,100
There's a lot of really, really great stuff on there

1350
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,540
that you're really gonna love.

1351
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,940
And then we're gonna be on there pretty soon.

1352
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:20,060
So yeah, thanks, thanks for watching.

1353
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:20,860
Thanks CISO.

1354
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,300
And thanks everybody who sent in their questions.

1355
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,140
Excellent.

1356
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,540
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo for us to enjoy?

1357
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,820
This one was sent in by Aaron Keys.

1358
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:28,300
Thank you, Aaron.

1359
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:32,380
It's by Yahoo Answers user Houdman.

1360
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:32,860
Perfect.

1361
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,300
Houdman asks,

1362
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,900
Are old school fedora hats back in style

1363
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,860
for the upscale businessman or just for the fringe?

1364
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,620
My name is Justin McElroy.

1365
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,140
I'm Travis McElroy.

1366
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,180
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1367
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,380
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

1368
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,100
Kiss your dad.

1369
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,060
Square on the lips.

1370
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,260
Maximumfun.org.

1371
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,300
Comedy and culture.

1372
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,420
Artist owned.

1373
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,380
Listener supported.

1374
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:16,380
Going into a bullseye interview,

1375
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,260
I know it's somebody who does amazing work,

1376
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,860
but it's an actual conversation.
