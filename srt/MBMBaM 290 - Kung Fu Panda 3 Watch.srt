1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,640
Hello everybody, and welcome to a very special edition of My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,920
My name is Justin McElroy, and I'm your oldest brother.

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,280
My name is Travis McElroy, and I'm your middle-est brother.

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,680
I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy. Boys, the fucking energy is electrifying in the studio

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:11,520
today. That's because we're all on fire waiting for our chance to see Kung Fu Panda 3. America's

10
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,480
favorite panda, Poe, is back. He's joined by Bryan Cranston as Lee. Dustin, a galaxy of stars.

11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,480
A whole nebula of beautiful stars shining up there on the silver screen. I gotta say,

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,440
Kung Fu Panda 3 watch, it's been a while since we've had a watch before, yet, in a while. It's

13
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,880
been a while, and now here we are again, and I have to say congratulations Kung Fu Panda 3.

14
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,960
Didn't it come out like a month ago?

15
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,560
No, it's on right now. We're all waiting for our chance to see it.

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,160
I feel like I've been seeing previews for it for like two and a half years.

17
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,120
Oh, that's because they've got to build the heat, they've got to build the buzz. Travis,

18
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,120
in Hollywood, things are very competitive today.

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,960
Griffin, what can you tell me about what you know about the plot of Kung Fu Panda 3?

20
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,800
Well, following on the heels of Kung Fu Panda 2, the Dragon Shrine has been

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:10,720
disgraced by the ape colony, and they will have a big fight, and Lucy Liu is a snake in it, and she-

22
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:20,400
We seem to have lost Griffin, so fully pumped with the energy.

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,720
Guys, I just got so excited, this electrifying energy. My throat literally closed up,

24
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,280
and I couldn't breathe for a full 30 seconds.

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,000
Do you have your EpiPen? Your Kung Fu Panda 3 branded EpiPen?

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,560
Yeah, it shoots ramen broth into my veins.

27
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,840
That's the thing, right? That he is both a Kung Fu master and a chubster.

28
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,320
Is that the whole point of the three movies?

29
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,000
I am so excited about Kung Fu Panda 3. I have yet to watch one and two, but I really feel like

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,040
three is the one that's going to get me into this franchise.

31
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,240
Are you worried that you'll be lost, Justin, like when I just saw The Matrix 3?

32
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,920
A lot of people have been asking me,

33
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,440
Justin, is Kung Fu Panda 3 a good entryway to the series?

34
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,400
And as somebody who has not seen Kung Fu Panda 1 or 2, but is very excited about 3-

35
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,520
Also has not seen 3 yet, because again, gang, it's been out for a couple days.

36
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,280
Who's got the time?

37
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,760
Just haven't made it, but the fire is electrifying.

38
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,080
But my answer to that question is an unqualified yes.

39
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,480
This is the place for new fans.

40
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,480
I feel like a new generation is about to fall in love with Po, that beloved Kung Fu Panda.

41
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,320
I always like to believe that Kung Fu Panda 3 was a bit of a reboot for the series,

42
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,240
much grittier, much darker.

43
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,520
It's the first one to have an R rating.

44
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,640
The other ones really skirted it with a really hard PG-13.

45
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,960
Yeah, the Fu stands for fucking.

46
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,240
Yeah, and this is the first one that really leans into the original source material.

47
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,360
And if I get full frontal panda nudity-

48
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,760
Well, that's always been the whole franchise.

49
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,960
Panda don't wear pants.

50
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,760
Yeah, but this time you actually see his dong.

51
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,760
You can see his dong through the whole thing, I've been led to believe.

52
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,080
Haven't caught it yet, but do you think-

53
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,240
Well, they're not going to show it in the previews, Justin.

54
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,680
They're not going to give away the cow when you get the dong for free.

55
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:22,080
Oh my God, guys, right now, stop what you're doing and find a poster of Kung Fu Panda 3.

56
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,520
I'm going to drop a link for my brothers here in our Skype chat.

57
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,160
If you could just look at that poster real quick and imagine his dong was there.

58
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,680
It's the greatest poster that has ever been or ever will be.

59
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,360
I understand this is a visual gag.

60
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,080
It's too important.

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Okay, but no, yeah, it would be, yeah, it's literally him sitting.

62
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,120
He's got his legs spread, balancing between two pillars as what looks like six children

63
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,880
look up like perfectly where-

64
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,360
You know what?

65
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,520
You don't even need to have the dong on this poster.

66
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,760
There's six children looking up into either his dong or his asshole.

67
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,560
They can see through him.

68
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,880
The children in this poster are looking at his gaping butthole.

69
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,760
They're all baby burning underneath his gaping butthole.

70
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,680
One dude is literally mouth agape at his gaping butthole.

71
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,480
This spiritual sequel to The Human Centipede takes Poe in the role of the nutrient provider

72
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,280
and the baby pandas as those who are gobbling up the sweet, sweet food.

73
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,840
Are you reading this from the IMDB page, Justin?

74
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,160
Yeah, this is from the credits narration.

75
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,800
Oh, the scroll.

76
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,760
This is the scroll that goes up before the film.

77
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,360
I'm just so fucking excited to see this movie.

78
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,360
I'm so fucking excited to see Kung Fu Panda 3 as soon as I get the opportunity, gang.

79
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,880
I went to Hong Kong last year and I saw an actual panda and you know what I did?

80
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,160
I yelled fuck you at it because it's not my Poe.

81
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,680
I said not my Poe.

82
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,400
I'm most excited about Jackie Chan in the film.

83
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,680
Absolutely.

84
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,600
And is it live action Jackie Chan like Michael Jordan in Space Jam?

85
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,000
It's like Cool World, Jackie Chan edition.

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But if Jackie Chan dies in Kung Fu Panda 3, does he die in the real world?

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,480
Any world with Jackie Chan in it is a cool world.

88
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,120
It's like who framed Jackie Chan except nobody can because how are you going to stop him?

89
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,880
He just chopped that frame to bits, chopped it to matchsticks.

90
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,000
Hey Travis.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,800
Yes?

92
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,240
Rank them.

93
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,760
Good question, Justin.

94
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,520
I'm going to say one, two, and three.

95
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,920
You're counting.

96
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,040
Rank them.

97
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,880
Okay, two, three, and one.

98
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,040
And to provide some justification for your rankings.

99
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,320
Okay, well I'm going to say two because it's my favorite and then three because it's my

100
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,360
second favorite and then one because it's my third favorite.

101
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,240
Okay, perfect.

102
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,880
That's excellent.

103
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,240
Griffin, rank them.

104
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,480
Oh shit.

105
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,800
Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen, Kate Hudson, James Hong.

106
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,600
Oh.

107
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,520
Okay, fuck, marry, kill, Jack Black, Poe, Poe with Jack Black's head.

108
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,720
God.

109
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,400
Oh, well, I would probably fucking kill all of them.

110
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
We are just so excited about Kung Fu Panda 3.

111
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,320
Just so excited.

112
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,080
The electricity in the studio is electrifying.

113
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,240
We're on fire here for this film.

114
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,800
Bryan Cranston was a breaking bad and he could have done anything.

115
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,600
You know what he did?

116
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,280
Several things.

117
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
And then after those, do you know what he did after those?

118
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,320
A couple more.

119
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,600
And then you know what he did?

120
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,120
Kung Fu Panda 3.

121
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,680
Okay.

122
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,640
Actually, it says on his IMDB page, he ran out of things to do and started back at the

123
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,680
beginning again with Kung Fu Panda 3 because Bryan Cranston is a flat circle.

124
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,160
Bryan Cranston wept because there are no more countries to conquer.

125
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,880
He said, fuck it.

126
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,720
It's time for me to get up in the panda mix.

127
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,400
And so he did it.

128
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,160
Oh, God, I'm fucking raging hard on for this flick, guys.

129
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,520
Just like Poe.

130
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,880
Hey, let's go not to the money zone because we haven't earned that.

131
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,160
But let's do some advice.

132
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,360
Okay, sure.

133
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,160
Sounds good.

134
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,880
I guess I'll close this picture of Kung Fu Panda now.

135
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,400
Here's my first piece of advice.

136
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,080
Get a ticket today to go see Kung Fu Panda.

137
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,360
See it in 3D.

138
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,320
See it in 1D.

139
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,480
You'll still enjoy it.

140
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,520
It's just a line.

141
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,000
It's just a line of changing color.

142
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,560
And sound, that glorious sound, which is like a fifth dimension because you'll be teleported.

143
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,080
Jesus, Justin, you're right.

144
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,480
What?

145
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,320
Sound is the fifth dimension.

146
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,480
Hey, why are we just now figuring this out?

147
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,240
You're welcome.

148
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
Gravity waves, shmavity waves.

149
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
I say go see Kung Fu Panda 3.

150
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,280
It's got gravity in it.

151
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,280
It's got gravity and it'll take you to the sound dimension.

152
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,800
And it's got gravity toss.

153
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,680
It's got gravity toss.

154
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,120
It's so important.

155
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,000
So important.

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,280
So important.

157
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,240
I wish this movie had a smell so I could smell it.

158
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,480
Find the right theater.

159
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,040
Or the wrong one.

160
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,000
Hey.

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,280
Read a question.

162
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,840
Here's some.

163
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,360
I will read a question.

164
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,720
I'm just really excited right now about Kung Fu Panda 3.

165
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,240
You need a distraction.

166
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,120
Is that what it is?

167
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,800
Is it the 10 solid minutes of talking about Kung Fu Panda 3?

168
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,720
I'm not sure we've got the 10 solid minutes of expressing our excitement about Kung Fu Panda 3.

169
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,600
I'm using new recording equipment and I can't tell exactly where it started.

170
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,720
No, we're at 10.

171
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,480
Are we at fully 10?

172
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,160
Like I don't want to tell people.

173
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,680
Okay, let me say this.

174
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,720
Poe would never promise to use Kung Fu on someone and then not do it in front of an audience.

175
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,920
And vice versa, I don't want to promise 10 minutes of unadulterated Kung Fu Panda 3

176
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,120
excitement and then not deliver it in the final recording.

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,960
That's a great point.

178
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,920
So if there's anything, Griffin, any stitch of audio you think you might edit out from

179
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,360
the previous 10 minutes, please, please let me know.

180
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,520
The only part that I'll edit out is- I'll bloatgate more about the adventures of Poe and Ko.

181
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,040
Poe and Ko sequel.

182
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,800
The only part I'll probably edit out is where I talked about how this,

183
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,600
my excitement for this film had given me a raging hog.

184
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,160
Raging hog is my favorite of the Kung Fu Panda crew too.

185
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,600
He's like a mean old, mean old Mongolian pig man.

186
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,000
It's slippery snake, raging hog.

187
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,320
Hot cock.

188
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,320
Throbbing cock.

189
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
Throbbing cock.

190
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,600
Whistling clam.

191
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,400
Rabid weasel.

192
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,320
Listen, hey listen-

193
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,760
Penis, penis Tom.

194
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,200
This is unexpected and perhaps a little unprecedented in cinema,

195
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,000
but I am so excited about Kung Fu Panda 3 that I want a sequel to Kung Fu Panda 3.

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,120
I don't want Kung Fu Panda 4.

197
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,280
You want Kung Fu Panda 3 2.

198
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,440
I want Kung Fu Panda 3 2.

199
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,840
Yes.

200
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,800
Is that possible?

201
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,600
Cool.

202
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,480
Anything's possible in this crazy, weird, holly weird.

203
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,720
Okay, so I answer some questions now.

204
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,120
I'm just really, it's really hard for me to-

205
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Well, let's give it a try and we'll see like how it goes.

206
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,440
If I offer a coveted ticket to an event for free to someone,

207
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,520
how long should I give them to respond?

208
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
I had someone him and Hoffer weeks before-

209
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,760
Before taking the ticket to Kung Fu Panda 3.

210
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,480
That's what the ticket, why did it have to be about a ticket?

211
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,600
Because now I can think about is, let me just,

212
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,840
I'll just insert it so my mind doesn't wander, okay?

213
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:14,800
Okay.

214
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,240
I'm watching a trailer in another window.

215
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,600
Let me just pause it, hold on.

216
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,240
Wait, I've got three of them going simultaneously.

217
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,000
So let me put a different part.

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,360
So they're looping endlessly.

219
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,240
Let me just pause.

220
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,360
Okay, okay, okay.

221
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,960
All right, I got them all close.

222
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,280
Well, minimized so I can still hear them.

223
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,360
If I offer a coveted ticket to Kung Fu Panda 3

224
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,720
for free to someone, how long should I give them to respond?

225
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,640
I had someone him and Hoffer weeks before

226
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,200
giving me a response about going to Kung Fu Panda 3

227
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,680
with a free hotel room provided.

228
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,240
Oh man.

229
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,360
Now to be fair.

230
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,680
To be fair here.

231
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,200
That movie is so good, it really took it out of me.

232
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,560
I need to go to sleep right now.

233
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,080
Well, we provide hotel rooms.

234
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,800
To be fair, that is, it was actually regarding Comic-Con

235
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,920
and a free hotel room, hundreds and hundreds of dollars

236
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,640
as opposed to the 12.95 to see Kung Fu Panda 3.

237
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,680
In 2D?

238
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,200
I mean, you're gonna be paying, okay.

239
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,480
You pay extra for 2D?

240
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,320
Yeah, I would.

241
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,520
How many D's you want?

242
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,640
You're gonna get them all in Kung Fu Panda 3D.

243
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,560
Another friend waited a week to tell me

244
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,880
they couldn't make it to a music festival.

245
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
That's from Irritated Altruist.

246
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,720
So this is crazy.

247
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
First of all, Comic-Con with a free hotel room

248
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,360
is, that's what, like a G?

249
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,840
That's like one stack easily?

250
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,080
Yeah.

251
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,760
That's like great.

252
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,800
That's an enormous thing to give to somebody for free.

253
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,280
If they're not like shoot from the hip and be like,

254
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,360
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

255
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,120
A thousand dollars, thank you, yes.

256
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,800
At the very least, they could take it and resell it

257
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,840
and get that stack.

258
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
I feel like you're so within your rights

259
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,720
after like three days to just say like,

260
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,240
hey, I need to hear back on this.

261
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,320
If you can't do it, I'll ask someone else.

262
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,600
I think you can grindstone a little bit.

263
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,440
It's worth, if there's a value on it,

264
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,840
I think it's worth giving them a timetable

265
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,880
when you make the offer.

266
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,960
If there's any hemming and hawing, just say,

267
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,200
hey, I need you to let me know in like three days

268
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,360
because if not, I'm gonna get somebody else to go with me.

269
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,560
And because I think that offering a timeline later,

270
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,960
it feels like, I think that you're,

271
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,000
I think it makes you seem desperate for like,

272
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,840
considering the fact that you're giving someone a gift,

273
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,960
you shouldn't have to do that.

274
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,720
You shouldn't have to establish a timeline later.

275
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,520
They should just be accepting it, going for it.

276
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,880
And there's a really, you get to use the sentence,

277
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
I really need to figure this out,

278
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,120
which is a really official sounding sentence,

279
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,280
but doesn't actually imply any kind of consequences.

280
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,240
It's not like, I got Jim breathing down my neck, man.

281
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,480
I really gotta figure this out.

282
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,720
So if after like three days, you can just be like,

283
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,240
yeah, I really need to get this figured out.

284
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,120
Are you able to go?

285
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,000
Cause if not, I need to like figure something else out.

286
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,440
You know what?

287
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
I'm about to tell a pretty hard line on this.

288
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,360
You give them 30 fucking seconds.

289
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,800
This is a $1,000 trip I'm offering to take you,

290
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,320
my best friend, Kyle, to.

291
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,200
You have 30 fucking seconds to make up your mind

292
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,600
because this is a wonderful opportunity.

293
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,720
And if you don't jump at it now.

294
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,060
Okay.

295
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,240
When someone asks me if I wanna do something,

296
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,440
when I say, let me look at my schedule and figure it out,

297
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,040
I'm lying.

298
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,920
Almost all the time, I'm lying.

299
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,600
I think everybody is, right?

300
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,120
Like if you're into something,

301
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,600
and you're like into it right away, you just say yes.

302
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,960
And the other things are like,

303
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,160
they'll figure it out around that.

304
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,240
If I say, let me think about it.

305
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,040
Let me look at my schedule.

306
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,880
What I'm saying is, let me talk to my wife

307
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,600
and see if she can help me cook up a pretty good lie

308
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,360
for why I can't go to your thing.

309
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,320
Like she won't let me lie,

310
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,720
but she'll help me come up with a reason why I can't.

311
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,320
Because I need that sometimes to help sort through these things.

312
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,760
Or my wife will convince me,

313
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,840
hey, this is something you should probably do.

314
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,880
It'd be good for you to do it.

315
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,800
But either way, it means let me talk to my wife about it.

316
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,600
I don't need to talk to my wife.

317
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,120
And that's not necessarily a reflection on you,

318
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,200
the question asker, whether they wanna go with you.

319
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,240
Sometimes just committing to something in the future

320
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,640
like gives me such panic attacks of like,

321
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,920
yeah, but what if something happens?

322
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,160
But what if like in a month, somebody tells me

323
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,440
I need to do blah, blah, blah.

324
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,080
You know what I mean?

325
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,440
Like, it's not always like,

326
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,280
oh, I don't wanna go with Joan.

327
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,800
Sometimes it's like, okay,

328
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,680
but like, do I wanna commit to something three?

329
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,560
Like I sat on like buying concert tickets

330
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,920
for like 20 minutes just going, but who knows the future?

331
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,720
I did the opposite.

332
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,120
I accidentally bought 17 tickets to Carly Rae Jepsen

333
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,920
this coming weekend.

334
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,120
You just kept clicking?

335
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,640
I just kept doing it over and over again.

336
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,720
Cause I was like, what if I lose the first 16?

337
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,840
What would you rather have?

338
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,360
Would you rather have someone him and haw for like two weeks

339
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,280
or have someone say yes immediately

340
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,400
and then like a week before the event be like,

341
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,960
hey, I can't go and now you're fucked.

342
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,320
Oh, that's a good point, Travis,

343
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,040
because the side effect of them answering too quickly

344
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,840
might be that they have to bail and that's the worst, right?

345
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,400
Yeah, so I feel like you have to find a balance

346
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,440
between those two of like, here's your timeline.

347
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,400
So it gives me enough time to ask other people

348
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,160
because especially if it's like, listen,

349
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,000
it's four months till Comic-Con or whatever,

350
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,640
I need an answer and then versus like, okay,

351
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,200
well I have three days till Comic-Con to find someone else

352
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,320
to go with now.

353
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,040
I tell you if you, oh, sorry, go ahead, Griffin.

354
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,960
I'll tell you if you really wanna get good

355
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,320
at making these kinds of distinctions,

356
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,240
plan a wedding, cause that is literally

357
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,880
just like 150 times.

358
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,800
Just like, hey, you wanna come get like fucked up

359
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,200
and eat some sick food and dance to some dope tunes

360
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,640
with me and my newly betrothed.

361
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,440
And then you'll get like, let me sit on that

362
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,080
for a month and a half.

363
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,040
Oh, the happiest day of your life?

364
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,240
Let me just sit on that.

365
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,680
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll totally be in there.

366
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,760
Yeah, totally, five days before the event.

367
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,200
Can't make it, guess you have to throw that food

368
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,160
in the yard.

369
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,560
Guess you have to pour that wine down the toilet.

370
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,160
I think the better approach is to not ask people

371
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,880
way out in advance because for me,

372
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,600
the likelihood that I'll accept an offer like this

373
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,800
actually grows as it gets close to the event

374
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,200
because then I think it starts to take on the fun

375
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,080
of spontaneity.

376
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,080
One time I was going to a murder mystery

377
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,840
with a bunch of friends and I had two friends

378
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,760
who had an illness in the family

379
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,800
and they had to bail like 24 hours before.

380
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,760
And my friend Michael Beck lives in Indiana

381
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,240
and I called that thug the morning of and said,

382
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,360
hey, get in your car and start driving to Ohio.

383
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,520
You're going to a murder mystery this weekend.

384
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,040
And that dude did it.

385
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,160
He found an Ascot and that weekend he ended up running

386
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,000
from a guy in a werewolf costume.

387
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,840
So these things do pan out sometimes.

388
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,280
Wait, what?

389
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, it was a whole crazy story that we'll have to tell.

390
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,760
It's the most scared I've ever been in my entire life.

391
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,720
Okay, no, but I don't want us to get too deep into it,

392
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,920
but I do want to say like,

393
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,280
that's not a good murder mystery.

394
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,880
The werewolf done did it.

395
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,800
The werewolf was a rogue member.

396
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,560
He was not associated with the company

397
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,520
putting on the murder mystery.

398
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,000
He was, if you will, a lone wolf.

399
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,960
Yeah, okay.

400
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,800
And he scared me in a gypsy camp

401
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,480
and I ran silently through the woods.

402
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,200
I ran into a tree, but he could not find me.

403
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,400
I was very proud of myself.

404
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,000
You cover your tracks.

405
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,040
You put them in a tiger pit.

406
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,120
The one last thing I want to say about this.

407
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,720
I also pretended that a gun I had

408
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,560
had magical wolf killing powers

409
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,000
because once a werewolf shows up,

410
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,120
you're playing Calvin Ball.

411
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,720
The rules of the murder mystery done fell away.

412
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,400
The best laid plans of mice and men

413
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,560
just go straight down the turret

414
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,080
when a werewolf rolls up.

415
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,880
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

416
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,880
Can I take a quick sidebar?

417
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,080
Yeah.

418
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,760
It's not about Kung Fu Panda 3.

419
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,280
That's not true.

420
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,480
Though it is about cinema.

421
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,760
I would say now top three discussions

422
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,920
that we've had on My Brother, My Brother, Me

423
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,120
and we never circle back around to things on this show.

424
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,920
It is actually a part of the DNA of this program

425
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,120
that we never look back.

426
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,680
No, it is a linear march through time.

427
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,360
We had our necks removed.

428
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,160
But I have to say the conversation

429
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
that we've gotten perhaps the most,

430
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,840
at least top three feedback

431
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,760
in the entire history of this show

432
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,520
has been our conversation about Travis's experience

433
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,880
watching Night at the Museum crew with three mics.

434
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,840
Folks, we had like Freddie Wong,

435
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,280
who is an actual person

436
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,040
who is making video professionally

437
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,240
create a fabrication, a lie to support Travis's story.

438
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,320
There are people creating fake web pages.

439
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,280
There are people who reshot Malcolm in the middle scenes

440
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,960
to try to justify it.

441
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,120
Frankie Munoz came out of retirement

442
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,800
to shoot Malcolm in the middle scenes.

443
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't know who the fuck,

444
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,440
like who's leading this worldwide Illuminati conspiracy

445
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,120
just to troll me and Justin.

446
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,360
And the crazy thing is everybody's been saying like,

447
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,640
Travis, you've been vindicated.

448
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,800
I also thought I was making it up.

449
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,120
Yeah.

450
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,040
I also believed it was a fever dream

451
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,360
brought on by Ben Stiller's amazing performance

452
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,400
in Night at the Museum.

453
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,920
In case you didn't listen last week,

454
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,360
Travis on Night at the Museum 3

455
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,400
and could swear that the film was framed in such a way

456
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,080
that he was seeing like boom mics

457
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,280
and stuff through the entire page.

458
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,800
Well, let's not rewrite history.

459
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,080
It's Night at the Museum 1.

460
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,120
I have never nor will ever see Night at the Museum 3.

461
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,160
They know what they did.

462
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,960
Let me just say this

463
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,480
because the thing we've heard is

464
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,120
there's a thing called

465
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,520
according to this fucking worldwide conspiracy thing

466
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,800
called open matting

467
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,560
where the fucking projectionists

468
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,240
are apparently supposed to put up the letter box around it.

469
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
And if they don't put it up right,

470
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,880
you see the wires and shit.

471
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,440
That's the joke we said on the thing.

472
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,840
That's the most ridiculous thing ever.

473
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,400
People would film this shit and be like,

474
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,240
uh, cameraman, are you sure?

475
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,520
Because there's like-

476
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,640
Yeah, some 18 year old drunk kid will take care of it.

477
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,840
Yeah, don't worry guys.

478
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,320
We got it 90 yards down the field.

479
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,520
Drunk Brian,

480
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,240
drunk 16 year old Brian's gonna get it the rest of the way.

481
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,280
He's gonna run it into the insert.

482
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,040
While he's playing with his nunchucks.

483
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,680
We put $6 trillion into the making of Avatar.

484
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,200
I think Brian's got it.

485
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,680
Do you think that if you saw Avatar like this,

486
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,880
that the bottom of the screen,

487
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,680
you'd just see like James Cameron's legs

488
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,520
as he's moving puppets around and shit?

489
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,880
You would see the Navis like,

490
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,120
like bottom of their torsos

491
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,480
and it's just not painted blue.

492
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,440
It's just like a regular fleshy torso

493
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,800
and like a regular non-blue genitals.

494
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,600
I'm not even wearing my Navi pants down here, guys.

495
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,320
Let's loosen up.

496
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,080
Casual Friday, Brian's got it.

497
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,040
You see the hand up Yoda's ass,

498
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,160
like making it talk.

499
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,480
Like this is the worst Star Wars I've ever seen.

500
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,920
And you see the puppeteer's other hand

501
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,480
like making a fake jerk off motion on the Yoda puppet.

502
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,360
Like, I get it.

503
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,560
Don't worry, Brian will get this.

504
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,160
What the fuck?

505
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,200
Holly weird.

506
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,520
Do you think if we open Kung Fu Panda 3,

507
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,760
we'll see like Jack Black underneath Poe?

508
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,800
Like doing the lines down here.

509
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,560
Just writing tenacious D lyrics.

510
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,720
Yeah, oh fuck.

511
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,400
So Travis was lying.

512
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,280
Please, please, please, please, please.

513
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,880
God, you're embarrassing yourselves.

514
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,520
And stop sending us these Malcolm in the Middle screencaps.

515
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,680
I mean, I love good Malcolm in the Middle jokes

516
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,360
as much as anybody, but fuck.

517
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,440
I don't think it's really glossy JPEGs

518
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,640
with Malcolm in the Middle.

519
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,400
You can just zip those right over to my inbox.

520
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,840
Yeah, just zip drive those up,

521
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,200
put them on a jazzy drive,

522
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,360
and just flip those over to us, please.

523
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,520
I will say there was one of these

524
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,760
that showed Dewey standing

525
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,600
and it's the most mental thing I've ever seen.

526
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,240
This weird Dewey homunculus

527
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,200
standing next to Frankie Muniz.

528
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,160
Holy shit.

529
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,960
Yeah, it's as though someone was-

530
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,280
What was the kid who played Dewey doing

531
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,000
that you couldn't be in that shot?

532
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,800
Yeah.

533
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,680
Is it on me?

534
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,760
No, then I'll be in my fucking trailer.

535
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,800
Get Dennis out here.

536
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,280
And listen, if you guys get the matting wrong,

537
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,640
I'll fucking kill you.

538
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,440
I have it in my contract.

539
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,320
I'm Dewey, damn it.

540
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,160
It's as though someone is filming Malcolm in the Middle

541
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,960
and behind them,

542
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,800
someone is sweeping Malcolm in the Middle.

543
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,040
Like they're creating their own Malcolm in the Middle fan film

544
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,880
directly in the same shot.

545
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,840
This one was sent in by Morgan Davey.

546
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,400
Thank you, Morgan.

547
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Wade, who asks,

548
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,480
can anyone recommend some good weightlifting music?

549
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
I'm making a playlist of workout songs

550
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,720
for my high school weight room

551
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,880
and I need some great heavy metal songs

552
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,600
with great pump-up riffs and heavy drums.

553
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,120
Nothing from the 80s, please.

554
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,880
Late 90s to modern day, please.

555
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,560
YouTube links would be appreciated.

556
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,640
No rap, pop, hip hop, or techno.

557
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,800
Nothing from the 80s?

558
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,760
Go fuck yourself.

559
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,960
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of restrictions on here

560
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,880
that this person can go fuck themselves about.

561
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,680
Does weird outfit into this?

562
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,360
Now, explain.

563
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,200
I think they would make really good pump-up jams.

564
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Yes, okay, I respectfully disagree.

565
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,440
Fair enough.

566
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,280
What about, when were the Scorpions?

567
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,440
They're actually, they're modern day.

568
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,720
They're describing like once,

569
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,040
it's like they want you to back into one song.

570
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,360
Like they have one song in mind.

571
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,120
Across my weightlifting bridge,

572
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,960
you must answer this riddle.

573
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,360
How about this?

574
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,600
If you're trying to get sick gains,

575
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,880
then might I recommend Chris Gaines?

576
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,440
The heaviest of metals.

577
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,160
Fuck heavy metal.

578
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,680
No, let's put that restriction in the garbage

579
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,000
because if that's the case, then we're not gonna get anywhere.

580
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,080
We know how to get this person's sick gains

581
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,880
better than anybody.

582
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,600
And that is to listen to the sweat pumping,

583
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,920
muscle grinding, rock riffs of Chris Gaines.

584
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,920
That was the whole point of Chris Gaines, right?

585
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,760
Because Garth Brooks said,

586
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,320
okay, well, I can't do the heavy rock that I want to.

587
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,480
So he Stefan Erkeld himself and made Chris Gaines.

588
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,280
So Chris Gaines could do the rock anthems

589
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,200
that he had been dreaming of.

590
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,040
The greatest regret of my life

591
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,080
is that this program was not in production

592
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,600
while the Chris Gaines saga was unfolding.

593
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,240
Oh, Jesus.

594
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,520
My dream actually, I want our max fun bonus episode

595
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,320
to be a alternate reality episode

596
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,520
released the week that Chris Gaines is like on SNL

597
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,640
and behind the music.

598
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,880
And can you imagine while it's happening?

599
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,320
Because I am so sad that I was not talking.

600
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,040
Do you know that this fool said Chris Gaines

601
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,480
was from Australia?

602
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:30,080
Can you imagine being in his management entourage group

603
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,880
when fucking G Brooks is like, guys, I've got it.

604
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,160
Guys, guys, got this sick idea.

605
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,000
He said he's from Australia.

606
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,240
First off, you're not only locking yourself

607
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,600
into like making this alter ego.

608
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,040
If you do an interview, you have to,

609
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,320
like Garth Brooks is like,

610
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,800
oh fuck, they have, they talk different, don't they?

611
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,200
Shit.

612
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,840
Okay, hold on.

613
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,480
Give me a second.

614
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,440
Let me try to cook.

615
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,800
Shrimp on the barbie.

616
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,440
Like Garth, no.

617
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,680
Hello there, it's me, Chris Gaines.

618
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,320
No way, Garth Brooks.

619
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,840
Can I pivot a little bit?

620
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,080
Why do people work out?

621
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,400
Why do people get those sick gains

622
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,040
to get those fucking glistening fish lifters?

623
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,560
I'm only calling them Chris Gaines from now on, by the way.

624
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,320
All I want in the gym is Chris Gaines.

625
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,760
Is it to impress people that they would like

626
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,760
to engage in sexual Congress with?

627
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,360
That's probably part of it, right?

628
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,760
But there's a lot of different ways that you can do that.

629
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,120
I think for the most part, it is an intimidation, right?

630
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,880
You make yourself bigger to scare.

631
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,040
I mean, this is basic wilderness shit.

632
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,080
You make yourself big to scare off a predator.

633
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,360
So you wanna make yourself big

634
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,600
so you can intimidate people and get fucking power plays

635
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,240
all over the place.

636
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,400
If that's the case, I think you carry that whole aesthetic

637
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,640
over to the gym while you're trying to get Chris Gaines.

638
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,200
To that extent, why not just put on a song on a big speaker

639
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,120
that's just gonna sort of freak everybody out

640
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,760
while you're getting your gains

641
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,440
and sort of attract attention to yourself

642
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,360
and you are enjoying it and getting Chris Gaines

643
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,040
to a song that maybe people don't understand

644
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,000
and maybe they're scared of that.

645
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,720
Maybe just say anything, the whole thing,

646
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,960
and you're just lifting the speaker over your head

647
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,880
and that's how you're doing your curls.

648
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,400
You're getting your Chris Gaines

649
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,920
by blasting Chris Gaines over your head and just screaming.

650
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,600
Chris Gaines is too obvious a choice.

651
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm saying we keep it weird.

652
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,880
I'm saying what about you're doing some deadlifts

653
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,000
to the theme song to the cartoon show Bobby's World.

654
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,680
Okay.

655
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,920
You're like crunching it

656
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,080
and you've got a lot of crunching some bars

657
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,960
and it's just like, oh, fuck yeah.

658
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,760
Oh yeah.

659
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,480
Some big gains today, boys.

660
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,880
Sounds like a guy masturbating to Bobby's World theme.

661
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,640
Yeah, it can be both.

662
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,080
Yeah, with 61.

663
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,320
It is kind of a, I mean, I will say this.

664
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,600
It's kind of a horrifying theme song.

665
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,640
Like it's kind of really scary.

666
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,600
Out of context, it's very like Tim Burton's clown nightmare.

667
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,080
Yeah, if you slowed that down like a half beat,

668
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,440
I think you would have something very, very terrifying.

669
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,880
Put it in like a minor key

670
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,080
and then you just hit the fucking everyday fitness

671
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,880
and get some fucking fish lifters.

672
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,160
What if you just played books on tape over the sound system?

673
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,600
What book?

674
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,000
What book?

675
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,400
What book?

676
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:26,720
What book?

677
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,120
What book?

678
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,680
This is good.

679
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,760
This is Travis to really stick.

680
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,400
Okay, yeah.

681
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,520
Eat, pray, lift.

682
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,960
Like that, pray, lift.

683
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,800
Dear God, please let me get gains today.

684
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,600
Oh, thank you.

685
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,040
Will you please, I've told you this before,

686
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,160
don't pray with your mouth full.

687
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,920
It's rude to me, it's rude to God.

688
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,280
You want to go to the Money Zone?

689
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:54,960
Hell yeah.

690
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,720
If you want to see a great website, maybe the best one ever,

691
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,880
go to mackleroyshows.com

692
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,480
and you're going to see a modern work of like art,

693
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
I guess art, maybe, is it?

694
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,040
Yeah, art.

695
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,600
It's art and science.

696
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,200
And commercialism and capitalism and like big business

697
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,520
and fuck boys, we sold out.

698
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,400
We did it.

699
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,080
Travis, how hard was it to make a site with Squarespace?

700
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
Honestly, Justin, and I'm not just saying this

701
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,840
because they are our sponsors this week,

702
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,960
it was the easiest fucking thing in the world.

703
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,360
And not just easy to do, but easy to make look really nice

704
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,280
because they had amazing templates.

705
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,040
And it was a lot of it was just like,

706
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,560
okay, I'm going to type in this thing.

707
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,880
And then they took that information

708
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,320
and turned it into a really polished sharp looking website.

709
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,000
We've got a website that I can't recommend it enough

710
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,240
how much I loved working with Squarespace

711
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,480
and how many compliments I've gotten on it.

712
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,640

716
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,520
I want to talk about me undies wearing them right now.

717
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,040
I've got those lounge pants.

718
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,720
It is like a blanket.

719
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,160
Did you get those Keith Haring Valentine's Day designs?

720
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,400
Of course, I got those Keith Haring Valentine's Day designs.

721
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,840
I wore them and I felt, can I just say something?

722
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,760
And this may turn some people off.

723
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,120
I felt sexy all day.

724
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,440
I felt-

725
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,680
I'm more worried it may turn some people on.

726
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,640
I'm not worried about that at all.

727
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,480
I felt grown sexy.

728
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,520
I felt-

729
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,320
You're a grown boy.

730
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,800
I felt terrific like a grown sexy lad.

731
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,760
Like Poe in Kung Fu Panda 2 when he finally-

732
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,680
Except with your dong covered.

733
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,640
Yes, please.

734
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,760
Nothing can describe the fit and feel of me undies.

735
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,320

736
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,920
the world's most comfortable underwear

737
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,320
and you have to experience them for yourself.

738
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,480
Every single week we hear from listeners

739
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,640
who finally took the plunge and got the me undies

740
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,320
and they're never going back.

741
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,160
When I wear non me undies, I feel like a criminal.

742
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,040
That should go to jail.

743
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,480
I feel like I should go to jail.

744
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,320
I feel like I've been like a bad lad.

00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,120
Oh yes, I love Photo Jojo.

762
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,360
The bad guy from fucking Powerpuff Girls?

763
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,560
No, that's his brother.

764
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,000
Okay.

765
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,200
Photo Jojo has photography gear for everyone

766
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,400
because everyone has a camera in their pocket these days.

767
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,640
From nifty little lenses that attach to your phone

768
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,880
to the latest instant camera from Polaroid.

769
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,160
Yep, they still make them.

770
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,640
To cute camera straps and backup phone batteries.

771
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,680
Go check out all this great stuff at photojojo.com.

772

Use the coupon code MIDDLIST to save five buckarinos.

775
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,880
Plus it took a lot to convince my coworkers

776
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,040
that this ad would be money well spent.

777
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,360
Show them I'm right, min-bam-binos.

778
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,360
The cutest thing they got is they have sort of a battery

779
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,120
that plugs into your phone to charge it up.

780
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,400
It's called apple juice,

781
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,160
and it looks like a little container of apple juice.

782
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,120
It's fucking adorable.

783
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,200
I think we, Teresa got that, right?

784
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,640
Photo Jojo sent us some cool stuff.

785
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,520
Teresa got the apple juice.

786
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,600
There's really like super cute stuff,

787
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,680
really neat accessories.

788
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,320
And like if you want to take better photos with your phone,

789
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,280
which is still a standard, you can do that by the way.

790
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,080
That's wild.

791
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,880
And not just phone stuff.

792
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,160
They have camera equipment too.

793
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,200
Photojojo.com, coupon code MIDDLIST.

794
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,960
Can I tell a quick little vignette?

795
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,680
Yeah.

796
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,000
I was at a wedding this past weekend in New Orleans,

797
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,040
and it was cute.

798
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,480
They had the guest book,

799
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,600
and then right next to the guest book,

800
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,680
they had like one of these instant Polaroid cameras

801
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,600
that take like the little pictures, little guys.

802
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,560
And then they had another book

803
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,000
that you would just like slide those into

804
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,520
and like write your names right next to your picture,

805
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,240
your little Polaroid selfie.

806
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,440
But we were like an hour into the wedding

807
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,960
and we realized nobody had used it yet.

808
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,400
And so me and Rachel were like,

809
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,600
well, the people who play in this wedding

810
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,800
probably like wanted people to do this.

811
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,400
So like, let's just like get it started.

812
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,600
So people will feel more comfortable.

813
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,240
And then we did it.

814
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,920
We took a picture of ourselves and put it in the book

815
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,640
and signed it.

816
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,040
And then like a half hour went by

817
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,120
and I started to get legitimately worried

818
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,040
that we would be the only people to do it.

819
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,680
And then our like wedding present to them would be like,

820
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,360
here's a book with a picture of us only in it.

821
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,400
Happy wedding.

822
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,360
It's the Griffin and Rachel book for us at your wedding.

823
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,560
It's us though.

824
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,920
It is us though.

825
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,280
It's your wedding, your special day,

826
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,640
but it's our fucking book.

827
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,640
Do you think about just filling it

828
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,320
with pictures of you and Rachel?

829
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,120
Didn't think about that,

830
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
which would be another fun gift for anybody.

831
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,960
Anybody would love that.

832
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,560
I got a message for Thomas

833
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,960
from Sierra Madden Puppy and Piggy.

834
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,080
It says, happy birthday.

835
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,120
I wrote you a haiku.

836
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,160
Here we go.

837
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,800
My dungeon master,

838
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,480
you are the Tom to my Gronk, Mandy Patinkin.

839
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,800
I feel like at the end they just needed,

840
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,720
they were maybe short on this.

841
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,440
Justin, everyone knows that in a haiku

842
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,960
you have to either have a reference to like spring,

843
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,840
the nature, weather, or Mandy Patinkin.

844
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,960
You're talking about Kigo.

845
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,640
Of course.

846
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,200
Yeah, I guess I am Griffin, but aren't we all?

847
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,880
The traditional Kigo are,

848
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,600
you know, they're relating to the current season.

849
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,320
So something like leaves, flowers, renewal, sunshine,

850
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,360
Mandy Patinkin, because fucking Homeland

851
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,240
is about to start up again.

852
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,040
People still on that tip, huh?

853
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,640
He's just, get one of his albums,

854
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,520
singing Broadway show tune.

855
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,480
Kidults, don't mind if I do buy a copy

856
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,320
of Kidults right now on Amazon,

857
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,600
cause I can't find mine.

858
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Probably cause I gave it to a dear friend.

859
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,520
And another exciting announcement.

860
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,800
I committed kidultry, unfortunately.

861
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,160
Everybody who has a question read

862
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,000
or a message on today's show

863
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,800

If you use it for anything else, I'll fucking know.

869
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,920
Wait, that's only if you have a question

870
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,160
right on the show, not if you just email Justin.

871
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,000
Yeah, no, if you have a question right on the show

872
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,280
or one of those messages from you,

873
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,800
then please let me know

874
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,120

and you gotta go fucking see it if I'm gonna do the thing.

876
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,040
I wanna see a ticket stub.

877
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,120
You guys said we wanna see pictures of you

878
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,000
at the movie theater.

879
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,960
I will end you.

880
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,000
Holding the ticket stub, torn ticket stub.

881
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,760
If you go fucking see Deadpool,

882
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,840
I'll spend all my days trying to burn.

883
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,200
I will salt the earth.

884
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,440
I will call your place of employment

885
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
and say horrible lies.

886
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,560
Don't think that you're gonna like outthink Justin

887
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,800
and say like, oh, I can think of a funnier thing

888
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,920
to do with this fan date.

889
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,240
No, there is nothing funnier you can do

890
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,360
than go see Kung Fu Panda 3

891
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,440
and then let Justin know what you thought of it.

892
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,360
This is an important question, Justin.

893
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,080
Will you be paying enough for them to see it in 3D IMAX

894
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,640
or just for your basic 2D version?

895
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,960
I'm not made of money, it's a basic 2D version.

896
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,200
This film is certified fresh, 81%.

897
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,200
Please stop fucking around

898
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,680
and go see Kung Fu Panda 3 in theaters now.

899
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,160
We are not in any way paid to do this.

900
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,840
I cannot make this clear enough.

901
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,440
This is not native marketing

902
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,040
or whatever the fuck it's called.

903
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,320
We're just fans.

904
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,400
We're just fans of Kung Fu Panda 3

905
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,640
despite never having seen one of the films.

906
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,000
I've seen the first.

907
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,320
I have seen, I think, an episode of the TV show.

908
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,480
Is that Jack Black or is that a Jack Black-alike?

909
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,160
I think it's probably just like his brother, Jack Brown.

910
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,520
You idiot.

911
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,520
Let's be honest, we live in a world with too much media.

912
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
You need a podcast on the front lines,

913
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,040
figuring out what's great.

914
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,000
We're here for you.

915
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,960
We're Pop Rocket.

916
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,160
I am Guy Branham.

917
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,360
I'm a comedian.

918
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,160
I'm Wynton Mitchell.

919
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,080
I call myself a digital strategist.

920
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,960
I'm Oliver Wang, academic and disc junkie.

921
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,200
Margaret Wappler, je suis es journaliste.

922
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,560
And we watch, listen to, and read everything

923
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,920
so that you don't have to.

924
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,280
And then we tell you about all the things

925
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,640
that you'll love to love.

926
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,600
Find us in iTunes or wherever you download podcasts.

927
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,160
Pop Rocket, every Wednesday from MaximumFun.org.

928
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,280
I'm a fashion student.

929
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,520
I love clothes and putting together outfits.

930
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,400
But like you often say, a ship in harbor is safe.

931
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,320
And sometimes I mess the heck up.

932
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,880
And if this happens in BD, I'll go change.

933
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
But my friends and fam now make fun of me

934
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,920
for times when they've seen me in two or three outfits

935
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,480
in a day.

936
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,840
I paint, sew, and go out pretty often.

937
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,560
So it's not just from sartorial floop ups.

938
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,840
My question is, how are people not doing this?

939
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,680
Are some people just okay with being uncomfortable

940
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,120
socially or physically with their outfits?

941
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,000
Do I have a problem?

942
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,360
Not currently in the nude in the North XX.

943
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,680
So this person will often change clothes

944
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,360
multiple times throughout the day.

945
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,640
Oh, okay.

946
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,440
Got it.

947
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,080
No.

948
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,440
I mean, no.

949
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,280
I have like a uniform basically.

950
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,080
You realize we're three Dugs.

951
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,320
Like basically three Dugs.

952
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,080
I got some t-shirts.

953
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,600
I got some jeans.

954
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,880
I got some cowboy boots.

955
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,760
And that's what I call my Travis.

956
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,080
That's all the accessories that come with the Travis doll.

957
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,840
I have never worn khaki pants where I did not first

958
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,560
have a thought, where the fuck are my khaki pants?

959
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,000
Like that's every time.

960
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,080
They were not at the ready.

961
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,880
Yeah, I do not have them like ready to go.

962
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,320
At this wedding I went to last weekend,

963
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,680
I brought my wedding wear.

964
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,280
And then I found out there was a cocktail party

965
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,560
the night before and was like, yeah,

966
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,680
you should wear something nice for that.

967
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,160
I was like, well, that's going to be a problem

968
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,160
because I have wedding Griffin and that's just it.

969
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,400
I don't have a cocktail party Griffin style.

970
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,000
I, Teresa was telling me her father has every day

971
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,240
that she's known him, when he gets home from work,

972
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,320
he immediately like walks in the door.

973
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,920
And the first thing he does is changes every stitch

974
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,560
of clothing to like his home wear.

975
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,560
And I love this, like socks, like everything.

976
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,320
He's doing it in the Japanese style.

977
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,200
Yeah, he's like sloughing off work

978
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,760
in a very physical real way that I think is a pretty cool move.

979
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,320
I don't get that move because I'm at home

980
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,000
in pajama pants all day.

981
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,160
So I can't be like, oh, another tough one.

982
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,120
Oh, the old rat race trying to put on some comfier clothes.

983
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,040
I wish I had the dedication to do that.

984
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,000
I wish that I did have, we've talked about this,

985
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,680
I mean, literally last week.

986
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,640
I wish I had the dedication to wear something

987
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,200
like more stern and restrictive

988
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,440
to just have that freedom at the end of the day.

989
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,040
You put on a tie every day.

990
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,800
It's important to note, I want to make it clear

991
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,240
that when I talk about my father-in-law,

992
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,080
he's not like changing into pajamas.

993
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,440
He gets home, he changes into other regular clothes

994
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,080
that you could then go out back into the world in

995
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,640
and then changes again for bed.

996
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,560
So he's like got work outfit, home outfit, sleep outfit.

997
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,880
I think that's pretty cool.

998
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,280
And his casual yukata, a kimono worn in the casual times.

999
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,720
I don't want to part the kimono,

1000
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,800
but that's what Travis' dad-in-law wears.

1001
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,880
Griffin, do you have another yahoo for us?

1002
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,320
Yes, how about this one?

1003
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,800
It was sent in by Level 9000 Yajuru Drew Davenport.

1004
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,840
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

1005
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,680
The Poe of Humans.

1006
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,440
Big, imposing, kind, loving, excellent at kung fu.

1007
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:57,920
Dick out.

1008
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,320
Dick always out.

1009
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,440
24 seven.

1010
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,200
24 seven dick out bonanza.

1011
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,880
I'm not going to tell him how to do his thing though

1012
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,640
because obviously he knows what's up.

1013
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,360
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

1014
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,160
It's by yahooanswersuser.

1015
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,560
Steffi who asks, please, I need to know how to start

1016
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,080
with Popeye the Sailor Man eulogy for my speech class.

1017
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,360
What?

1018
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,080
Please, I need the speech for this Monday.

1019
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,960
What?

1020
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,160
Please, Travis, I need to know how to start

1021
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,040
with Popeye the Sailor Man eulogy for my speech class.

1022
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,040
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1023
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,200
There's a very important distinction here.

1024
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,240
Please.

1025
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,640
Are you giving a eulogy for Popeye the Sailor Man

1026
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,200
or as Popeye the Sailor Man?

1027
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,120
As, guys, as hysterical as I think we could make the ladder

1028
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,560
with all of us doing our Popeye impressions

1029
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,680
and what have you.

1030
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,720
I think we should focus on the former, which is my dude.

1031
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,520
What has this motherfucker here?

1032
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,960
That's what we're doing.

1033
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,920
He got me clean.

1034
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,200
He got me clean right now.

1035
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,480
Popeye the Sponsor Man.

1036
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,840
I love him like a brother.

1037
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,880
I never told him.

1038
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,320
He was my real brother.

1039
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:18,560
My name is-

1040
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,880
He was my real, I'm Steven the Sailor Man.

1041
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,520
I'm Church's the Sailor Man.

1042
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,960
The Sailor Man.

1043
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,280
Oh, God.

1044
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,080
If our father, Pappy the Sailor Man were here today,

1045
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,480
but of course they haven't spoken in 36 years.

1046
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,760
And now it's too late.

1047
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,560
Now it's too late?

1048
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,040
Damn it, Popeye.

1049
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,240
The living years.

1050
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,200
Damn it, Popeye.

1051
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,880
Damn you.

1052
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,320
This is how you do me.

1053
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,240
You leave me like this, you son of a bitch.

1054
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,000
I mean, we know his cause of death, right?

1055
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,120
Bluto, who is like, Bluto's fucking huge,

1056
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,480
just killed him finally.

1057
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,400
Do you think Bluto's there?

1058
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,160
Do you think he had the fucking sheer balls?

1059
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,760
I'm sorry, Popeye.

1060
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,760
I didn't mean to.

1061
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,480
Didn't mean to.

1062
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,720
We were just doing our usual punch routine.

1063
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,320
I punched you and you went through the roof,

1064
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,400
only this time you hemorrhaged.

1065
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,840
I hit you through a horse,

1066
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,480
and then you got one of them big swelling lumps

1067
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,200
on top of your head and the horseshoe swung around it,

1068
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,520
but then you didn't get up again.

1069
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,760
I punched you till your brain stopped working,

1070
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,040
then I tried to pour the spin notch down your mouth

1071
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,880
and you choked on them.

1072
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,080
And the spittoon done fell on your head.

1073
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,200
No.

1074
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,440
Can you imagine anything funnier than seeing Bluto

1075
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,000
just like forcing the jaw of Popeye's car?

1076
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,520
Popeye's corpse up and down trying to help him mask it.

1077
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1078
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,840
Here I come, Bluto.

1079
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,200
I'm gonna get you real good.

1080
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,000
Everybody comes-

1081
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,240
He's strong to the finish.

1082
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,520
Everybody.

1083
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,640
Olive Oya got to help me scoop the spin notch down his throat.

1084
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,760
I love him.

1085
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,400
Everybody comes around and Bluto like lifts him up

1086
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,720
and puts his arm around him like,

1087
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,040
I know he's fine, listen.

1088
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,120
I'm Popeye the Sailor Man.

1089
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,440
Why are you moving his mouth, Bluto?

1090
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,160
That's terrible.

1091
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,680
Don't touch him.

1092
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,720
And Wimpy like shows up like five minutes late.

1093
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,240
He's like, hey, good news, everybody.

1094
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,440
I found a hamburger.

1095
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,440
And they're like, Wimpy not now.

1096
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,280
He realizes what happened and he's like,

1097
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,640
I wasn't here, I can't go back.

1098
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,840
I can't take this heat.

1099
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:38,800
I got people waiting for me on the inside.

1100
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,640
What if that wasn't his cause of death?

1101
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,920
What if he just ate some spinach?

1102
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,040
He was like, time to get real,

1103
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,280
wait, my arm won't stop growing, oh shit.

1104
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,240
And he's just like, Akira just like explodes.

1105
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,720
His body gets too diesel.

1106
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,040
And then soon he just like starts rapidly expanding

1107
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,600
until he completely consumes Neo Tokyo.

1108
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,120
Let me paint you a picture.

1109
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,440
He goes in for his yearly checkup physical

1110
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,920
and the doctor's like, Popeye, I can't say it enough.

1111
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,360
I won't tell you again.

1112
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,760
You have to knock it off with the spinach.

1113
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,040
Your body is 92% spinach at this point.

1114
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,880
I don't know how much more of this you can take.

1115
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,960
If you change again, you might never come back.

1116
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,200
And Popeye's like, okay.

1117
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,040
But then one day he sees an injustice

1118
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,280
and he goes for that spinach and he's like, I can't.

1119
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,720
I can't, but the city cries out, Popeye, Popeye.

1120
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,680
And he does it knowing it's the end.

1121
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,520
And he goes out Akira just like he always dreamed.

1122
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,600
Okay, that wasn't so much funny

1123
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,760
as much as it was like pretty good fan fiction.

1124
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,080
I'm trying to pitch that.

1125
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,960
If anyone's listening,

1126
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,240
if you've got, it will be a multi-million dollar production.

1127
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,880
I'm thinking it'll be like a Pixar level.

1128
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,840
Oh, see, I was thinking like a Christopher Nolan Batman flick

1129
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,560
where Bluto, is it Bluto?

1130
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:55,920
Yeah, yeah.

1131
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,800
It would be like Bane.

1132
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,920
Pluto is Mickey's dog.

1133
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,720
Well, this will be the first dark Pixar movie.

1134
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,960
I'm thinking like a Pixar cartoon with like a hard PG-13.

1135
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,560
So if anyone's looking to invest,

1136
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,000
I've got a Kickstarter going for a million dollars.

1137
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,960
You can get a producer's credit for $2 million.

1138
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,960
You can come to the animation studio.

1139
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,560
It does start at a million dollars.

1140
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,120
Okay.

1141
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,080
For $13.95, you can go see Kung Fu Panda 3

1142
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,240
and just like save your fucking time

1143
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,040
because you'll never want to see another movie after that.

1144
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,640
Hey folks, that's going to do it for us.

1145
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,400
I want to say two things.

1146

So fucking good.

1155
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,680
And Lin, thank you for probably accidentally kicking off

1156
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,320
like a full-blown Illuminati deep dive

1157
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,880
into your whole life history

1158
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,200
by the people who are desperately looking into the Freemasons

1159
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,040
and like the triangles and all that shit

1160
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,000
with your secret my brother, my brother, and me gesture.

1161
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,480
And I don't want to, prying eyes.

1162
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,680
If you know it, you know it.

1163
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,480
If you know it, you know it.

1164
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,360
If you don't know it-

1165

Join our Facebook group.

1166
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,840
Join our fucking Facebook group.

00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,400

You can also find our now defunct retired shows.

1177
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,600
I also want to say I'm launching a new podcast pretty soon

1178
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,880
because I get bored and generate new podcasts constantly.

1179
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,200
What?

1180
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:55,760
It's too many.

1181
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,160
It's a lot of podcasts, Travis.

1182
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,560
It's all I've got and I love it very, very much.

1183
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,360
But this one's called Interrobang with Travis and Tybee.

1184
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,960
You can find it on macroshows.com.

1185

1187
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,680
I'm actually really happy about this

1188
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,280
because it makes it even on the website.

1189
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,760
Now there are three columns of six.

1190
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,960
That makes me really happy.

1191
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,520
We're also really excited because this is the week

1192
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,240
that we're moving Trends Like These over onto MaxFun.

1193
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,240
So if you haven't checked out Trends Like These yet,

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,200
go check that out.

1195
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,000
Go check out Still Buffering on MaxFun.

1196
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,200
Yep, they just did.

1197
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,280
Oh my God, the new episode of Still Buffering,

1198
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,480
which is about my wife Sydney and her sister Riley who's 15

1199
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,760
and them like explaining the teen life then and today.

1200
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,640
There is a segment on today's show,

1201
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,880
an extended segment of the new episode about Instagram

1202
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,040
and her explaining Instagram and Snapchat

1203
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:49,520
that was like.

1204
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,720
Oh, I know everything there is to know

1205
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,920
about those two platforms.

1206
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,920
Well, you don't trust me.

1207
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,960
I thought I did.

1208
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,480
It is the most captivating listen of 2016

1209
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,280
as far as I'm concerned.

1210
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,400
I was losing my mind.

1211
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,280
It's fascinating.

1212
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,640
Go check out Rose Buddies that Griffin does with Rachel.

1213
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,760
I have never, well, I tried to watch an episode

1214
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,760
of The Bachelor and I made it about 20 minutes in,

1215
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,840
but I have never been a fan of The Bachelor,

1216
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,000
but I fucking love Rose Buddies.

1217
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,360
It's become my new favorite show.

1218
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,160
Thank you, Travie.

1219
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,800
And then also go check out Schmanner's

1220
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,000
that my wife and I do.

1221
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
We put out a Valentine's Day special

1222
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,760
that was all about like the history

1223
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,760
and customs of Valentine's Day,

1224
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,880
as well as another normal episode last week,

1225
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,520
all about being a house guest and hosting a house guest.

1226
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,560
So go check that out

1227
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,840
and then check out all the other amazing Maximum Fun shows.

1228
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,120
There's a ton on there.

1229
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,800
Thanks to John Roderick and the Lawn Winners

1230
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,920
for using their theme song,

1231
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,880
It's a Departure, off the album,

1232
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,760
Putting the Days to Bed.

1233
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,760
Yeah, it's a great album.

1234
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,320
You can get it on vinyl, get it on wax on Amazon.

1235
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,960
Sorry, Juice.

1236
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,280
Nothing.

1237
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,160
Did you have something else?

1238
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,320
No, just I love you.

1239
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,120
I love you.

1240
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,960
I love you guys, too.

1241
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,240
Do you guys realize that by the time

1242
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,360
we record this next episode,

1243
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,360
I will have seen Carly Rae Jepsen in concert

1244
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,040
and I will literally just be,

1245
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,600
I mean, I'm already blissed to light

1246
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,960
of a floating like piece of light consciousness

1247
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,200
just exploring the spiral galaxy

1248
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,240
and I'm just gonna stop by the ACL taping

1249
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,200
of Carly Rae Jepsen

1250
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,200
and I don't know what the next fucking level

1251
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,200
of consciousness is above that,

1252
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,320
but I'm really-

1253
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,800
You just wake up and you are Carly Rae Jepsen

1254
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,560
like being John Malkovich.

1255
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,520
Ooh, that'll be fun.

1256
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,440
Yeah, it is.

1257
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,560
It's pretty great.

1258
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,400
If I could say-

1259
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,160
I've been Carly Rae Jepsen for years.

1260
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,400
If I could say one sort of personal,

1261
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,880
more serious thing before we close

1262
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,200
and this isn't the sort of thing

1263
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,160
we normally talk about on the show

1264
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,320
and I didn't run this past you guys before,

1265
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:50,320
but sometimes we all have like struggles

1266
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,960
and I know that our listeners have expressed to us

1267
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,280
how our show has helped them

1268
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,480
and I know that like for future generations,

1269
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,920
everybody's gonna have things that they're going through

1270
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,160
and I don't mean to be oblique,

1271
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,280
but I don't know your struggles.

1272
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:11,680
But I wanna make sure that when my daughter comes of age

1273
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,760
and her daughter after her comes of age

1274
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,040
and she has struggles or things she's struggling with in life,

1275
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,880
I wanna make sure there's a new Kung Fu Panda movie

1276
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,120
for her every time.

1277
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,280
Every generation needs its Kung Fu Panda movies

1278
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,440
and I feel like if we could all just go see

1279
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,280
Kung Fu Panda 3 this weekend,

1280
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,400
we can really guarantee that that continues to be.

1281
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,880
Do you wanna be the last link in the chain?

1282
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,720
I don't wanna be the last link in the Kung Fu Panda chain.

1283
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,000
And hey, why wait till the weekend?

1284
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,800
It's what I'm saying.

1285
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,680
It's Tuesday now.

1286
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,560
The ideal time to see any movie,

1287
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,800
everyone knows this, is 11 30 in the morning

1288
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,840
on like a Thursday.

1289
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,560
I know we don't usually get serious on the show,

1290
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,760
but I have something I'd like to talk about

1291
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,800
really quick here at the end

1292
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,800
and that is, there's a lot of,

1293
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,680
the reason I love this podcast in the community

1294
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,040
that we've sort of surrounded ourselves with

1295
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,040
is that I feel like there's a lot of sort of bad stuff

1296
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,400
happening in the world today.

1297
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,480
And it's so easy to like consume the media

1298
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,200
that you consume and just sort of be distracted

1299
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,880
by the noise of it all, right?

1300
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,360
And just sort of turn a blind eye to all the injustices

1301
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,120
that are happening in the world today.

1302
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,200
And that's fine, like, you know,

1303
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,000
I'm glad that we can provide sort of a safe place

1304
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,440
for people, but I think that we need to sort of confront

1305
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,360
some of these things head on.

1306
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,760
And I would recommend starting with joining my boycott

1307
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,760
of the Village Voice for their fucking slanderous review

1308
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,760
of Kung Fu Panda 3, written by Alan Sherstal.

1309
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,800
Get that negativity out, Alan.

1310
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,960
Yeah, Alan, like we get it.

1311
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,120
Like, you're too cool for Kung Fu 3.

1312
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,200
We get it, you're too cool for Poe.

1313
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,680
It's okay to unironically love stuff, Alan.

1314
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,120
Yeah, and so anyway, never buy another issue,

1315
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,800
never again, write him a letter that just says

1316
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,960
never again, Alan, you know what you did.

1317
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,280
And then a paw print, a panda paw print,

1318
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,440
and then say this one's for my pandas.

1319
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,280
Now, we don't usually get-

1320
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,240
No, we don't.

1321
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,760
We don't usually get serious on the show,

1322
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,280
but can I just say real quick,

1323
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,960
I have killed before, and the only thing

1324
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,520
that stops me from killing again is knowing

1325
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,000
that there's a new Kung Fu Panda movie out.

1326
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,520
And if society were to, for some reason,

1327
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,760
take that away from me, I don't know what I would do.

1328
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,760
Travis's soul is the respite of a dark passenger.

1329
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,360
I've got what scientists call a dark passenger.

1330
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,680
See, when I was little, I was a little bit

1331
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,520
of a dark passenger.

1332
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,920
See, when I was little, I died for five seconds

1333
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,520
and something came back with me.

1334
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,320
Yes.

1335
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,640
And the only thing that allows me

1336
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,240
to control the hunger within is knowing

1337
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,400
that there's a new Kung Fu Panda movie

1338
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,320
every like two to three years.

1339
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,080
And I worry that if that ever stops-

1340
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,720
Yeah, you're gonna throw some-

1341
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,960
Let me just say, the voice I hear in my head

1342
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,040
is no language spoken by man.

1343
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:17,840
No.

1344
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,200
As far as I know, ever.

1345
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,000
But it's Jack Black doing the voice, which is weird.

1346
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,560
Yeah, and just the only phrase I can understand

1347
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,600
is just two words and it's old gods.

1348
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,640
Yeah.

1349
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:35,520
And if Kung Fu Panda were to ever not be there

1350
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,080
as a barrier against the darkness,

1351
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,680
I worry not only for myself,

1352
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:44,120
but for everyone in this plane of existence.

1353
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,280
If you've just finished watching this clip

1354
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,000
of the YouTube video after Travis commits

1355
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,520
some terrible atrocity,

1356
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,760
you should know that we thought he was kidding.

1357
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,000
Well, thanks for listening.

1358
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,920
You want a final Yahoo?

1359
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,800
Yes.

1360
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,560
This final Yahoo was sent in by level9000.

1361
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,600
YajurJudu Devonport.

1362
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:07,920
Thank you, Drew.

1363
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,240
It's by YajurAnswers user, Abby, who asks,

1364
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,040
can anybody find out if Billy Zane is available

1365
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,560
to sell pasta at my new store, Cal Pasta?

1366
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,480
My name is Justin McElroy.

1367
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,200
I'm Travis McElroy.

1368
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,160
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1369
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,280
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1370
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:25,920
Kiss your dad.

1371
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,040
Square on the lips.

1372
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:46,000
Skadoosh.

1373
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,840
Maximumfun.org.

1374
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,960
Comedy and culture.

1375
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,000
Artist owned.

1376
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,200
Listener supported.

1377
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,600
The three of you enter a cave of a big red dragon

1378
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,280
and is standing over a hoard of precious golden rubies.

1379
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,600
And he says, what do you do, adventurers?

1380
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,800
I'm a dragon man.

1381
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,680
I cast fire on him.

1382
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,560
It's very good.

1383
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,480
I address the red dragon and say,

1384
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,560
us, we're the hosts of The Adventure Zone,

1385
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,760
a podcast about family playing Dungeons and Dragons.

1386
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,800
Very good synergy.

1387
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,680
Commit to the bit.

1388
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,280
I roll to charm new listeners.

1389
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,080
It is very effective, against all odds.

1390
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,120
Everybody, we're the McElroys.

1391
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,080
We host The Adventure Zone,

1392
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,160
a podcast where we play Dungeons and Dragons together.

1393
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,440
It's a comedy podcast.

1394
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,800
We don't take the rules too seriously

1395
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,840
because there's a lot of them

1396
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,200
and we did not take the time to learn them.

1397
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:27,920
Maybe listen to us.

1398
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,560
