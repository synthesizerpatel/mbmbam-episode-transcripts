1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,720
Hello everybody, and welcome to the one we're phoning in, because the Max Fun Drive is over,

6
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,960
we got your money, and now we're just going to fuck them. These laurels are awful comfortable.

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,360
Oh boy the laurels. We put out the best shows that we could. Still not good enough for some of you,

8
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,520
that's fine. I hear you. I hear you. But you know what, we're doing our best right now.

9
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,520
But not, no, no, sorry, sorry, sorry. We did our best. That was our best. We did our best.

10
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,880
We're all out of best juice. I am giving a solid 63 percent.

11
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,400
Welcome, my brother, my brother and me to Vice Show for the Magenera. I'm your oldest brother,

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,760
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Now I did want to mention here at the top of the show

14
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,520
that we, like sort of one of the things that we talk about during the Max Fun Drive is how your

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,240
money has helped us expand, and to that point I'm really excited to announce a new project that I'm

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:45,040
working on. It is a home improvement podcast, fan cast of the show Home Improvement. No,

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,280
it's an actual, I improve a home. It's very specifically a specific room in that home,

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,760
which is to say, and by room, I mean part of the, I'm talking about showers. I'm doing a new show

19
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,520
and it's all about improving showers. And is it your own? Yeah. Where are you starting? Like what

20
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,360
shower gets the first episode? You know that saying, don't shit where you eat?

21
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,680
Yep. I'm shitting right in my, right on my dinner plate because I'm doing it right in my own master

22
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,280
bath. You eat in your shower? I don't know if you hear that noise. That's my co-host on the show,

23
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,000
Matthew. He's a new friend of mine that I just made this morning. But we're fast friends,

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,200
brothers one might say. We're basically the new property brothers, but just friends. And

25
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,240
technically he works for me right now. And so yeah, he's just in there banging away. And this

26
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,120
is also technically, this is the first episode of Shower Boys, which is why I decided to call

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,720
the podcast because it's just me and Matthew just like living it up. In the shower. I heard him

28
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,480
weighing in on this just now. Yeah. He speaks mostly through Morse code as he bangs on pipes

29
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,920
and tiles and stuff like that. Um, if Shower Boys doesn't work out and it won't, then we,

30
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,480
I think we could pivot and do like a prank show where we just steal people's showers.

31
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,840
You know what I mean? Maybe, or maybe like a, another funny prank might be you ruined the

32
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:19,200
podcast that we do. Now how did I, how? Just like now. I mean, it's a good example now

33
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,840
of how like you're ruining it now. Just because of the banging and the clanging and the clattering.

34
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,800
Well, people like the, people like a sense of place, don't they? This is technically,

35
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,640
this is some people's ASMR is pipe banging. You think people are triggered by the sound

36
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,520
of tiles being destroyed? Oh yeah. He is really fucking them up. He's going hog. I think he

37
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,360
actually, I think he maybe, I think he might actually be able to hear what I'm saying in here.

38
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,560
And I think he's like trying to show what a big strong boy he is in the shower.

39
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,720
Griffin is Matthew a big strong boy?

40
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,880
He's a big boy. Yeah. He's a big strong lad. Um, he's in there doing it all by himself. He's like

41
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,840
going to get that, that, that play out by himself is like, damn, damn, Matthew back at it again.

42
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,200
Oh, uh, okay. So this is an advice show where

43
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,840
about showers. This is the, remember it's both shows and also shower, but this is two podcasts

44
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,360
together. Um, open, just take the left earbud out and you're going to hear shower boys in the right

45
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,120
earbud. Now there's going to be a lot of crossover. Um, you actually don't want to take any of your

46
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,960
earbuds out. You might miss, uh, um, here's just sort of a programming note about shower boys.

47
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,520
Um, all right. I'm worried that I'm, I, if I'm going to be sort of the mouthpiece,

48
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,960
like, I guess shower boys conceptually, as I've imagined it is I will sort of talk about like,

49
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,800
what, what the shower is and like what my vision for it is while he does all the work. And then

50
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,640
I don't think I'll have much to add in terms of like practically useful information. It's just,

51
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,040
basically it's going to be me talking about what showers do while you hear banging and clattering

52
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,240
in the background. Sounds great. Um, I actually have, do you think that would be a pretty good

53
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,080
podcast? Just like interviewing people who have actual skills about how to apply those skills.

54
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,040
Just like maybe it's just called like how grownups do it and just ask a grownup how they do it.

55
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,400
He is just busting ass in there. He is kicking the shower. I've watched enough home improvement

56
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,640
shows to know that you messed up by letting somebody else do the demo. Demo is the easy

57
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,880
part. That's true. I actually have, I actually have Richard Carton in there too and he's keeping

58
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,280
an eye on shit. You paid for a Carton appearance fee? No. Are you crazy? He was outside jogging

59
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,560
and he needed to take a shit. And I was like, you can use my bathroom, but Matthew's in there. Can

60
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,040
you keep an eye on stuff? And Carton's just been laid up on that toilet for like an hour and a half

61
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:41,920
now. I walked in, I peaked my head in there just like make sure he had, you know, TP and stuff.

62
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,120
Make sure he was doing okay. Make sure Matthew wasn't too uncomfortable with the whole situation.

63
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:52,400
And, uh, uh, he was white as a, white as a sheet. Wait, Matthew was? Or Carton was? Both,

64
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,040
both, but Carton whiter. I think a pretty good joke to do if you're Richard Carton

65
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,160
is invite someone over to repair your shit and then just stand near them kind of like judgmentally.

66
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,320
Like, well, not how I would have done it, but oh, you're a freak. I don't think so, Matthew.

67
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:12,400
I'm not sure, Matthew. I have them locked in there. I should point that out too. Both. What?

68
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,720
Both. I have both of them locked in the, in the toilet chamber. Oh, so do you think the

69
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,480
banging is actually him trying to escape? Do you think the banging is him trying to kill Richard

70
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:29,920
Carton? Like a mouse hunt situation where he just can't catch that rascally carn? God,

71
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,680
how did Richard Carton get so tiny? I can tell you, I can tell you how he's been just based on

72
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:44,640
like the time to like, um, mass exodus ratio. Like, um, he's, he's probably like dropped like a 120

73
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:51,280
pounds in the John. Maybe that sound isn't like Matthew banging on tiles. It's just car and

74
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,360
shitting in the toilet. Just dropping hammers. Listen, listen, I'm going to ask a question

75
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,040
for advice. Okay. That's what this show's about. Hey, thank you everyone for max fun drive,

76
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:07,920
by the way. It was really awesome. We love you. Yeah. You all killed it this year. It went so

77
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:14,720
well. We're um, yeah, we're pleased as punch. Very pleased. I apologize. I genuinely do apologize

78
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,400
that this work is happening behind me. It's either this or the show's late. So we thought

79
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:26,800
this would be better. Um, so we're sorry. I will not stop thinking is hysterical that a man is

80
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,720
hammering two feet from where you're making your show. I'm an adult woman with a job and stuff,

81
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,800
but sometimes babysit for a family friend, uh, for arguably too much money. The family's great.

82
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,920
I chill and play video games with the kids and their parents always tell me I can invite my

83
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,280
boyfriend to join too. They don't know him super well, but he's cool. My question is this. If I

84
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,720
bring him over to play video games and watch movies, do I have to split the cash with him?

85
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:02,080
That's from confused caregiver in Canberra. Where's Canberra? Australia. I think. Okay.

86
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,600
Pulled that right out. Wait. Yeah. You guessed that. Ask Matthew. It is in Australia. You

87
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:15,200
fucking crushed it. No. So, um, uh, so it's the capital by the way. Good job guys. Thank you.

88
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,600
Oh, I got it. Um, I here's, here's the way to solve this. He's over there. You're playing

89
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:28,240
in what? Halo two with them on this, on these kids, first generation Xbox that they don't have.

90
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:35,200
Um, and you're racking up sweet kills and stuff. Um, and then one of the kids, uh, you know,

91
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,720
falls down a well, but just straight up baby Jessica's themself, like real good.

92
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,680
While playing Halo? No, you you're distracted by, you know, getting,

93
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,160
getting all the great scores and the, you know, the, you know, the stuff that happens in Halo

94
00:08:50,160 --> 00:09:00,800
and, uh, kid baby Jessica's died. And does the blame, does the blame get split equally between

95
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,360
you and the boyfriend? Because if not, the money should not be split. Does that make sense?

96
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,080
I mean, yeah. If something horrible happens, if something horrible happens to the children,

97
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,000
then, and your boyfriend's over, but you're the babysitter. You're the one whose name is on the

98
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,800
contract. Um, I feel like you're the one that's going to get in trouble. Like that's why they,

99
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,880
that's, that's all a babysitter is. It's just like a person to carry the blame.

100
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,920
I'm more confused as to why you jump to a child and not just like the kid gets sick and throws

101
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:42,080
up. You jump to like baby Jessica well situation. I feel like that I'm more confused about why

102
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:49,200
why that was your something bad that could happen. It's literally the worst thing that can happen.

103
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,760
It's a really bad thing that can happen though. Because even the kid, like, like if the kid does,

104
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,040
like the problem with the well is, okay, listen, babysitting scenarios, the kid eats poison.

105
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,240
Ow, well, easy come, easy go. Kid falls in a well. The impetus is on you to get the kid out of the

106
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,640
fucking well. Right? That's still a problem you can solve ostensibly. Yeah. That's a solve. That

107
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,960
is a solvable problem. Like if you're babysitting my kid and the kid falls out well and I come home

108
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,880
and the kid's still in the well, you're not getting a tip. Yeah. You know what I mean? That's fair.

109
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,280
Why didn't you get the kid? That is fair. I just think, yeah, I think you don't split it. I think

110
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,280
it's yours. This is your job. If I'm at Arby's and my, my wife comes to hang out with me at my,

111
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,080
during my shift at Arby's, I don't give her a portion of my Arby's paycheck. I give her,

112
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,920
you know, some curly fries and maybe a big fish sandwich. This is a, that's an excellent point.

113
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,680
Like, is the boyfriend doing anything to help or is he just there? Is he doing burpees? Is he

114
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,480
changing diapies? Is he, is he just guarding, is he just, is he guarding the well? Is he just

115
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,400
standing at the ready at the well like a fucking goalie looking for like incoming kids? Because if

116
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,800
he undertakes well guardianship, I feel like that's worth 20%. I think you need a flow chart

117
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:10,320
of percentage of if he does this much, then he gets like a 10% like well guarding fee, right?

118
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:17,680
If he changes one diaper, it's like 2% per diaper, right? And then you have just, you have like a

119
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,560
star chart, kind of like he gets a little check marks and gold stars to determine how much of

120
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,400
your sweet babysitting case he's going to get. Yeah. I don't think you can let him interact

121
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,800
with the kids at all. Cause if he does that, if he helped like, if he helps one of them reach the

122
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,560
cookie jar or God forbid teaches one of them a valuable life lesson, you're sunk. You have,

123
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,120
that's a legal claim. If you see him turning a chair around to sit backwards on it, you get him

124
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,400
out of the house. He's trying to get some of your money. Yeah, absolutely. What if he, what if he

125
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,800
comes in, what if the boyfriend, you don't give the boyfriend any money though. You may want to

126
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,720
fold him into the operation because what if you don't give him any money and then as you're

127
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,880
leaving, he like looks at how much the parents gave you and he's like, listen, just friend to

128
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,520
friend, you're really getting raped over the coals here. If you call Dylan's babysitting services,

129
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:15,680
we will, we're going to cut you a very, very optimal rate. Friends and family. He undercut

130
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,600
you. Yeah, he got undercutter. Let's, no, here's you, Susan, you stand over here. I'll stand right

131
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,680
here. We'll let the kids decide. Which one do you want to come to? Oh, but then it turns out he's

132
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,920
got a potty full of bacon. He's got, what? I was going to say fun size Snickers. But kids can't

133
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:39,200
smell that. That's a good point. You mean something aromatic. You stink like Snickers, old man.

134
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,480
Do you guys want to Yahoo? I smell the stink of Snickers on you. Please let me read this Yahoo.

135
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,920
Okay. Okay. I'm being quiet. I don't, I feel like I'm being more quiet than I usually am.

136
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,400
Just cause I'm. You don't want to wake up Matthew. Well, I don't want anybody. He's falling asleep

137
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,320
while chiseling. He could be on Twitter right now. Just like putting up all the jokes as I say him.

138
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,520
And this is a, this is a closed set. Um, a bunch of people sent this in, including a guy named

139
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,800
Travis Pace. Thank you, Travis. This is by Yahoo Answers user. You're welcome. They're anonymous.

140
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:18,000
Um, we're going to call them. There's something trending called dingus day. Oh, it's an actual day

141
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,960
in. Okay. There's a day it's Easter Monday is called dingus day. And well, sorry guys. I got to

142
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,880
take a break from the show and learn everything about dingus day. Dingus day celebrations are

143
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,960
widespread and popular in Buffalo, New York, Wyandotte and Hamtrak in Michigan, South Bend

144
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,920
and La Porte in Indiana and Hanover, New Hampshire. Give me a minute. There's something funny in here

145
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,320
because it's called dingus day. Yeah. You feel like it almost has to have something.

146
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,720
Then it just seems like second Easter they do a polka and they exchange eggs and they roll eggs

147
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,120
and stuff, but they call it dingus day. That seems disrespectful. It's like good Friday

148
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,720
and then Saturday and then Easter Sunday. And then you follow that up with those,

149
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,520
that the high holy day with dingus day. It feels like it should be something like

150
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,560
Mondo Monday or something like it's going to be awesome. And not like you're a real

151
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,120
dingus day was created in Bible times and it was created to as an opportunity to make fun of the

152
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:22,480
people who thought Jesus was down for the count. You just come around like, I told you, I try to

153
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,160
tell you, I said, my boy was coming back and you're like, nah, nah, nah, but look at the stone.

154
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,000
It done rolled away. Dingus. Give me an egg. Anyway, happy dingus day to everybody. Uh,

155
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,440
this Yahoo was asked by dingus day, uh, brother to Morris day, uh, uh, dingus asks

156
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:47,360
if I let a bee sting in on my male part, will it make it bigger? One more time.

157
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:56,560
If I let a bee sting in on my male part. Oh, Matthew's loving this one. Will it make it bigger?

158
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:04,400
I'm talking about his hog. If you get a bee sting up on there. Oh my. Are you going to get some

159
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:14,320
extra shove meat? Yes, but not for permanent. So you're going to have to time it till just before

160
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,360
the reveal. Travis, you didn't get that, but you didn't get that, but out fast enough. As soon as

161
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,560
you said, yes, I let a bee sting me on my Johnson. But now Griffin, you're going to have to just keep

162
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:31,680
having a bee sting you every hour. I don't know how long swelling lasts until the reveal and God

163
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,960
help you. If you get a career in pornography, then it's like before every scene, like bringing the

164
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,280
bees, you get a fluffer, you get a buzzer, the buzzer brings in the bee. I didn't know if that

165
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:50,720
was clear. Um, I have a, I have an idea for a 300th episode celebration. Um, for a 300th,

166
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:58,480
we mark this very auspicious occasion, uh, by going one episode without fucking talking about dicks.

167
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,520
Like just one. If we could just do one where we don't talk about hogs or I don't know how to hear

168
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:09,680
the phrase hog or Johnson or, or dick, just like one episode without dicks. What about, what if I,

169
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,040
what if I call it, and this will be appropriate now because of the bees. If I call it my lumpo,

170
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:24,320
I mean, I still, I'm still my lumpo bumpins. Hi, I'm Lumpo bumpins.

171
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:36,880
Do you have an epi pen? I got to be honest. Uh, I, I don't like a lot of Ted Nugent tunes,

172
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:44,240
but a Lumpo Bumbo is probably the one that I can groove to the most. Probably my favorite

173
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:52,320
Ted Nugent song is Lumpo Bumbo by Ted Nugent. The delicious candy treat turned rocker.

174
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,840
Yeah. It was his follow up to Cat Scratch Fever where he said, what other animal could inflict

175
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,120
pain on you, but in a sexy way. I've got it. Bee saying my nail parts. Bumbo, Bumbo.

176
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,480
I did that too loud. Now I'm embarrassed.

177
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,200
Matthew knows too much. You can't let him leave. And then he was about to release a song and then

178
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,600
he saw Striper in their uniforms. It's like, well, they've already got this bee like locked down.

179
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,520
The whole bee thing is really there. They have a whole choir of Lumpo Bumpos.

180
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,240
Where do they get the bees though? That's what I want to know. How do they,

181
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,800
do they have a special compartment in the bus and their tour bus that all the bees sleep in?

182
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,200
This is why, this is why all the bees are dying out. The answer is no, right? I mean,

183
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,640
the answer is no. Yeah, Justin. I mean, it's just like Bugs Bunny cartoon

184
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,720
where he gets stung on the hand and his hand swells up. Unless, unless.

185
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,320
I mean, you get that, there's like that bees, that bee sting like lip gloss that was real hot

186
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,400
in the nineties until it definitely probably killed some teens that you would put it on your

187
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,520
lips and it would sting, but then your lips would get kissable, plump, kissable, plump, kissable

188
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,800
Bumpos. So you want to plump up your bumper. I think if you're plumping those Bumpos, then

189
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,440
you're, I think a bee sting would absolutely work. I don't think it is a, I don't think it's a great

190
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:24,080
solution. I would be curious as to even if you did discover that the answer was a definitive yes.

191
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,840
Bees are not the most sort of like tamable creatures. I mean, what are you going to

192
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,720
rub some pollen on it? Like how do you train a bee to sting your dick? Well, you would have to

193
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,960
make the bee feel threatened by your dick. By the way, because a bee sting, you does kill the bee.

194
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:50,240
What a fucking, what a, what a pristine end that it, what a meaningful, what a meaningful death

195
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,720
for that, for that poor bee. How did you go? Oh, good news. Bee St. Peter. Uh, I sting the dudes.

196
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,200
What? St. Peter. St. Peter. Well, no, it would be, it would be the, the Hyena Net Cheerios bee is

197
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,480
probably the first face you see in bee. I believe his name is Buzz. Okay. Well, great. Good work.

198
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,880
It's not mine. I think his name actually is Buzz. No, I know. I'm saying shitty job, General Mills.

199
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:20,240
It's very first thought. Who are the five bees you meet in heaven? I could only come up with like

200
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,000
three. I mean, there's like Buzz and then all the stugs in a bee movie. The bee from The Simpsons,

201
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,080
I guess, but he's a man in a bee costume. Yeah, I was gonna say the, the fly from, um, uh,

202
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,080
Rescue Rangers, but he's a fly, of course. Zipper is a fly. Yeah, not explicitly, not a bee. But not

203
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,360
a bee, but like, I'm just trying to think, why is there such under-representation of bees in the

204
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,120
media? I mean, they made a bee, they made a bee movie. Most animals don't get like, hey everybody,

205
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,240
it's an armadillo movie. No, we got a bee movie. No, because they cause leprosy. That's not true.

206
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,040
I've got another question here. Uh, I cohabit, is that the word? Cohabit? Cohabit with my S.O.

207
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,080
Her mother continually buys furniture items that are likely to be used by both of us. Bed frame,

208
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,480
dresser, rugs, etc. While this is great on the one hand as I get new shit, I also abhor my mother-in-law's

209
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:20,560
taste. All these items are gaudy and usually poorly made. The real trouble is that I try to

210
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,040
politely say no, I don't feel like that fits our decor, but these things just keep showing up in

211
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,920
my house. How do I get an in-law to stop buying me invitation Victorian shit when I'm more of an

212
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:37,120
American craftsman kind of guy? That's from settling in Seattle. P.S., if it helps, my S.O. has no

213
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,920
preference on one style versus the other. Uh, I'm confused because I, at first when I heard this I

214
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,880
thought it was like she was gifting you this stuff because y'all like weren't getting your own stuff

215
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,400
or you couldn't get your own stuff. In which case, I thought it was like a gift horse scenario.

216
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,240
Whatever the next time, um, your mother-in-law, uh, brings over, uh, some furniture you say,

217
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,360
oh, sweet firewood. And then she's like, what? And you're like, I said, oh, sweet firewood.

218
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,480
And then you just sit in silence until she leaves the room. That's good. I called it, I called it

219
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:17,280
kindling. Kindling. Thanks for the kindling mama. What if you, every time she brought you a new

220
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,200
cabinet, you put an armament in it and you shut and locked it and you opened it up again and said,

221
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:30,320
nope, not this one. I'm sorry, Griffin. I'm sorry to do this. It's the key. It's not the cabinet

222
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,680
because later they use it on a trunk. They use it. So it's not, it's not cabinet specific.

223
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,000
But as long as the mother-in-law doesn't know that. Yeah. Yeah, Travis. Obviously I know the secret

224
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,280
of the magical source, the arcane source for Indian in the cupboard. Um, but I, I, I, you,

225
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,440
you're just looking for a way to get rid of some old furniture. And I think this is a good one.

226
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,840
Why'd you go, why you gotta put me on blast like that, Travis? You know, I'm in a

227
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,720
vulnerable place right now. I just love you so much. Okay. Love you so much. I had to do it.

228
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,600
I think that, uh, I, okay. I had a question as we were reading this question,

229
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,840
which is you keep, you use the phrase S O. Are you using mother-in-law to literally describe

230
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,680
someone who is now legally related to you? Or are you using it for shorthand of a significant

231
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:25,360
other's mother? Like is she using it legally or casually? Yes. I've never met anybody who's used

232
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,120
the word in-laws casually before. Well, see, I wouldn't think that either, except that they say

233
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:38,720
S O rather than to just say like wife or husband or like partner or anything like that. Maybe it

234
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,000
stands for superior officer and they're in the military. I have a new three step process for

235
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,160
this. Uh, for, for questions like this, it goes like this. Are you going to say shit? This is a,

236
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:56,080
this is a flow chart. Okay. Are you going to say shit? If yes, the problem is solved. If no,

237
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,880
go to step two, step two, fucking learn to live with it, my man. Cause that's it. That's all you

238
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,680
got. I thought you said there were three steps. Yes. There's, well, it's a three step flow chart.

239
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,920
So there's three questions. It doesn't fucking matter. Listen, either say something or tough it

240
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,720
up. You got furniture. Okay. This is, this is not that big of a problem. Just put your drinks on it.

241
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,680
You know, look at, look at this way. If she's not worried about your taste,

242
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,120
you shouldn't be worried about whether or not you have to use the stuff she sends you.

243
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,360
So we have a segment on shower boys and it's all about sort of like rehab addicts. You know,

244
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,320
the show rehab addicts. You know, I think that's kind of a fucked up name for a show. Don't you

245
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,800
think? Anyway, you know, is there, they rehab furniture and then breathe new life into it.

246
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,880
Oh. So we'll do like just sort of a sample episode right now. I thought that was a completely

247
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,520
different thing. We'll do a sample episode right now. One of you guys be this person.

248
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,160
I've got all this furniture. What do I do? Oh, let me see it. Oh, this is good stuff. What is this?

249
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,120
Is this imitation Victorian? I love the, I love the woodwork, but you say you're not a fan of it.

250
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,960
Yeah. I'm not a fan of it. I don't like it. It offends my sensibilities.

251
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Okay. Here's like a bunch of stickers. Here's like a bunch of stickers. I got some of these

252
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:12,080
out of the official PlayStation magazine and a lot of these are bumper stickers I got from

253
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,760
the library. And then- Is this a Garbage Pail Kids sheet?

254
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,920
Yeah, it's a sheet of vintage Garbage Pail Kids. And I'm going to need you to actually reimburse

255
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:26,240
me for that. I got those for $200. Can I just stick the outline sticker part on it and you

256
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,880
keep the actual stickers? Yeah. I want you to ruin it without using it. That's absolutely what I want

257
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:39,440
you to do. No. Okay. What? Nothing tastes as good as Garbage Pail feels. Put these on your thing.

258
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,680
Give me $200 right now or else I'll burn your house. I don't have $200. Wait, wait, wait.

259
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,040
This is my favorite segment of the show or else I'll burn your house to the ground. Oh.

260
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,960
Will you use the furniture as kindling? No. I'm not going to solve your problem like that. You

261
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,600
can't backdoor trick me. So you will burn my house to the ground, but first you will remove

262
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,400
the offending furniture from said house so that I will be left with nothing but the furniture that

263
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,960
I so despise. And the stickers because I can't exchange. I can't return these.

264
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,880
That's funny. Sounds like a deal. $200.

265
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:19,440
$200. Storage wars. So that's another sort of angle for, oh, there he goes. There's another

266
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,960
angle of Shower Boys is it kind of has like, what's that show called? Junkyard Buddies where

267
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,240
they break into storage units. Kind of have that going on where we go to houses and we just auction

268
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,840
them off and then I break it in or into them and a family's there and it's like, sorry, I auctioned

269
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:42,480
it. Auction law says nine tenths of possession. This is his now. Probably the best episode of

270
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,720
storage wars ever would be one where halfway through the auction somebody shows up like,

271
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:55,040
what are you doing? These are my personal belongings. Yeah. I paid for this. This sucks.

272
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,640
How about you want another question or another Yahoo or what are we doing here?

273
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,400
Do another Yahoo. Yeah. I don't have that many, but sure. This one was sent in by

274
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,360
Michelle Cassidy. Thank you, Michelle. It's by Yahoo Answers user,

275
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,520
Gufu, who asks, and let me know if we've talked too much about this already, but Gufu asks,

276
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,840
should truck nuts be made illegal? They are distracting. Oh shit. Another contractor just

277
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:30,480
got here. Sorry. I got to welcome them into my home. One sec. Hi. If you're listening to this,

278
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,240
you've stumbled on another episode of contractor buddies, the sequel to shower buddies. Why now

279
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:42,560
there are two contractors in the house. They will be competing both for Griffin's money and his love.

280
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,920
Which contract? If you listen closely, you'll be able to hear Griffin. Pretend he's a grownup

281
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,000
who knows what needs to happen in order for this exchange to take place.

282
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,240
He has just been handed a business card by the contractor and he is forced to pretend as though

283
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,360
he won't immediately lose it. As the contractor outlines their plans, Griffin's going to nod

284
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,040
in an agreeable fashion. He will not comprehend anything that they're saying. Griffin may gesture

285
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:15,840
towards a bag and say, those your tools? Great, great. At some point, Griffin may be asked to

286
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:23,680
assist in a menial fashion with this exchange. He will do it wrong. I cannot emphasize this enough.

287
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:30,640
His anxiety over the situation will paralyze him. What a pickle. Guys, what a jar of pickles I've

288
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,320
got myself into because that wasn't another contractor. It was actually a private detective

289
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:43,120
looking for Richard Karn. I had to kill. I had to kill him. I had to kill him, but luckily Matthew

290
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,160
could keep a secret. He's just going to help me. He's going to put him in the shower wall.

291
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,800
But you're going to lose significant inches in your shower, Griffin.

292
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,880
No, I know, but I'm going to gain inches in freedom of not being in

293
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,720
prison because now I got murder one and card napping.

294
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,640
Should truck nuts be made illegal?

295
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:11,120
I was driving today behind a truck today that had truck nuts. I laughed a little bit when I saw them

296
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,720
at first, but while driving behind the truck, I found myself mesmerized by those things

297
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,040
bouncing around and I couldn't keep my eyes off of them. Those things are so distracting

298
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,280
that they can potentially cause accidents. Should truck nuts be made illegal?

299
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,040
I like how many times they said the word those things and I would actually prefer if we could

300
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:35,200
stick to that vernacular as well. Wouldn't it be great if that was like in the new James Bond movie

301
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,600
they pressed a button and just like deployed those things and suddenly like the enemy, the

302
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,440
whatever, the Spectre agents were so distracted by their pendulous nature that they like careened

303
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,800
off a cliff? Yeah, that would be funny as fuck, dude. If truck nuts were the new caltrops?

304
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,040
Judy Dench was like, check this out.

305
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,600
I'm back to life.

306
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,200
That was her leaping for her casket, right? Yeah, but now with truck nuts.

307
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,440
We can't. She's a dame. We can't say these things.

308
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,280
More like, damn, look at those truck nuts.

309
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:26,320
All right. That joke was rough. So that one was in shower boys. That wasn't a good one.

310
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,880
Because it needs considerable rehab. I'm going to do a little bit word swap.

311
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:40,080
Okay. Look at those truck nuts. Damn, Judy Dench. Is that better or worse? Where are we at?

312
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,880
It's not even a joke. It's nothing at all. Well, I was trying to make it sound like I was saying

313
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,600
dame Judy Dench, but instead I say damn Judy. Oh, that's good. You can use that for a lot of things.

314
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,920
Yeah, I mean, you could follow up damn Judy Dench with pretty much anything.

315
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,400
Damn, Judy Dench back at it again with the white kids.

316
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,280
Were they kids or vans? They were vans. Vans, yeah. It's all right. I mean,

317
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,640
he might also have white kids. Did you just sneak preview the next damn Daniel?

318
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:17,360
Hey, guys. This is a MBMBAM shower boys exclusive. No, fuck MBMBAM. I'm only about shower boys now.

319
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,520
I'm kind of just Tarzan swinging from project to project, and this is the one I'm really invested

320
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,840
in now, and it's the sequel to damn Daniel, and I'm proud to announce it here on shower boys.

321
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,400
All this talk of truck nuts has got me wanting to buy some for myself.

322
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,240
For your Volkswagen?

323
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,240
No. For my Kia Sportage. For my 2008 Kia Sportage.

324
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,960
I would love to see the pair of truck nuts hanging from a Kia Sportage.

325
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,440
That's the sensible truck nuts.

326
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,480
Yeah, I got a Kia Sportage, and these are what my nuts look like.

327
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,880
I wanted to sound cool saying that, but also very quiet.

328
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,640
It's important that I emphasize the 2008 because that had the most unappealing body

329
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,000
design of any Kia Sportage. It's the minkus of cars.

330
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,240
But not with this fucking cool hog basket hanging from it.

331
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,480
Could you put truck nuts on minkus and make him cool?

332
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,160
Yes.

333
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,520
Oh god, let's get out of this. Let's jettison.

334
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,440
Okay, the crazy thing about truck nuts to me, and there are many. Oh,

335
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,320
we'll get to the money soon in a second, but I gotta talk about truck nuts for a second.

336
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,800
The thing that you have to remember about truck nuts is that by definition,

337
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,760
what precedes that is somebody in a store and they see nuts hanging off of a hook,

338
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,560
and they say, I'd love to put those bad boys on my vehicle.

339
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,680
You gotta run it back further. Someone sat down with like a sketch pad and drew them,

340
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,840
and at first went, because if you've ever noticed, drew them symmetrically and went,

341
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,560
no, no, no, not believable. So then they redrew them so that one nut hung slightly lower,

342
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:10,400
and they say yes. Yes, yes, yes. And then a sculptor took it, took that design,

343
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:15,680
and welded it, like lovingly cast them. There's a factory where they make those,

344
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,800
and there's people who work at that factory as their jobs.

345
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,760
Mr. Johnson, thank you for joining us on Bring Your Parent to Work Day.

346
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,360
Please tell the class what you do. I'd really rather not.

347
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,800
Hey, Bring Your Parent to Work Day would be crazy.

348
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Oh, oh, whoops. You know what? Fuck it. Money's up.

349
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,720
Ah, here we go. Truck nuts are a high-quality novelty automotive accessory that hang from

350
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,280
any bumper, and let folks show the world they're nuts. This is our first sponsor.

351
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:02,960
Available in white, blue, flesh, black, red, yellow, chrome, and green, and camo,

352
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,800
when you just really can't anymore. When you want nuts on your car,

353
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,760
but you don't want anybody to know about it or see them.

354
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,520
How much would you guys be willing to pay for truck nuts?

355
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,960
$14.99 a minute. $19.99.

356
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,840
Fucking $15. Exactly, Griffin. Off by a penny. You crushed it.

357
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,240
They're the toughest in the industry, and they're guaranteed not to fade,

358
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,240
chip, crack, or break. Hey, I want to buy these.

359
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,880
Are they going to chip at all? Is chipping going to be a concern for this hog basket?

360
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,280
How much nut mass will I lose over the course of, say, a calendar year?

361
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,280
Are these resistant from the tars and other perils of the road?

362
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,680
I should mention that the truck nut site, you can also get bumper stickers about truck nuts,

363
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,120
which there's very little funnier to me than the idea of somebody who has a truck

364
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,840
nuts bumper sticker but no truck nuts, as if to say, someday.

365
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,720
Watch this space. Watch this space. I got the first few payments in.

366
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,280
Exciting developments. They're coming soon.

367
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,560
How many Osama Bin Laden-related bumper stickers do you think are available on the truck nuts site?

368
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,640
Three. Did you guess two?

369
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,840
He guessed three. He said it out loud. You heard him.

370
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,360
They are selling a bumper sticker that has a picture of Saddam Hussein

371
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,400
and Osama Bin Laden, and it says, one down, one to go. That's not even applicable anymore.

372
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,720
Maybe that person was saying, that's what I'll buy my truck.

373
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,400
I will buy my truck nuts on the day that Osama Bin Laden is killed.

374
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:44,000
Those will be celebratory truck nuts. Where can I buy a truck vagina?

375
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,200
Yeah, that's the real question. What I really like is that our first sponsor is actually

376
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,440
Bowling Branch, and in the copy that they sent us, this is the first line of the copy,

377
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,480
please feel free to ad-lib the intro with a personalized story.

378
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,600
I think we kind of did that.

379
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,200
You got it.

380
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,680
Somebody tell me about Bowling Branch.

381
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,200
I slept on Bowling Branch sheets last night.

382
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,000
Oh yeah? How'd it go?

383
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,320
They were glorious. We've had them for a while now. As we wash them, they get more and more

384
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:21,120
comfortable. A thing I've never experienced with sheets before. You know why? Because they

385
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:27,440
don't worry about thread count or any of that bull roar. They just get really good quality

386
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:34,480
cotton and material and stuff, and that's what they use. And they make them real good.

387
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,440
And now you think, real good sheets, huh? I've been taken in by real good sheets before,

388
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,720
and I had to pay an astronomical price at the department store. Well, you're a fool.

389
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,680
You could have ordered them on BowlingBranch.com, and it would have been way cheaper because they

390
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,920
have way less overhead. They don't have that brick and mortar stuff to pay for.

391
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,600
They have a website, which is not a brick and mortar place. It's a bits and bytes place,

392
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:05,040
and bits and bytes are a lot cheaper. And now you can try them risk-free for 30 nights,

393
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:12,400
and if you don't love them, you can send them back. And you just got to go to BowlingBranch.com.

394
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,400
And if you go to BowlingBranch, and you use the promo code MYBROTHER, you get 20% off your entire

395
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,560
order. And they don't just have sheets, they got towels, they got blankets, they got duvet covers,

396
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,720
everything, plus free shipping. I'm a big fan, and I think you will be too.

397
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:35,440
Where's that website and the promo code again, Trav? It's BowlingBranch.com,

398
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,760
with the promo code MYBROTHER, all one word. Oh, you go ahead, Griffin.

399
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:50,000
I want to tell you all about Club W. It's a wonderful service that takes bottles of wine

400
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,400
and gets them to your house, your kitchen, your glass, and your mouth, and your tummy.

401
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:02,800
We got a special segment on Shower Boys called Wine Time. I just get loaded drunk,

402
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,920
really fucked up, and just keep asking questions about where they are at in the project.

403
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,080
You're basically describing rosebuddies at this point, though.

404
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,920
Yeah, that's a good point.

405
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,600
But if, Griffin, we're on The Bachelor standing behind them going,

406
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:24,880
you guys got a gift? What are you doing? Hey, Kale, are you feeling it? It seemed like you guys

407
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,640
were really feeling it. Club W, though, is going to get you wine to your house, and not just any

408
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:39,200
old wine. Oops. It's Wine Time came early today, folks. Not just any wine. Wine that is going to be

409
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,280
delicious, and it's going to be tailored specifically for you. There's an easy six-question

410
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,120
quiz that figures out what your palate is like, so that every bottle you receive is

411
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,520
perfectly tailored to your taste. They got a no-risk guarantee. You're going to love what

412
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,200
they send you. Right now, Club W is offering listeners $20 off your first order when you go

413
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:06,000
to clubw.com slash my brother. That's all one word. Of course it is. It's a URL. Clubw.com slash

414
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,240
my brother. And not only that, Club W is actually going to pay for your shipping on orders of four

415
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,160
bottles or more, and of course you're going to want it. What, are you going to get two bottles?

416
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,200
You can knock that out over a lunch. Take something off your duty list. Go to clubw.com slash my

417
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,680
brother. Get $20 off your first order now. Get some great wine. Perfect for you. All right,

418
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:32,560
this next one's a puzzle. I got a personal message. And I hope this makes sense to literally

419
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,200
one human being on Earth, because it seems to be specifically targeted at that person.

420
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:47,120
This is a message for Isabelle. And the message is this. That's Panini. And it's from,

421
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,960
we have no idea. Nobody. There's nothing in this field. Maybe the universe sort of

422
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,360
conspired to send Isabelle a message as if to say like, hey, go for it. Shit,

423
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:03,840
this is the singularity. What does that mean? The internet generated this. That like the,

424
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,720
the, the content. This is the Google. This is the Google go bot blowing off steam.

425
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:16,400
The AI consciousness wants Isabelle to know that's Panini.

426
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,280
I have no idea what this message means. I'm worried about it. Yeah, it's weird, but like,

427
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,680
thanks for the message, I guess. Thanks for the hundred dollars. Thanks for the hundred

428
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,440
dollars Google go bot. I don't know where you got money from. You probably hacked into

429
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,320
your dad's account or something. I want to, I want to read another one. Hopefully you enjoy that

430
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,320
Isabelle. If you're a human and not a computer, I got a message for Dylan and this is from Sarah.

431
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,120
Happy anniversary to the best hunky boy. Thank you for making these past five years amazing with

432
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:54,080
your premium goose cartoons in the Japanese style, pointy hair and really great hugs.

433
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:59,680
Sounds like a cool person. Honestly, to me, sounds a good person. You're my best friend and the best

434
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,720
cat stepfather and obese tabby could ask for. I'm so glad that I met you and here's to many more

435
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:13,200
years together. I love you. And then it says at the end, that's weird. It's weird. This is weird

436
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,880
guys. I'm looking at the rest of the questions that we have picked out and the Yahoo's that I

437
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,440
had selected from the ones that people sent in. Um, and let me just like, so let me read this.

438
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:29,280
Yahoo right now, uh, is from Yahoo answers issue. That's Panini. And, uh, they asked that's Panini.

439
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:37,920
Oh no. Um, uh, so happy anniversary Dylan and Sarah. I can't imagine when that must've been

440
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:45,360
months ago. I'm sure, but I hope in the future, maybe Sarah overshot it and she got it in like

441
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:52,480
eight months before their anniversary and we read it too soon. Maybe I'm Jesse Thorn. I'm Jordan

442
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,680
Morris. The federal government has millions of dollars in programs and opportunities that you

443
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,040
need to seize today. You're a taxpayer, right? Well, then you've got it coming. Thanks to uncle

444
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:09,200
Sam. You can learn to get grants for education, learn to ride a llama, print money the old

445
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:16,160
fashioned way, force your dog to stop being so rambunctious, make a souffle that sets and stays

446
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:22,720
set, mount the heads of your enemies on spikes, grind your own corrective lenses using just rock

447
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:30,400
salt and diamonds for all of this and more. Drop us a line. Don't wait right now. Jordan, Jesse,

448
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,640
go one, two, three iTunes street or wherever you download podcasts. Here's another question.

449
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,240
I take a prescription Ambien every night to go to sleep. While it works great, I do suffer from

450
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,600
one of the known side effects, sleep eating. I apparently get out of bed and make delicious,

451
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:53,440
but terribly high calorie snacks before falling asleep for good. For example, my wife informed

452
00:41:53,440 --> 00:42:00,800
me that last night I made an ice cream sandwich using pop tarts and magic show. Oh, damn, damn.

453
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,080
What's up? You can have a pop up in L.A. with that. That's like a new hot. Yeah, absolutely.

454
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,400
I usually have a vague recollection of my nighttime noshing the next day,

455
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,480
but I'm disappointed in both the unhealthy eating and the kitchen messes that I leave.

456
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,800
Brothers, how can I prevent myself from creating these late night shame snacks

457
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:28,640
while still using my sleep as intended? That's from midnight. Midnight. Man, Manjia. Yeah, sure.

458
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:35,280
Sure. I can't tell a story real quick. Sure. I mean, I feel like we all have a good dad

459
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,880
Ambien story. Oh, yeah. Ranging ranging from the not hilarious like the time he fell down some

460
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,400
stairs to the hysterical like the time my car got broken into in the west end of Huntington.

461
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,280
Um, and this was at about seven thirty eight p.m. I called Daddy. I was like,

462
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,360
Daddy, I'm crying. I'm crying. I'm scared. I'm sad. My car got broken into. Somebody stole all

463
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:03,360
my tapes. And as soon as I called him, I told him what had happened and I needed him to come

464
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:10,000
come over. He his his reaction was not what I expected. I was expecting like, Oh, don't worry,

465
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,360
son. I'll be there in just a moment. What I got was a shit because Daddy had just popped a fistful

466
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:24,080
of Ambien. And when he showed up, he was not in a good state, not in like a safe driving place,

467
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:30,240
certainly. So I sent him home. And when I got home at around like eleven thirty. Thanks,

468
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,440
Huntington cops. You got there real quick and speedy like never never boy came out, didn't he?

469
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,120
Who came? I came, didn't I? Yeah, I came. Yeah, you came. You relieved Dad. Yeah.

470
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:49,840
And when I got home where I live with my daddy, there's a big old box, empty box of Jolly Pirate

471
00:43:49,840 --> 00:44:00,960
Donuts, like a dozen. Oh, Daddy. Daddy had just taken them to church. No recollection, no memory

472
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:08,640
of these sweet donuts going going down the hatch. But unless he got like a couple and like as as

473
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,520
goofed up as he was, was like, no, I want him in a big boy box. You put those two donuts in the big

474
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:19,600
boy box. I believe we confirmed on a receipt that he bought a dozen. Okay. Well, we did some

475
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:27,040
encyclopedia Browning. Anyway, that's that's a good one. That's a good story. Yeah. Ambien,

476
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:33,920
I can't believe that shit's legal. You know, some people really rely on it and need it.

477
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,520
No, I know that, but it seems like it seems like I don't know, man. I mean, I like to get high

478
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:47,520
and party and stuff, but I've seen Dad get like, whoa, dude, like, oh, oh, started on Ambien before.

479
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:56,560
Yeah, I mean, I think the obvious answer is to lock your bedroom door from the inside because

480
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,520
maybe you. Okay, wait a minute. I don't know that much about sleep eating. Are you just like,

481
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,920
are you just like the second you wake up and start sleeping? Are you just making repeated

482
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,800
motions of moving your hand from a place in front of you up to your mouth and then chewing?

483
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,640
Like you're making that like if your robot was programmed to eat, like, are you just doing that

484
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:23,680
until you run into some food or do you have like the mental acuity to like go eat like to unlock

485
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,280
a door that you locked? This is a good, like, have you ever caught yourself eating like sardines and

486
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,720
graham crackers and it's just like whatever, like your hand's sweet. What if, okay, I've got it. I've

487
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:42,240
got it. I've got it. You gotta accentuate the positive. You set up a webcam every night. You

488
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:48,320
film yourself doing it. New hit YouTube cooking show, sleep eating with Dave. It's like that

489
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:56,080
drunk kitchen YouTube show. Yes, but it's sleep eating. This seems exceedingly dangerous.

490
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,120
Yeah, it seems really, you know what you should do? Oh, oh, this is even better. What does everybody

491
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:07,440
hate to eat? No matter who they are and no matter what kind it is, vegetables, obviously. So what

492
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,440
you do is you put a tray of vegetables by your bed every night. So when you wake up and start

493
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,720
sleeping, oh, what's that? Some healthy options. Excellent. These are so close. I'll just go ahead

494
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,600
and eat this celery with like low fat cream cheese on it. Get some ants on a log going maybe with a

495
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:31,600
few saltanas on there. And you can eat, you can like force yourself to eat healthy vegetables,

496
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:39,200
but you don't have to like know you're doing it. You know? Well, why don't you, if we want to get

497
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,040
you really fit, like if we want to get your body so right when you're asleep, because who's got the

498
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,040
time in the waking hours? Um, why don't you put those vegetables in the kitchen where you're

499
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,640
normally going to go to snack down, get rid of all your unhealthy food so you don't accidentally

500
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,920
fall into some of that and then put between yourself and your kitchen, a big fun obstacle

501
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:02,000
course. Yeah. And then do film that. Cause holy shit. I would love, I would love to peep that.

502
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,080
Are you kidding me? I would love to watch. I would love to watch our sleepy dad, like try to climb up

503
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:15,040
a ramp. Sleepy ninja warrior. What if it was live stream? Like, can you imagine this new sounds

504
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,760
trying to diagnose what's going on? Is that the new shower? They're just like dragging it in

505
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,880
from the front door. I don't think that's how it works. Sorry. Go on. Uh, what, what if you

506
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,960
could live stream it? So like, imagine you're sitting around living your life and you get a

507
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,840
notification on your phone. It's like, here you go again. Here we go. Time to do it. Is this the

508
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:39,760
night he dies? Is this the night? No, the obstacle course would be made out of fun, like foamy pads

509
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:45,680
and stuff. This is, it would be safe. It would be safe for the user. Um, and there will be like

510
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,560
referees and lifeguards on duty at all times. I gotta be honest. As long as we're talking about,

511
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:58,320
like turning your negative experience into a positive, like web streaming entertainment

512
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,280
experience for me. Um, let's just do a fucking cooking show because you've unlocked something

513
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,080
like primal and, and amazing with this ice cream sandwich made of pop tarts and magic shell

514
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,720
situation. Like I don't think a sober mind is going to be able to crack that potential nut.

515
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,480
I think this is probably how Guy Fieri comes up with most of his stuff. Most of his goods.

516
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,680
Just like in a full on tra- I think most of Guy Fieri's goodies come from like,

517
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:28,720
I think Flavortown exists only in his ambient mind. And then like he wakes up the next morning

518
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:33,360
and it's like the, the, the, the gnomes have done the cobbling for him. You know what I mean?

519
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:38,800
And then made a cobbler out of nachos. He's like, what? Sick. Thanks gnomes.

520
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,480
But it's really him. He's just fucked up.

521
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,880
Do you think when he bites into it, he just goes gnome chompsky?

522
00:48:44,880 --> 00:49:00,640
No, what? What? What? How could this be? Is it back? It's back. It's haunted doll watch.

523
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,880
I got a live one here coming in straight from the electronic bay. This is, here's the listing.

524
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,440
I'm going to read it to you. And where I take pauses is where there are periods. Haunted doll,

525
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:18,640
ghost meter active, paranormal, supernatural, which is dull. Okay. So here's the listing.

526
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,280
And I'm going to read the description. It's a short one. So let me get through it.

527
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,920
She comes from a haunted antique auction that was held a few days ago in nearby the pointed

528
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,680
hat store in port Jervis. I was told this vessels and is antique and very viable for collectors,

529
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,000
but I felt more attracted to it because of its haunting value.

530
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:43,360
That's like, that's like I saw a $20 doll and I just can't shake how good of a value that is.

531
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,720
The smell attaches dolls been in it for many, many years. The spirit is the spirit of a native

532
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:57,280
American Indian just covered all the bases there. And it's a female spirit of age 18 to 24 years

533
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,600
old. The spirit is very attached to the vessel and refused to move on. We had some paranormal

534
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,680
experts who main purpose of buying spirit dolls is to help them stay moving to the other side

535
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,200
and not saying stuck in a vessel. This worked out well in the past with the other vessels,

536
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,960
but I sold as experts. I wouldn't recommend to try this, this vessel. Cause she clearly stated

537
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,240
she wants to remain in this vessel and it ends with good luck comma as though they were killed.

538
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:28,000
It's not a ringing endorsement. No, the thing I wanted to hit on is, um, I, uh, she comes from

539
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,440
a haunted antique auction that was held a few days ago in nearby the pointed hat store at port

540
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:41,680
Jervis held a few days ago. This person is flipping haunted dolls. They are downright spooky.

541
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,680
They're flipping these dolls. They're getting it. They're polishing it up,

542
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,480
taking some great photography, writing a great story and they're flipping haunted dolls.

543
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,840
What did you think they meant when they said they wanted to keep them moving on, Justin?

544
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:00,080
Oh, you mean like no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

545
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,440
From into your hands. So you can start enjoying them at home right now.

546
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,000
They got to stay in the haunted doll bubble.

547
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,080
Is there someone out there, hypothetically speaking, who in an attempt to keep this

548
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:17,360
market from becoming flooded and over saturated, cause a flooded haunted doll market is bad for

549
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:26,320
everyone, um, is de-haunting dolls is actually making them move on. I'm thinking of like the

550
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:34,240
exorcist from, um, well, the exorcist or poltergeist, um, just like, just like blasting,

551
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,520
busting, busting ghouls out of these dolls so that the ones that are definitely still haunted,

552
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,480
uh, are like increasing value. Do you think that's happening out there somewhere?

553
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,520
Yeah. I mean, there's got to be some kind of haunted doll decommissioner.

554
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,760
Somebody because like, okay, because what you don't want, you, there would have to be some

555
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,160
kind of governing body. Cause what you don't want is somebody to like move the spirit on from the

556
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:05,600
doll, but then continue to flip it like it is a haunted doll. So you need some kind of like

557
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,840
certified 100% haunted. Yeah. Like still.

558
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:16,320
Uh, what you could do is just head on over to the electronic bay and search banishing kit.

559
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:22,080
Oh yeah. And you've got 17 different, uh, results for different ways to, now here's the one thing

560
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:27,840
that does trouble me a little bit about these 17 different banishing kits is that they're all wildly

561
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:33,280
different, which almost makes me wonder, you know, are they effective?

562
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,360
You want, there's 17 different kinds of spirits. OVS.

563
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:43,360
Yeah. Fire type, water type, grass type, ground type, dark type, steel type, fairy type, dragon

564
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:51,840
type, ice type, flying type, bug type, psychic. Oh, oh, it's getting real in there. Oh God. I hope

565
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:57,200
that's, I hope that that buzz saw is being used on, on ceramic and not on carn flash.

566
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,800
Uh, well that's going to do it for us folks. Thank you for joining us for another episode of

567
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,600
my brother, my brother and me. Uh, we hope you had, sorry, Travis, did you have something that

568
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,600
you wanted to interrupt to say? Well, I just, some people tune out during the housekeeping

569
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,480
and I wanted to let everyone know we're coming up on our 300th episode and I'm working on like a

570
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:26,960
project for it, a sound collage. So if you would like to, you can email mbmbammemories at gmail.com

571
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,400
with a 10 to 15 second sound clip of you saying, since I started listening to my brother,

572
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:40,320
my brother and me, blank, thanks mbmbam. And it would be great if the blank was filled in.

573
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,800
What if only bad things have happened to them since they started listening?

574
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,760
That's great. As long as it's not really a bummer, it's gotta be funny or sincere,

575
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:56,000
but no bummers. Just the general, no bummers. Uh, cool. So, um, I don't know what to say.

576
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,200
What do we say? Um, thank you.

577
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,360
I think we say thank you. Thank you once again for everybody who came out for the max fun drive.

578
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:08,000
Um, this year we wrapped up with like 8,600 new and upgrading donors, which is like,

579
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,640
we, I mean, our original goal was 5,000. So y'all crushed it. Um, thank you so, so much.

580
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:20,240
Um, we'll keep doing the damn thing. We'll keep expanding, launching new, exciting projects.

581
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,240
Um, watch this space.

583
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:33,600
this week is still buffering with Justin's wife, Sydney, uh, and her sister Riley.

584
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,560
They put out some real club banger episodes during the max fun drive. I especially enjoyed

585
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:45,200
the how to music episode, uh, made me feel very nostalgic and very out of touch at the same time.

586
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,920
That's that show's jam. That's what they do there.

587
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:53,920
Um, and it's wild finding out how the kids are doing things nowadays cause it's like,

588
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,640
it's out there.

589
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:00,000
Just to hear Sydney talk about like mixtapes and Riley's reactions to them made me very happy.

590
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,600

596
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,680
putting the days to bed. It's a wonderful song, catchy tune.

597
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:28,000
Uh, so that's it. Griffin, do you have a last Yahoo? Something that we can really think about

598
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:28,480
and chew on.

599
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,760
I got a final Yahoo here and it was, uh, sent in by, I still have this tab for dingus day open.

600
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:38,480
I still can't believe it. Um, sent in by Ethan McDermott. Thank you, Ethan. It's by Yahoo

601
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:46,160
answers user. Sorry, something's gone wrong. Dan, Dan asks, I ate a whole can of baked beans.

602
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:52,880

603
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,880
My name is Justin McElroy.

604
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,680

00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,560
I'm Griffin McElroy.

606
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:17,200
This has been my brother. My brother may kiss your dad's square on the lips.

607
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,040
Maximum fun.org.

608
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,080
Comedy and culture.

00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,200
Artist owned.

610
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,640
Listener supported.

611
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,440
The three of you went to a cave of a big red dragon and is standing over a hoard of precious

612
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:32,240
golden rubies. And he says, what do you do adventures? I'm a dragon man.

613
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,000
I cast fire on him. It's very good.

614
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I addressed the red dragon to say us. We're the hosts of the adventure zone,

615
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,200
a podcast about family playing Dungeons and Dragons.

616
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,120
Very good synergy. Commit to the bit.

617
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:49,520
I, I rolled to charm new listeners. It is very effective against all odds.

618
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,560
Everybody where the macro is we host the adventure zone to podcasts where we play

619
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,960
Dungeons and Dragons together. It's a comedy podcast.

620
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,080
We don't take the rules too seriously because there's a lot of them and we did not take the

621
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,360
time to learn them. Maybe listen to us.

622
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,000
We come out every other Thursday on the maximum fun network.

623
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,800
You can find us on iTunes or on maximum fun.org.

624
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:20,080
I think this promo is a critical hit.
