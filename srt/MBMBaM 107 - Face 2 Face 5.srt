Hello Maximum Fun Convention. Ladies and gentlemen, it's 10 a.m. on a Sunday, the funny hour. The

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,200
best weekend of your life is ending. You got three hours of sleep last night and you have

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,740
a double hangover. Who's ready to laugh? Let's chuckle up, people. Let's do this. Chuckle

4
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:32,440
up and deal. How was everybody's fancy dress party? You're just cheering. We need answers.

5
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,520
Yeah, I need specifics. Everyone shout a detail all at once. Everyone looks so wonderful.

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:49,920
Sexy? Did anybody get any camp strange? If not, it's not too late. We have bathrooms

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,160
all over the place. It's a very open show. It's a very permissive environment. Just keep

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:04,480
it down. Unless we stop being funny and then distract away. So we, no intimidation or anything,

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,440
but we're the last thing that happens at Max Fun Con. The good news is we haven't seen

10
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:20,880
anybody who's way funnier than us for the past 48 hours. But one of the things we learned

11
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,920
from watching some of the shows we've seen, like great shows like Riff Tracks, Jordan

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,920
Jessica, the stand up show last night, and Susan Lee, everybody married, usually people

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,120
like buy me some time. Listen, we have a long show to get through. There's still a notepad

14
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,480
up here that says pussy on it, by the way. Cool, cool. One of the things that we learned

15
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:47,560
while we were watching some of these other shows is that preparation is so important.

16
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,000
So I realized we should have done some. So I made, in conjunction with the boys, I made

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,520
this presentation about some of the things that we should have prepared. By the way,

18
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,400
Max is my brother, my brother and me live, face to face five, the fifth element, which

19
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,760
is laughing. And I'm your little brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your sweet, sweet baby

20
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,240
brother, Griffin McElroy. So presentation. First thing that I should, that we should

21
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:30,480
have prepared, a PowerPoint. No one uses this at all. And you're tech savvy. Sure, sure.

22
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,040
That's what that means. I got these with the PowerPoint Linda class that I took online.

23
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,480
So that's thing number one, a PowerPoint. Lots of the shows had those, and we should

24
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:51,400
have done one because it looked great. A second thing, breaks. This is important because this

25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,240
is a long show, and Jordan and Jesse left for a while. That would have been good. I

26
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,920
had no idea we could do that. Didn't know that was an option. Yeah, did not know that

27
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,480
was an option to do a cinematic entertainment. That's a great idea. Like 10 minutes. You

28
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,120
want to be funny. That would be like sweet, sweet water. If somebody on your podcast,

29
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,080
and unlikely cases, they have irritable bowels. Yeah. Unlikely case if you're on a podcast,

30
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,240
not nobody up here. Yeah. Maybe traveling upsets your little guy. Tell me. It's actually

31
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,660
the it's, it's the, it's the height up here on the mountain here at the fucking throat

32
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,880
of the world. It's the, the air is really, is that the correct term? Throat of the world

33
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:36,040
high schools, right? These kids are going to school in Game of Thrones. Musical interludes.

34
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,640
This is good because people always like those. And again, it gives the people of an irritable

35
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,120
bowel a chance to, not a lot of time, but. If Jordan and Jesse go didn't go long enough,

36
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,520
Ashcon could have just kept repeating the chorus for like another 20 minutes and they

37
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,960
would have been fine. I have no, we have no such padding. If any of you know any songs,

38
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,440
you want to like hop up and don't do that. Don't do that. It's our, this is our fucking

39
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:12,300
time. It's our time. Speaking of this being our fucking time, famous guests. Okay. Usually

40
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:22,960
that's hard because they have to come to the place you're at. We literally could have spun

41
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,120
around three times and gone, you. We could have put honey on our hands and caught three

42
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,000
guests. Now here's the thing. Here's the trick though. Here's the important, important bit

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,240
about this. We talked about this one. We just didn't want to share the attention. It's like

44
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,160
to be, let's be honest, the funniest person in a room and for 48 hours you have to watch

45
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,960
other. Thank you, ladies. A little less uproarious next time. Others know that this morning I

46
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,920
might have accidentally when talking to Cameron Esposito referred to myself as the funniest

47
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,640
person in the room. It's one of those things that pops out of your head and immediately

48
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,720
go, Oh, I'm a douche. And then it's at max. You're lucky if you're the funniest person

49
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:21,840
in your jacket. So we didn't want to share the attention. We also, if we fail so, so

50
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,160
miserably, we don't want to drag anybody else down. Exactly. Speaking of failing miserably,

51
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,840
the last thing we should have prepared is jokes. Many people had jokes written. It was

52
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,060
like a theme. It was a theme of preparing funny things to say. So if it doesn't pan

53
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,280
out like that, we didn't know that was part of the rules. That was not in our packet that

54
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:53,160
we could prepare jokes ahead of time. So instead we're just going to do what we normally do

55
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:01,560
and take your queries and turn them alchemy like into wisdom as well as answer some questions

56
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:09,280
from the horrible, horrible people on the Yahoo Answers service. You guys want a Yahoo

57
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,720
right now? Yeah. Ready? Guys, it's not to you. It's to us. No, but hey, do you want

58
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,040
a Yahoo? This Yahoo was sent in by Steve Lewis. Thank you, Steve. It's by Yahoo Answers user

59
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:34,400
Bob123. Bob4562003. Cool, cool. 2000 other two guys. Bob and then all those numbers asks,

60
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,900
I often fantasize about my wife transforming into the She-Hulk. Is there any real way to

61
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:48,520
make this happen? I had a dream about her transforming into the She-Hulk and was wondering

62
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,840
if there is any scientific way to make her really transform into a She-Hulk or a She-Hulk

63
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:04,440
like creature. It would be amazing to watch her turn green, grow huge muscles and watches

64
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:13,240
her body burst through her clothes. I will pay any amount. I know a foolproof way to

65
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:23,000
make that happen. Leave the toilet seat up. That's the kind of caliber of joke you get

66
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,280
here at Maximum Fun Con. We've been prepping for this and I've done that joke three times

67
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:36,400
and it has not worked any time and yet I persist. I'm like Lawrence of Arabia. I'm really glad

68
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,720
that this gentleman, Bob, asking this question clarifies that money is no object. Yeah. That's

69
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,760
a weird cross-section. How rare is it for somebody to be obscenely rich that money truly

70
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,160
is no object. I'm a billionaire playboy. They also have a creepy She-Hulk finish. I just

71
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,480
like the idea that the only thing that's been holding this back from being scientifically

72
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:04,800
possible is the cost. Sure. It comes down to you're going to need your wife's consent.

73
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,280
That's number one, guys. Don't try to push this through. It's going to take years of

74
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,840
cross-fit training to really rip and blast. That's a very slow transformation. I think

75
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,300
this guy is very clear about wanting her to go from 90-pound weakling to 200-pound muscle

76
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,080
beast that can tear apart his house. You're also going to have to get her green, which

77
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,680
is I guess paint, I guess is the best way to do that. I would assume so. I've never

78
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,240
performed this act. This is not my... It's great though because once you get her there,

79
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:42,800
you can act out your She-Hulk fantasies or your Blanca fantasies. Sure. I guess Jolly

80
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,060
Green Giant is a... That's one. You could have her not paint her body green and then

81
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:52,760
she could just be Lou Ferrigno. I'm sure there's some people who would enjoy that. He's a very

82
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:59,440
nice man. Yeah. And my wife already doesn't listen. What's that mean? In the show? It's

83
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:06,040
Lou Ferrigno. Oh no. Oh no. Stupid. All the best jokes you have to tell people why it's

84
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,760
funny. There's a comedy scene. This is a wannabe comedian convention, right? There's your first

85
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:19,240
lesson. The best punchlines have to be explained. Cross-ditch it somewhere. Did I put vodka

86
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,680
in this? No. I have some actual questions that people have actually asked us. People

87
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,360
who listen to the show, not just randos on Yahoo Answers. Don't you judge me. Oh no.

88
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:37,520
Griffin's laugh. Who brought the dork? Sorry, everyone. Can someone run to the kitchen just

89
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:43,280
real quick and get some... Just run to the kitchen real quick. Can anyone take off his

90
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:51,920
shirt and just... Does anyone have a Swiffer wet jet? Just an old t-shirt. Have you had

91
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:59,440
a mishap? I'll use the pussy paper. By which I mean the paper that says pussy on it and

92
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,200
not something else. Just blot it up with that. I always imagine that if something goes wrong

93
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,720
with these things, you can say it in that voice and something will happen. It's our

94
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,120
fifth show and this is the first thing that's gone wrong. I think that's okay. Yeah. So

95
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:19,440
anyway, questions from actual real people. First question. My fiance and I are getting

96
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,680
married on September 1st and we're having a bit of dilemma on our hands. We want a kid's

97
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,420
free wedding, but we don't know how to nicely tell family members to leave their youngsters

98
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:33,640
at home. We don't want to beat around the bush or be blunt. The last thing we want is...

99
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,600
Okay. The last thing we want... That means contrary thing. The last thing we want is

100
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,840
for a bunch of children to show up because we were too vague. Whether this is accomplished

101
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,920
by indication on our invitations or through another method, I leave it in your hands.

102
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,560
Chris from Burlington. Quick note, I have made it very clear you should leave nothing

103
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,680
in our hands. That's a bad place to leave a thing. Yeah. We have those big clumsy like

104
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:04,960
linny hands and we'll just pet it to death. Thanks, Demetri. Demetri got that, everyone.

105
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:12,160
It's from a book, you guys. I thought you guys were nerds. So here's thing one, clown

106
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,680
at the door, I think is going to be... Just put station a clown right there. No kid's

107
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,680
going to come through that threshold. You kidding me? But then you're going to need

108
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,000
an extra storage facility to scare the frightened children. Oh yeah. Like a corral, you mean?

109
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,440
Yeah, yeah. Something the clown can drive them into. Yeah. Yeah. Move along. Move along,

110
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:42,280
Skyler. That's a kid's name, right, Skyler? Jesus. Jesus. Help us, Jesus. Is it possible,

111
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:48,000
could you maybe put on the wedding invitation, the normal stuff, Max and Susie are getting

112
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,440
married this Sunday at the church. It's going to be real cool. I hope they have more notice

113
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,520
than this Sunday. Sunday, Sunday, Sunday. Max and Lindsey are going to holy matrimony.

114
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,880
It's pretty last minute, but we don't really like each other all that much. But on the

115
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,040
invitation, can you also include, we'll have fish or chicken if you want that, and it's

116
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,680
going to be real beautiful. And also we both just found out we're sterile. Wait a minute.

117
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,800
And if you bring your kids, it's going to be a constant reminder as you walk down the

118
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,120
aisle. Why would you think they would mention that they're sterile if not for a goof? Right.

119
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,720
So they're mentioning it so that everyone else will feel really bad about bringing their

120
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,160
children. About bringing their children. That's correct. But thank you for joining us at our

121
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,000
day of holy matrimony. Yeah. Right. We're glad you could be here. What is the problem?

122
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,040
What do kids do? Is it they spill pudding? Is that the problem? That's it. We're going

123
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,280
to have a giant pudding fountain at our wedding, and we're really worried about these kids

124
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,120
getting into it. Although I don't think a kid could take the reality of a chocolate

125
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,760
fountain, which is very popular at weddings now. If you say a kid, show a kid like, it's

126
00:12:49,760 --> 00:13:03,840
infinite. Maybe that's it. Just let them melt down at the door. Get some smelling salts.

127
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:11,520
Would this necessitate the adoption of a flower man? Just like walking down the aisle like,

128
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:23,000
hey, what's up? Petals. Petals. Or unless you can build a Vicky. Build a small wonder

129
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:31,880
Vicky to be your flower girl. Topical. We're hitting all the big pop culture hits. Oh man.

130
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,560
Next up, Turner and Hooch. Don't miss those goofs.

131
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,840
Here's a Yahoo answer. It's sent in by Christian Vezina. Thank you, Christian. It's by Yahoo

132
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:49,320
answers user Ross, who asks, getting my dog medical marijuana. Help. Stick with it. It

133
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,400
starts off kind of sad, but okay. Okay. My dog has a sore and it won't heal. My dog may

134
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:03,840
have cancer. I looked up dog sores, not healing, and that is a sign of cancer. All right. Still

135
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,680
going. I need to get my dog THC to help fight off the possible cancer and help with the

136
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,160
pain from the sore. I am on probation, so I can't fail my drug test. The weed is strictly

137
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,660
for my dog. It will be her first time. Should I buy swag or some good weed? I don't know

138
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,240
if I should get her super stoned being her first time. And that's from teach the dog

139
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,800
to smoke. Can I take a quick medical timeout before we get too deep into this? I'm just

140
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,320
going to ask my wife, Sydney, do you smoke people with cancer? You smoke weed. Are they

141
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:46,000
sitting at the party? Are you good? Um, is it because it has cancer fighting agents or

142
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,840
is it to distract from the fact you have cancer? Shit. Really? What? Okay. So the guy is confused

143
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,960
about dogs don't know anything. They don't have to be distracted from the depression.

144
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,840
One day they go to sleep. Nevermind. I'm not gonna talk about, I'm not going to talk about

145
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:13,120
dogs dying this show. Tune in next week. The thorniness of this situation, uh, is that

146
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,480
first of all, it's, it's totally contrived. You're obviously, you're obviously trying

147
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,160
to get some weed for yourself in a very perplexingly roundabout way. No, I would like to be at that

148
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,680
probation hearing. Listen, it's secondhand. My dog has cancer. You asshole. I was getting

149
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,160
my dog wicked high. Who feels bad now? He doesn't have thumbs. He can't hold the bong

150
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:41,400
and the hot dogs. That's the problem. That's just it though. The dog, if you can't fail

151
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,000
your drug test, you're going to have to teach the dog how to smoke weed and teach them how

152
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,640
to hold it together. You're going to have to teach the dog to smoke weed in another

153
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:58,040
room by itself so that you don't get the sweet, sweet wafting. Listen, my nanny can't work

154
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:04,640
a DVD player. How's my dog supposed to start fear and loving in Las Vegas? I love that.

155
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,640
I love the mental image of like your dog becoming like a shitty college roommate, like hangs

156
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,840
out and smokes weed in his room all day. Like, Hey man, you want some? Like, you know I'm

157
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:18,200
on probation. If you want to listen to some Incubus, it's going to be real cool. You know

158
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,720
I'm on probation. I can't listen to Incubus. Is that a weed band? Incubus? Is it still

159
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:31,440
a band? Wow. Not a lot of Incubus fans. Maybe the wrong demographic here. I want to take

160
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:39,720
everybody inside the joke for a second. I just, I just, I was up here and I decided

161
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,280
to make that joke about fear and loathing in Las Vegas and I had a good 10 or 15 second

162
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,720
panic attack where I was thinking to myself, please don't say the one where Nick Cage

163
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,780
drinks himself to death and please don't say the one where Nick Cage jumps out of an airplane

164
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:58,120
dressed as Elvis. Please say the right movie that has Vegas in it. So I'm glad it panned

165
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:04,760
out and if it, if that was wrong, please don't tell me. I'll never realize it. It was right

166
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,840
by the way. It was a good thing. You did a good goof. Thanks. That was the best goof.

167
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,360
It was a BTR goof, but at least I didn't. No, that was like A plus. Why are we drinking

168
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:23,360
screwdrivers? I mean, I'm very appreciative for the screwdrivers because it gives daddy

169
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,160
his courage, but I already have so much acid in my stomach from the past 48 hours. I think

170
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,520
the thing is we're gonna, we're gonna go mimosas and we didn't have the prep to get it together.

171
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:43,600
We were too lazy to make mimosas. We got an open stove. Liza Minnelli makes mimosas and

172
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,080
we can't be bothered. She's still out there. And she's fucking lazy? What are you saying

173
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,880
about Liza Minnelli? No, she's a hell of a performer. You should, and you should see

174
00:17:50,880 --> 00:18:01,560
those gams. Fuck you. Listen, day in, day out at the Palms Casino. She's doing a show

175
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,120
there and it is, she does all the hits. She even does a touching tribute to her mom. There's

176
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:15,280
a hologram of Judy Garland. There's some weird phenomena of laughter happening. It's a big

177
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,920
hologram audience. It makes perfect sense. Guys, real quick, I want to talk about Comedy

178
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:26,200
Bang Bang. It's a new TV show that starts this Friday at 10, 9 central on IFC. It's a half

179
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,520
hour comedy show hosted by Scott Aukerman, who is hilarious, with guests like Amy Poehler.

180
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,840
This Friday, it's got Zach Galifianakis who discusses what would happen if dogs could talk.

181
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,140
Tune in. Hey, so, uh, uh, uh, we have a question asked from somebody who is here and they can

182
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,040
feel free to raise their hand if they like. We're not. If you're ashamed to be a part

183
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,280
of this, I understand. I don't mind. It's about, it's about butt sores. I don't, I don't know.

184
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,040
I'm sorry. I was going to say, no, it's not about butt sores. I'm sorry. It's about being

185
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,240
on, Griffin had to excuse himself from the podcast for a minute. It's about being on

186
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:05,380
job hunt. Does anyone want to claim it? Okay. It is you. Okay. Hey, you got it right. Um,

187
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,680
so Lindsay asks, I'm currently on the job hunt and it is the worst. I graduated with

188
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,960
BFA in theater design and technology a few years ago and although I really love it, I

189
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,800
felt the stability of a more traditional job. The only non theater job experience I have

190
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,080
is one of a brief customer service gig. So my resume is pretty sparse. At this point

191
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,580
I'm down for anything more or less. What should I do? That's from Lindsay. Um, do you know

192
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,000
anything about making PowerPoint presentations and booking famous people? I'm making people

193
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,520
not like nervous in front of other people. Yeah. Reminding us to take our pepsi. Yeah.

194
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,320
Slapping drinks out of our hand the night before we perform. You have to be funny in

195
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:49,400
eight hours. Uh, so when you say theater designs, it's pretty broad. Where was it like lights

196
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:55,080
costume? Hey guys, I happen to know a little bit about theater. All right. That's, this

197
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:05,280
should make for great. It happens to be my profession. Lighting. Ah, that sucks. What's

198
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,040
your point? A computer can do that nowadays. Learn, learn to build things. Computers can't

199
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:18,320
do that yet. Yet. What if she learned to build the computers? What do you know about computers?

200
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:29,760
I've had a computer thing or like a snake. You're learning about pythons. Well, if you

201
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:36,080
know pythons, since Jack Hanna would love to have you come on. We actually need a new

202
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,680
Python lady, which isn't a job so much as it's a title. It's very, it's very, it's very

203
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:49,040
close to a Carney. Um, the Python lady. But, uh, listen, I didn't appreciate how much you

204
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,920
guys laughed at us for not knowing about Python. This is the wrong, but I guess when I did

205
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:05,800
a Skyrim goof earlier that a Python would probably fucking guys. Tough crowd. This is

206
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:16,360
awesome. So let me pull it back in. You're the one I turned to to reel it back in. I'll

207
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:22,440
be the anchor of this team once more. Um, so anything, it's not a theater job. So like

208
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,400
every other job. Yeah. Can you travel back in time and retroactively study a different

209
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:34,520
profession? I guess it's like literally anything else. I mean, they're probably human beings.

210
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,600
The only thing that human beings, I watched a documentary on Netflix about eyeballs. You

211
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:47,600
don't see like people, you see the light refracting off of the people. So you are responsible

212
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:55,280
for all human sight. So like any other thing, any other job depends on lighting. So I guess

213
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:04,000
just say that to an employer at Arby's. And so Mr. CEO, this ends my presentation on eyeballs.

214
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,880
I will look. It's eyeballs colon. Please hire me. I will look for my first paycheck. Uh,

215
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:21,200
so have we helped you? Uh, are you rich and famous out? We, we, uh, you can do this. This

216
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,600
is easy. It takes literally nothing. It takes literally no degrees that qualifies to do

217
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:33,600
this. Um, so that didn't go over well. Yeah. Jesus. You could all do it right now. That's

218
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,160
who wants to trade out. I will tag you in. I would love to just catch like a 20 minute

219
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,040
power nap to be completely honest. Uh, this Yahoo answer was sent in by Krista Whelan.

220
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:49,120
Thank you Krista. It's by Yahoo answers user Alphonse who asks, would you attend church

221
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:58,400
more if they served pizza for communion ceremony? Only if it was bagel bites. Yeah. I would

222
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,960
go for the pizza alone. The heck with their dead guy gods and their mythologies. I would

223
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,880
be good just long enough for the pizza and beer. It's a little, was that you or the,

224
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,760
no, no, no. I, you know, you know where my heart is. It's with both Jesus and pizza,

225
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,480
which is why I could be so, so down with this idea. I think this is the kind of reinvention

226
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,040
that the modern church needs. Right. Well then why stop there? If you're going to do

227
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:28,080
like pizza for the community, why not make like a, instead of the wine, some Josta. Yeah.

228
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:34,760
Six people know what Josta is. Josta! With Guarana. I think, I think it's, I think it's

229
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,560
definitely time to turn up the heat because all we've had for a while is churches trying

230
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,560
to lure young people in with like, check it out. We got acoustic guitars now. Did you

231
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:47,360
see? Um, I think we need to make churches as, as. Like what? Like give me some, what

232
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,560
are some innovations? What's going to make it. When I say rad church, what do you think?

233
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,480
Like a right. What if it was a righteous church and we could say righteous both in the Jeezy

234
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:02,880
way and then like the surfboard way, like first United Methodist righteous church. Give

235
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,440
me some, what's at the righteous church? What can I entertain? You can have like, uh, you

236
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:13,400
can have bagel bites instead of communion, Josta instead of wine. Um, what? Skyrim. Skyrim.

237
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:19,400
Sure. You can have kids love. Skyrim in place of what? Like the Bible? Or like it's one

238
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,080
in and one out kind of thing. You can't just add it. You can have a, you can have a water

239
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,560
slide that goes into the basically you want to make a church as though it's run by the

240
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:41,440
kid from blank check. What if God had a million dollars? What if God were a call kid and he

241
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,120
had a million dollars? What wouldn't he do? No, no, no, no. Oh, it looks like I ran over

242
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:54,000
God's bike. Here's a million dollars. Thanks, Carla Gugino. Hey, by the way, what if God

243
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,880
had a Carla Gugino? Uh, the movie Blank Check if you haven't seen it has a love affair between

244
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:07,440
a 10 year old kid and Carla Gugino. It's a pretty messed up movie. Scott, there's a lot

245
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,400
of blank check fans. I'm learning so much about like three people in this audience.

246
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:21,160
Yeah. Um, so another question here from a, a, a, a listener of ours. I have a friend

247
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:30,520
who will be getting a puppy soon. She is excited. I would like her friends and family. She would

248
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:45,960
like her friends and family to attend a puppy shower. We're ready Quetzalcoatl. Come get

249
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:55,560
us a puppy shower. I'll a baby shower. It's so wicked. Not a baby shower. Yeah. The extent

250
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,600
to which it's not a baby shower. Come on guys, I'm having a taco shower. I'm going to make

251
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,480
a taco and then I'm going to eat it. Come bring me gifts. Guess the flavor. That's right.

252
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:16,320
It's taco. The best part came with taco showers. Um, so it's a baby shower and they says in

253
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:23,920
parentheses, gifts are expected. I refuse to participate in this and all puppy themed

254
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:31,000
events. I anticipate invites to fur further puppy at birthdays, graduations and wedding

255
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,720
parties. Wait, what? We have a hard time pushing through gay marriage, but puppy marriage is

256
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:49,360
totally cool. As long as it's between a girl puppy and a guy puppy. Um, God damn it. How

257
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,080
can I decline politely? And when she asked, explain my decision without hurting her feelings

258
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,840
or telling her she's crazy. And that's from pup P kicker. Um, that's a little, that's

259
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,840
taking a little too far. It's a little too much. Uh, I kind of feel like if someone gives

260
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,880
you an invitation to a puppy shower, it is actually an invitation to end your relationship

261
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:16,220
with them to, to, to discontinue your association. Like, Hey, this is your out. Uh, you're not

262
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:22,360
just explain it to them. Like, no, no, that's dumb. You're a stupid person. What kind of

263
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,280
friend are you? If you don't let them know when they're doing or know the war, you wouldn't

264
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,480
come to my taco shower and you expect me to roll up to your puppy shower. This, this thing

265
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,600
is the worst thing that you're doing and I'm your friend. So I'm going to tell you, that's

266
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,600
really your only two options. Either you discontinue the relationship, which listen, that's where

267
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,800
I'm leaning, but I don't have, you know, I, you know, your friend didn't save me and I'm,

268
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,240
I don't know what it was that is keeping the two of you tied together. It's very easy for

269
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,480
me from my position here at the throat of the world to tell you to end this relationship.

270
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,680
Um, additional details. My friend once saved my life. Yeah, right. Uh, yeah, that makes

271
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,880
it adds up. You either have to, you either have to end the relationship or talk your

272
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:08,200
friend out of this. It's the worst. You get a puppy and it's like, just go with, like,

273
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,160
just be at my house now. You're a puppy. Can I, can I throw some, some ideas, spaghetti

274
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,880
against the wall and we'll see if it sticks. Yes. There's my idea. Spaghetti out. Just

275
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:24,400
picture in your mind's eye, uh, a puppy in like a Justin's graduation robe. And I like

276
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:32,640
tell me that you couldn't, you couldn't get down with that. Okay. All right. I could go

277
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,120
that far, but I think once we get to like puppy gift registries, I think I would probably

278
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:46,840
have to back out. Puppy funerals. I know I'm not. You were all on board when we're against

279
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,800
the birthday. If we're going to create something, you're all in favor of the funeral, right?

280
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,680
You're right. If we're formal, if we're like, if we're building these codified ceremonies

281
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:00,480
for puppy events, it will be fucked up not to do funerals for you. I told Griffin that

282
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,160
we couldn't pull it back from ending a question about we're going to try everything about

283
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:12,880
puppy caskets and how tiny and adorable they would be. Go on. Think about it. And you're

284
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,360
laughing. The casket would have four saddles on it so that four smaller puppies could carry

285
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:38,640
it. Hey guys. Yeah. I'd like to slow it down for a minute from time to time. Whenever I

286
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,720
decide that the crowd is special enough, I like to create a little something for them.

287
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:53,520
So I've written, fuck this. Oh, God damn it. So I've written a mad lib. He's written a

288
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,240
sad lib. It's a sad lib. Don't let him ever try to convince you otherwise. I've written

289
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:03,320
a mad lib. Yeah, actually he wrote a jumble of words and you all made it sad. And everybody

290
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:09,560
here, they contributed words. And it's because you people are also special to me and I love

291
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,600
you so much. You do a sad lib voice when you're trying to get into it. I'm trying to be as

292
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,000
pathetic as possible so people won't beat me up. Mission accomplished. So I made you

293
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,240
this thing from my heart. Okay, now if you're not that familiar with that show, here's a

294
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,200
few things you should know about this bit. It's not funny. We stopped doing it. We stopped

295
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,080
doing it. You know why? It's not funny. I made it because I care about you all. It's

296
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,600
just that you're so special to me. And I made so many friends this weekend and I feel like

297
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,200
this is a safe place where people can just be themselves and we don't have to be afraid.

298
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:49,000
And so I decided it's a page and a half long, but it's from my heart. And I'd like you all

299
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,040
to join me on this rollercoaster. I'm on Facebook on my computer while you do this. Okay. Your

300
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,760
girlfriend's gonna write on Facebook about how good it is while I do it. He's gonna live

301
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,320
Facebook my mad lib. I wish I could poke this bit to death. I am. I don't actually want

302
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:11,260
to be sitting here and be associated. Okay. They don't want to be swept into the glow

303
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:17,960
because I love you so much. I love you all. I love you all so much. So this is a special

304
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:28,040
thing that I've written for you, my friends. And so he goes a little something like this

305
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:33,740
and it's, it's all about Max Fun Con because you guys are so special to me. Each and every

306
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:46,640
one of you. I am. And it goes a little something like this. Um, and basically how mad live

307
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:55,760
works. And so if anybody needs to know, we'll talk about it afterwards. I'll tell you all

308
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:11,080
about it. Um, it was a scrumptious and salty day at Max Fun Con. The tuba had risen and

309
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:16,440
all the dinosaurs were chirping. Jesse looked down from his library on high and watched

310
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,640
all the cats attending the conference as they began flying one another. He smiled to himself

311
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,400
flyingly. Now I want to take a short break from the narrative here to thank the person

312
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:34,200
that gave me both of those words. When suddenly David Reese punched into the room, sir, the

313
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:50,920
bears are fisting the horse. Are you laughing with me or at me? And the unicorn has already

314
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:58,760
slept. And if we don't exsanguinate the shoehorn soon, then this whole place could push. But

315
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:05,600
Jim, but Jesse simply macerated and placed his and placed his elbow on David Reese's

316
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:18,160
spleen. Don't you worry. He traipsed. It's all going according to diving board. And if

317
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:25,440
anyone would like a copy of that, it'll be available in my book coming out soon. There's

318
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:35,120
orange juice everywhere. Who did this? I hope it's available in your obituary. He doesn't

319
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,080
mean it. I mean, he doesn't know how to express himself. That's exactly. No, I said exactly

320
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:49,720
what I'm saying. Hey, do you want to I heard you guys laughing. Please don't do that. Next

321
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,080
time, like when you're here at Max Fun Con 2015 and you're having to hear one of these

322
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,800
again, like you're saying they're going to skip three years because of how terrible that

323
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:12,720
was. No comedy can grow here anymore. There really is nothing worse than choking at the

324
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,320
throat of the world. Maybe the elevation has something to do with the reason why people

325
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,240
were laughing because the oxygen, they're so oxygen deprived. They can laugh at anything.

326
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,760
These are the same people who thought dead puppies was hysterical. I mean, I worked that

327
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:32,520
into like a, you know, if I didn't know better, you don't. This Yahoo answer was sent in by

328
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:38,800
phallic, which isn't spelled the dirty way. I was asked by Yahoo answers user V who asks,

329
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:53,800
how do you eat a hot pocket? Additional details. I always get burned frowny face. Now the top

330
00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:03,040
answer on this one was let it cool down. Oh, yeah. Much easier. That would be much better

331
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,600
than what I do, but I need the hot pocket right now. I'm so hungry. Uh, Griffin, I have

332
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:14,680
a method. Oh, good. This is legit. And you guys can cool it with your tears. I don't

333
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:26,960
need hot pockets. I lean pockets cause I'm an adult. Just the worst. See, it's a, it's

334
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,520
a pro method. You'd buy a corner off and then you buy it another corner. By the way, when

335
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,440
I'm done explaining this, can I get a round of applause? If anybody else imagined here,

336
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,240
this also, you buy two quarters off and then you blow in one and create a steam chair.

337
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:58,800
Do not celebrate his hot pocket ocarina alone. Can you open face a hot pocket? Is that, I

338
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,600
don't know that there are, maybe you could food process it and then put it in like another

339
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:11,360
thing. I don't judge him. You don't know him. You laughed at Travis' dumb thing. I know.

340
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:19,560
I use every part of the hot pocket. The best bits are left on the sleeve after you microwave

341
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,920
and not a lot of people know this. The first step with any hot pocket is you shear the

342
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:30,040
crust off to get to the filling inside. Sure, sure. You get the hot pocket rind off. I think

343
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:36,720
the saddest thing that I've done with a hot pocket. Oh God. This will be great. I think

344
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,840
the second saddest thing I've done with a hot pocket is, uh, sometimes I'll decide I'm

345
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,680
going to have a hot pocket and you know what that decision feels like, but then I'll put

346
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:51,120
it in the oven. I know I'm going to be hungry in 30 minutes. I'm going to take the time

347
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,800
and really make this hot pocket right. That is no joke. The fucking saddest thing I've

348
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:06,880
ever heard. Cause you could put anything else in that oven. Cause what you're doing is cooking.

349
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,920
That is cooking. That is what cooking is. You got, you have, I do. I put a little, um,

350
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:19,240
Parmesan on there. You fucking, you fucking chop and screw the hot pocket. No, this is

351
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:25,800
the second saddest thing I've ever done with a hot pocket. Not the first. I always get

352
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:34,080
burned. Three people over here knew what that was. How long do you guys cook hot pockets?

353
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,880
Two 15. Two 15? That's what it says on the foil. No, Sydney does two 15. I do one 50.

354
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:46,000
I like a little al dente. You like a little pink. You like a medium rare. You like your

355
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,280
hot pocket bleeding. Which is good. Cause that's pretty much what they do no matter

356
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:56,160
what. Al dente of course is French for sloppy. I like that. I like that. That cheese to just

357
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,920
sort of glop out. I don't like it all piping hot. What you're describing is the hot pockets

358
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:08,200
natural state of being. I'll eat them raw. I don't care. Hey, wait, like, like a hot

359
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:15,840
pocket you find raw in nature? Yeah. That's how, that's how the devil tempted Eve. Plucked

360
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:20,120
a hot pocket off the knowledge tree. The tree of the knowledge of yourself. Tree of the

361
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:24,540
knowledge of how desperately alone all of us are. My wife and I are expecting our first

362
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:29,000
child soon and we're torn over names if we have a baby boy. I don't remember adding this

363
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,720
question to the list. Well, we both like some names now, but my wife has suggested naming

364
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:40,320
our child Griffin. She's in love with the name and wants it to be, wants it even more

365
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,040
after listening to some of your fantastic podcasts. My question is, can my baby live

366
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:51,720
up to the supreme awesomeness that is the name? Signed from Griffin. Sincerely Griffin.

367
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:59,400
My concern is him falling short of the stratospheric level that MBMB AM's Griffin has set. I guess

368
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:05,320
Blake Griffin, he's a good basketball man. Uh, Peter Griffin, uh, please advise. That's

369
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:13,380
from perplexed, almost parent. Do you know how everybody thinks their kids the best?

370
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,320
Do you know how little anticipation you have to have your kids back? I hope he's as good

371
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:26,160
as that podcaster I like. He could be anything between here and here. Yeah, right. In this

372
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:35,520
narrow range of kid. I think that this is a availed plea for me to, uh, take this person's

373
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:43,480
child under my wing to train them. Not like, I thought you meant like for protective services.

374
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,920
Do you mean like, you mean like more of a rumple still skin situation where you show

375
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,160
up? I have not read it. I have not read the story, but you spend some stuff into stuff

376
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,760
and then you take the baby. Wait, what was the end game in rumble still skin? There is

377
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,880
no end game. It actually doesn't. He flies away on a spoon. It was mother goose's final,

378
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:11,480
uh, her unfinished. She didn't finish before she died. Mother goose died, everybody. How's

379
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:17,520
your Sunday? Match fun condo was good till the end. I'm saying I could be, I could give

380
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,040
this person artisanal Griffin training. Okay. You make the artisanal Griffin. I can show

381
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,960
not how to make an artisanal Griffin, how to be, how to just, I just love the thick

382
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:31,560
crust on the Griffin. It's so fresh. Oh, you can really taste the basil in the Griffin.

383
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:39,160
I can train them in the proper formula of hazelnut, like coffee mate to coffee to get

384
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:45,200
a fresh brew every morning. That's my only, that's my only fucking skill. Now you all

385
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,200
know the secret. Griffin, what you were describing is raising a child. Like you teach it the

386
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,840
things that you know, so it knows those things. Like, is that what you're saying? Like you

387
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:58,600
write raising a child. Like how long do you anticipate this process? Day game? I honestly,

388
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:05,080
I don't know that much shit. So maybe like a week and a half. Guys, I just got the latest

389
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:11,840
allure magazine and it is entirely dedicated to Snooki's vagina. Not again. It's called

390
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:18,040
Snooki puss. It's called allure, the Snooki puss fall issue. Why do they keep doing that?

391
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:24,560
I wish modern magazines would cater to my tastes. Like what? Like old buttons? Oh, with

392
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,800
the alley oop. With the commercial alley oop is Travis McElroy reading things off the internet

393
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,160
page that he has in front of him. Like Justin, would you say that you are more of a kooky

394
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,480
aunt or a cranky uncle? Kooky aunt. In terms of magazine consumption. I'm a hide the kids

395
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:50,280
uncle. Well, if you go to Penelope popsicle.com, you can get a magazine subscription from the

396
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,500
past for the modern magazine reader. Basically what it is, is say for this month instead

397
00:41:54,500 --> 00:42:01,240
of giving, getting a magazine from June 2012. The Snooki puss issue. The Snooki puss issue.

398
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:05,920
I hate you for making me say those words. You would get a June issue from some bygone

399
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,520
year in the past. So it's a pretty cool idea. And you just go to Penelope popsicle.com.

400
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,520
And included with each one's mailing is an exciting envelope of ephemera, which I think

401
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,440
is ectoplasm. I'm not 100% sure. It's dead people's hair. So I look forward to that.

402
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,480
They get the dead people and they take a hair from them and they put them in envelopes and

403
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:32,000
send them out for good. Every month. For omens. And now here's our jingle. Wait, oom bop pa

404
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,240
oom bop, oom bop pa oom bop. Penelope popsicle. New magazines are bullshit. You gotta get

405
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:45,760
those old magazines. They don't talk about vaginas of Snooki. There's a key change.

406
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:56,000
Of Snooki. Penelope popsicle.com.

407
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,320
Hi I'm Justin McElroy here for Extreme Restraints. I'm talking to my wife Sydney. Sydney, have

408
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,320
you gotten the distinct impression that things have gotten, you know, a little dull in the

409
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,720
bedroom? Well, I didn't want to say anything. Well, it's okay. I'm saying it for you. Sharing

410
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,880
is caring. Well, now that you mention it. Well, great news. I bought a plug to put in

411
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,440
your butt. I know what you're saying. Where did you get one of that size and contour?

412
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:28,600
Well, I got one at ExtremeRestraints.com. I use the coupon code MIDDLIST and got a 20%

413
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,920
off of my entire purchase area if you can believe it. How did you know that's just what

414
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:39,680
I wanted? Well, there's one thing I know. It's how to check a wish list that you hide

415
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:46,880
in your copy of Fifty Shades of Grey. So go to ExtremeRestraints.com and find things like

416
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,480
a giant tub of lube or a cage for your wiener. You know how you're always saying you'd like

417
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,600
to put my wiener in a cage? Well, I wasn't going to share that with everyone, but yeah.

418
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:01,520
It's too late. This is the internet and now everyone knows, but I got this cage. Look.

419
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,360
I'll unzip my pants and you can look at it. That's the most beautiful penis cage I've

420
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,880
ever seen. That's what marriage is all about. ExtremeRestraints.com. Thanks, guys. Go to

422
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,420
we do on this show sometimes, but we stopped doing it because it, again... Not very good.

423
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,080
Not very good. Not a good bit, but lots of people demanded its return. So ladies and

424
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:31,360
gentlemen... That's not how we intro this bit, though. Hey guys, what day is it? You

425
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,560
didn't answer my fucking question. According to my MacBook, it's Sunday, June 3rd, 2012.

426
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:43,000
Is it really June already? Where does the time go? This slow march towards death. This

427
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,360
is our first episode. We are releasing this, right? This isn't just a special... Let's

428
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:54,200
see how it goes. All right. This episode is our first episode in the month of June, so

429
00:44:54,200 --> 00:45:00,440
let's observe a few... I'll call them words of warning for monthly observances for the

430
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:08,020
month of June from the website BrownieLocks.com. No joke, I should have prepared this one.

431
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:16,920
Let's see. It is... Oh, God. Celibacy Awareness Month. I don't think anyone's not aware that

432
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:25,000
they're celibate. I don't think a moment goes by. Okay. Show of hands. Show of hands. No,

433
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,120
don't play. No, please don't. This show is depressing enough already. I'm just kidding.

434
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:38,160
I think all of you are getting it. Black Music Month. I'm sorry. Black Music Month. Jesus

435
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:49,080
Christ. It's International Surf Music Month. June is Turkey Lovers Month. It is... I think

436
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:57,600
Jeff just guessed, if I remember correctly, from the message board. It is Potty Training

437
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,680
Awareness Month. Okay, let's go with that. Okay. Potty Training Awareness Month. That's

438
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:08,440
the month that you make everybody terribly aware that you are in fact potty trained.

439
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,440
That's where you, when you meet someone on the street, say, oh yeah, I've got like a

440
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,200
wall of grape stickers every time. Don't even worry about it. I make the bad guys go in

441
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,840
the hole. It's not even a big deal. My daddy showed me where my pee pee goes. Oh, my boom

442
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:29,120
booms? Totally on lockdown. Don't worry about my boomers. They're going down the tubes.

443
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:35,980
There's a special chair that my daddy showed me where to sit to do my thing. That chair

444
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:46,000
goes on top of my daddy's toilet. He says it's only for big boys. So how are you enjoying

445
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,960
Max Fun Con? Okay, show of hands. How many of you are potty trained? Who up in this piece

446
00:46:51,960 --> 00:47:01,240
is potty trained? Not a lot. There's like a third of the audience is like, I don't,

447
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:09,400
I don't know. I'm like, I feel like I'm close enough to master it, but I don't want to lie.

448
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:15,960
What if there's a test? What if there's a test? Oh, really? Poop in the toilet. Come

449
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:22,560
on, big boy. Show of proof time. This isn't just a podcast. It's a test of will. Potty

450
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:29,040
training awareness. Who is not aware that that is an important thing that has to happen?

451
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,400
That's sort of like taking your kid out of the hot car awareness. Like, yeah, you should

452
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:42,240
do that. Kids are real soft. Guys, you've got to jump in here because I'll talk about

453
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:49,160
it. What else is there to talk about in potty training awareness? Goof bit run. I'll come

454
00:47:49,160 --> 00:48:02,160
up with something. If you let me dangle here long enough. Potty training. Oh no. I just

455
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:08,600
got it. Welcome. We can make people aware of the profession of a potty, professional

456
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:15,600
potty trainer. With a chair and a whip. You got to control the potty stuff now. I'm sorry.

457
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:21,280
I'm sorry. I tried to back out halfway through. Sometimes British people call shoes trainers.

458
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:28,040
Is there a joke in that? Let's discuss. Let's sit here for 10 minutes and think about it.

459
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:32,160
See if we had a movie right now we'd play. Like here's a movie. We're going to go workshop

460
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:39,960
some potty groups like we should have done this morning, like I said. It's okay. I came

461
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:47,720
up with one. It's my potty and I'll cry if I want to. Deal with that knowledge that I

462
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:55,360
said that and you paid a bunch of money to hear me say it. I just did the math and that

463
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:03,960
joke cost you $10 to hear. For those listening at home, I just gave a big thumbs up. What

464
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,840
did we do? What did we do? Oh, it's your turn. Let's do a regular question. Okay. You like

465
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:13,800
that flow? Love it. We'll edit that out. You like that flow? Potty training awareness.

466
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:26,280
Thank you. We're back. Back on top. I like to sit quietly for 10 minutes. Potty training

467
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:35,760
awareness. Oh my God. My boyfriend and I are engaged and getting married in the fall. The

468
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:43,080
issue, I hate the word fiance. Something about it sounds pretentious and like when a college

469
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:48,360
student freshly back from semester abroad in Italy refuses to pronounce bruschetta as

470
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:54,280
an English word, but insists on saying bruschetta with a Mario accent. You could do better than

471
00:49:54,280 --> 00:50:12,360
that. Let me try again. This is really bad jerking off though. I'm just tapping it. I'm

472
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:27,960
just swinging it back and forth. Oh, I was misreading the motion. He can't finish if

473
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:48,720
you're laughing. Potty training awareness. For those of you at home, he's still doing

474
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,040
it. He's making a vigorous jerk off motion with his hands. It's like a figure eight at

475
00:50:52,040 --> 00:51:02,040
this point. It's a wild elliptical jerk. It's a mobile strip of hand job. I really appreciate

476
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,120
that you guys are still laughing at. The reason I'm still doing it is because I know there's

477
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:15,040
one person in this audience who's like, I don't get it. I'm waiting for it to click.

478
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:29,800
I know it's ridiculous, but the word fiance is to me what damp, moist, and other pet pee

479
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:36,240
words are to others. Can you suggest some other words to refer to my boyfriend until

480
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:45,680
September? Thanks for your help. Words to refer to your fiance. Forever boyfriend. What

481
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:55,000
about Beyonce? That would make me feel pretty good. This is my Beyonce, Trevor. He liked

482
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:02,600
it so he put a ring on it. Yeah. What about calling him your maybe husband? Because let's

483
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:08,560
be honest, you're not there yet. There's a lot of things that can happen. There's a lot

484
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:13,040
of track left on this. Griffin, tell me everything you know about planning a wedding. Oh fuck,

485
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:19,280
you got to get flowers, cake. You got to say yes to the dress. You got to say yes to the

486
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:26,560
dress. You got a cake boss. You got a flower wars. You got a bucks for tux, which is a

487
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:32,880
new show on TLC. You got a preacher fight. You got a what? Preacher fight at the righteous

488
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,800
church. At righteous church? Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, preacher fight at righteous church.

489
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:49,560
Two men in the club are tearing it all off. There's flower boy charm school. Okay. You

490
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:55,120
know there's no such thing as a flower boy, right? Flower man charm school. That was almost

491
00:52:55,120 --> 00:53:00,360
a really nice callback. Um, fuck. I don't like that word either. I don't think. Cause

492
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:06,840
every time I see it on paper, I read it as finance. It's like fiance, but with a, there's

493
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:13,560
like an N. I think I get it. That's just not, it didn't really hit me. It doesn't land.

494
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:18,920
Sometimes two words. They look similar with like one or two letters. Not every joke's

495
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,320
for everybody. There was that one guy who didn't like it when I did the thing with my

496
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:26,240
hand for so long. That's okay. Nothing to feel ashamed of. Can you just call him by

497
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:32,640
his name? Yeah. This is my Steve. Do you mean this is my Steve Steve? This is my Steve Steve.

498
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:37,520
Oh, because you know what the double names is forever. What if, uh, what if he has a

499
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,880
terrible name like Gordon and then you just don't. What's wrong with Gordon? I said it

500
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:53,240
and I can do it. He's my Gordon Gordon. It instantly makes you sound like an idiot. As

501
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,400
opposed to if it was a double of a normal name. Right. Not most names you can get away

502
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:02,500
with saying twice if that sounded too weird. Uh, this Yahoo answer, uh, was sent to my

503
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:09,520
Earl Parsons. Thank you Earl. It's by Yahoo answer user Dr. Terry genius. Who asked, how

504
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:18,040
do I ask my dad to stop kissing me on the lips?

505
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:32,160
You guys jumped to a conclusion. You haven't even heard the background. I am 22 years old.

506
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,840
He keeps wanting to kiss me. I don't want to kiss him on the lips anymore. How do I

507
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:44,680
ask him to stop? Hey, can you just, Dan, can you stop that? Let's wrap. There's only, there's

508
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:52,040
only one surefire way. And that's to grow a beard. That's, that's why our dad could

509
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:56,120
kick in that door any minute and come smooth to Justin and I on the mouth and try. What's

510
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:07,720
it? Travis and not proud of you. I heard what he did. Look to your left. Look to your right.

511
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,600
One of these people has a beard and their parents are apparently not proud of them.

512
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:19,720
It's like a shame, shame carpet that you wear on your face. Daddy, please. It's like a science

513
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:26,520
to me. It's just that I could shave. No, no, daddy's allowed. Yeah. This is a daddy freeze.

514
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:33,640
You could shave that into your beard. No daddies allow. And then go to a job interview. Literally

515
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,400
anywhere on the planet. Hello. I only know about lighting and it says this on my face.

516
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:47,160
Am I good? Do I have a kind of a job now? Lindsay doesn't have a beard for those of

517
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:52,640
you at home. And if she did, it would, she would be too tasteful not to carve anything

518
00:55:52,640 --> 00:56:00,160
into it except her basketball jersey number. You have to get a third party involved in

519
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,420
this at this point, right? For if you're 22, you've certainly hinted to your father that

520
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:07,560
you're not interested. Are you saying it's time for litigation? I'm saying it's time

521
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:15,440
during a fire. In the final episode of Perry Mason. Uh, Perry Mason was a show about a

522
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:31,400
joke. Let me try again. Crash Bandicoot. Where's the joke? Just a word that people knew. Surefire

523
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:40,240
words. Yeah. In this episode of cherry pop tarts. Are we cool? Um, you just ask, right?

524
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,880
It's just as simple as asking. Yeah. And then you bring it up. Unless it's not. Can you

525
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:49,560
please stop? No, no, no. Unfortunately, I just simply cannot stop doing that. Have you,

526
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:56,720
have you seen those, those, uh, I love it. I love talking, talking meat, your talk flesh

527
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:02,320
right here. Oh, I, some of you didn't grow up in West Virginia. That's what we call mouths

528
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:12,280
in West Virginia. Not yet, but I'm trying to get it going. Um, Oh God. How many more

529
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,960
yahoo's do you have Griffin? I have just the one. Okay. Uh, let me ask this question. I

530
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,800
got a friend of mine on Facebook asks, what is the girl equivalent of a bromance? I had

531
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:26,880
always figured that girls had the lockdown on hetero BFFs since the beginning of pajama

532
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,840
parties and group bathroom visits and that there really isn't any trendy word for it.

533
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:37,360
But I don't want to dismiss the question before I asked the smartest guys I know. Oh God damn.

534
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:43,080
And then I emailed you guys. Yeah, right. They didn't respond to me. Thanks for nothing.

535
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:55,120
Miss busters. What do you guys, what do you guys think? God damn. Sometimes I read a question.

536
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:59,480
It's like two out of three of us are going to say something really bad and we're going

537
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:05,840
to get in trouble. Okay. So I'll go ahead and say my, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, but

538
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:12,120
I want to say there's no rush. Uh, I'll save it. Okay. May I think they probably just call,

539
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:18,680
they just could say friends. Women are fucking adults. This is my, this is my friend. Janine.

540
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:27,040
I like her. We go to the, no, what's the thing that we go to the righteous church together.

541
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:41,040
We totally shred the Bible and make room for Skyro. This is taking forever. So many pages.

542
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:46,360
There's nothing. Oh God. I think I, is it possible that just like a bros before hoes.

543
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:53,440
Don't say that. Rather than O braids before O Hayes. Okay. Thank you. Cause everyone here

544
00:58:53,440 --> 00:59:00,680
is an idiot. I took Maria Bamford's pig Latin class. I know what you're saying. I wouldn't

545
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:05,160
have yesterday, but now I know. Is it possible that bromance is not a term that anyone actually

546
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,560
like self is self-referential? I don't know. I've never heard it in the wild. Yeah. Like

547
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:16,200
no one's ever said that this is Jim. We're having a bromance. We are currently engaged

548
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:21,840
in a bromance. Right. Cause it's a, it's a weird noun. If you could say like we're bro

549
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:28,960
dating, that would be fine. We're bro talking. I don't want to come in, but he seems nice.

550
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,320
He seems bro nice. He seems bro nice. And he did take me to a bro dinner. So, and then

551
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:41,000
a Brodio. Can we just, can we just stop using that word? Can people just be friends? Cause

552
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,920
it's 2012. Is that okay? Like, can we just be all ladies? What do you call your friends?

553
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:52,680
What do you call no friends? You guys have friends? No one here. Jesus. Sisterwise. Sisterwise.

554
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:59,640
I like that. Now that does mean something else. It seems familiar. That seems familiar.

555
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:05,840
But I, I, yeah, why not? I, wow. That TV show is much different than I thought it was. I

556
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:11,760
have misunderstood. Sister buddies. It's just, it's just Cody and like four lady buds just

557
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,240
hanging out. Yeah. They live in the same house. They're lady buds. That's what they do. They're

558
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:20,480
all friends. That's actually what they have to tell the law. That's what they have to

559
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,720
tell Johnny. We're lady buds. Back off. Don't worry about it. Lady buds is actually not

560
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:29,760
bad. It's kind of close to the hit Jonathan Brandis film lady bugs. Yeah. It's some Jonathan

561
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:39,920
Brandis fans out here. Oh shit. Jonathan Brandis is here. Oh fuck. Okay. Now people at home

562
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:46,480
run back the tape and count off the seconds. Jonathan Brandis at 1001. You now know the

563
01:00:46,480 --> 01:01:02,320
exact speed at which Griffin's brain computates facts. Sequest. Sequest. Oh no. His little

564
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:14,320
librarian was just toddling through the show. Stop the world. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh no. Is

565
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:23,440
it almost over? Oh, oh Darwin. Um, DSV. That's the only room on the planet that that works.

566
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:29,920
Guys, I would be remiss if I did not tell you about Bunk. It is a television show also on

567
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:36,560
IFC this Friday at 10 30 right after comedy bang bang. It is a game show for improv comics who

568
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:42,640
perform crude stunts I imagine for inane prizes. It's got categories like whose crotch is hotter,

569
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:48,320
shame that puppy, give that bitch some arms, and un-stamp the tramp. This ain't your dad's comedy.

570
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,280
That was my own tagline. Do we want to do that thing that we talked about doing?

571
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:59,840
How much time? We got time? We got a little bit of time. You guys got anywhere to go? You actually do.

572
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:04,560
Sorry to break it to you. If you haven't checked out yet, please leave the room and go check out

573
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:09,280
now. We're gonna try to do a thing. Oh god. I'm so terrified. Seriously, this is our fifth live

574
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,640
show. We've never tried to do this thing before. We're gonna take live questions from the audience.

575
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:20,080
Wait, bro. Now hold on. Please, please wait. We're gonna. It's gotta disclaim some things. Okay.

576
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:29,040
If you bum anybody out, I will savage you. That's my job. Email us if you have those.

577
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:34,080
We're not good at that shit, but if you have a problem like that, email us. This

578
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:39,760
probably isn't the best. Let's run through what we've hit so far. Puppy kicking. Keep that in mind.

579
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:46,080
Justin needs some courage. And I don't know. Just nothing. I don't know. Who's got a question?

580
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:50,800
And I want a real question. If you try to find our job, we want to split attention.

581
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:57,440
We would have had some professionals up here. Oh my God. I'm so yes. Head on over to the mic and

582
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,880
we'll try to answer your question. We get some humming. Can we get the Jeopardy music from

583
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:08,400
everyone in the audience? No. Oh Jesus. The power I wield is amazing. Sounds like the Jeopardy

584
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:16,080
funeral dirge. Please introduce yourself. Hi, I'm Holly. Hi, Holly. Hello, Holly. Holly,

585
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:20,320
do you understand that no matter what we say, you shouldn't do any of it? I've heard the show.

586
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:27,760
Okay. How can we help? So we recently got a fourth cat. Okay. Just to round it out.

587
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,440
And people told us it was a mistake. We were like, well, if we have three cats, four cats,

588
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:38,480
it's not a big deal. And now you want to renege on the cat. Well, the problem is it's not the

589
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:46,080
fact that she is the fourth cat. She sucks. Yeah. I'm amazed that your logic is 50% of cats suck.

590
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:50,080
Right. But we had three really good cats. And so we were like, oh, let's get another cat.

591
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:55,120
Pushed her luck. Yeah. That's the thing. The law of averages beat us, but bit us in the ass.

592
01:03:55,120 --> 01:04:00,000
And now your cat bites you in the ass. Right. I think she would if given the opportunity.

593
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Right. How long have you had the cat? Uh, maybe like two months now. Now,

594
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:10,160
how close do you live to the railroad? Justin? Wait, he would have meant hobo cat.

595
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,880
This is actually, this is actually a joke that's been made in the house before where

596
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:22,480
we're going to pack her a little bindle. A little grease paint beard.

597
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:27,920
Is that Incredible Hulk walking away music? Perfect. What's the cat's name?

598
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,840
It's Margo. Oh man, that even sounds like an asshole.

599
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,960
She's named after Margo Tenenbaum from the Royal Tenenbaums. She kind of sucked too.

600
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,760
You can actually, you can train cats. Right. Like asshole in what way?

601
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,640
She, well, she's, she doesn't really like, she likes me. She doesn't like anybody else in the

602
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:57,840
house. She tends to sort of like hiss if you come near her. She, um, she poops places. Well,

603
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:04,480
all cats poop. You didn't let me finish. She poops places she's not supposed to poop.

604
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,400
On the ceiling? What? How many litter boxes do you have?

605
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,000
Uh, we have to have five cause you have to have one for each cat plus one.

606
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,160
What? Hold on. What? Yeah. No, that's the thing. You have to have one for each cat

607
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,400
plus an extra. For those of you at home, there are way too many people in this audience

608
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:28,560
nodding knowingly. Oh yeah, sure. She's exactly right. You got to have an extra cat shit box.

609
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,120
What is it? Okay. We're going to need you to firm up your question. Are you asking

610
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:42,560
how to guilt-free get rid of this cat? Well, I mean, we don't want to like,

611
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:47,600
you know, we're not going to like take her out, but like, you're not going to hire Tom Barringer.

612
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:55,520
Not Tom Barringer playing a part of something. Here's the problem. Here's the problem is that

613
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:01,920
we can't give her away to people that we know because they know we've talked about the cat.

614
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,800
You can't use Craigslist because a Craigslist user will turn them into a hat.

615
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,240
Actually, I don't even think you can get rid of pets on Craigslist. I think you can if you like,

616
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:19,920
if you're selling a microwave. Yeah. I've got a cat shaped microwave. Yeah. Yeah.

617
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,800
I have a Felix the cat toaster. Sell her as a magical cat.

618
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,480
I don't know any details on that plan. I'll have to workshop it with you later,

619
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,600
but magical cat is the way to go, I think. This cat talked once.

620
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,560
It said, fuck you. I'm not going to lie, this cat sucks. Do you care enough about this cat

621
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:42,480
that you want to keep it and try to work through these issues? We are cat counselors.

622
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:48,960
We feel bad because she's not very old. We're thinking maybe she'll chill out,

623
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:53,440
but then again, I'm tired of cleaning up cat poo. Yeah, and you'll have another 20 years.

624
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,360
My favorite line in the Tim McGraw song Live Like You're Dying is get rid of your cats if

625
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:01,760
there are dicks to you. You shouldn't have to live another day with this cat. This is

626
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:08,320
the symbiotic relationship. It's not an asshole. You give it dry food. It's a pretty simple contract.

627
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:13,920
The cat's got to do one thing, not be a dick. Not be a dick. And your cat is violating your

628
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:20,080
sacred trust. I think, oh good, he looks at the audience judging their reactions. I think

629
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:27,360
you should try to work through it. I think just get a little extra love. You know what? Sometimes

630
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:35,600
that's a cry for help. Maybe your cat's just hurting inside. Yeah. Maybe it needs a papoose

631
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:41,920
to ride in. Maybe some- No, you can't picture that? Okay. You can picture a graduating puppy,

632
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:49,360
but not a cat papoose. Not a cat papoose? You guys are so close. Dr. Pussy's prescription is

633
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:57,120
some extra- No, but like the cat. My cat, some extra TLC. Let him watch TLC. Let him watch TLC.

634
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:03,280
Thank you. Say yes to that. Thank you. That went fucking great. Okay. Who else has one?

635
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,800
All right. Right next to the mic there. You understand the terms of use, right? You understand

636
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:14,000
if you mess this up, I will savage you. Again, I can't make this clear enough. Go ahead. Don't

637
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:21,280
blow it. Don't blow it. Everyone's watching. This is being recorded. Hi. Hi. Hello. What you got?

638
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:31,440
Bring it. Let's dance. Step up. Step up three podcast. What are you into? Do you like to step

639
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:37,440
up movies? Where did we switch to seduction? I missed the turn. You look like you work out.

640
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:47,440
Yay. Do you like the shins? Sorry. What's your question? Okay. What's the question?

641
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:52,400
I have a friend. He's kind of a messy guy. It's the same space. Just say it to you.

642
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,280
I'm going to very much assure you that this is not me. He's kind of a chubby guy. He doesn't

643
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:05,920
keep great care of himself, but he's very nice. But the issue is that he doesn't seem to wash his

644
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:13,760
socks ever. So he'll come over to someone's house, take off his shoes, and then it just smells like

645
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:18,800
all hell broke loose. Okay. What is the nicest way to bring this up to him and tell him to wash his

646
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:22,880
socks? I'm sorry. What was your, we didn't catch your name? Oh, Patrick Foy. Patrick, you got to

647
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:32,080
wash his socks. A little trust exercise we used to play back at the commune. Wash socks? What the

648
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:36,080
fuck are you talking about? I don't know. It petered out at the end. Yeah, it petered out in

649
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:48,960
the middle. Let me say potty training runs. Come on. Have you considered that it's his shoes

650
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,040
and not the socks? Yeah, that makes a big difference in the context of the question.

651
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,960
He can't wash his shoes. It goes from being lazy to unfortunate. The reason I know it's

652
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:02,000
his socks and not his shoes is that he takes off his shoes at the door, but the smell follows him.

653
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:08,400
Okay. All right. Got to cut off his feet. That doesn't fix anything. The feet are still in the

654
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:24,400
room. What did you help? For those watching at home, I just did something funny. Why the

655
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:33,120
fuck is your friend taking his shoes off? Do you live in a dojo? He likes to get comfortable,

656
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,040
I guess. I don't know. Then he can buy some fucking comfortable. You can buy some Crocs.

657
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:43,360
Actually, no, those are porous. He needs to buy some comfortable shoes. No, you need to buy him

658
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:47,040
some comfy shoes. Yeah. That's a fucking great solution. What about slippers? That would be

659
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:51,040
great. Say, hey- Those still aren't going to hold the funk in like you want them to. Duct tape

660
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:59,440
slippers. I haven't flushed that out. Yeah. I would say buy him some slippers. Then when he says,

661
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,760
he can't get mad at you because you will tell him when you give him, your feet smell so bad

662
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:09,200
and I hate it and here are these slippers I got you. I got them at JCPenney if they don't fit.

663
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:13,440
Here's a gift receipt. Receipts in the bag. I have the real receipt, but I don't want you to know

664
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:19,040
how much I spent on them. If you return them, I guess you'll, damn it. Damn it. This plan is flawed.

665
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:24,880
Give receipts fucking suck. Why did you ask? I'm sorry. You asked about gift receipts, right?

666
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,640
What to do with them? How to get your gift receipt? It's easy. You just got to tell him

667
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:33,120
first that you got to push the button beforehand. Trust me, I work at Sears. You can't go back.

668
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:37,040
You have to do it beforehand to print it out with the receipt. Thank you. Next question.

669
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,960
Thank you so much, Patrick. Thanks, Patrick. All right. I think we got time for one more.

670
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:50,160
Maybe one more. Yeah, we got one right here. The gentleman in the max fun con t-shirt.

671
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:56,320
Hit me, Jake. I don't understand exactly what we need from you, right?

672
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,840
I don't know if I understand many things, but okay. You're the one, aren't you?

673
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,600
Okay, go ahead. My name is Jacob.

674
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:14,560
Jukub, I think? Jukub. Hit me. Hit me. So I got a roommate last year and then when we signed a

675
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:21,840
year-long lease. Did you have a roommate shower? Okay, so go ahead. That's when you have a shower

676
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:31,920
with your roommate. Then yes. Let the man finish. He was my friend beforehand and after a year of

677
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:36,480
it, it's getting a little tenuous and now I'm getting to like two months left on the lease

678
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:41,600
and I have made secretive plans with another friend to go be roommates with that person.

679
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:47,040
This is very America's Next Top Model. Thank you, ma'am.

680
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:53,440
I still haven't really told him this. I was planning. I was like,

681
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:57,840
after Max Fun Con, that's whenever I'll tell him. You'll come home with a new field of self-worth.

682
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,560
Absolutely. I don't want to live with you no more.

683
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,840
I made a whole new network of friends. I don't need you.

684
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:11,760
This is such a great opportunity, Jukub. You've got to do the midnight move out.

685
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,960
He's got to wake up the next day and it'll be like a scene from Taken.

686
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,760
The whole room is destroyed and he's looking for clues.

687
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:25,120
Listen to me, whoever took Jukub. I have a very particular set of skills.

688
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,640
Skills are making me a nightmare. I can make a delicious hot pocket.

689
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,400
He says my feet smell bad, but I don't believe it.

690
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:36,960
I'm not the best at dishwashing. Do you guys live together?

691
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,640
Because trust me, he's not going to be broken up about it.

692
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,160
Can you describe without going into too much detail?

693
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,080
Do like eight words. Whichever is funnier.

694
01:13:54,080 --> 01:14:00,800
What's he do that's so off-putting? Oh, I just found out he was kind of racist.

695
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,440
So I knew something a little tenuous.

696
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,040
This might be terrible, but I kind of assume a lot of white people,

697
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,160
especially white people whose last names are Thurmond, which is what his last name is.

698
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,240
He is actually a relative of Strom Thurmond.

699
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,600
Now who's racist, Jukub? Against Thurmond.

700
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:23,840
I always assume they're a little bit racist, but he's just kind of bad about it.

701
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,400
He used to be in such a nice neighborhood until the comments moved in.

702
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,680
He just throws her around a lot. So yeah, we watch NBA basketball and he'll

703
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,520
just say off-putting things, you know, and be like, oh, black people just making...

704
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:40,400
Oh, he'll reference black people? Oh, look, some black people.

705
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,600
Fuck this guy. Midnight move out.

706
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:49,040
I think the best thing for you to do is wait till midnight

707
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:53,120
on the whatever, the end of the month or whatever, and just put all your stuff in a truck.

708
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,720
Be very quiet. And make him wake up to an empty house.

709
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:59,200
Is there any way you can do that and also make him help you move?

710
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,160
Like hypnotism tapes while he sleeves or something?

711
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:08,720
Say, listen, I got a fucking great plan. Slip and slide through my bedroom.

712
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,280
There's only one thing I need to make this happen. Help me move to apartment on 10th street.

713
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:20,160
I think that if he is really, you know, that bad, then part of your job as a parting gift is to have

714
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:24,080
a post-mortem on the living. All right, I'm going to be moving out.

715
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,440
Oh, today, by the way. But before I do, let's run through some things.

716
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,080
You got to debrief him. You should know.

717
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,360
I mean, it is an opportunity for growth. It's not really your responsibility.

718
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:37,760
You've had to deal with the guy for this long. So it couldn't hurt to mention it to him.

719
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:43,840
I'm like, hey, you're kind of racist. And nobody likes that. So I'm moving.

720
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,680
I have another friend. So I hope that helps.

721
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,120
Midnight Nubat is what I'm going with.

722
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:49,520
All right.

723
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:52,720
See, at first I was going to say you got to tell him I had a time, but fuck that guy.

724
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:53,200
Yeah, fuck out.

725
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,240
He sucks.

726
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:54,960
Thank you, Jacob.

727
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,040
Just playing this episode of the podcast. Fuck you, man. You suck. You racist.

728
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,880
Fuck you fucking racist. Jacob's out.

729
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,640
I'm going to fucking kill you.

730
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,840
I won't do that.

731
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,840
Sorry, guys. This is my second screwdriver.

732
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,920
So let's stop the show.

733
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,440
Do you have any more questions?

734
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:16,240
I think we can, we can, hold on, hold on a second.

735
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,640
I'll be here with you people. How's it going?

736
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,400
So I learned a lot. I had to open my class.

737
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,920
What's the deal, ladies and dudes?

738
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:26,400
You can stop.

739
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:26,880
Okay.

740
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,000
Yeah. So, Justin.

741
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:34,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to start the podcast.

742
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,800
Ladies and gentlemen, this has been my brother, my brother and me.

743
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,160
And if I show up for the modern era.

744
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:38,880
Why are you so sad?

745
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,440
I'm just sad because everything's ending, you know?

746
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,800
Like this is the last thing that happens.

747
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:48,320
But we wanted to send you off in style.

748
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:52,640
As you know, we end every episode with a Yahoo answer.

749
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:59,040
This is so apropos because we are the final Yahoo answer of Max Funcom.

750
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,360
Wow, that's deep.

751
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:04,000
So if anything, this is a tribute to our final answer.

752
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,200
It's a tribute to ourselves.

753
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,720
It's a tribute to everything.

754
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:07,600
Seriously, thanks.

755
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,320
Should we? Yeah.

756
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,600
Because we're just going to fucking thanks for letting us be here.

757
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,000
Thank you to Jesse and everybody for setting this up.

758
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,640
This is, this is the coolest fucking thing ever.

759
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,320
And like a year and a half ago before we joined,

760
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:28,560
we went to the dinner on Thursday and I had people try to,

761
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,560
well, I went to the dinner because I'm prompt

762
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,720
and a good employee of Max Fun.

763
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:38,560
And I had people try to explain to me what the conference was going to be like.

764
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,080
And for those of you at home that did not attend the conference,

765
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,560
no explanation can do it justice of how amazing it is to be in a place

766
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:51,040
filled with 200 people that are pretty much exactly like you.

767
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:51,840
Just best friends.

768
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,120
Yeah, it's amazing and a great environment.

769
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,880
So if you weren't able to make it out this year

770
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,240
and you felt bad about it, that's good.

771
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,400
You should feel bad about it.

772
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,600
It's a weird school of parenting you're going with, but I'm into it.

773
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,640
I feel, I dig it.

774
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:10,960
So we thought for our final goodbye to you guys,

775
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,240
we would read several Yahoo Answers.

776
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:29,760
These final Yahoo Answers were sent in by Vanessa Williams.

777
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,240
This is orange juice, not pee on my pants.

778
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:45,120
Why is Bruce Willis bald?

779
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:57,680
It turns out that guy in Miami who was eating the other guy's face was a conservative.

780
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:03,120
No surprise there.

781
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,640
How much does a pyramid cost?

782
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,640
If you're in a car crash with a girl,

783
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,600
is it still okay to ask her to the prom when her legs heal?

784
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,760
My son didn't eat his potato salad.

785
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:31,440
Is he gay?

786
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:34,240
How am I sure that I'm the real mom of my kid?

787
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:37,840
Think about it.

788
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,800
Is Kelly Clarkson a virgin?

789
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,440
Does anybody still use this term in everyday conversation?

790
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:59,040
Well, now, during sexual intercourse, do you put the balls in?

791
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:13,040
Is it okay to defrost chicken in a pool?

792
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:27,760
Still, I feel interest for Indian moms.

793
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:28,960
I want to talk to them.

794
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,600
Is there anyone to share my exact feelings, please?

795
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,880
Are there dogs in the new Batman movie?

796
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:43,680
I'm Justin McElroy.

797
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,720
I'm Travis McElroy.

798
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:45,520
I'm Kevin McElroy.

799
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:49,200
Remember, remember, let me kiss your dad's small lips.

800
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,720
James, where are you?

801
01:20:50,720 --> 01:21:04,160
Come back, everyone.

802
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:21,440
Thank you very, very much.
