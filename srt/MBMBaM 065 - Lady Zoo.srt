1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,800
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,520
I am your host, Justin McElroy. I am co-host Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,520
I'm Cocoa host, Cocoa McElroy. Hi, Cocoa.

8
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,600
Hey, this is Cocoa. So today, we're going to kick things off.

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,320
I've given everyone an assignment. We're going to put the debt ceiling on the old

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,720
comedy juicer and just kind of see what comes out.

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,240
See what kind of jokes we came up with. Now, I like my comedy pulpy, so I'm definitely

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,040
going to go with a Boehner sounds like boner joke.

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,000
Travis, what do you feel like? I like puns, so I'm going to say my debt

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,960
ceiling has a sunroof. Your debt ceiling has a sunroof? Okay.

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,080
That sounds more like the origins of a shitty political cartoon.

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,280
What I was going to go with is something a little more man of the people.

17
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,400
I was going to say, I don't know about the debt ceiling, but I've certainly reached my

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,920
give a shit ceiling, and then I was going to go, a twang.

19
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,600
If someone could provide that sound effect for me, that would be great, too.

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,400
Is that a spittoon sound you just made? No, it's like a twang.

21
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,280
Like a banjo riff? It's more like a twang.

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:10,080
It's like you've released a bow and arrow. It's like HTML, but instead of saying the

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,880
previous text was emphasized or italics, it says the previous text had a twang to it.

24
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,120
So it's like HTML for speech. Talk to email, yes.

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,480
Talk to email. I like that. I like that a lot.

26
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,120
When I'm using it for jokes, I call it ha TML. It's about comedy.

27
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,240
How about HTMLOL? We would also accept HTMLOL.

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,160
I was just sitting here trying to think of flash base puns.

29
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,160
I don't think this episode is off to a great start.

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,600
No. Flash mob puns are much easier. Hey, everybody, can we stop with that?

31
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,840
Can you just stop? Flash mobs were in a Sprint commercial,

32
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,680
so that's pretty much done. So you gotta move on to something else.

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,480
Flash mobs are those things where a bunch of young kids go and beat the shit out of people?

34
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,800
That's correct. This is free advice for flash mobs.

35
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,640
How the fuck was that in a Sprint? Like,

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,920
hey, I'm so glad we could meet and get here and beat up this cop

37
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,880
because we texted on our Sprint phones. No, that's not like that.

38
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,320
Flash mobs are when young people get together and just dance,

39
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,920
but it's choreographed and they don't- And all of a sudden it's like at 12.01,

40
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,520
everybody dance. I mean, basically it's like insane people have been doing for years,

41
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,480
the insane homeless running up people's- Only slightly less organized and way less interesting.

42
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,160
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

43
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,360
I think there's nothing more interesting than a group of young kids coming to,

44
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,320
like, break both your legs on the street. No, it's not-

45
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,880
Why is yours all about violence? It's not like a mob like soccer hooligans.

46
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,960
That was used inappropriately. True flash mobs are about dancing.

47
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,480
Now, okay, will I agree with you that that would be a better use of the word flash mob?

48
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,800
Of course. Of course that would be a better use of it. It would make a lot more sense

49
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,000
because what they're doing is flash dance. It's not a flash mob.

50
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Maybe because flash dance is already taken.

51
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,880
Across this great country of ours,

52
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,160
how many show choir ensembles do you think have named themselves the flash mob?

53
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,640
And they were like a bunch of sequins.

54
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,600
I think it's the kids inside the show choir.

55
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,920
There's like a splinter cell inside them that do things their own way.

56
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,080
You know what I mean? They're plotting the overthrow.

57
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,800
They wear their reversible vests inside out.

58
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,280
So you're saying by day, they all sing,

59
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,920
we built this city in a choreographed dance.

60
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,640
And at night, they tear it down.

61
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,760
By night, they wander around town and beat the shit out of cops.

62
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,320
No, there's no- Again, Jesus Christ. Let's move on to the questions

63
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
because I feel like you're going to grok those a little bit better.

64
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm going off to college soon and I'm going to be meeting a lot of new people.

65
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,360
When I meet another guy, naturally, we shake hands,

66
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,880
but what's an appropriate greeting for a stranger of the opposite gender?

67
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,400
Greetings in Georgia.

68
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,080
Oh, that's a great question.

69
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,480
That's a really good question because I don't know what to tell you.

70
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,560
Well, in Georgia, don't you delicately dab your handkerchief

71
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,960
to your forehead and wave your lacy fan?

72
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,800
Uh-huh, right.

73
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,000
You sip your mint julep and you talk about your land

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,040
and how good it is to have it fertile.

75
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,920
Do a little snuff.

76
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,160
Just a little snus.

77
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,240
I've experienced this a lot in my industry

78
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,680
where you'll meet a woman who is in PR, perhaps, or marketing

79
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,520
who you have never met before in real life

80
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
and you'll go for the handshake and she'll go for the hug.

81
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,160
And boy, howdy. It's that awkward.

82
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,880
Because that's what you can end up doing,

83
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,520
is putting an open hand right between her boobs.

84
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,560
That's how it shakes out.

85
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,480
So what you're saying is it's-

86
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,600
Not like you touch, but it looks like you're indicating to her.

87
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,920
Yeah, like, hey, can I dive in there?

88
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,400
What's up?

89
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,000
You got to make a bigger opening bet than the person you're greeting.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,160
Because if they're going for a handshake,

91
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,840
if they're going for a handshake, you have to go for a hug.

92
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,320
If they're going for a hug, kiss them on the cheek.

93
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,120
If they go for a cheek kiss, which is coming back and-

94
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,240
You tongue them in the mouth.

95
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,720
Tongue them in the mouth. They go for that? Marry them.

96
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,280
Hi.

97
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,840
I love you.

98
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,760
Can we- What about just a big old flashy bow?

99
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,840
You sweep your cape to the side.

100
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,480
A pleasure, I'm sure.

101
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,120
Greetings.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,680
I am Voldemort.

103
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,040
No, your name is actually Brian.

104
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,360
Pleasure.

105
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,960
I am Dracula.

106
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,920
So glad to have you working at my quiz-nose.

107
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:52,960
Have you been to that one quiz-nose out Route 60 where the guy says he's Dracula?

108
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,520
Whatever you do, don't ask for garlic.

109
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,960
He will flip.

110
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,200
He will flip his mind.

111
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,520
I think handshaking-

112
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,240
That's the thing, though.

113
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,160
The problem is that this isn't just a gender question.

114
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,960
I think that this is-

115
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,880
We've lost that kind of universal etiquette of greeting.

116
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,480
Back in the 1800s, it used to be so structured and like,

117
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,280
this is what you do.

118
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,200
Yeah, codify for it fully.

119
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,960
You kiss the back of the hand.

120
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,440
You bow.

121
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,280
Across the board, there was a rule for it.

122
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,960
Now it's so up in the air.

123
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,480
Please don't kiss the back of my hand.

124
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,760
Please don't do that.

125
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,640
Don't do that.

126
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,360
Don't do that.

127
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,280
It's still pretty structured, I think.

128
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,360
I think we're making a mountain out of a molehill here.

129
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,800
I think you just shake the hand.

130
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,160
Because I can't think of anything else you do except for hugging,

131
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,600
and that's kind of weird to do.

132
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,680
That's a good goodbye to a stranger.

133
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,800
I like to drop that like,

134
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,800
hey, our relationship's moving faster than you thought it was.

135
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:57,600
But if you defy the greeting convention and you kiss a hand or bow

136
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,800
or do the, what is it, the like, the French cheek kiss?

137
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,000
Well, there's gotta be a proper name for that.

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,720
A genuflect.

139
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,400
Just douche-chill city.

140
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,080
Just, that's just.

141
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,120
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

142
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,080
The only way you can.

143
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,280
Any of those things are bad.

144
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,640
You can take a shot.

145
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,960
I mean, like, you're not gonna go wrong.

146
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,680
If you think about like the,

147
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,600
and we're mainly talking about the hug shake,

148
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,960
like that dichotomy there.

149
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,240
You're not gonna go wrong.

150
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,440
I would rather be on the handshake end of that

151
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,760
than the hug end of that, by which I mean.

152
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,040
You mean you go for the handshake.

153
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,880
If you're not sure, go handshake.

154
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,000
If you wanna gamble and go with hug,

155
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,800
if it's your first time meeting somebody

156
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,200
but you've kind of talked to them in the past,

157
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,760
you know what I mean?

158
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,920
Like maybe that's very common in our society now.

159
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,560
You've talked to someone via email or via phone

160
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,080
and this is your first time meeting in the meet space, as we say.

161
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,520
If you look in the eyes and there's that recognition,

162
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,040
maybe you go in for the hug.

163
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,400
Still gonna be a gamble.

164
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,440
When you do the hug, you got about one to two seconds

165
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,200
of contact and then you gotta break off.

166
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,240
No expanded hugs.

167
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,120
Pat, pat, then you're out.

168
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,560
Total stranger's gotta be a handshake.

169
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,520
Got to be a handshake.

170
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,400
Gotta be a handshake.

171
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,600
Now, here's another question.

172
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,960
Let's do another level.

173
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,880
Let's go to sleep in Inception Machine

174
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,920
and go another level down.

175
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,120
When you shake a fellow's hand

176
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,640
and it's a contemporary,

177
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,720
and not your boss, I almost always go for the three pump.

178
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,800
Like, uh, uh, like, uh, and then maybe bones it,

179
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,400
but usually I don't bones it.

180
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,760
I just go in and then go thumbsies and then nucks

181
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,880
and then pull it back.

182
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,440
Yeah.

183
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,280
Can you do that to a lady stranger?

184
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,360
Or do you, how do you shake a lady's hand?

185
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,160
I think with a lady stranger.

186
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,880
How do you shake a lady's hand?

187
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,280
Here's my thing.

188
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,520
How do you shake a lady's hand without breaking it?

189
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,160
Without hurting it?

190
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,080
I think you just give like one squeeze and you're out.

191
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,440
Like you just, you're out.

192
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,920
Like you just grasp and stop.

193
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,880
I don't think you pump.

194
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't think you do nucks.

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,200
I don't think you bones it.

196
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,640
I just squeeze it out.

197
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,600
Some ladies are so delicate though.

198
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,320
They're like, you go to shake their hand

199
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,160
and it's like, it's like a bunch of glass sticks wrapped in silk.

200
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,120
Like how am I supposed to shake this?

201
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,320
It's like grabbing a bunch of, grabbing a bunch of tulips by the head.

202
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,200
Yeah, exactly.

203
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,400
And I tell you, there's a, there's a whole social hierarchy

204
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,000
for guys in handshakes too.

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,920
We were at a family gathering this weekend

206
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,840
and I met a new member of our family

207
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,280
and he shook my hand with a sort of bravado maybe.

208
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,520
That made me say like, hey, this guy is somebody you got to take seriously.

209
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,020
Yeah.

210
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,080
Yeah.

211
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:38,400
Now some, now some, I'm not saying like all ladies hands are silk wrapped glass sticks,

212
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,360
but I'm saying like, it's hard sometimes

213
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,440
that you don't feel that sort of the meaty warmth you expect.

214
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,840
I think when you shake a lady's hand, it's not a competition.

215
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,320
You're not trying to, as opposed to the dude where it's like,

216
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,680
I can give a firm handshake.

217
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,440
I am a man with a woman.

218
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,240
I think you don't need to crush her fingers.

219
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,280
Don't be an asshole.

220
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,160
You guys know that because of this bit, every time we do a live show

221
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,680
and we meet our one to two lady fans, they are gonna fucking break our hands.

222
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,640
Oh, crush it.

223
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,600
Oh, fuck.

224
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

225
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,120
Yeah, but we'll deserve it and we'll understand it.

226
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,640
Mm-hmm.

227
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,920
Guys, everybody, let's just chest bump.

228
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,600
Can we all just chest bump?

229
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,960
Just get back to basics and just bump our chests together.

230
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,200
Hey, dear brothers McElroy, I'm worried that I might be in love with my best friend's ex.

231
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,480
I understand the rule is bros before hoes.

232
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,080
Please don't say that out loud.

233
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,560
Mm-hmm.

234
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,560
But when it is considered acceptable to proceed with getting my Mac on, form spring.

235
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,160
Never.

236
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
It's never bros before hoes.

237
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,760
Hey, hey, whoever said bros before hoes is lying.

238
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,440
Meet exhibit A in the fact that the world does not operate on that premise.

239
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,560
I call it the continued existence and propagation of the human race.

240
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,720
Hi, it's never been bros before hoes until your bros learn to make progeny.

241
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,000
Do you know who invented bros before hoes?

242
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,120
It was somebody who knew that his friend was interested in his own ex-girlfriend.

243
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,240
Yeah.

244
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,400
He's like, hey, wait, but you, uh, uh.

245
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,520
Bros before hoes.

246
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:15,840
Yeah.

247
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,720
Gotcha.

248
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,360
I did it.

249
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,680
Um, came down from the mount.

250
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,640
There's a stone carved bros before hoes.

251
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,960
I have, I have, um, uh, a, a, another example.

252
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,720
If you say bros before hoes in front of a quote unquote hoe,

253
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,360
it'll be bros and just bros forever and ever and jerking it forever.

254
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,800
Cause like, what are you doing?

255
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,920
Don't say that out loud.

256
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,280
Don't even think it.

257
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,440
Like, what is it with that attitude?

258
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,800
Bros before hoes.

259
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,960
Like, have you met your bros?

260
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,640
It's, it's, it's absolute nonsense.

261
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,840
It's nonsense.

262
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,240
Can we make a-

263
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,760
It's just falderol.

264
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,920
Can we make a less, uh, falderoli, uh, less, um, inflammatory version of this?

265
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,400
Yes.

266
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:58,800
Yes.

267
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,840
Pals before gals.

268
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:00,640
Okay.

269
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,120
That's, that's perfect.

270
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,920
That's much better.

271
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,200
I thought we could get a good 15 or 20 seconds of riffing out of that,

272
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,560
but you just don't shut it down.

273
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,520
I just, that's right now.

274
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,480
Pals before gals.

275
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,160
Everybody, no more bros before hoes.

276
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,760
I'm going to do a slight addendum to one of our usual answers.

277
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,560
Uh, and it's this.

278
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,880
Just ask him, silly.

279
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,120
Hey.

280
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:19,840
Hey.

281
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,360
Go to your best friend and be like, hey, you're my best friend.

282
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,480
You want me to be happy.

283
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,200
Um, can I put it in Debbie?

284
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,200
Can I put it in her?

285
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,240
Um, can we, how about buds before jugs?

286
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:35,920
What?

287
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,120
I got, Griff and I already did this part.

288
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,320
Buds before jugs.

289
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,600
I did this part for you.

290
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,040
I wanted to make my contribution just since it's democracy and people can vote.

291
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,960
We'll pretend I haven't already nailed it.

292
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,080
Griffin, you've got, you've got buds.

293
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,800
Is it buds?

294
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,200
I'm sorry.

295
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,960
Is it buds before jugs?

296
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,880
Is that your rhyming?

297
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,600
Okay.

298
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,000
Travis.

299
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,840
We have to find some way to, to say that the first one is, is guys.

300
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,920
Cause pals can be lady.

301
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,040
I have lady pals.

302
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,240
Do you think, so you don't like how mine's more progressive?

303
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,080
Oh, you're sick.

304
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,600
What if your best friend's a lady?

305
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,040
I twisted it on you.

306
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,920
What's up?

307
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,320
Yeah.

308
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,800
Mine was not only less offensive, it also elevated all of humanity's dialogue.

309
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,080
So did you have something else you would like it had?

310
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,960
You took the game.

311
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,520
I would like to look into the future a hundred years, uh, when we can just say human beings

312
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,560
before human beings.

313
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:35,200
Actually that'd be human beings before human beans, which were created in a terrible Dr.

314
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,480
Moreau style.

315
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,160
Don't date your best friend's ex.

316
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,640
He says.

317
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,120
Period.

318
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,800
Don't, sorry, what is it again?

319
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,600
Do not, do not date your best friend's ex or, or buds before jugs.

320
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,320
Which one did you want?

321
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,360
Which one of my bone moles?

322
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,160
Which one of these pearls?

323
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,120
I'll just open up another Griffin fortune cookie and see what spits out.

324
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,640
Buds before jugs it says.

325
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,120
Listen, you can't like, she's just going to compare you to him.

326
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,080
Comfy with that?

327
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,520
The thing that's weird about this is that that I think it's, I'm less concerned about

328
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,320
the, your friend giving permission and everything.

329
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,400
I'm less concerned about that.

330
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,600
More concerned about how your life, should you pursue this relationship is going to splinter

331
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,960
in a very real way.

332
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,920
Like you are creating, you're basically creating a splinter reality for yourself.

333
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,520
Civil war is what you're creating.

334
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,000
Yes.

335
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,200
You're creating a civil war.

336
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,720
Bro's against hoes.

337
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,280
Rebels versus rebels before redcoats.

338
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,280
I just, that was the revolutionary war.

339
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,560
Okay.

340
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,120
Rebels.

341
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,440
I'm sorry.

342
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,280
Is it rebels before redcoats?

343
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,240
Here's the problem with this is that if you do this, there's no way your best friend is

344
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:59,520
going to be able to divorce from his mind the idea that you were, you were into his

345
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,560
girlfriend while they were dating.

346
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,200
No way to do it, no way to do it.

347
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,480
And that's it for you guys.

348
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,720
That's pretty much the, that's pretty much the old ball game.

349
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:14,160
Once he plants that seed and the fertile, fertile loam of his jealous mind, you're done.

350
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:21,760
So I guess like to sum it all up, you can do it, but it will irreparably change your

351
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,800
friendship forever.

352
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,600
And by change means end.

353
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,960
So yeah, kind of like how a building works.

354
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,320
Kind of like how a building when burned down is changed.

355
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,120
Back to not building.

356
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,880
Back to zero building left.

357
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Love is, I would say that there's very, there's a, there are almost no situations where I

358
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,640
say don't pursue love.

359
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,240
I just want you to know that you are the risks that you are talking about here.

360
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,080
That's all.

361
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,000
And, and it also, and I think X is a little, I think we almost need more information to

362
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,680
really decide.

363
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:01,920
Yeah.

364
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,560
If they just broke up like two days ago, fuck you.

365
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,960
Or if it was like a two week relationship though.

366
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,200
Yeah.

367
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,640
Like what if they just casually saw each other and then you just said fuck you at him for

368
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,040
nothing.

369
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,840
That's fine then.

370
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,680
You just yelled at him.

371
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,720
Well, now I feel bad.

372
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,600
You should feel bad.

373
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,840
You don't spring the conclusions.

374
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,400
Peruse before abuse.

375
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,120
That's what I say.

376
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,000
That's my other one that I've got.

377
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,400
Griffin.

378
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,200
Hey.

379
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,000
Hey.

380
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,280
This Yahoo answer was sent in by CurlyHeadPoet.

381
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,720
Thank you CurlyHeadPoet.

382
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,280
Thanks buddy.

383
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,200
Thanks friendo.

384
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:40,160
It's by Yahoo Answers user um who asks, what to do with my pubes and pit hair heart?

385
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,640
Should I braid them?

386
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,200
Curl them?

387
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,400
I have a hot date tomorrow.

388
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
My pubes and armpit hair need to be gorgeous.

389
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,600
Just smile face.

390
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,120
Just as long as they match.

391
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,680
Yeah, right.

392
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,720
Don't do one thing up top and a different thing downstairs.

393
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,960
Consistency is key.

394
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,320
I think that you can I think I'm saying that I think that you can mix it up.

395
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,760
I think you can go I think you can go bouffant and armpit left.

396
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,680
I think you can go cornrows and armpit right and pubes.

397
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,760
I think that you can shave your basketball number.

398
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,840
I'm saying that's a good look.

399
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,720
That's not just a good look.

400
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,560
That's three good looks.

401
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,640
Oh, so you want what you want to emphasize on this day is variety.

402
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,080
I have a lot of different things.

403
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,200
Welcome to the buffet.

404
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,480
What do you feel like today?

405
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,800
I got all kinds of weird shit in here.

406
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,200
What if and I do a lot of bad things.

407
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,840
This would take a lot of patience and some skill.

408
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,800
But what if you raise up your right arm and there's a rhino in there and in your left arm

409
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,720
it's one of those swirly tree looking things and you see some topiaries all over the place.

410
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,160
Oh, you didn't mean like a literal rhinoceros.

411
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,660
No.

412
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
That'd be difficult to get up in there and have.

413
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,000
We're trying to watch a movie.

414
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,400
Can you please keep your giant horned mammal quiet?

415
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,760
Can you keep your pet rhino just silenced?

416
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,040
That'd be a pretty cool commercial for deodorant, wouldn't it?

417
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,800
Can you walk me through it?

418
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,000
Can you walk me through the visuals?

419
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,720
It's a storyboard.

420
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,320
No, I'll just do sound.

421
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,200
Okay, what's your underarm situation like?

422
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,440
That's the rhino.

423
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,600
It's like you gotta slam it down with some axe paste and they smear the axe paste on the rhino

424
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,880
and he shrinks down.

425
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,920
Okay, maybe the rhino's in a stained t-shirt and he's eating nachos.

426
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,300
Okay.

427
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,120
I mean, I don't know why we...

428
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Seriously, he's like a sloppy rhino.

429
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,240
He's not one of those well-manicured caped rhinos you see in Georgia.

430
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,920
Can we dye our miscellaneous hairs?

431
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,960
Tie-dye, maybe?

432
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,440
Can we tie-dye them?

433
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,920
That only says, I'm taking the care to get a cool look for you.

434
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,760
It says, very flexible up here.

435
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,280
I don't know what's going on.

436
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,240
Brian, I'm having a good time.

437
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,360
We're both in a situation where I can see your armpit hair, so it's got to be intimate.

438
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,000
So straight up though, hold on.

439
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,040
Let me pause just a second because is that cotton candy?

440
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,400
What have you done?

441
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,360
How could you do this?

442
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,200
If so, can I get some?

443
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,240
Can I get a nibble?

444
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,280
Is it blueberry?

445
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,840
Yes, please.

446
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,880
I don't like the idea of people having hair anywhere.

447
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,360
Even guys, I don't want to think about it, that reality.

448
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,920
I just want people to have it and keep it to themselves.

449
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:40,640
Wait, you're uncomfortable with the idea of body hair other than the kind on your head area?

450
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,800
I'm not uncomfortable with the fact that it exists.

451
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,960
I'm uncomfortable with it being brought into the discourse.

452
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,280
I'm actually more uncomfortable with the idea that there are people out there

453
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,040
that are impressed with how well-manicured your armpit hair is.

454
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,800
I don't think those people exist.

455
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,080
No, I think this gentleman has invented the situation for himself.

456
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,080
I don't think there's anything wrong with being proud of your puberty, Bush, though.

457
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,160
You don't think hair is sinful?

458
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,120
Well, I mean, it is a sin to have hair on your mom's pupus.

459
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,600
But listen, it just makes it sweeter.

460
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,200
Oh, yeah?

461
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,720
Yeah, it's the sweetest sin.

462
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,400
The sweetest sin is having hair on above your genitals?

463
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,560
Uh-huh, I just think that it's time for us to be proud of our bodies fully,

464
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,360
wholly, internally, externally.

465
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,840
You're saying, ladies, stop shaving.

466
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,600
I'm saying, ladies, gentlemen, no more maintenance.

467
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,320
No more, you know how many hours in the day you have before you die?

468
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,440
Not a lot, not as many as you might think.

469
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,720
Let it all run wild, let it all hang out.

470
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,560
So let's just Sasquatch it up.

471
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,200
Yeah, and you know Griffin is living this lifestyle

472
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,560
because he uses his shampoo suds to wash his body.

473
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,560
So you know that he's committed to this.

474
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,000
Groom Free is the name of this movement that he has initiated,

475
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,800
and he wants everybody to get on board with him.

476
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,080
Why don't you spend that hour writing some poetry instead of noosing?

477
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:22,720
Uncle Jesse. I guarantee you if they have a full-blown, poorly maintained situation,

478
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,360
they write some poetry from time to time.

479
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,400
They indulge in some creative writing.

480
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,360
You know, if Uncle Jesse had spent half as much time

481
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,840
trying to get a fan base for Jesse and the Rippers

482
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,360
as he has spent moosing, blow drying, conditioning, endlessly styling his hair,

483
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,280
that could have been a very different series.

484
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,280
It would have been about his meteoric rise to stardom. Think about it.

485
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,360
Full house, think about it.

486
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,960
Hey, I got a question for you guys.

487
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,840
Is it possible to ask out a pizza girl?

488
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:59,120
Or more importantly, should you ask out a pizza girl?

489
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,360
Mystified in Melbourne.

490
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,200
I think those are two different questions.

491
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,560
Is it possible? Yes.

492
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,440
Wait, should you?

493
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,880
No, I think he means successfully.

494
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,160
Can you close the ask out?

495
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,440
Oh, well, that's a different question.

496
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,520
Here's my biggest thing.

497
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,520
That sounds gross.

498
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,520
Is this a girl made of pizza?

499
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:26,240
Because I think if she could find someone to love her and not eat her,

500
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,840
she should count herself lucky.

501
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,440
And you know what?

502
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,880
I don't care what people say.

503
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,120
Yes, you can ask out a pizza girl.

504
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,720
And you know what?

505
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,080
Yeah, you should ask out a pizza girl if you love her.

506
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,560
And if you think she's something special to you.

507
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,560
If she has the toppings that she likes.

508
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:42,960
If you like-

509
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,640
This is my supreme girlfriend.

510
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,400
Hey, you are supreme.

511
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,720
I'm a meat-

512
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,320
I don't care that you're a little bit big.

513
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,040
I'm a meat lover.

514
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,320
I'm a meat lover lover.

515
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,200
That's me.

516
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,840
I love you.

517
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,880
You're a meat lover's pizza.

518
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,480
I'm a meat lover's pizza lover.

519
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,280
Meat lover lover.

520
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,320
That's me.

521
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,680
That's who I am.

522
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,160
You are covered in sardines.

523
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,080
What?

524
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,360
I am crying and it's not because of your freshly diced onions.

525
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,120
It's because I love you so much.

526
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,520
You are so special to me.

527
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,800
Pizza girl.

528
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,880
Pizza girl.

529
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,800
That's my favorite Ed Milkman song, by the way.

530
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,680
You guys should check it out.

531
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,600
So assuming he means a pizza delivery woman, I think they prefer-

532
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,200
They don't let girls do that job.

533
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,160
They don't let girls do that job.

534
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,720
You gotta be real.

535
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,360
All woman.

536
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,480
I think no, because there's this inherent laziness that's like,

537
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,240
is this a girl delivery service?

538
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,280
It is not.

539
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,360
She is just bringing you food.

540
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,080
I am going to say no, because when someone is on delivery to a stranger's house in a

541
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,040
strange neighborhood, they're already on high alert.

542
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,400
And I think that that is not the right time to ask them how.

543
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,320
When they're terrified?

544
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,560
Yeah.

545
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,200
They're prepared to like open the door to like an S&M cult or something.

546
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,760
You know what I mean?

547
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,400
Like they're already afraid.

548
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,600
An S&M cult?

549
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,000
You think?

550
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,240
Yeah.

551
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,520
Yeah.

552
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,760
Is that what they're prepared to open the door to?

553
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,920
Have you ever been a delivery person?

554
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,720
Either one of you.

555
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,120
No.

556
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,760
No.

557
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,320
I have.

558
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,840
And you walked in on an S&M cult.

559
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,200
They're like, oh, Jimmy John's.

560
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,600
Thank you.

561
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,040
Hey, get out of-

562
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,160
Hey, can you get out of me for a second so I can pay this man for the Jimmy John's?

563
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,840
Could you undo my mouth zippers so I can eat this delicious submarine sandwich?

564
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,520
Oh, I left my wallet with the gimp.

565
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,080
Go get him.

566
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,080
Hey, Daniel, can you plug my gape for a second so I can walk to the front door?

567
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,200
I'm trying- I got to get to the door and pay the Jimmy John's guy, but you're standing on my balls.

568
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,680
Um, here's- I can only see one way that we can test this out because I'm still on the fence.

569
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,040
Okay.

570
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,640
We got to role play it.

571
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,000
I think we just got to keep going until we find if it is-

572
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,200
If it is-

573
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,440
Okay.

574
00:25:51,440 --> 00:26:00,160
... we can do, so I'll be pizza girl, and, um, Travis, you can be the lonely customer,

575
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,480
and then, uh, we'll trade off if need be.

576
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:03,760
Okay.

577
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,960
So, uh, I ring-

578
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,440
Travis, go.

579
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,880
... ring the doorbell, and-

580
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,960
I'll adjudicate, and I'll let you know when the situation's-

581
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,160
Okay, just narrate, and we'll-

582
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,720
Okay.

583
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,440
All right.

584
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,320
So, ding dong.

585
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,120
Hey, I got a pizza here for you.

586
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,240
Well, thank you.

587
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,760
Uh, you're awfully cute.

588
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,400
Bye!

589
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,280
I want to go to the-

590
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,360
Oh, it was a good try.

591
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,080
It was a good try.

592
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,760
Um, Travis needs to go play some more, be comfortable talking to women, I think.

593
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,560
Yeah.

594
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:41,200
Uh, hey, the, uh, my- my problem with this is the same problem I have with asking out a bank teller,

595
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,360
in that they're trapped.

596
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:43,840
Like, it's a-

597
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,080
Yeah.

598
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,000
That's a girl- you're just asking her out because she's a girl in a glass cage

599
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,560
that you're asking her out because it's perfectly safe.

600
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Like, don't- don't do that.

601
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,760
If you want to be serious about it, follow her back at a- at a distance she won't see you.

602
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,320
Well-

603
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,640
Follow her back to pizza joint, and then wait until she's getting out of her car,

604
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,560
and just as she's about to get out of her car, slam the car door back closed,

605
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,040
and then make her roll down her window, and then ask her out.

606
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,120
Because that says, to me, romance.

607
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,520
I, um, it sounds- smells to me like a felony.

608
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:23,840
I like your idea that banks are lady zoos.

609
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,000
That's what they are.

610
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,200
They're lady zoos.

611
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,600
You go through the drive-thru, you get to see a lady.

612
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,200
You pay your deposit, you pay your APR,

613
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,560
and you get to see ladies in prison.

614
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:44,080
Yeah, anybody could use an automatic teller machine for anything.

615
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,440
You know why you don't?

616
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,040
It's because you're gonna go see a lady in a prison, and you're gonna think,

617
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,240
oh, I should ask her out.

618
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,680
You're gonna treat yourself to a little midday alternate reality fantasy about this girl,

619
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,120
but you're- just stop it.

620
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,720
Just go use the teller machine.

621
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,880
Why do you want an extra interaction?

622
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,440
I don't get it.

623
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,360
I don't get it.

624
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,280
So I think somewhere in there, we've decided it's not a good idea to ask out your pizza girl.

625
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,480
I think we've decided that anybody in any service industry, you should not- you should not court-

626
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,280
You shouldn't.

627
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,560
Leave them alone, they're working.

628
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,520
Leave them alone.

629
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,200
Can't you just leave them alone?

630
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,080
I'll tell you what, here's the message you're sending.

631
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,840
Let's talk about first impressions for a second.

632
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,440
You order a pizza, so this person knows two things about you.

633
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,800
One, you pay for it.

634
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,160
And two, you don't cook.

635
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,400
So that's not like a-

636
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:32,960
Not a good start.

637
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,320
That's not a good scene.

638
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,520
No, it's not a good start.

639
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,800
Plus, plus, plus, you have to decide this so quickly.

640
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,720
You know absolutely nothing about them.

641
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,520
No, nothing about them.

642
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,440
It's like- it's like- it's like mystery day.

643
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,760
You look at them for five seconds like, uh, uh, uh.

644
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,240
I have to make a split second decision and you do too.

645
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,600
What's what decides right now?

646
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,480
We're making a connection.

647
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,240
You guys don't believe in love at first sight?

648
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,880
No.

649
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,720
Not when she's driving a shitty rusted out Dodge Dart and holding a pizza box.

650
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,040
Why can't you fall in love with a girl driving a- like you said.

651
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
Chaz, you're throwing a lot of hate.

652
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,960
You're throwing a lot of hate this app.

653
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,960
I'm just saying that you know nothing about her.

654
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,480
She knows nothing about you.

655
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,200
It's too on the spot.

656
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,480
I have built entire marriages out of less information

657
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,600
than you like pizza and don't like driving to get pizza.

658
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,480
You're down with Hawaiian.

659
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,080
That must mean you're mysterious, cultured, and you have a sophisticated ballot.

660
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,000
Can I appreciate the intermingling, the delicate dance of salty and sweet?

661
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,880
It looks like you have also gotten brownie bites.

662
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,080
So you are a little fat and I can but I can just see that I can I can scope that one.

663
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,200
Didn't need to Sherlock it out.

664
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,120
I have a Yahoo answer that I'd like for us to discuss.

665
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,400
Okay.

666
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,040
Sent in by Oliver Brogden.

667
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,840
Thank you, Oliver.

668
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Richard or Richard who asks.

669
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,440
It's an early early member, huh?

670
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,280
Yeah, he really had he's been sitting on that username for a while now.

671
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,000
Yeah.

672
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,520
What is the most unique bathing experience you have seen or maybe even imagined?

673
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:19,280
Hi, I am currently designing a bathhouse spa in Spain as part of an architectural thesis.

674
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,040
This will be no ordinary spa.

675
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,200
In fact, it will be highly experimental.

676
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,040
Think Egyptians bathing and donkey milk experimental to get to the point.

677
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,200
We'll get back to that to get to the point.

678
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,520
It is many different bathing swimming spaces experiences.

679
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,400
My question to you is what's the most unique bathing experience you have seen or maybe even

680
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:40,880
imagined?

681
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,920
Every time I go on Yahoo Answers, I have to get into a scalding hot shower and scrub the top

682
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,040
layer of my skin off.

683
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,920
Does that count?

684
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,880
Griffin, I know there are answers.

685
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,280
Please give them to me.

686
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,240
I mean, there's an S.

687
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,120
There are two essays that people have written that I'm not entirely.

688
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,720
The Roman baths at Bath look pretty inviting.

689
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,040
The green color and warmth look good and tranquil.

690
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,840
In Herigut, there was this very old steam bath complex with lots of rooms and different ways

691
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,720
to hang out.

692
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,160
Hey, let's go to the-

693
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,280
Can I ask you something?

694
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,520
Can I ask you guys something about this?

695
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,360
This side topic sort of.

696
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,400
Do you guys agree that like of all the historical knowledge you can have, historical knowledge

697
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,120
about the ancient Greeks is pretty much the weirdest?

698
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,000
Mm-hmm.

699
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,080
Like, it's like the creepiest one that when you know about it, like, and mentioning it,

700
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,320
like, it's like, it's the creepiest, right?

701
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,160
It says a certain thing about a person.

702
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:42,640
Like, if you know a lot about the ancient Greeks, then you just like a fucking party.

703
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,640
You are just a nonstop, like, put anything in front of me.

704
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,680
I'll fuck it.

705
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,800
Like, that's what it says.

706
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,200
That's what I hear is that you like that.

707
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,640
You like just, yeah.

708
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,040
I'm going to put a stop to two things right now.

709
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,200
Just preemptory stop.

710
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,480
I don't want any emails about how wonderful bathhouses are.

711
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,200
Okay.

712
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,040
And I don't want any emails about how awesome the ancient Greeks were.

713
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,280
Yeah.

714
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,200
I'm telling you right now, I'm sure you had a great time.

715
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,800
You had a great time in your Greek bathhouses and whatnot.

716
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,320
It's not for me.

717
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:23,280
Can a bathhouse be something that you can go to, oh gosh, how to phrase this?

718
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:29,120
Without a bathhouse, without making a bathhouse lifestyle change.

719
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,280
Can it be something that I just go to like-

720
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,120
So like, can you dabble in bathhouse?

721
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,160
My bath is broken.

722
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,920
Is there a place much like a laundromat for clothing?

723
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm talking about a laundromat for human skin.

724
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,800
Okay.

725
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,760
Just to chill out.

726
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,400
Just to hang out.

727
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,720
You know what I don't have?

728
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,760
I do not have a boiling hot pool of donkey milk.

729
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,120
I would, yeah.

730
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,400
Yeah, hey, I'd kind of like to know what that's like a little bit.

731
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,600
I would like to swim in a bathtub filled with silica gel.

732
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,160
I would like to hear an undiscovered Barry Manilow and Bette Midler playing together

733
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:11,760
for the very first time for an adoring crowd of gentlemen at a bathhouse.

734
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,240
And I want to be able to go to that without making a lifestyle change.

735
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,720
You know what I mean?

736
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,560
I just want to be part of that experience.

737
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,640
I would like to be a member of a bathhouse in the same way that I want to be a member

738
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,160
of a gym, where I just show up and just go to the juice bar.

739
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,640
Like, I don't want to actually work out or do any of that stuff.

740
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,480
I just want to hang out and like, get some juice.

741
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,040
I mean, if you go to a bathhouse, you're going to get some juice.

742
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,800
You know there are juice stores.

743
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,040
Yeah.

744
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,040
I may have a fundamental-

745
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,160
Travis, will you do me a favor?

746
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,040
Will you go to a bathhouse, walk in the door and just shout,

747
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,480
where can I get some juice?

748
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,840
Give me the juice.

749
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,880
Anyone got juice?

750
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,840
I may have a fundamental misunderstanding of what a bathhouse is.

751
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,040
I do not know.

752
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,600
I believe it's like a skeezy YMCA.

753
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,520
It's a sexy YMCA, where there's no workout equipment, just the bath part.

754
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,480
Just a large tub filled with naked people.

755
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,160
I don't think it's one large tub.

756
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,880
See, that's what I thought.

757
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,320
I'm almost certain it's one large tub, and then you have steam rooms off on the side.

758
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,520
I thought it was just like a big, hot pool.

759
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,480
Like a pool that is heated, and also there's like 30 goddamn dicks in that thing.

760
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,440
Will someone please email us and let us know what their personal favorite bathhouse is like?

761
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,440
I don't want to read it.

762
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,320
I don't want to read it.

763
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,440
I want Travis to read it.

764
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,720
But you're not going to have to read it.

765
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,440
I'm going to have to read it.

766
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,640
I'm going to get educated on this.

767
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:41,680
I just googled bathhouse, and the top result is a Wikipedia entry for gay bathhouse.

768
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,520
And the second result is a Wikipedia entry for bathhouse.

769
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,680
So even Google kind of...

770
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,920
Google's biased.

771
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,480
But really, you two, let's dig deep.

772
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,720
What is the most unique bathing experience you've ever seen, or maybe even imagined?

773
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,520
Like for reals?

774
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,600
Because I've seen on some like travel specials where there's stuff where they

775
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:11,840
bathe in like lava-heated pools and stuff that I guess looks okay, and there's monkeys in them.

776
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,120
On episode three sheets, I saw Zane Lamprey bathe in beer.

777
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,880
It's supposed to be a hangover cure.

778
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,680
Yeah, that looked nice.

779
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,120
Oh, comfy.

780
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,000
Maybe bullshit, but...

781
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,720
I, this is, I can't in good conscience come up with anything because

782
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,000
we've talked about how dangerous baths are.

783
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,080
Yeah, we, I think we are pretty firmly anti-bath.

784
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,880
I feel like...

785
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,760
I mean, you can do it.

786
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,520
You just have to be responsible about it.

787
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,040
And there's nothing more irresponsible than a hot donkey milk bath

788
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,640
because what's going on in that water?

789
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,720
To be fair though, the nice thing about bathhouses is it provides you with 29 spotters

790
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,400
to make sure that if you go down, there's someone there to pull you back up.

791
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,320
Unless they, yeah, unless they don't want you to.

792
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,200
Hey, the problem with bathhouses, we couldn't even afford to get into one

793
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,080
because we don't have the money to do it.

794
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,600
Is there any solution for that?

795
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,080
Is there a steep price to get into these bathhouses?

796
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,640
I don't know.

797
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,120
There are prices.

798
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,560
Let me hop on Ticket Hub.

799
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,160
Did you say Dickit Hub?

800
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:32,960
Ticket Hub, money zone, money zone.

801
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,560
Travis, our first is, our first is with GameOverNation.com.

802
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,280
Can you tell us about it?

803
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,000
Well, GameOverNation is a video game site.

804
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,720
It's just three dudes, Javi, Ryan, and Dylan,

805
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
and they give their thoughts on the video game industry.

806
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,520
Uh, they have cartoon doppelgangers that star in their animated game reviews and web comic.

807
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Uh, and they, uh, provide instructional videos on how comics are made, which is pretty cool.

808
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,880
In addition to the comic, they have editorials, weekly podcasts, things that'll keep you entertained.

809
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,040
So if you want to check it out, you can go to GameOverNation.com.

810
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,360
GameOverNation.com.

811
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,400
Uh, I, wow, I didn't mean to sing that.

812
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,440
I hope I didn't, I hope Griffin didn't try to murder me for edging out his groove.

813
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:23,680
Um, the other big exciting thing we have going on this week is, uh, that is, it's, it's for a lady named Melissa.

814
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,200
Sweet Melissa.

815
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,280
Hey, Melissa.

816
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,240
This is from Chris.

817
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,200
And Chris wants you to know, Melissa, that he wants you to have a happy fourth anniversary.

818
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,440
You play Borderlands together, you play Resident Evil 5 together.

819
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,040
You're in love, one would assume.

820
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:51,040
He kills bugs, she makes sushi, me hopes there's not a connection between the two.

821
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,240
Um, but you guys are, are in love, and I support that.

822
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,000
And I want you to know that you found each other, you hold tight to one another now that you've found someone who will have you.

823
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,600
Never let them go.

824
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,320
We also have a third conductor.

825
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,360
This, this train has a lot of conductors, which is insane.

826
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,560
Yeah, it's a crowded train.

827
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:24,800
Um, the conductor is, uh, a listener named Taryn, which is a pretty radical name, who, uh, wishes her boyfriend, Israel Briggs, which is the fucking coolest name, uh, a happy belated birthday.

828
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,600
His birthday is July 19th, and, uh, she wants to say, I'm gonna do my best Taryn impression.

829
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,720
Happy birthday from your loving girlfriend Taryn, and I guess I got my swagger back.

830
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,520
That's so sweet.

831
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,720
That's beloved.

832
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,480
People are, people are showing their love for each other with quotes from our show.

833
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,920
I'm uncomfortable with that, actually.

834
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:57,040
Now let's mock them in song.

835
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:04,160
You've got a high score in my heart, and I hope that we never part.

836
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:10,880
And you can be my player, too, and I will do strange things to you.

837
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:30,240
I said, Melissa and Chris and Taryn and Israel, you've got to get your gaming news from GameOverNation.com.

838
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,240
Happy birthday.

839
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
Wait, fuck.

840
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,240
Was it somebody, it was somebody's birthday, okay.

841
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
Someone's birthday.

842
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,240
Wonderful, Griffin, another, another fine job.

843
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,240
These are getting badder.

844
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,240
Yeah, maybe we need to stop doing these.

845
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:53,440
Um, uh, hey, I fear I might have a problem with hoarding.

846
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,560
I just realized that within arm's reach, I have eight keyboards and three more within

847
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,800
a couple of steps.

848
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,520
I bought four keyboards in the last week.

849
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
Do I need help?

850
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
Or am I just weird?

851
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,520
Can I be both?

852
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,520
You're definitely weird.

853
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,520
Yeah.

854
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,520
Those aren't mutually exclusive, Kara.

855
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,520
Yeah.

856
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
Yeah.

857
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,520
Weird people need help.

858
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
Uh.

859
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,520
God damn.

860
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,520
You own 11 keyboards?

861
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,720
Okay.

862
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,720
What kind?

863
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Okay.

864
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,480
So like if you own 11 computer keyboards, you're definitely weird.

865
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,360
If you own 11 musical keyboards and like after you buy each one, you're like, it's not the

866
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,360
right sound.

867
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,720
That's what I hear in my head.

868
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,320
Or you've built a keyboard wall.

869
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,320
Yeah.

870
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,720
Then you have like this epic, like, you would hear it on John D. Libertas, you know, soundscapes

871
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,720
or whatever it's called.

872
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,720
That'd be awesome.

873
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,720
I'm sorry.

874
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
How was that again?

875
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,720
Sorry, Travis?

876
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,720
It's synthesizers.

877
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,880
And you said it would be awesome.

878
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,880
That's how synthesizers sound?

879
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
Yeah.

880
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
Be-bong-boo.

881
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,880
Echoes.

882
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,880
That's the name of the show.

883
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,080
Echoes with John D. Libertas.

884
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,040
What the fuck are you talking about anymore?

885
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,120
You don't know about Echoes?

886
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,840
You have to stop liking bad things.

887
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,040
I don't like it.

888
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,040
I can't stress enough.

889
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
I don't like it.

890
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,040
All right.

891
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,040
It's what comes on NPR at like nine o'clock.

892
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,040
Okay.

893
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
Listen.

894
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
I'm sorry, John.

895
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
He's a listener, of course.

896
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,040
I'm sorry, John D. Libertas.

897
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
Libertas.

898
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,380
John D. Libertas.

899
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:23,600
Is it possible that she has 22 hands?

900
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,760
Oh, like you think she can't input the data?

901
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,720
Like a man in black, like the alien for men in black, the one that hangs out in the central

902
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:37,720
hub of the MIB headquarters, MIB HQ, and keeps track of all the aliens.

903
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,440
I think it was, you had a name like Bob or something, like something simple, a simple

904
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,440
name that you wouldn't expect the alien to have.

905
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,160
Fuck what a good movie.

906
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
I wish I had a keyboard to smash.

907
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,160
That would be fun.

908
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,160
But here, okay.

909
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,360
You break one of those keyboards over your knee or something.

910
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
That would be very stressful.

911
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,960
I think that everybody has at some point while they were like doing spring cleaning or something

912
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,680
realized that they owned-

913
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,680
11 keyboards?

914
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,320
No, that they owned like, why do I have three copies of the same book?

915
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,880
Or why do I have, you know, all these movies?

916
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,360
And why do I have four, you know, half empty spindles of burnable DVDs?

917
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,980
That's normal.

918
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:18,080
What's not normal is going out and in one week buying four keyboards in one week.

919
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,080
That's no longer about 40.

920
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,520
You know you've got a keyboard.

921
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,520
Yeah.

922
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,800
Like if I have, for example, if I realized yesterday while I was cleaning out my cupboards,

923
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,320
I have two boxes of kosher salt.

924
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,080
If I have two boxes of kosher salt, that's a coincidence.

925
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,480
If I buy four boxes of kosher salt in one week, I have an iodine deficiency and I need

926
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,480
to go to the doctor.

927
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,180
That's the difference.

928
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:46,480
So yes, if you find yourself uncontrollably buying computer keyboards, you probably have

929
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,480
an issue.

930
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,400
Do you think she only meant to buy, like she went to Best Buy and she was like, she just

931
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:57,440
wanted the one keyboard, but she slipped, she slipped up somehow and she accidentally

932
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,440
bought four?

933
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,640
Do you mean like she was tempted by the features offered by the other three keyboards?

934
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,320
I'm saying she went to the counter at Best Buy and was like, let me get four keyboards.

935
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,320
And they're like, okay.

936
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,520
And they round her up and by the time she was halfway home, she was like, ah, fuck,

937
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,320
I meant one keyboard.

938
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,760
Maybe she said she, Floridian slipped it, was too embarrassed to correct.

939
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,920
And they're like, are you sure?

940
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,640
Excuse me, did you ask for four keyboards?

941
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,640
Yes.

942
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,640
Yeah, I did.

943
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,720
Why don't you mind your own fucking business?

944
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,800
I guess I would want to know, like, why, like, what do you think you need so many for?

945
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,280
Is it so, is it because you keep finding better ones?

946
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,260
Because I own a lot of like Mises.

947
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,040
I own a lot of headphones.

948
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:43,140
I mean, maybe she's really heavy handed and she keeps like breaking the keys.

949
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:49,000
And also for her to keep finding better ones and buy four in the same week, that is predicated

950
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
on her, like, seeing a keyboard at Best Buy, grabbing it, running it up to the cashier

951
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,840
supermarket sweep style, and then going back onto the floor, like, okay, ah, fuck, there's

952
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
another one.

953
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,840
Oh, no returns.

954
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,840
Huh?

955
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,840
Okay.

956
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,840
Fuck.

957
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,760
Also, I'm, I'm not all that up on technology and computers and whatnot, but what kind of

958
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,800
keyboard advancements have there been in the last, I don't know, say week that would

959
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,800
necessitate her?

960
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,800
I see, there's more than you'd think.

961
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,800
Yeah.

962
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,800
Really?

963
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,800
What does the keyboard offer?

964
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,800
My keyboard.

965
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,800
This one now with more letters.

966
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,640
My keyboard's wireless.

967
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,800
My keyboard is very light.

968
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,280
My keyboard turns on when you wave your hand over it and glows from within.

969
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,280
Did you get that?

970
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,080
Did you get that keyboard with the new letter on it?

971
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,120
This has Z2.

972
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,120
Huh?

973
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,120
Z1 and Z2.

974
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,120
Yeah, Z2.

975
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,240
It's the sequel to Z. What?

976
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,880
This has Z and Zed, which is pretty cool.

977
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,160
I can't give advice here because I'm too perplexed.

978
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:57,620
If I had 11 keyboards, I would just, I would just run.

979
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,440
I would just run away from my house as fast as I possibly could.

980
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,360
Can I say something here?

981
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:10,600
I don't mean to be a downer, but if we can't find a logical reason why Kara has 11 keyboards,

982
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:16,320
maybe it's, and then she asks us if she needs help or if she's just weird, maybe it's that

983
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,340
first one.

984
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:22,640
Maybe you do need to talk to somebody about keyboards.

985
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:28,160
It's like, I was watching David Hasselhoff on Same Name, of course, last week, and he

986
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:34,200
was working in the electrical industry because David Hasselhoff that he was replacing was

987
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,560
working in the electrical industry.

988
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:42,120
And they went to fix a giant breaker, a giant electrical breaker, and he was cleaning it

989
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,240
out.

990
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,440
And David Hasselhoff said, I don't even know where the electrical breaker is in my own

991
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,620
home.

992
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,680
If the lights go out at my house, I move.

993
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,000
Hey, Dave.

994
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,520
That's the kind of keyboard relationship.

995
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,380
Dave, I- Oh, so she doesn't know how to clean it, so she just buys a new one.

996
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:06,640
I think that, Dave, I really appreciate everything you've done for our show, but you can't have

997
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,680
that much money left, dawg.

998
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,280
You can't have more than, I'm gonna say, a hundo thou in the bank right now, at this

999
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,480
very moment.

1000
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:21,000
Nah, he's got a guaranteed revenue stream, because every time things get tight, he sells

1001
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,720
a shitty black car to somebody and says it's the real kit.

1002
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,720
Oh, man.

1003
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,640
This is the real one they use in the show.

1004
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,640
Believe this.

1005
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,560
I can't believe I'm parting with this.

1006
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,560
This is a minivan.

1007
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,840
Yeah, no, that was it.

1008
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,480
They just filmed it from weird angles.

1009
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,480
Bye, Feeny.

1010
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,480
This is the real kit.

1011
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,480
Treat him nice.

1012
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,480
Treat him good.

1013
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,920
Thanks for the hundo grand.

1014
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,840
It's not a problem for him.

1015
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:48,560
My younger brother has a tendency of doing overly romantic things for his girlfriend.

1016
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,880
For example- I almost thought that was gonna say me, and I thought this was gonna be the

1017
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,880
best question ever.

1018
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,920
I got so excited.

1019
00:46:54,920 --> 00:47:00,280
For example, he took her to see the sunrise on the east coast of Florida, went skydiving,

1020
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,480
had a fancy dinner, and then watched the sunset on the west coast of Florida.

1021
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,840
How can I avoid looking like a jerk to my girlfriend when my younger brother is clearly

1022
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,720
setting the bar too high with his girlfriend, says Dan.

1023
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,280
That's the sweetest thing I have ever read.

1024
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,760
Hey, Bad News Dan, you better worry about looking like a bad boyfriend to us.

1025
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,760
Like start with us and then work to your girlfriend.

1026
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,760
He-

1027
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,760
Because I'm impressed with your brother.

1028
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,760
I'm impressed with Dan's brother.

1029
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,760
Dan Jr.

1030
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,760
Dan Jr.

1031
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,320
Dan Jr.

1032
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:40,760
But keep in mind, that date sounds great, but it may have been like super stressful.

1033
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,720
Because he watched the sunrise on the east coast of Florida, he's like, get the fucking

1034
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,720
car!

1035
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,720
We gotta go!

1036
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,720
Get in the car!

1037
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,720
We're racing the sun!

1038
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,720
Dan, I don't know what to tell you.

1039
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,260
I think you gotta give up love forever, or go away, or move away so that nobody ever

1040
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,840
hears about your younger brother's exploits, because he is some sort of like genetically

1041
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,360
engineered Lothario that can't be beat.

1042
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,520
That's the sweetest thing I've ever read.

1043
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,680
A sunrise and a sunset?

1044
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,040
And they went skydiving?

1045
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,720
Maybe you could hope that eventually, and inevitably, he'll run out of things to do

1046
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,200
and then he'll just start repeating himself.

1047
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,200
Oh, right.

1048
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,700
I don't think he'll ever run out of things to do.

1049
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,440
I think date two is somehow they're gonna go to space.

1050
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,820
I was gonna say that!

1051
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,960
We watched the sunrise from the moon!

1052
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:34,680
Dan, I think your best ploy is to secretly, covertly tear down your brother when he's

1053
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,120
not in the room.

1054
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:43,240
So let him tell his story, and then as soon as he leaves the room, you lean over to your

1055
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,920
girlfriend and say, secretly, he does not have a penis.

1056
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,920
Yeah.

1057
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,120
Or, secretly, he's very abusive.

1058
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:57,280
Like something where it's gonna tear Dan Jr. down and build you up.

1059
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,280
And not true.

1060
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,280
It can't be true.

1061
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,280
Like, what do you want, baby?

1062
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,280
You want the sunset every night?

1063
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,440
Or do you want a man who has a penis?

1064
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,440
Your call.

1065
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:12,200
Do you want a man with a penis, or do you want to see, like taste oranges from every

1066
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,200
part of the state?

1067
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,200
Because he bought you a big box of them.

1068
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,200
Eat all these oranges!

1069
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,200
I love you!

1070
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,200
Sorry about my no penis.

1071
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:25,000
I'm like, I'm like a Ken doll down there, but I'm taking you to space.

1072
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,360
This is the weirdest card on a floral bouquet I've ever received.

1073
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:34,480
Uh, yeah, Dan Jr., what would you like the card to say?

1074
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,000
Um, sorry I'm all smooth down there.

1075
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Eat these oranges.

1076
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I love you.

1077
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,680
Hey, check it out, sunset!

1078
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,680
Look up!

1079
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,680
Look up!

1080
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,680
Don't look down!

1081
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,680
Don't look down!

1082
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,280
Ain't nothing for you there.

1083
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,960
It's my own orange grove.

1084
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,960
I love you.

1085
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,840
I styled my pubes to look like a penis.

1086
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,840
I love you.

1087
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,040
It's very romantic.

1088
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,000
How did we not think of that?

1089
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,800
How did we not think of that when we were talking about the pube question to make your

1090
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,280
pubes look like another penis?

1091
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,240
Another bigger penis on top of your penis armor, as it were.

1092
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,240
A penis jerkin.

1093
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,240
Yeah.

1094
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,240
A gherkin jerkin.

1095
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,240
A gherkin jerkin.

1096
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,280
A gherkin jerkin for jerkin.

1097
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,280
A jerkin jerkin.

1098
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,280
Um, a merkin jerkin.

1099
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,280
Stop.

1100
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,280
A merkin jerkin lurkin.

1101
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,280
Turducken.

1102
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:26,800
I styled my pubes to do a turducken.

1103
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:32,000
Dan, I think, I think you just gotta chill on this for a bit because Dan Jr.'s gonna

1104
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,560
get his heart broke sooner rather than later.

1105
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:41,360
I mean, everyone's romantic style is different and, you know, maybe yours is more sustainable.

1106
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,700
It is universal.

1107
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:47,040
When Dan Jr. gets his heart broke, the shine is gonna come right off that love apple.

1108
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,040
It's gonna come right up off it.

1109
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,040
Oh, sure.

1110
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,040
Yeah.

1111
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,340
Today, I'm taking you to this table at Denny's and then we're going to move to another table

1112
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,000
at Denny's, provided this is not an inconvenience.

1113
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Why are you crying?

1114
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I miss the sunsets.

1115
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I miss my penis.

1116
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Bad things happen.

1117
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:09,880
That's where you get a sausage factory for you.

1118
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,160
Grow up.

1119
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,160
Going to love again.

1120
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,160
I can't.

1121
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,160
I'm Dan Jr.

1122
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,160
Dan Jr. is...

1123
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,160
Griffin's right.

1124
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,640
Dan Jr., this is a...

1125
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:24,280
He is in a sprint and Dan is in a marathon.

1126
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,160
So you're saying Dan Jr.'s playing a young man's game.

1127
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,360
Dan Jr.'s playing a young man's game.

1128
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,360
That's exactly it.

1129
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,160
They're gonna bench him in the 15th outing.

1130
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,160
Wow.

1131
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,160
Yep.

1132
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,160
You know what I mean?

1133
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,160
Nope.

1134
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,160
You know.

1135
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:48,200
He's gonna get a couple of hit-ems and he's just gonna ice it in the showers, you know?

1136
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,200
I don't know.

1137
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,200
Are these croquet terms?

1138
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,680
Why have I never heard these before?

1139
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,960
He's gonna get a few hoops.

1140
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,960
Yep.

1141
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,960
Mm-hmm.

1142
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,960
A few long...

1143
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,960
Some long booms.

1144
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,960
Some RBAs.

1145
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,960
Some RBAs.

1146
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,960
Tell you...

1147
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,960
And Dan, here's the other thing.

1148
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,960
He's your younger brother.

1149
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,400
Go to him and tell him to fucking cheese it.

1150
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,400
Yeah.

1151
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,240
Say, Dan Jr., can you cheese it with that?

1152
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,840
Can you please keep it to yourself if you're gonna keep doing it?

1153
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,840
Which you should not.

1154
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:17,360
Hey, Dan, I spoke to every other guy in the world ever and you're making us all look bad.

1155
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,360
Not me.

1156
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,360
Yeah.

1157
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,360
You guys don't know my style.

1158
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,360
You know what I do?

1159
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,800
I give a lady two sunsets in a day.

1160
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,920
Like you cross that international date line?

1161
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:32,120
I fly backwards across the world and I catch Sunset, the sequel.

1162
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,120
You catch the 11 o'clock.

1163
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,120
Uh-huh.

1164
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:41,320
I get on my private jet in my G6 and then we fly and we just keep catching and we just

1165
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,200
chase that sun.

1166
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,440
Do we have time for one more question or do we need to wrap up?

1167
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,920
We have time for one more Yahoo question.

1168
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,920
Okay.

1169
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:49,920
This one was sent in by...

1170
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,920
Make it a good one.

1171
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,920
This one was sent in by Michael Maney.

1172
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,920
Thank you, Michael.

1173
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,920
Hey.

1174
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,920
Hey.

1175
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,920
You know that guy.

1176
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,920
It's my...

1177
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,920
Who is also the artist of the amazing Giant Scott Baklova versus Donnerfield.

1178
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,920
Oh, my God.

1179
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,240
You should be following us if you have not seen it.

Michael Maney.

1184
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,240
M-A-Y-N-E.

1185
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,240
Yahoo!

1186
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:16,280
Answer's user Bunny asks, do ghosts see you when you are having sex or when you are using

1187
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,520
the toilet?

1188
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:23,000
I think my house is haunted and I don't mind, but I was thinking that if it was my dead

1189
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,920
granddad or anyone else I know who has died, then it would be embarrassing if they saw

1190
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:31,360
me naked or doing things with my husband or on the toilet.

1191
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:38,920
Hey, dummy, here's the thing.

1192
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:44,600
Let's play into the premise that your house is haunted with your granddad.

1193
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:49,600
Do you think that in the ethereal plane, he's really super-duper worried about what you're

1194
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,600
doing on the toilet?

1195
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,520
Yeah, that would be really weird of your grandpa.

1196
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,160
Was your grandpa like a nasty freak?

1197
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,800
Is that like something you do, like poke his head in ghost head style, like what's going

1198
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,800
on in here?

1199
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,800
Oh, sorry.

1200
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,800
I didn't realize.

1201
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,120
Oh, I won't keep you.

1202
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,120
I tried to-

1203
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,280
If he was a nasty Gramps in real life, then I have no reason to believe he won't be a

1204
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,560
nasty Gramps in the afterlife.

1205
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:13,640
You know, ghosts, the idea of a ghost is that after they die, they had unfinished business.

1206
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,960
If his unfinished business is to peep on you while you're doing it or hitting the toilet,

1207
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,960
then-

1208
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,640
If his unfinished business is your unfinished business, then-

1209
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,720
I can't move on until I watch your deuce.

1210
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,880
I can't move on until you make a movement.

1211
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,840
I would watch people fuck all the time if I was a ghost, so-

1212
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,400
Eat your ghost popcorn.

1213
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,400
What is this question?

1214
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,900
Is this-

1215
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,800
Of course they fucking do.

1216
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,520
Like, are ghosts not allowed to watch you fuck?

1217
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,480
Like, if you have sex in a room with a ghost in, the ghost is like, oh, I gotta go!

1218
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,480
Gotta dip!

1219
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,480
This is awkward.

1220
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,480
Are they just colorblind?

1221
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,360
Like, they can't see naked people?

1222
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,360
Don't be a child.

1223
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,360
This is-

1224
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,400
Don't be a child.

1225
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,800
Of course ghosts are watching you have sex all the time.

1226
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,640
You're not allowed to believe in ghosts and hauntings and also believe that ghosts aren't

1227
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,000
gonna watch you fuck and use the bathroom, because of course they do.

1228
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,000
The reason the rest of us are out here in fucking Sane Town is because I- that idea

1229
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
is too creepy.

1230
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,200
I can't- I can't even begin to believe that- that there are not only ghosts, but they're

1231
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,200
watching me deuce.

1232
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,880
Do you know why it's creepy?

1233
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,920
Almost a trillion people have walked the Earth.

1234
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,680
Just one- really, let that number sink in.

1235
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,400
A trill of people have walked the Earth.

1236
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,120
The space is gotta be- we are just caught in like a fog of ghosts.

1237
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:39,440
So, what you're saying is, the chances that when I am shooting a duke, there is a ghost

1238
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,440
not only watching me, but occupying the same space that I am.

1239
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,440
In you!

1240
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,440
Under you!

1241
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,200
You are shitting at a ghost!

1242
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,760
You are not only having sex with your wife, you're having sex with like three to four

1243
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,560
ghosts that are inhabiting the same space as your wife's.

1244
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,200
We need to deal with this astral infestation.

1245
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,320
This is ridiculous, Griffin.

1246
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,360
Many of them have gone to hell.

1247
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,280
For watching people use the bathroom.

1248
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:09,560
That's the secret about ghosts, like that's the one rule of ghosts, is that you get to

1249
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,280
walk the Earth, but if you watch people have sex, or make a BM, or if you actually see

1250
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,840
a penis or a boob, you go to hell.

1251
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,840
Instantly.

1252
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,840
There is no appeal.

1253
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:23,320
I'm suggesting that we can really get rid of these trillion ghosts if we all just walk

1254
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,320
around with our dicks out.

1255
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,320
Yeah, bye ghosts.

1256
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,320
What are you doing?

1257
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:31,720
They'll say as I walk down the street with my dick out, and I'll just say, ghost busted.

1258
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,000
Busted makes me feel good.

1259
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,360
Busted makes me feel good, which explains how fully erect I am.

1260
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,680
Don't mind me.

1261
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,680
What are you doing?

1262
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,680
I'm killing ghosts.

1263
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,680
Well.

1264
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,280
It makes me feel good.

1265
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,800
It's finally happened.

1266
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,800
Finally happened.

1267
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,520
I'm chasing ghosts around with his penis.

1268
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:53,000
Did you guys hear Ray Parker Jr. got locked up for public exposure?

1269
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,480
We got to get him out.

1270
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:01,480
He's the only one who can stop- There's a joke about me calling my penis Slimer in here.

1271
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,480
Give me a second.

1272
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,480
Okay.

1273
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,480
We'll just take a break.

1274
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,480
Okay.

1275
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,480
All right.

1276
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,480
I'll tell you what.

1277
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,480
We'll do some housekeeping, and then we'll come back.

1278
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,480
Okay.

1279
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,360
And you can tell us the joke about your penis being named Slimer.

1280
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,560
You can follow us on Twitter.

1281
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:16,720
We're NBNBAM, at NBNBAM, I guess.

1282
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,200
We have forums at MaximumFun.org.

1283
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:23,920
You can email us, NBNBAM, at MaximumFun.org.

1284
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,240
And we got a FormSpring question in here, so I'm going to start checking those again.

1285
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,760
So if you want to hit us up on FormSpring, you can.

1286
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,960
I suggest Gmail, though.

1287
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,160
It's much more direct.

1288
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,160
Yeah.

1289
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,160
It's easier to catalog to.

1290
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,520
There are other MaximumFun podcasts that you would enjoy.

1291
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,480
Check out Jordan and Jesse go to the Sound of Young America.

1292
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,760
Stop podcasting yourself.

00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,480
Also, we have t-shirts for sale.

1295
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,520
All the t-shirts are back in.

1296
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,600
They're all at MaxFunStore.com.

1297
00:57:54,600 --> 00:58:01,080
Some were sold out, but they are all back, all sizes, and any ones you could want.

1298
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,440
Some are running low.

1299
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,760
I see that the 2X has gone on back order.

1300
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,440
Those will be back in momentarily, I'm sure.

1301
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,400
But most all the sizes are there, so go get them.

1302
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,400
Go buy them.

1303

Not just listening, but also spreading the word to people.

1308
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:45,040
A lot of people like SmartBuddy, Joshba, Patrick Neville, Brendan from Beer, spreading the

1309
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,040
word.

1310
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,800
A lot of people trying to get the Onion AV Club to review us.

1311
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,720
I really appreciate that.

1312
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,720
Thanks to Indie Mike.

1313
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,560
And you know, special thanks not only to all of our wonderful Twitter friends, but all

1314
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:02,760
of our real life friends that are going out there and talking to people in the real world.

1315
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,200
Maybe you're telling your friends about it at work or something like that and you don't

1316
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,880
get a chance to mention it on Twitter.

1317
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,880
So thank you if you're doing, you know, fighting the good fight.

1318
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,200
And I want to thank our best friend of all, John Roderick and the Long Winners, for letting

1319
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,200
us use the song.

1320
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,840
It's a departure as our theme song.

1321
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:23,240
You can get that song and a bunch of other really good songs on the album Putting the

1322
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,160
Days to Bed, which is on iTunes.

1323
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,160
So go buy it, silly.

1324
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,200
So buy it, dumb-dumb.

1325
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:35,040
All right, this final Yahoo is sent in by Gray Dotridge, it's by Yahoo Institute's user

1326
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:43,840
Chris Monsanto, who asks, is Family Matters an accurate portrayal of African-American

1327
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:44,840
families?

1328
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,840
I'm Justin McElroy.

1329
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,840
I'm Travis McElroy.

1330
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,840
I'm Coco McElroy.

1331
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,840
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1332
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,840
Kiss your dad.

1333
00:59:49,840 --> 01:00:10,440
Square on the lips.
