1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm your most mystical, baby-est brother, Griffin McElroy.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Wait, most mystical? Wow, that could only mean one thing.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's right Justin, it's time to go back to the movies.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hit the red carpet, and grab me some corn from the stands, cause we're, it's Doctor Strange, watch everybody.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Marvel's back, they've done the damn thing again, and we're here for another high-flying action adventure with everyone's favorite wizard, Doctor Strange.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And who's that up in the mix? It's the Cumberdy Batch.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's the Cumberbatch, and he's doing his great American accent, everyone loves when that happens.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What's that behind your ear? It's a coin from the world's greatest powerful wizard.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Wow, thank you Doctor Strange, you're welcome Griffin.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I am not a Britishman, and this is, I'm a really American man, and this is how it sounds, my normal American voice.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay, I also, just a side note here, I can't stress enough how on board with this watch and excited I am.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Did Marvel think that everybody was so enamored and well-versed with the true history of Doctor Strange that we wouldn't accept a British Doctor Strange?

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We can't change the accent.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We can't make him British, they went riot.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You do not understand, my, me, Benedict Cumberbatch, I am an American man from Montana.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And this is my regular voice, and I'm not a British man, and when I speak in British, it gets very exhausting.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Two people can do decent American accents that are British, they're Emma Thompson and Hugh Laurie.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's it, those are the only ones.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I actually, I don't believe that Hugh Laurie is British.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I think that that was a lie perpetrated by Blackadder and Jeeves and Wooster, but you know what, I'm willing to be proven wrong.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's get back to this watch though.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Let's get back to this watch because abracadabra, it's going to reach out and grab you this film, and it's going to grab your heart is the other thing.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
There's a romance in the movie, and you watch it and you go like, I think the real magic was not the way that he bends and makes the cities all crumpled up and weird.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It was love the whole time, I think.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah, the rabbit that he pulls out of his hat is actually the ghost of his wife that passed away, and that's an angle that is very controversial.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It'll change that, but not the accent.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah, that's a little strange.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And also, I thought it was a nice touch, I think, something for the kids, that they gave him that whimsical talking cartoon cape sidekick.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Like he puts the cape around and it's like, you know, that's his buddy, and it talks to him, which is just going to be great for merchandising.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, Don Caper is the name they went with.

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Which is weird.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
A strange one indeed.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You know the thing that's crazy about this new Marvel superhero?

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He's so weird though.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He's a really weird guy.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He's very strange.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I thought it was weird at the end of the movie, they just revealed that he's actually grown up Harry Potter.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And then he says, that's right, I'm grown up Harry Potter.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And then he leans over, and Spider-Man's been there the whole time.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And then they kiss, and then Spider-Man's like, nothing strange about this doctor.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And they all kiss.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You know what I thought it was weird?

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Which part was weird for you?

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Well, because I saw on all the blogs that there was going to be a cameo by David Copperfield.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But then he's like in the whole movie.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So in the whole movie as Doctor Strange.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, which is weird.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But you don't know it until the end, and then it's revealed that it's actually been the him the whole time.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Not in a mask or anything, but you just couldn't tell.

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
American Benedict Cumberbatch just plays Doctor Strange's friend, Jeremy.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's so good though.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Jeremy Regler.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Jeremy Regler is his name, and he's really good and super duper American.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So American.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The one thing I like is the 15 minute montage at the beginning, which is when he's just a regular brain surgeon.

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And it's just a montage of people learning what their brain surgeon's actual name is.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And saying, no, I don't think so.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I think probably not on this one with what it all is my brain, you know.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think I'm just going to go with any other name pretty much.

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No, it's pronounced Strangy.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, it's not.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's not.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I know the word.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I may need brain surgery, but I can still figure out that I'm not going to go to Doctor Strange.

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I thought it was weird when he gets his super magical powers.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And then there's a 30 minute montage where he uses them to make girls' dresses blow around all crazy at the park.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And he gets a boner.

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That part is weird.

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And he goes, oh wow, a boner just for me.

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hey everybody, I've got a boner.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The fixation on the goatee giving him powers and the one scene where it gets shorn off and in real time he has to grow it back on a park bench is so odd to me.

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But you know what, I liked it.

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Cinematographically speaking, it totally makes sense though because they really, at least that shot, that 25 minute shot of him growing his goatee back is really earned.

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I did think it was weird that the movie is nine hours long.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah, but I mean they need to get, in the hair scene they just had to get into that tree of life shit.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Like the POV of each individual follicle, the cells and the nutrients just sort of mix in together.

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And then like you see a big yellow blob fall down and it pans out and his beard's back and he's been eating an egg salad sandwich.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's so weird.

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What was weird for you?

90
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The weirdest thing is when he goes to order a sandwich at the deli and the guy takes his name and the guy is Chris Angel.

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And when he gives him his name, Chris Angel is like, and how do you spell that?

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And it's like a weird, it's like he's twinkling his fingers at the camera and there's like sparks and stuff.

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And I'm like, yeah, spell, I get it. But why is Chris Angel so prominent in it?

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And then he's in the rest of the movie too.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And I thought it was weird during that sandwich scene when Jeremy, Dr. Strange's good friend and roommate says like,

96
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Could I get some crisps? And he's like, oh fuck, I mean, no.

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Do you know what I thought was weird?

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm me.

99
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What about in this one, Trav?

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What I thought was weird, but I'm really glad they did it in retrospect. This is the first movie to show the characters going to the bathroom.

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Like they'd be in the middle of a scene and then they were just like, hold on one second.

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And they go to the bathroom and they like in real time show like Jeremy sitting in the living room for like 10 minutes waiting for Dr. Strange to come back from the bathroom.

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I thought it was bold and at first I didn't get it.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And no spoilers, but it ends up playing into the finale that they've been going to the bathroom the whole time.

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He gets in a big boss, a magical fight with Professor Peculiar and Jeremy's there helping him out, but he dies.

106
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh shit, sorry.

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I said no spoilers.

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Anyway, him and Professor Peculiar, like he's like, can we stop?

109
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Can we stop for a moment?

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So my IBS, I have got to make a very magical dookie.

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And Professor Peculiar is like, yes.

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And then he also goes.

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I thought the strangest scene for me is the crossover thing where Wolverine shows up and he's like, hey, bub, it's clobbering time.

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And then Dr. Strange does a spell that makes his fingers melt.

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
OK, that was strange because obviously that's going to conquer Wolverine right away.

116
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But then Spider-Man comes and he melts his fingers and also Thor and Iron Man and Black Widow and Hawkeye and Captain America.

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And he melts all their fingers off.

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And what's really crazy is then Batman swoops in and they all spend like 45 minutes just beating the fucking shit out of them.

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And the whole time they're just yelling about how stupid DC is and how bad and childish the movies are.

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But they don't have any fingers while they're doing it.

121
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No, but they beat him to death.

122
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And then like three of them peel off like the Hulk and Iron Man and Daredevil.

123
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
They peel, and Elektra, they peel off to go use the bathroom together.

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The weird thing is after Batman.

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What was strange for you, Justin?

126
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What was weird? What was weird, Justin?

127
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You watched the whole movie.

128
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Same scene.

129
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Which of the scene was?

130
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But after they kill Batman and then Dr. Strange conjures a life-size Calvin to pee on him.

131
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
On him.

132
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's like so, because it's like just a, I don't know if it's a meme, like kind of a meme culture kind of thing.

133
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's kind of like a, yeah.

134
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And but then he casts another spell and the Calvin turns into Stan Lee and he's like Excelsior.

135
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But there's like a stream of piss coming out of his old cartoon dick.

136
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I want the, sidebar, I thought it was really fun, the Stan Lee cameo.

137
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
When they pulled up to Stan Lee's house and he opens the front door and he's like,

138
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I told you I didn't want to be in this one.

139
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And they're like hilarious.

140
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Thanks Stan, bye.

141
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Thanks Stan.

142
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Should we do some advice?

143
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah, I do want to say.

144
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I got some advice.

145
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Go see this fucking movie.

146
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, it is an absolute trip.

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I mean plan your day around it.

148
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You need to bring two.

149
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah, definitely.

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's nine hours.

151
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You need to bring two meals in with you.

152
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And maybe a thermos to like, maybe with coffee.

153
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Because it's, like I said, nine hours long.

154
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's a full day's journey.

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We just bought a house and when we looked in the attic, we found 280 rolls of toilet paper in unopened 40 pack boxes.

156
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I did the math and at Sam's Club, this is $137 worth of toilet paper.

157
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh my God.

158
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,000
To make it stranger promo, cross promo, the toilet paper wasn't there at the home inspection a month beforehand.

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay.

160
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
All right.

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm weirded out.

162
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Should we use it?

163
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Am I good?

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And that's from Vex in Virginia.

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That was excellent reading Justin.

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You're not only good, you are great.

167
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You might have a magic house.

168
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I mean it could be like the Giving Tree or perhaps a smart house situation where they know that you're going to do some work.

169
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
280 rolls, I can make that last for like three months.

170
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Dude, are you kidding me?

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's awesome.

172
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah, you can have that taken off your plate for so long.

173
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's so much good stuff to find up there.

174
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Griffin, did you say you could do 280 rolls for three months?

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's like three rolls a day.

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Well, it depends on the brand because some of them you really got to like.

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't want to get it.

178
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We talked so much bathroom jive last week.

179
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I would rather avoid these choppy waters.

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't want to talk about bathrooms.

181
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I want to talk about a concerning realization I had because I was thinking, well, this makes sense because what happened was they did the home inspection and then they were trying to clean out that one room where they had all their stuff because that's in every one.

182
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You open that one door and you're like, whoa, you're keeping it all in here, huh?

183
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah.

184
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And so they were like cleaning it all out and then they were looking for a place to store that toilet paper and they thought, the attic, they'll never find that out.

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's fine, but it does raise a troubling question.

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That means that the previous owners of this house looked at 280 rolls of toilet paper and said, we're not going to need this where we're going.

187
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Like what?

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You definitely will need it, I think.

189
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Unless you moved into the sewer where your stuff just kind of goes.

190
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But you didn't.

191
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You probably moved into a house.

192
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, for sure.

193
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
An apartment or something.

194
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There's a risky scenario here in which the previous owners come back and say, hey, we left our 280 rolls of toilet paper and we do need them.

195
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We just completely forgot about them.

196
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I thought that they had grabbed them.

197
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
They thought I had grabbed them and we left them.

198
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And you're like, uh, I don't know what you're talking about.

199
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I think legally when you do the signing at the house, everything that is in the house is, I think this is true, your legal property.

200
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's why you've got to clean out those drawers.

201
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Can you imagine if you just realized you accidentally signed over 280 rolls of toilet paper to someone?

202
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's going to ruin your week.

203
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah, that's bad.

204
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I mean, not for the $137 that it cost you, although I mean, that's a hit, but when you sell or buy a house, it's such a huge financial transaction.

205
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I think 137 bucks at that point is kind of a drop in the bucket.

206
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But I think the sort of emotional turmoil that is involved with acquiring and checking out with 740 pack with this TP fort that you've purchased.

207
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And then getting that in your house and then up into the attic and then to leave all that good hard work up there.

208
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't know, man.

209
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Well, I mean, that's a real situation is maybe they did this and I don't know why they did it.

210
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Maybe they didn't know why they did it, but they got it up there and like, well, we don't need that stuff.

211
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And I certainly don't want to move, you know, 600 pounds of toilet paper again.

212
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So I do have a twist on this, though.

213
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What if obviously you're good to use it?

214
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What if it's a bad brand?

215
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What if it's a brand that you don't use?

216
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
There's some bad brands.

217
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Myself personally, I only fucks with Quilted Northern Ultra Plush, which is my jam.

218
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's in the purple package.

219
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's the only thing I use.

220
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Damn, dude.

221
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
How tender is your ender if you've got to go with something that has been hand stitched?

222
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Griffin, statistically, you spend one third of your life in the bathroom.

223
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And if you're going to do that, shouldn't you treat yourself to the finest?

224
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The finest bathroom experience possible.

225
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I mean, yeah, enjoy the go.

226
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But like, there's a middle grounds between that school toilet paper, which is actually not.

227
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It doesn't exist.

228
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
No, that's just the promise of toilet paper.

229
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And what you're dealing with, which is like, all those adjectives that you said,

230
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
it sounded like you're just describing like a quilt.

231
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Like they have a meemaw, like actually make a quilt, and they cut it up in a TP size,

232
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
and they roll it up, and you buy each roll for like $90.

233
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm pretty sure, Griffin, that was like the Quilted Northern commercial campaign for a while.

234
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It was.

235
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It was like a knitting circle, and they were quilting the toilet paper for you to put on your butt.

236
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And now it's just those nasty fucking bears, where the mom's like,

237
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
get that dookie off your bong.

238
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And it's like, yo, dog, what family is this?

239
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Mom, I don't need that much toilet paper to clean the feces off my bong hole.

240
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Hey, son, don't, don't.

241
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm in the kitchen making ravioli right now.

242
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't want you to come in here and be like, I only needed two sheets to excavate the...

243
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Like, no, dude, stop it.

244
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm not even in your family.

245
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm watching from home.

246
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I don't know what ad wizard, Dr. Strange, thought that I wanted to be a part of this.

247
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Because if I was a member of this family, I'd be like, you're sharing too much about the go.

248
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yeah.

249
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Maybe that's how bears is, though.

250
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm not enjoying the go right now.

251
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Maybe that's how bears is.

252
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What if it's a bad brand?

253
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What if it's a bad brand?

254
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You can't return it.

255
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
No.

256
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You can't sell it.

257
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
No.

258
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But what you've got, Justin, is you've got, you don't have 280 rolls of toilet paper at that point.

259
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You've got 280 rolls of peace of mind.

260
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Because you never have to worry about that moment when, like, you just got home, you barely made it home,

261
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and you really have to, you know, you have to deuce, you have to number Tuesday, and you get to the door,

262
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
you get to the bathroom, and it's like, ah, somebody didn't replace it, and we're out.

263
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But...

264
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The attic.

265
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But...

266
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I've got it.

267
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The attic.

268
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You, I think if you have that peace of mind, Travis, if you have that security, knowing that you've got TP,

269
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I think you're going to be pretty lackadaisical about maintaining your own good.

270
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That is the concern.

271
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Good, good supply.

272
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Mm-hmm.

273
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And I think you're going to chase sort of that self-defeating part of your subconscious that wants to destroy itself,

274
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and you're just going to let yourself get down to the bare bones.

275
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Okay.

276
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You're going to have to have someone you trust hide it from you.

277
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Shit.

278
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And then you can contact them in case of emergency, but then they have to hide it again.

279
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
They need to be, they need to get a pager.

280
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Okay?

281
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah.

282
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You can't risk them being at a self-defense officer.

283
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
There's an atomic battery in it.

284
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah.

285
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Like, you cannot have this pager go down.

286
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You are my number one.

287
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You can't go out of town.

288
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You can't go on vacation.

289
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Okay?

290
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
If you're going to go to your daughter's recital, you better sit in the back row because I could need you at any moment.

291
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Put on this necklace.

292
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
We could universalize this position, and then like the pager goes off and someone's like,

293
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
are you a doctor?

294
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You're like, no, I'm someone's poo father.

295
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And you're like, oh, God.

296
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Of course.

297
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Go, go.

298
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Put on this Greg Alert necklace.

299
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And if it starts a-buzzin', hop in the whip.

300
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
How often would you call and just like, nope, just, and they run over in a huff.

301
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Here it is.

302
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I got it.

303
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Just testing you.

304
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
No, I just need to make sure.

305
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That was a very good response.

306
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Now go hide, go hide that again.

307
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Cause I cannot be bothered.

308
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And I find my friends, dude.

309
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So I know where the cache is now.

310
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So you got to relocate it.

311
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
All of it.

312
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's a constant battle of wits.

313
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's a constant battle of wits.

314
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's a constant battle of wits.

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's a constant battle of wits.

316
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's a constant battle of wits.

317
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's a constant battle of wits.

318
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's a constant battle of wits.

319
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm always gonna be trying to find it.

320
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm gonna follow you home.

321
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm gonna be watching your every move.

322
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,160
I'm gonna get a Google car to follow you around and film your location.

323
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,680
I'm going to find it.

324
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,120
We're locked in this struggle for the rest of our lives, Jerry.

325
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
I don't know why I agreed to this.

326
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
I don't know why I agreed to this.

327
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,940
Hey, did you guys see hey, did you guys see rat race 2 yeah?

328
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,440
The plot was like fucked up like I don't know why Seth Green and Rowan Atkinson like agreed to do this one

329
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,560
Sort of taken it's kind of a departure

330
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,760
Have you guys seen the new Dan Brown Tom Hanks movie?

331
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,140
Like the hunt is great in the top flight, but man alive

332
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,380
One last thing because I know we've been hitting this question really hard

333
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:22,600
But the only other thing I could think for why you would hide this much of a treasure in the attic

334
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,720
I think there's an outside chances. It's a Jumanji situation

335
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,720
All I'm gonna say is be careful

336
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,440
More like poo manji and the show's canceled. Thanks for listening everybody

337
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,360
I didn't know I thought we were gonna make it to 400 like that was at least my dream is

338
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,320
400 we make it there in around 2018 or so, but like I guess this is I guess we've come to the end of the rainbow

339
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,320
Is it time?

340
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,020
To start planning for 420 or is that like?

341
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:58,680
Too much like I don't know how we're gonna do that one. What I mean we are now we're at like 326

342
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,060
326 so it's a couple years out, but it's it that it'll sneak up on you

343
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:09,280
It'll be a little a little less than two years, so it'll be probably it'll be about August 2018

344
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
if that by that point

345
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
We don't have

346
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:20,960
The worldwide legal that worldwide legal legal that legal beagle then like what the fuck is

347
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
What's up? What have we been up to?

348
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,820
I've also been alerted by a few listeners that we have we said in like

349
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,760
That on the first episode we said that on episode

350
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,880
350 Keenan and Kell would be on it and

351
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,000
I do have to say in our defense

352
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,680
Nobody could have guessed that Keenan would still be on SNL there

353
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:47,800
There is no reality in 2010 and not for lack of not for lack of talent like he's the best dude on there obviously

354
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,600
Yeah, he's out of control, but he's also now the longest running cast member. Yeah, well Bobby Moynihan

355
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,740
I think maybe no no no he's the most tenured, and he's also tied for like

356
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,720
Longest run ever with Darrell Hammond damn dog. No way really yeah, yeah

357
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,560
I thought Tim Meadows had a long run Tim Meadows was ten years

358
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:14,080
Keenan's been on there for like 14 now. I think good wow what a really dig in

359
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,140
Yeah, he he found what he was gonna. Do and he was just he just decided to move in

360
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,840
Also, we just need to evangelize as much as we can because I know there's people out there who haven't seen it go watch David

361
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,360
Pumpkins just go watch. It's called. I think it's called haunted elevator. It's a SNL sketch from this past weekend

362
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,260
It's really important to me, and it's gonna be important to you too once you've seen it

363
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:42,120
I I thought that they had really nailed it with the the land episode which was maybe the best I've seen in like five years

364
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:48,860
It's extremely good, but sorry sorry dude. You didn't have David pumpkins, which is didn't have David pumpkins monumental, okay, so here we go

365
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,680
I got a yahoo here, and it's from Paul

366
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,140
Kovasi a

367
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:00,620
Hey, how does that what Justin you drink Kovasi a mm-hmm crevasse crevasse crevasse a cool boss Kovasi a

368
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,060
It's co you are vo I s I er

369
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,580
Kovasi a I think it might be or it's corvus or I don't know anyway

370
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,060
Sunday Sunday Sunday at the civic arena corvus or

371
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:21,700
It's the fourth evolution of bulbous or crystal yahoo answers user crystal asks

372
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:28,740
Have you ever bought burgers at one place and fries at another I?

373
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,740
I prefer I

374
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,220
Think I think there's an outside chance Justin's laughing because the answer yes

375
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,860
I prefer Hardee's burgers, but I don't like their fries

376
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:49,280
So I usually get them at McDonald's people probably think I'm weird walking to McDonald's to buy fries while carrying a Hardee's bag

377
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,620
Hold on I

378
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,520
Wasn't expecting that twist. I thought we were talking drive-thru

379
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:01,100
I mean that doesn't to me if you've gone to

380
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:08,580
More than one fast-food restaurant to put a meal together that food has ceased to be fast

381
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,320
Now it's not you could have cooked that up in the time

382
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,940
It took you to drive to Mickey D's and then to Hardee's or vice versa. Do you know what I like to do?

383
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:25,940
Hmm. I like to get the burger at Wendy's the fries at Burger King because I like them crisper

384
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:32,420
there's something about the Pepsi at Taco Bell talk about and and the apple pies and

385
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:40,420
McDonald's and then the fried chicken at KFC and the tacos at Jack-in-the-box and now you've got like a five-course meal

386
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,220
That's the end. That's that song that McDonald's McDonald's

387
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,220
McDonald's Kentucky Fried Chicken

388
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,940
See that was actually just

389
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:56,100
Instructions for how to put together a bomb-ass meal a bomb-ass ten-course meal

390
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,660
You know the problem with that though realistically speaking is the first

391
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:07,500
Would be inedible cold by the time you finish your run. This basically needs to be a food court

392
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,980
Kind of scenario. I think for it to be in any way appetizing

393
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,580
You could also construct some kind of like foil lines

394
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,100
warming bag

395
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,460
Or maybe like a toaster oven plugged in to the cigarette lighter of your car

396
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:29,680
So you just pop into you pop into Hardee's and you're like just throw it in in my box

397
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:35,380
Drop it right in there. It says my good food box from all over is the label on this box

398
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:41,220
Just toss it in here cuz I've got other stops to make and you know why Hardee's it's cuz your fries are fucking trash

399
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,380
if

400
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,980
They sold, you know the pizza delivery guys have those

401
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,860
They should sell those really because I'm not gonna eat this whole pizza all at once

402
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:56,460
I would how will how luxurious would that be right if every time you popped it out?

403
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,460
It was like delivery fresh. That would be amazing. Well, I mean the bag's not magic

404
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,020
I don't believe it's plugged in

405
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:12,500
It's it can't be plugged in I believe it's charged up with enough pizza heating energy to get through a tough night of slinging

406
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Zah, yeah, and then and then you you just use that to keep the pizzas warm, right? Well, then they're they're worried about the proprietary

407
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,500
Technology getting out because they don't want you to realize that really the delivery boy is just sitting in their car

408
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:31,220
With like a stack of these and then they just call them and they're like hey go there now

409
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,500
They're not make they just make a big stack am Travis how dark on of man. We are on some

410
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:42,820
That's another damn brown mystery solved. I'm just trying to get the word out. I think I have an idea

411
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,620
uh-huh for an eatery for a

412
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,180
delicatessen

413
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:54,460
And it's not I don't know if it's an especially novel idea because I'm actually convinced that this is actually how Jack in the box

414
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,960
Got its start because you go to Jack in the box. They're like, what do you need tacos chicken?

415
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,760
pita a salad burger fries onion rings and some soup and

416
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,620
Tacos, I mentioned that. All right, but we got him

417
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:15,100
1250 I think that maybe Jack in the box like they originally just burger and fries and people started bringing their Taco Bell tacos into

418
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,420
the spot and then rolling out and it's like well, I'm missing out a lot of

419
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,100
Food dollars, so they just rolled with it Jack in the box

420
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:27,340
It's like a drunk McDonald's because McDonald's was like, let's try bratwurst. No, no, no, no, let's do pizza for a bit

421
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:32,780
Oh, this is stupid Jack in the box. It's like I think we're gonna have tacos now and like yeah forever actually

422
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,580
It's not a limited time

423
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,100
Anyway, my you can also just get like a tray of like frozen shrimp if you want, but fuck it

424
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,580
Who cares my idea is a very open source?

425
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,220
Freeware Linux based

426
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,360
Fast-food restaurant where I'll go to Wendy's in the morning and I'll get a bunch of all the shit

427
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,980
I'll get Frosty's from Wendy's and some of their chicken sandwiches like those spicy chicken sandwiches and their chili bring that on home

428
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,800
McDonald's, what's up? Give me y'all the fries that you got on your shelf. Just let me introduce myself

429
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,960
I'm gonna make you go fucking bank drop with my better fast

430
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,120
Just go all over talk about get the chicken fresco tacos cuz they're really low-cal and that's an option

431
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,320
I need sometimes and then I don't know

432
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,720
10% markup

433
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,580
Sell all that shit at my own spot and it's just we got all the good eats that you crave here

434
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,820
Everything how many I would do that for a 10% markup. That is nothing

435
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,100
I would roll up and be like ooh chicken fresco tacos

436
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:33,360
We get that that and some McDonald's fries and a frosty with some chili. Oh fuck. Yeah. Hello

437
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,700
But then they don't stock the fries you want like they don't have this special

438
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:44,980
Yeah, you don't have rallies fries don't fucking poke holes in my Joseph's amazing Technicolor dream

439
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,260
Code of a restaurant. Of course, you've got those rally fries

440
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:53,860
What do you guys favorite fast-food fries go Travis go Burger King. They're crispier Griffin go McDonald's

441
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,180
It's like eating the ends of a mop that somebody cut off and just covered in oil and salt

442
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:05,340
Only fresh though old McDonald's fries the absolute pits. My answer is rallies. They're the best or checkers

443
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,980
I believe in the

444
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:13,940
Well, we can't okay. Hold on. We can't include season curlies. This is a completely different check world checkers rallies

445
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:18,980
Don't have because if that's the conversation who's that poking their head in the door who goes it's me Arby's don't mind me

446
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:25,660
Get him out of here. Hey rallies doesn't have a season curlies. They're seasoned. They're not curly listen folks at home

447
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:30,540
I know there's gonna be a temptation for you to tweet your favorite french fries as please don't do that

448
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,540
I could not get less of a shit, but

449
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:39,700
Please do tweet them at Ashton Kutcher and and tag put a hashtag with bim-bam on there so we could see it all

450
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,620
But just don't directly tweet your favorite french fries at us. I don't contextualize it at all

451
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:52,860
Good french fries you had one time a plus K. Is this Twitter handle? That's a little word out and he I

452
00:28:53,660 --> 00:29:01,300
Imagine you go into Griffin's place, and we will have toys for the kids just loose toys laying around don't steal those kids

453
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,300
I'll say cuz I'll be outside of every door

454
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,340
just like did you put the toy back and

455
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:11,060
Then you go up, and there's a machine like they have at the airports and candy stores with the jelly bellies

456
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:16,100
Where is you just pull a handle and you get your favorite jelly belly except? It's like rally fries Arby fries

457
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,300
What the fuck ever?

458
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,540
Do it your way. It should just be a bag with a scale at the end of the line

459
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,700
Candy like a candy store just chuck as much slop in there as you want

460
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:34,500
You will need to hire somebody to stand by the scale to look at you with a face that says I'm not judging you

461
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:41,420
Don't worry about it. Go to town. Oh, you should call it last meal. No cuz it's good. It's a good idea

462
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:46,580
This isn't a joke idea. This isn't a joke idea about bad food. This is good

463
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,460
What you're describing Griffin is

464
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:57,860
Releasing all ties of self-control that you have by saying I need to pick one fast-food place and just go there and then go home

465
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,380
providing this kind of option

466
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:06,500
It could undo many people wrong myself, maybe but it's time

467
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,000
I'm talking about stripping away the fucking

468
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:16,680
DRM that McDonald's puts on its fries where you have to go to McDonald's get to get McDonald's fries

469
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,820
There should just be an open source

470
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:27,180
Solution for your real disruptor Griffin. You're also gonna save gasoline. How about that save gasoline? Oh boy

471
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:32,300
I'm global warming now. It's now we got global cooling. What the fuck happened Griffin's place. Did it?

472
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,780
Have you been they have great toys and all the fries?

473
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,980
Griffin's price sounds like a rehab. I love you, but I don't think

474
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,540
You should probably call it. They said that about they said that about McDonald's probably when it started

475
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,860
It it also sounds like a dance club for teens

476
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,220
Maybe we don't go to McDonald's and buy their stuff

477
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:57,140
Maybe I just have all the recipes and I'm in the back custom cooking them up, you know, cooking them up to order

478
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:02,060
Oh that you're probably gonna have to do a food truck Griffin because I don't think you'll have to be floating at this point

479
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:08,380
Because if you stay in one place, you're going to be arrested and probably sued for cooking other people's food

480
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,780
You'll have to be on the run constantly

481
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,940
Yeah, damn. Yeah, that's true. Still. It's worth it if I can save if I can disrupt the planet

482
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,880
I'm gonna do the damn thing come to my restaurant. It's really good

483
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:27,420
Listen, if we're ever gonna afford this then we're gonna need a cash infusion

484
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,940
And the only way I can think to do that is to head over to the money tone

485
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,500
Hey, can I tell you about Squarespace, please do sure would

486
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:53,220
Well, you see Squarespace makes website building easy for those of us who don't know two shits about website design

487
00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:00,940
Okay, should I do it do you think no I'm gonna stick with this I like this see I'm a real dummy

488
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,940
I don't know anything. All right, and maybe you're like me. Maybe you don't know anything about website design

489
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,580
Well, I made a website through Squarespace called macro shows calm and it turned out real

490
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:15,460
Well, people compliment me on it from time to time and I just look at them and I have like a glint in my eye

491
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,140
And they're like, why are you looking me like that?

492
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,940
And what they don't know is that I don't know what I'm doing

493
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:26,140
But I still made a great website and that could be used smugly smiling at your friends when they compliment something that you spent 45

494
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,140

Hey, can I talk about Casper though? Yeah, please. Yes, cuz I just got a Casper mattress. Yeah

500
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,540
I haven't been on it though. Oh

501
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:02,820
We got it for the we got a trundle bed out in the nursery and the in-laws were in town this past weekend

502
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,940
And they got to utilize it, but not me. No

503
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,900
I'll get on it someday though. It looked really inviting and comfortable. Oh, I'm sorry

504
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:17,060
We're sponsored in part this week by Casper which is an online retailer of premium obsessively engineered mattresses for a fraction of the price

505
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,260
I did I did lay down on it. It's comfy. I just didn't get my Z's on

506
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,380
But what I will say is getting it in that

507
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:29,300
Surprisingly little box and then deploying it. I felt like some sort of techno man

508
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:35,840
I felt like I felt like dr. Strange and his friend Jeremy just like making this small thing become very big and comfortable that

509
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:42,280
Is my favorite scene by the way in the movie when they're just like setting up their apartment and there it's like

510
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,860
I want to say 35 40 minutes of them just like

511
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:51,480
Unpacking IKEA furniture. I think they do Casper mattresses and they're like putting stuff together

512
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,020
They order pizza at one point they take a break to watch an episode of Bob's Burgers in real time

513
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:02,340
They have a pizza really good. They have a pizza fight at each other. It's really really fun

514
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,900
Anyway, Casper, they've got a risk-free trial and return policy

That's going to be mostly focused on

524
00:34:52,940 --> 00:35:01,220
Casper mattresses, it's gonna be really comfortable. It's gonna be very chill. It's gonna be very ASMR. It's gonna be slightly spooky. I imagine

525
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:09,100
So stay tuned for more details on our our spooktacular Casper episode special

526
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,300
But do you start cooking up your best?

527
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,820
like sleepy time questions or it's gonna be a very

528
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,740
It's a very confusing episode thematically, but

529
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:30,660
It's gonna be it's gonna be a hit have you guys heard the news? Oh

530
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,740
yeah about the

531
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,700
About that baseball show baseball show

532
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:42,060
It's a comedy podcast that uses baseball as a jumping-off point to discuss sports culture pop culture

533
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:50,300
Zeitgeist and stories about baseball that don't require an advanced understanding of stats or saber metrics far from being a quote hot take or news

534
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:55,180
Analysis show the tone is casual and from the viewpoint of two lifelong fans and comedians

535
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:59,460
You can download our weekly episode on iTunes stitcher or wherever fine podcasts are found

536
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,920
This is it's called that baseball show and as you can tell from there

537
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,200
The one promise they make is they'll never talk about baseball. It's pretty much everything

538
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,520
No, I think they do actually talk a lot about baseball

539
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,280
You think there'll be also some baseball and what an exciting time to baseball because there's two teams in it

540
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:23,000
For the big one and nobody thought they would and but they did it. They did baseball a lot better than everybody else

541
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,720
And then I guess everybody voted on

542
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,960
Who they thought did the best job and then based on that they got the the pennant

543
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:37,840
And then they move on to the big one. So congratulations to those teams and to all their fans

544
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,840
This must be really exciting for you that your bad baseball teams did finally get it finally pulled it out

545
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,560
It's like crazy. Like I heard the news of the two teams that made it. I was like, those are both bad baseball

546
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,240
Baseball teams. That's weird. How did they so did he add? That's a good point Justin

547
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,560
Did everybody else just get worse than these two bad baseball team is baseball?

548
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,220
I think it might have just been their rotation like it just came up in the books and everybody's went

549
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,240
Okay, and they had to turn to him

550
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
Yeah, cuz I know there's a lot I don't really follow baseball

551
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,240
But I know there's a long time there were like

552
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,920
The Yankees like everybody was pretty bad except the Yankees were like they did

553
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:18,040
Okay, and so they won all the baseball for like a hundred years or something crazy. Yep, but these two teams are like

554
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,880
Not good, but they're doing it and not getting it done. They won the vote. So isn't that just America?

555
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,720
You know what? I mean? Everyone gets an America it more this and more on that baseball show finding iTunes

556
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,760
They're wherever fine podcasts are sold. I have another message. I'm gonna read cuz why not it's for Nat

557
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,200
But never Nate and it's from Laura and Monica very mysterious. Hi, not Nate

558
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,560
Do you ever wonder why everyone else sucks? Does the lateness of the oncoming asteroid keep you up at night?

559
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:52,120
What about your loud deaf cat? Are we just naming things you hate like mushrooms bacon mayonnaise and ranch dressing?

560
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,560
Yes, we are and we have no solutions for any of your problems

561
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:01,760
But I bet you forgot your cancer came back and that's from Lauren moniker. Okay. I mean, it's an approach

562
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
It's definitely one is good

563
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,880
Certainly if you want to try to keep somebody's mind off something just focusing on the things they hate

564
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:15,200
That's like it's like what patch Adams did but the opposite of it the opposite of what he did

565
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,960
We have to assume considering that we now know this is their strategy that he hates our show, right?

566
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,440
I mean like that's the assumption and the good news is there there's like 325 episodes

567
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,360
Just 325 hours of you. It's just hateable material

568
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:36,080
So in in serious though net and that not Nate shit. Why would you even put that in there?

569
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Why would you do that in there except to trip us up?

570
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,520
You know how Justin is why would you do this to him?

571
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,680

Dunna pop up a dump pop pop pop a dump. What's come on down on the cruise? It's crews

577
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,960
We're taken together. Holy shit. Who's the captain of this ship? It's Jackie Chan. Here's a story

578
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,480
I forgot about Jackie Chan stories

579
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:29,120
We've had we've been on sort of a dry spell of Jackie Chan stories. So here's a random Jackie Chan story

580
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,600
Jackie Chan buys the segue every movies on at some point

581
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:42,960
He gives away the segue to a crew member a friend who does craft services was lugging a bunch of ice up a hill and Jackie

582
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,040
Was rolling by on his segue noticed

583
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:51,640
He was struggling and since his segue had saddlebags gave him the segue and said you need this more than I do

584
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,760
Then walk the rest of the way up the hill to set now the craft service friend uses the segue to deliver people

585
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,640
Trays of food on sets and that's from Taylor. Holy shit. That's the best

586
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:10,200
Best it's the best. Is it the truth and the answer according to a cursory Google search is yes

587
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,840
Absolutely, it's the truth. Of course. It's the truth

588
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:18,560
I I just love the idea that Jackie Chan buys the segue and then waits to see someone in need

589
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,520
Before deciding who to give it to it's not like oh you did a great job in the movie have a segue

590
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,880
But it's just looking to see someone struggling with something and he's like them. This is it

591
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:36,600
they need this more than I do Jackie chance not only a fan and and frequent purchaser of subways this dude owns a

592
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:43,120
Segway dealership in Hong Kong. I was in Hong Kong last year. Why didn't I swing on by let me get one of those?

593
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,640
Jackie Chan segues

594
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,920
These one thing he's working there. These ones never fall over but when they do fall over

595
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,000
It's like really charming and they put it at the end of the movie

596
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,840
God I would kill for a Jackie Chan Segway. I wouldn't know man

597
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:06,320
I would kill for a Jackie Chan Segway movie. Yeah, they're movie featuring Jackie Chan on Segway

598
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,720
And it would be like fast and furious, but it'd be like kind of slow and Jackie Chan

599
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,460
Fuck Paul Blart mall cop three. Oh my god

600
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,480
Right, he goes to Hong Kong to do some like

601
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,880
International mall copping and who's there why it's the head of the Hong Kong mall cops Jackie Chan

602
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,600
Paul Blart mall cop three Jackie Chan's in this one. Is this okay? I gotta I gotta save this for death part

603
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,800
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, hold on to it. Yeah

604
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,000
Are we going into another fucking segment?

605
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,320
No, no, no, I'm gonna read a question. No, this is just the outro music Jackie Chan

606
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,440
None of our vids have outro music. I

607
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,320
Share my dorm at college with another girl who has recently been

608
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:13,680
Once again, you've done this thing again where some innocent person is gonna hear the first sentence of their question

609
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,680
It's like oh they're doing my oh

610
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,320
Hey guys, yeah, the news of fucking 90s are back

611
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:28,860
The 90s are back every this is a trend I've noticed with fast food press releases

612
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,860
Which is what we read here on much squad

613
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:37,920
They are written as though the person has just been unfrozen or uncombed after a very long break from society

614
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,080
And is just now catching up. This is literally how this starts

615
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,880
Uh

616
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,680
October 4th is national taco day and Wendy's is celebrating by giving fans a taste of nostalgia

617
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,840
With the return of its beloved taco salad. That's right in an era of covers comebacks remakes and reboots

618
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,880
The 1990s classic is

619
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,320
Spiritual successor to salads with taco shit in it sort of a remaster

620
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,880
criterion collection of

621
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:14,600
Salad with meat goo all up on it. It's just the thing about the taco salad is like let's before we I want to

622
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,760
Contextualize this before we get to the choice quote

623
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:23,320
The kid this is a salad that is made by dumping tortilla chips on a plate and then they dump

624
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:28,920
they take the chili that is already made from their burger leave ins and

625
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,600
Cut into chili and then they dump that chili on there and then put some shame lettuce on and this is what 90s kids

626
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,480
Are just gaga about this is what this is the crazy taste. They just can't replicate

627
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,680
Toad the wet sprocket and fucking gooey meaty salads from Wendy's my favorite

628
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:53,280
But this is just me. This is just me bloating about it. Let's get it from an expert an expert like

629
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,360
No shit, Carl Laredo

630
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,000
vice president of Wendy's brand marketing

631
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,360
and cattle rustler and and main antagonist in a fast-food based fiction novel

632
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,560
I've never long Meyer, but I'm sure he's on it. Carl Laredo says

633
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:20,320
Wendy's taco salad is an all-time classic and over the years fans of the original have asked if we're ever bringing it out of retirement

634
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:28,960
We love how nostalgic and passionate our loyal taco salad fans are and we look forward to introducing it to a new

635
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,800
generation of fans with the same build

636
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,720
quality and grill

637
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:40,760
Excuse me. I've got to go capture those McMillan boys. Damn. Damn, Carl. That is it

638
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,720
I know I'm salivating as soon as you said build

639
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:52,440
Crap, look at that build of that salad with all its points and jutting edges with the same sloppy architecture

640
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:59,040
It's a built using all the ingredients that made it so popular when it first hit the menu. Oh god. Thank god

641
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:05,440
I thought lettuce and chips would be in short supply the ingredients for a taco salad are taco and

642
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,040
salad

643
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,640
The taco salad starts with a bed of fresh hand-chopped iceberg and well

644
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,000
hold on and is then topped with Wendy's signature chili hand diced tomatoes and

645
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:22,120
Shredded cheddar cheese and it really says this next part beyond that anything on the salad is your call. Oh, yeah

646
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,120
freedom

647
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,880
Salsa

648
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,320
And anything it lets you concoct your own unique flavorful taco salad creation. I

649
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,960
Guess my worry

650
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,640
My worry is that there's too many options and I'd be crippled by choice

651
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:47,220
I would just be frozen in place by the unknowing of it all do you think that would do you think that would go to

652
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,440
McDonald's and get

653
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,860
Like their chili and put it on there and then go to Jack-in-the-box and get like a chicken pita sandwich

654
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,760
To just have on the sizies because I want it my way damn it

655
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:05,620
I bet there's nobody the workers at the Wendy's drive-thru love more than the guy that wants to lovingly personalize his

656
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,620
Talk

657
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,920
There I'll have a taco salad, okay, that'll be five nine nine just pour hold up Bob whoa

658
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:17,660
Don't start making that bad boy yet. I gotta lay hands on it

659
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,820
Can I just meet can I just meet you at the window? I want to see ya

660
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,560
I want to see it happen just can you just lay out a tray?

661
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,980
Can you haul the tray out here to my car and let me just sort of go fuck wild?

662
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:36,300
I've been thinking about this bad boy for the last three days. I think I've got the numbers figured out

663
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:43,260
I'm ready to form to build my masterpiece. Hey dump a frosty on it sir. We can't we can't

664
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,980
I'll go to we'll go to jail for that

665
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:48,340
But then they just then they just turn and Carl Laredo's sitting at the table

666
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:55,000
And he just nods at them and they're like okay frosty it is don't put up and off big old sprite into it listen

667
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,700
I've got a kid. I can't do shit like this anymore

668
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,060
I

669
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,820
It's irresponsible

670
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:05,220
Can I read this yahoo? I want to read the question that I read cuz I otherwise will forget

671
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,060
I just want to read it, and we'll solve it real quick, and then yahoo promise, okay

672
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,980
I share my dorm at college with another girl who's recently been using my menstrual pads

673
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:17,020
I paid 20 bucks for them, so I am each what?

674
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:23,860
I would have no way of knowing I paid 20 bucks for them because I only buy tampons

675
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:28,740
So I feel like I should ask her to buy her own at least before she uses a ball of mine

676
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,020
But I'm also a shitty roommate

677
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:36,540
Should I let her have the pads as an apology for being messy and staying up too late or put my foot down

678
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:43,520
I also pay for our toilet paper paper towels and tissues by the way, and that's from miffed in Montreal

679
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:49,060
We're out of our dad eyes. I literally have no I you I would believe any price that you told me

680
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:53,860
20 bucks, I don't know what the I don't know what per unit what we're talking about here

681
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,860
It's that's beside the point though. I suppose

682
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:02,180
We could see how many roll we could use some quick math and see how many rolls of toilet paper that translates do sure

683
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:07,220
Just to give us some basis, but it's hard to say it's hard to say so I think like I think

684
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:12,700
Here's the thing if you have an economy of justification in your mind, which is to say

685
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,620
Let her have the pads as an apology for being messy and staying up too late

686
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:22,160
Then it sounds like you have a way of justifying it for yourself, and if it doesn't upset you too bad

687
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:29,660
Then you're I guess you're good. I don't minstrel pads seems like a thing that I wouldn't

688
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,620
want to

689
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,320
Use consistently from somebody else

690
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:38,940
Is that a weird is that a weird thing to say like it the the only thing I can

691
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,420
There is no I cannot equate it to anything

692
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:48,260
Over I'm on my side of the business, but like I don't know I don't think a hygiene product like that

693
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:54,980
I would want to just yoink from a roommate on a like a regular basis because that's like that's an obvious infraction

694
00:48:55,620 --> 00:49:01,260
Well because that the problem is especially an mmm dancing around my limits of knowledge

695
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:08,820
Something that you need only during a specific time you would totally forget to replace assuming you had some leftover

696
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,640
Yeah

697
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,440
But then they're not there because Rumi took them when you have he's so mad when you have your minstrel

698
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:23,800
like you need to know that you've got your supply and if it's all gone and it's time and it's it's time for the

699
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,280
minstrel then like that's

700
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,440
That's just gonna be a really uncomfortable situation

701
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,280
Yeah, I think I think that you've got what city you bring it up

702
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:38,040
You have a friend hide with them. I think you've got or you can hide them yourself is not a bad plan and

703
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,200
Then they can do it. They'll just buy their own damn stuff. I

704
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:47,320
Get I I'm so out of my depth on any even ones not involving minstrel pads

705
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,760
Like I'm so out of my depth on roommate civility questions now

706
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,840
And I think it's why we don't do as many is cuz like I didn't like dealing with that stuff when I was

707
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:59,360
One of those and now I'm I haven't gotten better at it. I don't think

708
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:03,880
Did you chart in these waters? Yeah, I never had a roommate, so I don't I'm

709
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,560
It's hard to say

710
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,400
How about this Yahoo? Yeah, it's sent in by Molly Bruce. Thank you Molly. See how who answers user

711
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,920
Oh, come on. It's trying to load Kevin has zero percent best answers. Oh

712
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:23,000
Yeah, he's only got one answer actually let's hop in at Kevin's activity and just see what he's been up to

713
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,480
It's about

714
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:33,400
Reprogramming a Mercedes keychip to a different Mercedes. Maybe he's a high-priced car thief. Anyway, Kevin asks

715
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,800
Marilyn Monroe poses with two handguns in her hands crossed over each other

716
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:46,120
I want to put it on a shirt for a friend. Where can I get the image so I can enlarge it?

717
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,440
Trying to get a picture on a shirt and it's Marilyn Monroe

718
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:58,600
Starving and she's got two fucking handguns and she's got her hands crossed over her chest and she's got these two guns in her hands

719
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:03,240
And it's Marilyn Monroe from seven-year itch, but she's got two big cool guns

720
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:08,800
So I want to get this on a shirt and I think Kevin obviously wants to handle it legally

721
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:16,320
So like what are the steps? I think obviously first step is just go the Monroe estate and sort of pitch your design to them

722
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,320
And see what they think

723
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:24,520
Oh, okay. Just to clarify currently this image does not exist anywhere, but Kevin's head

724
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:32,160
Yes, I get I did a quick Google image search and I'm here to tell you boys if you want to picture Marilyn Monroe

725
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:39,280
With two guns you're in luck because there are I would describe it as a lot of them

726
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,640
Available

727
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,960
I'm googled now. No, I'm the googled one

728
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,800
And there's a hundred thousand pictures of Marilyn Monroe with guns

729
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,800
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE INTERNET?

730
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,800
FUCK ME

731
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,800
WE NEED ANOTHER INTERNET

732
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,800
WE NEED A DIFFERENT INTERNET

733
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,800
WE ALL NEED TO GET ON FUCKING LIKOS OR JAVA OR SOME SHIT

734
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,800
AND GET ON A SALE BOAT

735
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,600
WE NEED TO FIND A CHUNK OF INTERNET ICE THAT WE CAN BREAK OFF WITH ALL OF US ON IT

736
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:15,600
CAUSE THIS ONE'S FUCKING DONE WITH

737
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,600
Why are there so many?

738
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,600
She does look really cool though

739
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,600
She looks so cool

740
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,600
But why are there so many is the question

741
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:31,600
Why is there two hundred thousand million billion results of actress star of stage and screen Marilyn Monroe with two guns?

742
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,600
Why does this happen?

743
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,600
Why are there so many pot leaves on them?

744
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,600
Well I know why, I mean you get one

745
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,600
It's just

746
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,600
There's Marilyn Monroe holding guns

747
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,600
Marilyn Monroe bandit

748
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,600
Marilyn Monroe holding money

749
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,600
Is there money and guns? Let's see

750
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,600
Yes?

751
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,600
I just found a picture of her holding three ice cream cones and it's real

752
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,600
So I don't know if that balances it out at all

753
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,600
Quick google Marilyn Monroe holding puppies

754
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,600
Okay

755
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,600
Marilyn Monroe holding two blank

756
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,600
Marilyn Monroe weed and puppies

757
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,600
My god there's a lot of pictures of Marilyn Monroe holding puppies

758

I'm just gonna put Marilyn Monroe holding two weeds and see what comes up

762
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,600
I'm sorry for this question

763
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,600
Hold on

I apologize for this question everybody

766
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,600
I thought this was gonna be a fun one

767
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,600
Can you imagine her holding

768
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,600
Yeah you don't need to imagine

769
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,600
There's some sort of community somewhere that has imagined it

770
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,600
Realized it

771
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,600
Gone to the Monroe estate

772
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,600
And I guess her granddaughter is like yeah that's fucking choice

773
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,600
Do that shit

774
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,600
Crush it dude

775
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,600
Put it on a jacket and ship me one

776
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,600
I miss my grandma

777
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,600
Yeah she loved guns

778
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,600
When I started looking at it and I thought I only saw one gun

779
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,600
I was like nah and then I saw the second gun

780
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,600
And I was like yeah and then I saw the weed

781
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,600
And I was like did they come in medium?

782
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,600
Cause that's my size for them

783
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,600
Here's one

784
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,600
Here's one I found

785
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,600
No guns or weed in this one unfortunately

786
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,600
But it is the actress Star Stages Cream Marilyn Monroe

787
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,600
And a skeleton is giving her a tattoo

788
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,600
And it says diamonds are forever on it

789
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,600
I'm actually

790
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,600
I'm really bummed out that I can't find

791
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,600
An image of Marilyn Monroe

792
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,600
Wearing a Bart Simpson t-shirt that says

793
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,600
Don't have a cow man

794
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,600
It's all I want now in the world and it doesn't exist

795
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,600
So someone could photoshop that

796
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,600
And I'm not talking about

797
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,600
I don't want like a shitty copy and pasted

798
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,600
I want it to really look like she's wearing a Bart Simpson t-shirt

799
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,600
That says don't have a cow man

800
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,600
Please

801
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,600
One bright thing I can tell you guys

802
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,600
Is that my quick google image search

803
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,600
For Marilyn Monroe fucking son of the hedgehog

804
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,600
Has yielded no joy

805
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,600
So we've still got

806
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,600
That corner of the internet is still

807
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,600
Okay

808
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,600
That one's safe

809
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,600
How about Marilyn Monroe wearing a fanny pack

810
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,600
Now why would that

811
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,600
Be part of the thing

812
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,600
Why would that be

813
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,600
I think we should wrap the episode up

814
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,600
Because this is gonna be my whole day now

815
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,600
Just Marilyn Monroe holding so many different things

816
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,600
So many illegal things

817
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,600
Maybe this is a powerful image that we don't

818
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,600
Know about like and we're

819
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,600
I hope we're not being disrespectful

820
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,600
I don't know if there's a community for who Marilyn Monroe

821
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,600
Holding two guns and also weed

822
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,600
Is like a powerful image that's important

823
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,600
To them

824
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,600
If someone can explain to me the image

825
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,600
Of Marilyn Monroe

826
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,600
Getting a shoulder tattoo from a skeleton

827
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,600
And the words diamonds are forever

828
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,600
And there's a big diamond

829
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,600
Over the skeleton

830
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,600
Why is the skeleton tattooing

831
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,600
Marilyn Monroe

832
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,600
And why does it say diamonds are forever

833
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,600
On the thing

834
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,600
One other thing to note is that there are no pictures

835
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,600
On the entire internet of Marilyn Monroe holding three

836
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,600
Guns so I guess

837
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,600
At some point taste does kick in

838
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,600
That's not done

839
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,600
You know what's strange though is I just googled

840
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,600
Marilyn Monroe and there's

841
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,600
No pictures of her not holding guns

842
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,600
Or weed or being tattooed by a bony

843
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,600
Skeleton man

844
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,600
Do you think this is oh this is probably one of those fun

845
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,600
Google Halloween filters

846
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,600
Where he dresses up all the images in a costume

847
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,600
And this costume is like

848
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,600
Some sort of weird ICP wet

849
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,600
Dream

850
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,600
Well folks we hope

851
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,600
You've enjoyed my brother my brother

852
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,600
Is there a picture of a gun holding Marilyn Monroe

853
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,600
Two guns

854
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,600
One gun holding two Marilyn Monroe

855
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,600
I can't I can't do this

856
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,600
Show anymore it's really

857
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,600
I miss my cool grandma so

858
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,600
Much she would fucking toke it with me

859
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,600
And we'd go shoot at the house

860
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,600
We would just shoot at the side of the house with my

861
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,600
High fucking cool ass seven year

862
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,600
Age grandma are you saying the only

Are ones

865
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,600
Where Marilyn Monroe is holding two guns

866
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,600
Or smoking weed

867
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,600
Well that was it it was in her will

868
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,600
That's what it said in her will

869
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,600
Google in quotes some like it

870
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,600
Pot oh no she did

871
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,600
She did party

872
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,600
Okay so let's wrap it up huh

873
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,600

Did a special documentary

912
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,600
About Hamilton and

913
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,600
I believe it's called Hamilton's America

914
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,600
Theresa and I watched it

915
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,600

916
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,600
And you can watch it in its entirety

917
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,600
Right now on PBS

918
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,600

919
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,600
America PBS you

920
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,600

921
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,600

922
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,600
Am Hamdoc if

923
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,600

925
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,600

Or

931
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,600
If your ham gets broken and fucked up

932
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,600
He should be able to fix it up for you

933
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,600
He will fix your ham

934
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,600

Filmmaking

947
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,600

950
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,600
My favorite

957
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,600
Jordan

958
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,600
