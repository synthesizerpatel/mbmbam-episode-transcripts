1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,920
Hello, everybody, and welcome ashore. My name is Justin McElroy. I'm my brother,

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,240
my brother, me, this one. Ahoy there. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,560
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30-30, luminary girlfriend McElroy.

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,000
Lanto. Lanto. Our smoothest, like, name-saying, I think, to date.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,520
Yeah. Yeah. I'm back on shore. On land, I guess. I don't know how to think of it anymore.

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,440
I used to think of myself as at sea, but then I think of this as at land now. You know?

11
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,280
You've surfed, and now you're turfing. I'm both surf and turf simultaneously.

12
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,200
At the same time? Yeah, I'm a delicious, pricey dish.

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,840
So how's our opener going so far? Not good, I think.

14
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,720
No, but listen. Oh, God, it's happening again. Not a joke.

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,640
Okay, so yeah, walk us through what's happening right now in your, I guess, inner ear zone.

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:47,680
I've been on the JoCo cruise for the past week. Just got back last night. Now, it was a fun

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:55,280
conflation of things. First off, there's a three-hour time difference. We had a two-hour

18
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,920
time difference, so it was like two hours before Eastern Standard Time for most of the cruise.

19
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,520
And then right the last day, we got back to San Diego, and it was PST, so it was three hours

20
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:17,120
difference. And then we flew back from PST and lost three hours that way. And then that night,

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,560
it was daylight savings time. Got up another hour.

22
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,440
For Justin, it's Thursday. So now I'm beyond the construct of time. I'm in all times.

23
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,400
Beyond time and stationary land, what that feels like under your knees.

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,560
You're Matthew McConaughey in whatever that Alien movie was that I've already forgotten the title.

25
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:44,080
Whoa, shit. It's also not a joke that after you've been on a big cruise ship for a week

26
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:53,200
and then you come home, your house feels like it's moving sometimes. That's especially noticeable.

27
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,480
It's important to stay moving around because it becomes much more noticeable when you,

28
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,360
let's say, sit stationary and stare at a screen and a microphone for an hour.

29
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
Justin, is this something we are going to be getting,

30
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,760
let's say, recurring updates on throughout the course of recording this episode?

31
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,560
I don't feel like they'll be especially funny, so I'll try to keep them to a minimum.

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,200
But if I stop mid-sentence, it's because my computer is falling through my desk

33
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,800
and the wall is turning upside down.

34
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,600
This is not fun, though. I want to hear about this sort of new oceanic mastery

35
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,600
that you have fucking now that you went down Periscope for a while and you got out there

36
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,560
on that big blue beautiful boy that we call the ocean. And what you learned out there,

37
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,520
just sort of some nautical secrets and just some lessons that you learned from your new wife,

38
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,480
the ocean.

39
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,800
I will tell you this one nautical secret.

40
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,600
Myself and Max Temkin of Cards Against Humanity learned this this week.

41
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,680
If you start asking about the brig a lot, you are going to start getting some huffiness.

42
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,280
We just want to see where the brig was because there's a brig for sure, right?

43
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,960
There's got to be a brig. There's a boat jail, and I just want to see the boat jail once.

44
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,920
Oh, yeah.

45
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,360
How many Jimmy Buffett songs are there about boat jail?

46
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,400
There's no boat jail songs, which is amazing.

47
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,760
Boat jail. Boys in the band go to boat jail. All of my boys did some sea crime.

48
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,840
Now they're in lockup.

49
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,440
There's that one. Justin, you with us?

50
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,240
There's that one.

51
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,800
I'm here. I had another one. I had a good boy. Good, twisty boy.

52
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,880
J Man, did you get to steer at all?

53
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,320
They sell captain's hat. They sell captain's hats in the gift shop.

54
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,640
All right.

55
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,760
I have to talk about the gift shop.

56
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Listen, I'm going to talk about the gift shop.

57
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,360
For one, this gift shop sold a lot of watches and crystals, and there were signs-

58
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,480
Crystals, huh?

59
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,960
Because all us nerds were on the cruise, there were signs like,

60
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,120
be like the doctor and control space and time and buy one of these watches.

61
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,320
And it almost worked. That's not how it works.

62
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,360
If I buy a stethoscope and a thermometer, I'm not controlling medicine.

63
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,160
You're right.

64
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,880
And then they started showing Dr. Who in the gift shop, which is pretty good.

65
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,880
That's good stuff.

66
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,840
I'll kick it in there.

67
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,080
We've got to go back in time. Let me touch my magic watch.

68
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,920
It's 1884. Thanks, magic watch.

69
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,480
You're welcome, Dr. Beepo Beepo.

70
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,080
This is my magic watch, Beepo.

71
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,480
Another thing I have to mention about the gift shop is that it was showing Dr. Who 24 hours a day,

72
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,320
and there were people who worked there that were just like, I guess, just on a bench, man.

73
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,240
Just like trucking their way through the tenant years.

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,880
I had, obviously, I had diarrhea.

75
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,400
All right.

76
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,240
I obviously had diarrhea.

77
00:05:52,240 --> 00:06:02,080
At one point, the old, had the old hemorrhoids, pretty bad, started flaring up pretty bad.

78
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,480
All right.

79
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,560
And I kicked it on down to the gift shop.

80
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,080
This gift shop will sell you a tray of delicious imported

81
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,360
rum flavored chocolate turtles with sea salt on them for $10 in a box.

82
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,200
Okay. And for the world's smallest tube of preparation age, it costs $17.95.

83
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,040
All right, J-Dot, but you got to understand.

84
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,080
They know their market.

85
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,800
Yeah, they literally, they have you over an ocean sized barrel.

86
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,920
What are you going to do?

87
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,040
Get fucking medevaced for your butthole?

88
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,000
That barrel is comically labeled diarrhea, like in an old political cartoon.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,640
Yeah.

90
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,880
And they do have a medical center, so I could have kicked it.

91
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,240
Oh, here we go.

92
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,080
I could have kicked it down there and just been like, you know, look at me.

93
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,960
You know what's up.

94
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,480
I think they should just like, you walk in the door and they shoot you in the mouth with a

95
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,440
Pepto gun.

96
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,160
They just know.

97
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,520
And you just walk in and there's just like a mouth level tray with Pepto on it that you

98
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,400
can just sort of consume and be out of the door in three seconds.

99
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,800
You should just walk into your hotel room and in your like state room and there's like a towel

100
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,960
folded like a monkey and it's holding a tube of preparation age for you.

101
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,120
How did you know about the towels folded like monkeys?

102
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,320
Because I know things.

103
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,400
I actually know it from John Hodgman's, I think it's more information than you require or it

104
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,760
might be that is all.

105
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,160
He talks about going on a cruise and about the different animal shapes and what they mean.

106
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,760
I never knew that Mr.

107
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,000
Hodgman also suffered from that very bad butt affliction.

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,320
He does not talk about Preparation H.

109
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,120
He actually-

110
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,080
No, cause he has more decorum than the three of us like orangutans just like shouting about

111
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,240
our shit every episode.

112
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,640
What I was going to say before Griffin interrupted me was that the H stands for Hodgman.

113
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,120
Oh, I see.

114
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,320
He is the inventor of Preparation H, but I didn't get there.

115
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,720
The problem with me going on a cruise and not getting to record this show for a week is I have

116
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,280
so much to talk about and I didn't get to last week.

117
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,640
So I'm sorry that we have like a bunch of different intros.

118
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,080
But I have other things I need to cover if you guys can just hang with me.

119
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,400
Yeah, sure.

120
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,720
Hit it.

121
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
Two more big bullet points.

122
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,120
The first came yesterday when I was going back through security to get on to the plane in San

123
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,400
Diego and as I was about to go through the backscatter machine, is that what it's called?

124
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,200
Yeah, sure.

125
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,320
Anyway, I was about to go through the backscatter machine and you know they got the metal detector

126
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,240
next to it if you don't want to do the backscatter thing.

127
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,160
As I was about to go through the backscatter machine, I see a security guard point at the

128
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,200
person behind me.

129
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
He looks at her and says,

130
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,200
you got any metal in your body?

131
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,080
All right.

132
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,000
And she's like, what?

133
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,200
Do you have any metal in your body?

134
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,480
And it becomes clear fairly quickly that English is not this woman's first language.

135
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,400
And English is my first language.

136
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,360
And even I was a little bit like, excuse me?

137
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,680
Yeah.

138
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,440
Yeah, what can you just say what I want you to say with my heart, which is, are you a

139
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,480
cyber grandma?

140
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,360
Can you tell me if you are part cyborg, part robot, part woman, all grandma, all cyborg?

141
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,320
You grandma Logan?

142
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,080
You grandma Logan?

143
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,760
This has nothing to do with my job.

144
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,600
I just, it's a fascination of mine and you look like you might have some cyber components.

145
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,120
Do you have cyber components?

146
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,280
Are you enhanced with cyber components?

147
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,920
Are you more machine than human at this point?

148
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,920
All right, going through.

149
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,800
This is really the main thing I wanted to talk about.

150
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:56,400
Yesterday, I was driving back and was watching Trolls in the car and Riley, the sister-in-law,

151
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,720
told me, I learned something by watching the credits of this movie.

152
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,480
Did you know that pretty much all the people who have one line in this movie are all well

153
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,240
known YouTubers?

154
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,280
Oh, fuck me.

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,280
And they did that because, so it's like kind of a cool marketing.

156
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,400
It's a smart marketing.

157
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,200
Yeah, really cool.

158
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:26,800
So then as I'm driving, I like, things don't come to me this hard, but it was like, I finally

159
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,080
understood the secret.

160
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,640
You know what I mean?

161
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,240
Like, I finally got visual, after joking about it for a long time, I finally understood the

162
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,720
power of visualization because I could see the path to the thing I'm about to say so

163
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,680
clearly.

164
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,180
Okay.

165
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:49,040
In April 2020, the three of us are going to be in Trolls 2.

166
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,540
Okay.

167
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
This is what I'm saying now.

168
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,900
All right.

169
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,400
It's March, 2017.

170
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,880
We do really want to put out there that we have three years.

171
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,560
We have three years.

172
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,040
I'm putting out into the universe that the three of us will be in, I don't even want,

173
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,760
I want to say are, but I feel like that is actually not visualization, it's just tense

174
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,640
confusion.

175
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,240
So I'm going to say will be in April 2020.

176
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,480
And this is a sort of narrow casting for a second to our agent, Joel.

177
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,920
Joel, Trolls 2, April 2020.

178
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,240
I don't care if we, it's of one, it's all three of us or nothing.

179
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,080
Two, I don't care if it's one word said simultaneously.

180
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,560
Yeah, we all sound the same.

181
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,320
We're in Trolls 2, and I'll notice.

182
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,840
We're in Trolls 2, Joel.

183
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:46,400
The main troll, Bimbo, turns to their friend Charlotte and says, who are those clowns?

184
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,480
And turns to us three, and we all are trolls of different shapes and sizes.

185
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,760
And we're just like, Bazinga.

186
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:52,800
Yep.

187
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,440
While my brothers are having a great time with their ignorance of the Trolls franchise,

188
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,000
I will also come in and do like some story punch ups.

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,720
Yeah, I'm sorry, I haven't seen that.

190
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,040
I've seen that movie quite a few fucking times.

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,280
And I will just, not to say the first one needed punch up, although there was some thematic

192
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,360
elements that I felt like could have been clarified.

193
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,840
Okay.

194
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,840
Like the parallels to drug addiction were like there, but I felt like weren't pronounced

195
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,160
enough, could have been a little bit, hit a little bit harder.

196
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,520
So I'm happy to do that work for you.

197
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,920
But we will be in Trolls 2 in April 2020.

198
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,080
All three McElroy brothers, add it to IMDB if you want.

199
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,040
But we will be in Trolls 2 in April 2020.

200
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,880
Give me Jeffrey Katz on the phone.

201
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,240
Give me whoever I need to talk to.

202
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,680
Justin Timms, Anna Kin-kin, Kin-kin, whoever.

203
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,400
We're going to be in Trolls 2.

204
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,360
I'm excited, man.

205
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,280
I'm psyched out of my mind.

206
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,920
I wish maybe we hadn't talked so much yay about, you know, oh, are you gone again?

207
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,600
We didn't talk any yay about it.

208
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,360
We pretended to be excited about it.

209
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,960
Now, after I've seen it 30 times, I'm really excited about it.

210
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,160
It was real to me, damn it.

211
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,000
Let's get to, can we do questions?

212
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,720
Can I tell, okay.

213
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,440
As long as we're saying things that happened in the last two weeks, because we, no, because

214
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,800
we missed an episode, we have 1500 new emails for this week.

215
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,200
And so I was able to kind of build a bit of a theme for this episode.

216
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,720
Oh, hell yeah.

217
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,000
That's really exciting.

218
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,280
Okay, yeah, I'm reading some of the questions now and I can kind of, okay, this is fun,

219
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,560
Trav, what you've made for us.

220
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,680
Let's get started.

221
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,920
When I was out buying-

222
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,760
Read the fucking do it, yes.

223
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,840
Hey, listen, I'm trying to just hang in there, okay?

224
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,800
Justin's trying to read this from the sunken place.

225
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,840
He's having a hard time.

226
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm back, I'm back from the upside down, everyone.

227
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,280
Justin's in the sunless sea.

228
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,520
When I was out buying special edition ketchup Doritos, a guy in the convenience store stopped

229
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,800
me, told me I was bootiful, and told me he couldn't let me go without giving me something.

230
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,840
He hands me a piece of paper and I think he's giving me his number.

231
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,600
It's a coupon for a whopper.

232
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,480
It's a coupon for a whopper.

233
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,080
Do you know what this means?

234
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,440
Is this how kids flirt?

235
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,960
That's from Confuse Canuck.

236
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,400
There's a lot, there's a lot here, huh?

237
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,840
There's a lot to sort of unpack.

238
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,640
There's a lot of runes and glyphs that we need to sort of decipher, I think.

239
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,360
Yeah, I need a codex.

240
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,640
Need a codex for this.

241
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,920
Yeah, so you're going to get the ketchup Doritos.

242
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,400
And like at this point, you're lucky that we continued to read the remainder of the question.

243
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,000
Right, is that a Canadian exclusive?

244
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,080
I haven't seen those on shelves.

245
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,920
There's a lot of, probably.

246
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,800
Although ketchup's not really their forte.

247
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,480
Like their sort of specialty is like gravy and cheese on fries.

248
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,200
Yeah, but that's what makes it, that's what makes it exotic, exactly, right?

249
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,320
I don't think, I don't think you can-

250
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,760
It's imported from Canada.

251
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,680
Interesting, I don't think you can call-

252
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,800
I mean, it's not imported from Canada if you're in Canada, it's just there.

253
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,640
I don't think you can call them the ketchup Doritos special edition.

254
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,200
I think it's just edition.

255
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,800
I don't think there's anything especially special about ketchup flavored Doritos.

256
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,240
I do, my favorite part about this whole question is imagining

257
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,120
that this convenience store worker needed this whopper coupon.

258
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,960
Like this was going to be, this was when his whole plan for lunch was like,

259
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,200
I've been saving this coupon and I'm going to treat myself to a free whopper

260
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,520
because the most delicious whopper is a free whopper.

261
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,000
I see.

262
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,120
But then-

263
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,520
Then this is like when Christ went to the temple and somebody was like,

264
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,920
here's a buck, I have a million bucks, but here's one.

265
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,760
And then the other person was like, I only have one buck, but here's my one buck.

266
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,760
And it was like, that's a hundred percent of your bucks.

267
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,440
So this is a hundred percent of the whopper coupons this person had

268
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,560
and they were very excited about it.

269
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,400
And so this gift was such a huge sacrifice that it means a lot to them.

270
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,160
And this is serendipity too, because his number is written on the coupon,

271
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,040
but what you need to do is take that coupon, get that whopper,

272
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,200
and then if that coupon comes back to you-

273
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,560
There it is, serendipity too.

274
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,360
I can officially declare that coupons are basically a curse.

275
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,400
You hand someone a coupon, you've basically cursed them.

276
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,400
Because what this means is like, now you have to,

277
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,320
just using this as an example, but it applies to all coupons.

278
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,120
Here's a coupon.

279
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,720
Now you have to go to this place and buy something you weren't planning on

280
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,520
or feel like you were throwing away money.

281
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,920
And one of those two things has to happen.

282
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,000
The only way to free yourself from a coupon is after it expires.

283
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,480
You can be like, ah, the money disappeared.

284
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,600
Now I can throw this away with a clean conscience.

285
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,920
But until then, it's a curse.

286
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,680
Coupons are basically a curse.

287
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,240
If coupons are a curse,

288
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,000
then the Bed Bath and Beyond near my house is low key the Baba Yaga.

289
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,360
Ah, the coupons expired.

290
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
It's not, but it says it never.

291
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,880
Free me from this curse, please.

292
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,720
Because it looks like money.

293
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,880
It looks like fun burger money.

294
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,440
You know what I mean?

295
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,760
It's got like the big free and big letters.

296
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,560
And it's like, get a free sandwich or whatever.

297
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,560
And you feel like you're throwing away money

298
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,680
when you throw away a coupon.

299
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,840
It's like, man, I could have used that for a free sandwich.

300
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,640
But in order to redeem it, you have to go through so many hoops.

301
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,080
And nobody remembers.

302
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,640
How many times, the worst part of the coupon experience

303
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,280
is when you go to Burger King and you forget.

304
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,560
And then as you're opening your wallet to put your receipt in

305
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,480
because you save all your Burger King receipts

306
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,360
because they're nasty.

307
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,080
For taxes.

308
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,040
You see in there the Burger King coupon.

309
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,160
You're like, oh no.

310
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,800
Shit.

311
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,520
Not like this.

312
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,280
All I can picture too is that, walk up to the counter.

313
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,120
I would like one Whopper, please.

314
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,240
No, just the burger.

315
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,320
All right, that'll be like a dollar, I guess.

316
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,760
Yes, no, it will not.

317
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,800
It will not today.

318
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,400
Take this piece of garbage and give me that burger.

319
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,520
I have a Yahoo transition that's really good here.

320
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,360
That's going to stay on theme, Travis.

321
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,640
Very excited for it.

322
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,520
It was sent in by Amelia Burger.

323
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,200
The question is not about food, but it's asked by Pee Pee Slap.

324
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,160
And this is actually Yahoo Answers Now, which, okay, yes.

325
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,080
It's Yahoo Answers Now, which I'm still unsure

326
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,480
what the distinction is between Yahoo Answers

327
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,440
and Yahoo Answers Now, which is like, how's your branding?

328
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,480
Because I use this motherfucker every single week of my life.

329
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,280
But anyway, this Yahoo Answers Now from Pee Pee Slap.

330
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,920
I like that.

331
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,800
I like that too, because it's like, Yahoo Answers Now.

332
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,640
No, don't think about it.

333
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,840
You're thinking too much.

334
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,520
That's been the problem with Yahoo Answers,

335
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,920
is people contemplating too long.

336
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,200
Just shoot from the hip.

337
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,560
This is a Rorschach test.

338
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Pee Pee Slap asks in card games.

339
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,560
It's an app.

340
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,520
It's a mobile app.

341
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,480
Oh, okay, I see.

342
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,120
That's your answer.

343
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,160
Pee Pee Slap.

344
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,400
For when you really need Yahoo Answers on the go.

345
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,240
How many times am I gonna say Pee Pee Slap?

346
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,280
Because we keep getting interrupted.

347
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,000
Let's find out.

348
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,600
Pee Pee Slap asks,

349
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,480
how do you tell someone they are bad at Yu-Gi-Oh?

350
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,480
No additional details, but this is great.

351
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,240
It's a really, like, here's the thing.

352
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,400
Jeremy, you've spent $3,000 on these cool cards,

353
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,360
but you just can't seem to beat anybody at the game.

354
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,640
And you need to stop.

355
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,720
If this is the sunk cost fallacy,

356
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,760
you're hoping you're gonna get the card or cards

357
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,240
you need to put a winning Yu-Gi-Oh game together.

358
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,960
And my friend, if it hasn't happened yet,

359
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,880
I just don't believe it's gonna happen.

360
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,840
Listen, kids, you just don't have the spark.

361
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,600
You don't have the spark.

362
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,360
Yu-Gi-Oh had the spark.

363
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,440
You don't have what it takes to go pro.

364
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,080
You just don't have it.

365
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,920
Yeah, if you don't have the blue eyes white dragon,

366
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,840
it's the only Yu-Gi-Oh shit I know.

367
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,240
And I'm gonna reference it about 10 more times.

368
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,880
Here's the thing.

369
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,200
Here's what they don't tell you in Yu-Gi-Oh school.

370
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,360
It's okay to not go pro.

371
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,880
Not everyone's gonna go pro.

372
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,360
You can have another job and just do Yu-Gi-Oh for fun.

373
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,840
Do it on the amateur level just because you love it.

374
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,400
You know what I mean?

375
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,480
You don't have to like commit.

376
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,080
You don't have to say like, no,

377
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,840
I'm gonna quit the accounting firm and just Yu-Gi-Oh full time.

378
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,240
Now I will say in the Yu-Gi-Oh anime,

379
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,120
I'm pretty sure the protagonist had to win certain games

380
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,720
or else his grandpa would die.

381
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,200
And in those games, it was actually very important

382
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,280
that he do well in the game.

383
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,640
And like winning isn't everything

384
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,800
unless your grandpa's soul is on the line.

385
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,080
In which case I do actually think

386
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,280
you need to pull out a W on this one, Mr. Yu-Gi-Oh.

387
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,800
Do you think that that's what everybody

388
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,200
in the Yu-Gi-Oh universe was playing for?

389
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,960
Like your grandfather too?

390
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,520
Yeah, my girl.

391
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,160
Your grandfather?

392
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,640
Did they take all of our grandpas?

393
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,080
Is somebody just holding all of our grandpas hostage?

394
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,080
I feel like the person who wrote this question

395
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,600
is on the wrong end of a pretty bad grift.

396
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,440
And it's a hustle.

397
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,600
And what I think is that their friend

398
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,680
has been following their Yahoo Answers account

399
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,040
waiting for this exact moment.

400
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,520
Okay.

401
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,680
There's a very different version of this

402
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,480
where like we see over the shoulder the friend type like,

403
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,320
how do I tell my friend he's not?

404
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,240
And then the friend like turns around

405
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,600
because he's been watching the whole time

406
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,160
and he's like, finally, the trap is set.

407
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,280
Finally, it's time to spring it on him.

408
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,760
And then the next time they play, he's like, listen,

409
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,160
I know you've been thinking and asking on Yahoo Answers

410
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,400
a lot lately about how I should get out of the game.

411
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,360
And I feel like maybe if you beat me this time,

412
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,400
I'll stop playing.

413
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,000
And just to make it like even sillier,

414
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,000
if I beat you, you give me-

415
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,920
Your grandpa's soul.

416
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,440
Give me your grandpa's soul.

417
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,680
Like I get your grandpa, no big deal.

418
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,600
Because he's like, I'm so bad, right?

419
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,800
And it's like, all right, Jeremy,

420
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,000
time to put you out of your misery.

421
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,720
And he's like, blue eyes, white dragon, blow.

422
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,400
And you lose, I guess.

423
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,480
I didn't watch that much of the show,

424
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,240
but I'm pretty sure there's one card called

425
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,280
blue eyes, white dragon.

426
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,800
That's just the best card.

427
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:13,840
Blue eyes, white dragon, can't lose.

428
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,720
Oh, God.

429
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,600
Man, that joke requires you to understand

430
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,440
so many different pieces of media.

431
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,480
A lot of levels.

432
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,240
This actually might be the only podcast

433
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:29,200
in which that joke lands.

434
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,000
It also had the trademark macarons so excited

435
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,920
to get to make the joke tone of voice

436
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,200
that always makes me so happy.

437
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,440
Yeah, this would be like Saturday morning JCC tables.

438
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,400
And it's just like you go and you play

439
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,160
in some low level Yu-Gi-Oh tournaments,

440
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,000
but coach Eric Taylor is there.

441
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,880
And Tammy's there too.

442
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,640
Maybe in this one, Tammy's like the fucking...

443
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,840
Coach Eric Taylor can handle all the football stuff.

444
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,840
Tammy's at the fucking Yu-Gi-Oh table,

445
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
like bringing the sheet.

446
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,960
She needs to blow off some steam

447
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,160
because Julie's putting her through

448
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,320
the fucking ringer again for no reason at all.

449
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,240
She's just trying to do her best as a mom

450
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,920
living here in this small Texas town.

451
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,160
So she goes to the JCC and blows off some steam

452
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,680
at the fucking tables

453
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,000
and just like drops that blue eyes white dragon.

454
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,640
This is actually a fact.

455
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Can you just like imagine like coach Taylor

456
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,880
is like enjoying a nice real at Applebee's

457
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,640
and he like turns behind him and he's like,

458
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,360
hey, saw you boys playing Yu-Gi-Oh.

459
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,720
You got something raw, I can mold.

460
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,400
Come join my team.

461
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,080
In Friday Night Lights,

462
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,960
anytime you do not see a character on screen,

463
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,240
they are playing Yu-Gi-Oh.

464
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,240
You know Landry's in it.

465
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,000
You know Landry's deep in that shit.

466
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,840
How did he keep his Sandy when he was in the hospital?

467
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,280
Yeah, you guessed it.

468
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,280
He was playing Yu-Gi-Oh the entire time

469
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,480
with himself honing like a chess master.

470
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:46,720
Yeah.

471
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,200
Okay, so I don't think we need to tell them

472
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,560
how to tell them they're bad at Yu-Gi-Oh.

473
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,680
You can just, I think just someone just tell yourself.

474
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,640
I found out this evening

475
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,200
that my little sister eats soup with a fork.

476
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,360
She eats all the vegetables and meat

477
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,640
and just leaves the broth.

478
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,120
Okay.

479
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,920
What should I do?

480
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,080
That's from sad soup sibling.

481
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,160
Fine, let's get into it.

482
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,600
Yeah, you're just treating this soup

483
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,360
like a sort of shabu-shabu pot

484
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,320
where it's just like, no, you don't drink the broth.

485
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,320
The broth is what cooks the stuff.

486
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,400
No, the broth is where the money is.

487
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,160
Yeah, it feels like if you're doing this,

488
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,960
you don't understand.

489
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,800
Like somebody spilled liquid on this meat and vegetables.

490
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,960
Yeah, what do you do when you get a fucking nice soup?

491
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,960
A nice like tomato basil soup

492
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,480
and you like somebody sets it down in front

493
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,560
and you're like, somebody already finished this soup

494
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,840
because there's nothing in it.

495
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,360
When you guys make a soup at home,

496
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,520
do you get really paranoid and very particular

497
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,160
when you're ladling your soup out into your bowl

498
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,040
to make sure to leave the future iteration for yourself

499
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,760
a very good stuffings to soup ratio?

500
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,600
I try to be very careful about that.

501
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,440
You gotta have that balance.

502
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,000
I don't do much self souping, to be honest.

503
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,040
It's usually something that other people prepare for me.

504
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,400
I don't do any.

505
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,360
I don't have that kind of budget.

506
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,120
You don't have your own saucier?

507
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:13,200
My problem is that I always over bit the soup.

508
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,520
There's not enough broth, too many bits.

509
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,280
And what you end up with is like a suggestion of broth

510
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,040
in a pile of bits.

511
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,280
If that's not soup, that's just a hot pile.

512
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,800
Yeah, then you just have a pile with some sauce.

513
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,080
I would always prefer, I dump out the broth of my ramen.

514
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,080
I want it to, before I add the seasoning packet.

515
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,840
So it's like highly concentrated, just the nudes, ma'am.

516
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,840
And I, not nudes.

517
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,760
Yeah, that was a rough one, Juice.

518
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,480
Let me try again, like noodles, not nudes.

519
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,160
I know, but the way you said it was really stinked.

520
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,920
It got into a drag that thing.

521
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,440
That's not a point of reference for me

522
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,960
that I'm really sorry about.

523
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,120
Well, I like the chunkens.

524
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,960
I don't really need the broth.

525
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,400
I brought my own drink, thanks.

526
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,520
I'm just gonna enjoy.

527
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,360
I'm actually kind of into this.

528
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,880
The only problem I have with the fork

529
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,920
is I think it would be hard bite composition

530
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,160
to get the right bite composition.

531
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,320
Like a spoon is much better for that, I think.

532
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,640
A slotted spoon would be perfect, it sounds like.

533
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,080
A small slotted spoon would be so choice.

534
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,680
Do you eat those?

535
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,040
First of all, I wanna say I'm very disappointed in you

536
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,120
for not eating your ramen in the Japanese style.

537
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,400
Hey, Griff, do you wanna be rich?

538
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,520
Yeah, sure.

539
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,680
Can you make some small slotted spoons

540
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,560
and trademark that?

541
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,800
Because I think that's a very good idea.

542
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,240
Wait, you're talking, you just said it?

543
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,200
That's a TM, right?

544
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,000
That's a TM?

545
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,800
I guess TM.

546
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,920
You could have something there.

547
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,520
But I don't wanna have invented this

548
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,360
because it kind of goes against everything I'm against,

549
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,760
which is just like, I think broth is very, very good

550
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,040
and you drink it on a cold day

551
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,640
and your lungs feel good.

552
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,560
Oh, yeah.

553
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,760
Are you gone?

554
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,400
No, it's good.

555
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,880
I'm thinking it's good.

556
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,080
Sorry, you were having a good broth memory.

557
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,000
I thought you were going to the deep place.

558
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,640
No, I think it's starting to wear off.

559
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,680
Oh, good.

560
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,200
Yeah, I'm getting there.

561
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,320
Enough coffee and stuff.

562
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
I'm afraid it'll go too far the other way, Justin,

563
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,080
and you'll just be super present all of a sudden.

564
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,960
You'll be operating lawnmower man-esque levels

565
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,080
of understanding.

566
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,000
You're gonna be like fucking Superman

567
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,280
powered by our yellow sun

568
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,600
without that Krypton gravity or whatever.

569
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,440
I feel like this for me,

570
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,160
part of it also depends on the broth.

571
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,000
If it's a tomatoey soup,

572
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,200
I don't normally go in for like drinking that.

573
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,880
Like a chickeny kind of broth,

574
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,640
I definitely could just drink that straight.

575
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,040
Okay, I'm glad we fucking settled that.

576
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,640
I was really worried actually.

577
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,200
So now it's made perfectly clear.

578
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,160
Well, this is why you always have to do a brothy soup

579
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,720
and like a crunchy grilled cheese sandwich

580
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,240
so you can eat the dip-ums.

581
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,800
You eat out the chunkums and then you eat the dip-ums.

582
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,240
Can I do a yahoo?

583
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
Love soup, love soup.

584
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,840
Top notch.

585
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,120
Now this is some revisionist history.

586
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,880
You can't say that you don't eat the fucking broth

587
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,840
and then say you love soup.

588
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,040
That's like saying I love pizza,

589
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,840
but I scrape all the shit off the crust

590
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,920
and I just eat like a little cheese mess.

591
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,200
No, it's like low pressure regular food.

592
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,280
It's like, hey, listen, I know what a bummer it is

593
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,280
to try to figure out like what you're gonna eat

594
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,920
or how much you're gonna eat or like how to get

595
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,840
good proportions of bites or whatever.

596
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,240
So we just dumped it in all of the vat for you.

597
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,840
We're just serving it up straight.

598
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,360
Soup is food sweatpants.

599
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,120
This yahoo was sent in by Irham Wazessa.

600
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,800
Thank you, Irham, you're crushing it.

601
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,240
It's from yahoo answers user.

602
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,280
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

603
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,640
I'm gonna call him.

604
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,400
Oh God, it just got fucking deleted.

605
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,040
I refreshed it.

606
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,160
What the fuck?

607
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,960
I just fucking refreshed the page and it got deleted.

608
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,840
Why did it get deleted?

609
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,760
It was totally innocuous.

610
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
Well, now I gotta go to the fucking internet archive

611
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,400
and pull up this fucking deep web illegal question.

612
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,920
This was not, this was not that fucking bad of a question.

613
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,360
All right, pull that up.

614
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,960
Let me grab the fucking cash.

615
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,520
What the fuck though, seriously?

616
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,280
And the cash isn't loading.

617
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,040
So this one, I lost it guys.

618
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,760
It just gone.

619
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,200
So what, do you remember kind of what it was about?

620
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,400
Give me the five, give me the fucking text only version.

621
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,680
View source.

622
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,200
Why is it gone?

623
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,280
I'm literally looking at the fucking metadata.

624
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,200
I'm looking at the fucking like meta name equals title content.

625
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,680
And all right, not this one.

626
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,760
The data's not in the bucket.

627
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,520
Is prod static true?

628
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,480
Sorry guys, I gotta get into the fucking like hacker code.

629
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,640
This is garbage from a toilet.

630
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,680
This fucking sucks.

631
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,680
All right, here we go.

632
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:51,280
It was asked by Yahoo Answers user fucking swordfish asks,

633
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,960
shoes off at the door, a growing trend?

634
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,160
I am fairly new to having a rule in our home

635
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,720
that everyone takes off their shoes.

636
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,920
Recently, I've been noticing that more and more people seem to be adopting

637
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,880
the same practice in their home.

638
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,720
I'm curious if anyone else is seeing this trend.

639
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,640
What do you do in your home?

640
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,520
Are shoes allowed?

641
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,480
What about your kids?

642
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,400
Are shoes allowed? What about your guests?

643
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,960
Now that we have the rule in our home, I really like it.

644
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,480
What is common in your area?

645
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,120
So another smooth transition.

646
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,040
We're talking about doing things in the Japanese style.

647
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,000
I think I could get into this.

648
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,840
I don't enforce this in my home at all.

649
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,520
And now I'm worried about sort of the grubbiness of our floors

650
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,000
or whether people are showing disrespect to me in my sort of my zone.

651
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,440
Griffey, normally in the Yahoo Answers portion here,

652
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,640
it's stuff like I put pizza crust in my butt or Garfield had pan buns.

653
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,200
Yeah, no, but I think this is more interesting to talk about

654
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,320
of whether we should start all sort of enforcing issues off policy

655
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,160
because on any walk from point A to point B,

656
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,960
no matter where you live,

657
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,920
both rural and urban environments have their own sort of danger things.

658
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:07,360
In an urban environment, you might step in like an old pile of soup

659
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,040
that somebody just like dumped on the ground.

660
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,200
But in a rural environment, you might actually step in a cow patty.

661
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,520
And then I don't necessarily want you bringing the story of your walk

662
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,920
into my home and sharing it with my floor.

663
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,200
You know what I mean?

664
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,320
Now that I'm thinking about this.

665
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,600
And I'm not like a, I don't think I'm particularly germaphobic at all.

666
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,800
It's just like you could bring anything from your journey into my place.

667
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,680
And I'm walking on the floor on my bare feet because it's my zone.

668
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,360
It's my little kingdom.

669
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:35,920
You know what I mean?

670
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,880
Am I the only one here?

671
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,040
I feel like whenever someone,

672
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,560
I never feel like it's an imposition when people ask me to remove my shoes

673
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,720
because I always feel like, oh, thank God.

674
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,800
Like finally I can get comfortable and really explore the space, right?

675
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,160
So I would always prefer to take them off.

676
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,160
That's why I like, you walk into a place, just anybody's house

677
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,240
and they say, take your shoes off

678
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,720
and they hand you a set of pajamas to change into.

679
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,200
Okay, so you went a little bit much there.

680
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,000
No, and then like you all just, they've spread pillows on the floor

681
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,360
and everyone just takes a nap

682
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,840
because this is apparently we're all children now

683
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,480
and we can't wear our fucking shoes indoors.

684
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,120
No, I'm just kidding.

685
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,840
This sounds great.

686
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,280
Cause I always wear funny socks.

687
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,440
Okay, so but you did mean jokes then.

688
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,000
It's like having a fourth brother.

689
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,560
It's like you walk into the house

690
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,760
and you fucking take your shoes off

691
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,400
and they make you climb up a big tube and jump into a ball pit

692
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,480
because it's apparently all big McDonald's Play Place.

693
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,680
That was you just a minute ago, but you know this is true.

694
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,960
Well, here's what I did Griffin.

695
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,000
I started to zig, right?

696
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,920
And then what I did was I zagged

697
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,200
because and I'll go behind the zag here for a second.

698
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,200
I realized that my funny joke might end up sounding mean

699
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,600
towards cultures who are taking shoes off is the norm.

700
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,000
Oh, I see.

701
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,840
So I zagged right out of it

702
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,400
and made it a thing where I'm actually on board with it.

703
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,840
Sort of a corrective zag.

704
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,400
This has been inside the zag.

705
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,080
Here's what I like about this.

706
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,600
I'm Peter Graves.

707
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,160
Welcome to inside the zag.

708
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,520
I like a lot about this.

709
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,720
I think it's clean and good and respectful.

710
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,920
I'm not gonna bring my shoes journeys story

711
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,240
all over your home where your baby is like

712
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,280
definitely like licking the floor 24 seven.

713
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:19,840
You know what I mean?

714
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,960
But also this also introduces the concept of toilet slippers

715
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,360
which can be very, very exciting

716
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,800
because you do need to put those on

717
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,120
when you go into that room because who knows.

718
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,760
I think we can all agree like no matter what

719
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,360
anything goes in the bathroom.

720
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,920
So you put these special shoes on

721
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,240
and then people come out and it's like a conversation starter.

722
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,800
I enjoyed wearing those toilet slippers

723
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,680
that you had in there.

724
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
They were fun and they were flirty and fashionable.

725
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,360
Yeah, you convinced him

726
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,920
I'm willing to take my shoes off from the house from now on.

727
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,000
Now, I think to really drive this home.

728
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,320
By the way, why the fuck did this get deleted?

729
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,000
Who are yahoo?

730
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,680
This is actually the most innocuous question

731
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,440
we've ever had on this TV show.

732
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,720
I know podcast.

733
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,200
Sorry.

734
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,040
What is yahoo owned by big?

735
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,240
Is yahoo owned by big Nike by big Adidas?

736
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,880
My big carpet wizards.

737
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,840
Every all day.

738
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,040
I dream about answering yahoo answers.

739
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,360
That got him nice.

740
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,440
It's just like I think this is dope

741
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,320
and I think I'm gonna actually invest in a little cubby.

742
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm gonna invest in a shoe cubby

743
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,120
and when my friends come over,

744
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,840
I can have little nameplates for my friends.

745
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,480
Hi, Justin.

746
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,040
Hi, Bristol.

747
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,240
This is your special cubbies.

748
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,440
Put your shoes in the hole.

749
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,760
You should take it one step further, Griffin.

750
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,080
Okay.

751
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,560
Special cubbies for shoes.

752
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,840
Then special like silly socks

753
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,080
with the non-skid slip on the bottom.

754
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,360
Those will be an option, sure.

755
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,440
So that way it's like they can

756
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,160
because that's the thing.

757
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,040
I have hardwood floors.

758
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,960
I don't wanna brag, but I'm worried.

759
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,680
Like people sometimes they have some sort of composite.

760
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,280
Like some sort of composite.

761
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,800
Are they real genuine?

762
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,080
But I also rent.

763
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,800
So listen, it's not a brag

764
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,520
because it's not my house,

765
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,480
but it's an old house, okay?

766
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,200
But I'm worried about people's dress socks

767
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,160
on the hardwood floor.

768
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,320
So I wanna give them something where it's like,

769
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,680
hey, they look like monster feet.

770
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,160
You know what I mean?

771
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,880
That kind of thing.

772
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,600
Yeah, I think that defeats the purpose a little bit,

773
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,200
but okay, I'm with you kind of,

774
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,840
but not really.

775
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,760
Like indoor shoes.

776
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,260
Okay.

777
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,560
So slippers.

778
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,760
Yeah, that's what you've just described.

779
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,200
You've just said indoor slippers.

780
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,160
No, I'm sorry.

781
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,320
Guys, I don't want them to slip around.

782
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,080
I wanna give them Shurer foot.

783
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,200
Stickers then.

784
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:37,760
Stickers.

785
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,840
Sticky indoor shoes.

786
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,240
Hey everybody, get inside.

787
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,760
Get aboard.

788
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,160
Where are we going?

789
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,240
We're sailing away from this commerce-free wasteland.

790
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,480
I'm taking you to a sweet little island

791
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,680
that I know about.

792
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,800
It used to be called Bally High

793
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,520
and now I've renamed it The Money Zone.

794
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,200
Someone who can talk should probably sell them.

795
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,520
All right.

796
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,120
I'll do this first one

797
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,480
because this first one is a good friend of mine named Harry,

798
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,840
or specifically Harry's.

799
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,120
What Harry's does is they send you razors

800
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,560
and the razors are very, very good

801
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,840
and they're very, very affordable

802
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,520
and they're gonna give you a close, comfortable shave.

803
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,120
You're talking about five German-engineered blades,

804
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,800
talking about a lubricating strip,

805
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,880
got a flex hinge there for a comfortable glide.

806
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,760
It's a really good blade.

807
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,720
I use mine pretty much exclusively now to shave my face

808
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,000
and I get, I feel like I get a nice shave every time.

809
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,840
And it was started by just two guys, Jeff and Andy,

810
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,080
who were fed up with being overcharged for razors.

811
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,080
So they cut out the middleman

812
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,480
and now they just sell their own high-quality razors online

813
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,520
and ship them directly to you

814
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,520
for half the price of the leading brand.

815
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,920
And they are so confident

816
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,320
they want you to try their most popular trial set for free.

817
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,960
It comes with a free razor handle of your choice,

818

five-blade cartridge and shaving gel,

819

and it's free when you sign up.

820
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,480

821

It's free for shipping and you get these good blades.

822

I would like to tell you guys about my underpants.

827
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,480
All right.

828
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,320
They're great.

829
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,880
They are wonderful, I'm wearing them right now.

830
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,480
They are endowing me with the confidence

831
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,200
to talk about me undies.

832
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,640
Here's the thing, we've talked about me undies

833
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,600
so many times in the show,

834
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,120
maybe this is your first episode.

835
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,920
Maybe you are just now getting into our show

836
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,760
on episode 345.

837
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,560
Gotta start somewhere, don't start at one.

838
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,560
Start here, work backwards.

839
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,920
Me undies is an amazing brand.

840
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,520
I mean, like a concept.

841
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,320
Family member at this point.

842
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,720
At this point, their underpants are amazing.

843
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,840
They're softer than soft.

844
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,420
They not only have underpants for everybody,

845
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:14,040
they also have sleep pants, T-shirt, it's incredible.

846
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,880
Different styles, cool patterns, it's great.

847
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,000
And it's the first thing you put on

848
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,940
and it's the last thing you take off.

849
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,320
And you're gonna, this is not a joke,

850
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,720
it is not an exaggeration.

851
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,920
When I put on a pair of me undies,

852
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,240
like fresh out of the shower me undies,

853
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,440
it feels like yes, I'm ready.

854
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,400
It feels like yes.

855
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,740
It feels like yes, it does.

856
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,520
It feels like I'm agreeing to do something with myself

857
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,200
that day.

858
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,080
And if you're not ready for a subscription,

859
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,960
that's totally cool.

860
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,200
You can still save.

861
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,440
That's because me undies is offering you 20%

00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,620

00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,820

866
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:07,820
I got a personal message here for Chambers and Daggley.

867
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,980
And it's from.

868
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,380
My favorite TNT show.

869
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,940
And it's from Chris.

870
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,660
Nobody has a favorite TNT show, so stop it.

871
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,460
Mark Paul Gosler and.

872
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,340
Mark Paul Glockosler.

873
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,180
Jesus.

874
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,940
Chris says to Chambers.

875
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,900
One's a lawyer, the other's a lawyer.

876
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,420
They practice law in a court.

877
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,700
But a different kind, well it's the same branch of law.

878
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,020
It's the same kind of law.

879
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,860
They're part.

880
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,780
But like, one's a little bit wackier.

881
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,600
It's not wacky.

882
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,440
Just a little bit, it's just a little bit.

883
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,180
No, absolutely not.

884
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,660
They're just regular lawyers and they're both lawyers

885
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,120
and they're good at their jobs and they do their best.

886
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,900
But they're not exceptional like house.

887
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,900
They're just regular law guys.

888
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,460
They're looking for love in the big,

889
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,900
they're not looking for love.

890
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,540
What are they doing?

891
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,520
Are they single dads?

892
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,260
No, they're not single, I'm just hearing

893
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,220
they're not single dads at all.

894
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,660
They're not single dads at all.

895
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,500
There's no kids.

896
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,340
What are they doing?

897
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,540
They're going to, okay, so Dagleigh's going

898
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,020
to the grocery store in this episode, everybody.

899
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,300
This is Dagleigh.

900
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,980
They didn't have a case this week?

901
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,020
There's no, okay.

902
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,860
All right.

903
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,120
Every week it's a new case.

904
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,980
Well, not always.

905
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,820
Not always, yeah.

906
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,860
Actually, sometimes there's paperwork.

907
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,700
From this one.

908
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,520
To do.

909
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,360
And this one.

910
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,240
TNT should just change their slogan to TNT, we know.

911
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,300
We know, come on.

912
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,740
We have a show in which one episode

913
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,100
a character just goes to Trader Joe's

914
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,180
and it's the whole episode, uncut.

915
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,180
Uncut Trader Joe's visit.

916
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,020
Okay, so.

917
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,020
And he ends up not getting anything.

918
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,860
No, he doesn't.

919
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,700
They didn't have what they needed.

920
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,220
He left his wallet at home.

921
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,080
That's a good episode.

922
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,820
That's a good episode.

923
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,640
That's drama.

924
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,480
TNT, we know drama.

925
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,320
We have characters.

926
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,140
We know drama.

927
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:45,960
Okay, so this.

928
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,800
We know drama, we've met him.

929
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,440
Boy, gotta get this message out.

930
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,980
This is from Chris to Chambers and Dagleigh.

931
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,920
And Chris says, happy Blorf Day

932
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,240
to my two Mabim Bam buddies.

933
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,340
I miss the most.

934
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,060
I wish we didn't live about as far

935
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,660
as three people can in the US,

936
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,740
but I'm glad we can still get together online

937
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,880
to slowly deconstruct the English language

938
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,580
into a series of unrecognizable sounds.

939
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,360
Hope you both have great B-days

940
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:12,480
and we get to play a bunch of Blabio Glambs soon and often.

941
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,780
There's a lot of challenging sort of goof-em-ups

942
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,840
on words in this one.

943
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,220
And we got the timeframe pretty much right on this one.

944
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,300
So happy Blorf Day, Chambers, and Dagleigh.

945
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,460
And sorry we talked more about a fictional TNT show

946
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:31,980
than we did about you, but kind of part of the course.

947
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,860
Yeah, you knew the job was dangerous when you took it.

948
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,900
I got a message for PV and it's from Apple Alligator.

949
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,120
And it says, happy birthday and congratulations

950
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,740
on finishing your thesis.

951
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,460
I'm so proud of you.

952
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,060
I love you and cannot wait to get some Jolly Pirate again.

953
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,180
Aw, damn.

954
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:52,180
Jolly Pirate donuts and gyros now sometimes.

955
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,020
What?

956
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,840
You wanna go in there?

957
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,680
Yep.

958
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,640
It even added it to the sign.

959
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,740
It's the J.P. Deli.

960
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,580
Oh, no.

961
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,860
Featuring J.P. Deli starring donuts.

962
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,860
And also gyros.

963
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,100
I mean, the family that runs that place

964
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,280
already kicked donuts ass, right?

965
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,500
And so they needed a new challenge, I guess.

966
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,680
Yeah, they've conquered donuts.

967
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,820
They put them in a treasure chest,

968
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,580
which makes them more appetizing and humanly possible.

969
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,780
Yeah.

970
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,360
Jesus, guys, it's 1.09 p.m. right where I am,

971
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,700
and I have not eaten lunch yet.

972
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,980
And we cannot talk more about donuts,

973
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,820
or else I may actually kill you.

974
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:29,720
It's 2.09 p.m. here, and it feels like 10, and I'm dying.

975
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,560
Okay.

976
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,100
The Max Fun Drive is coming up.

977
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,020
Okay.

978
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,140
Hey, everybody, it's Justin Mac.

979
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:34,980
Yeah, that's how we start.

980
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,700
That's how we start talking about the Max Fun Drive

981
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,300
with a little pep and our staff.

982
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,380
Can you just let me fucking get through the sentence?

983
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,060
The Max Fun Drive is coming up, so fucking get ready.

984
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,000
Brace your ass,

985
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,600
because it's gonna kick your ass right down your teeth.

986
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,140
And it's gonna be really good.

987
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,660
And it's the best shows of the year,

988
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,060
and all the shows are gonna be fucking rock out

989
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,300
and rock hard, and you're gonna love every episode

990
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,140
of every one.

991
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,020
These beach bodies are ready.

992
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,820
Come crave the sweaty crevices of these hard abs

993
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,660
Oh my God.

994
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,820
in the podcast abs, and it's coming.

995
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,820
The Max Fun Drive doesn't have vertigo, but I do.

996
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,860
And now it's time to listen to it next week.

997
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,460
Catch it.

998
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,540
So it kicks off on the 20th, and it runs for two weeks,

999
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,140
and we love you all so much,

1000
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,560
because you all come out for us every year,

1001
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,980
and we appreciate it, and so like-

1002
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,820
Rock hard.

1003
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,860
It's very rock hard, and if you're a new listener,

1004
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,400
and you like our stuff, and you wanna help support us,

1005
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,420
this is the best time to do it,

1006
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,800
and you get great gifts if you do so,

1007
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,060
and we'll have bonus episodes for literally every show

1008
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,620
that we make.

1009
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,420
And bonus episodes through the past.

1010
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,300
To the past, too, so yeah.

1011
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,580
If you're a new MBMBAM listener,

1012
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,580
and you get on board as a donating member,

1013
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,500
there will be fucking hours, and hours, and hours,

1014
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,520
and hours, and hours of content waiting for you.

1015
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,780
For our show, and all the other shows,

1016
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,020
I'm very partial to the Adventure Zone bonus episodes

1017
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,780
we've done that have been really, really fun.

1018
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,100
So yeah, it starts the 20th, runs for two weeks.

1019
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,820
We'll do some really good episodes for you,

1020
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:04,060
and have some bonus shit, and tell you how to support us,

1021
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,020
and get some cool gifts for being a donor,

1022
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,860
and thank you all so much for how much you've supported us

1023
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,020
in the past, because you've allowed us to do

1024
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,440
some really, really fun stuff.

1025
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,380
So thank you all so much.

1026
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,980
I have a problem.

1027
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,980
Last time we recorded, it was two weeks ago, or three?

1028
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,340
No, two, yes. Who knows?

1029
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,220
It was before you left the Earth,

1030
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,660
and moved to Mother C. It was before I left.

1031
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,980
Before you got on nautical time,

1032
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,780
where you measured time in clicks.

1033
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,140
I created a great recurring bit,

1034
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,540
where I basically just got an opportunity

1035
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,740
to talk about Guy Fieri, and see what's going on with him.

1036
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,580
Yeah.

1037
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,740
And I can't remember what I called it.

1038
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,020
At first, I thought it was Fieri Walk With Me,

1039
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,460
but that was just something hilarious

1040
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,940
that I said a long time ago, in a different life,

1041
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,820
before the C Mother took me.

1042
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,040
And then I thought it was Guy in the Sky,

1043
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,420
but that doesn't make any sense.

1044
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,280
No, I don't think that was it.

1045
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,120
I'm looking at the-

1046
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,620
I think it was Guy Focused.

1047
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,660
Guy Focused.

1048
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,620
No, Guy Another Day.

1049
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,300
Guy Another Day, I think it was.

1050
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,140
Yes.

1051
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,460
And then I have an important Guy Another Day update,

1052
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,500
although I kinda wanna,

1053
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,940
this is called Guy Another Day slash Fieri Walk With Me,

1054
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,580
because I don't wanna lose either one of those.

1055
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,820
They're both very good.

1056
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:12,660
Okay.

1057
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,420
When I was still, this is from All Listener.

1058
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,460
Travis didn't credit them.

1059
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,780
It's from Evan.

1060
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,140
It's Evan G.

1061
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,240
Evan G.

1062
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,300
While I was still in college,

1063
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,420
they opened a Guy Fieri restaurant on campus.

1064
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,540
In December of that year, I think,

1065
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:28,940
Guy Fieri himself came to my college for a book signing.

1066
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:29,780
He wrote a book?

1067
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,620
On a table-

1068
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:31,440
What?

1069
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,280
He's sorry.

1070
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,460
He's published?

1071
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:37,140
On a table behind the one guy was using to sign the book,

1072
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,460
there was a giant ice bucket with a single Heineken in it.

1073
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:41,500
At Guy's command,

1074
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,820
one woman would bring the ice bucket to his signing table.

1075
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,100
He would take a little sip from the Heineken

1076
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,660
and put it back in this ice bucket.

1077
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,340
The woman responsible for the bucket

1078
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,860
would then immediately move it back behind him

1079
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:56,060
and bring it back and forth whenever Guy wanted

1080
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,940
to drink his one single Heineken.

1081
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,540
This is a lot.

1082
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,160
It's a lot to take in.

1083
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:07,500
It's a lot to take in.

1084
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,500
I don't wanna waste any Heine.

1085
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,000
Just one at a time, please.

1086
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,960
So one thing I will say is, okay, I will say this.

1087
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,440
In Guy, in Mr. Fiaty's defense,

1088
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,200
sometimes when you go into situations like this,

1089
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,080
the setup of the situation is not of your own creation,

1090
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,320
but just happens to be whatever the person

1091
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,500
putting the thing together thought would be good.

1092
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,360
So you end up in situations that feel like weird.

1093
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,140
Like we had people when we were shooting our TV show

1094
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:44,640
that would just like run bottles of water up to us sometimes.

1095
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,540
And then we would say like, oh, we could have gotten

1096
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,880
our own water, but thank you very much for doing this.

1097
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,520
So you don't always like, but we would never demanded water

1098
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,200
until later on in shooting.

1099
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,640
We got a little bit more, really big heads.

1100
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,160
But like, maybe he didn't craft this.

1101
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,480
I will say though, that had someone put us

1102
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,740
in this exact scenario, we probably would have said,

1103
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,080
this isn't a great look.

1104
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,680
I would prefer you did not with this.

1105
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,840
Sorry, on the subject of Guy Fieri being published,

1106
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,000
of course he has many cookbooks under his belt.

1107
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,200
And I'd like to read- Seven.

1108
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,280
Yeah, I'd like to read some of them

1109
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,280
because they include Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.

1110
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,360
What's the full title?

1111
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,360
Diners, Drive-ins and Dives,

1112
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,240
an all American road trip with recipes, okay?

1113
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,320
More Diners, Drive-ins and Dives,

1114
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,480
a drop top culinary cruise through America, that's fun.

1115
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,640
Diners- Oh, sorry, Gervin.

1116
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,760
Sorry, Gervin, it's through America's finest

1117
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,040
and funkiest joints.

1118
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,060
You're right, sorry, Travis, it got cut off for me.

1119
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,760
Here's another one, Diners, Drive-ins and Dives,

1120
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,880
the funky finds in Flavortown, America's classic joints

1121
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,080
and killer comfort food, just a lot, just a lot, sir.

1122
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,640
And then sort of, we start paring down just a little bit.

1123
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,560
Guy on Fire, 130 recipes for adventures in outdoor cooking,

1124
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,100
that's a good one.

1125
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:03,280
And then we get Guy Fieri Family Food,

1126
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,160
125 real deal recipes, kitchen tested, home approved,

1127
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,100
is a good one.

1128
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,220
And then we keep going down and down and down,

1129
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,160
sort of the word slide to fun and food with Guy Fieri.

1130
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:20,080
And then finally, we just sort of land on Guy Fieri Food

1131
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,720
is the name of this book.

1132
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:26,040
Well, sorry, Gervin, subtitled Cooking It, Living It,

1133
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,160
Loving It.

1134
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,200
Guy Fieri Food.

1135
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,340
And then just the next one's just gonna be like Guy Food.

1136
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:37,240
And then finally, G-Slop is the final one,

1137
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,200
the final entry.

1138
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,840
These are all available on Amazon.

1139
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,520
You can get the, I'm sorry, six books.

1140
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,060
And then the seventh is the book and DVD bundle.

1141
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,280
And just a word of warning, Guy Fieri Food,

1142
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,280
Cooking It, Living It, Loving It, isn't a cookbook.

1143
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,360
I think it's like a dark and gritty detective novel.

1144
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,920
With himself as the detective,

1145
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,920
and I would read that so fucking hard.

1146
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:01,760
Are you kidding me?

1147
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,160
Yeah.

1148
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,120
Private Guy, Private Guy, Private Guy.

1149
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,920
Private Guy, excellent job.

1150
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,000
It's in food.

1151
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,240
Private Dick would be just, I guess.

1152
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,320
Listen, listen, I don't know that.

1153
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,160
I shouldn't say these things.

1154
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,640
No, he has a very secret dick.

1155
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,480
I understand.

1156
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,200
I've never seen Guy, hey, raise your hands

1157
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,840
if you've seen Guy Fieri's dick.

1158
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,080
I bet it's a pretty small club.

1159
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,480
From scratch, it's the unauthorized history

1160
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,120
of the Food Network, and I'm just entered the guy,

1161
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,800
the dawn of Guy.

1162
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,340
And they said that there's a whole section

1163
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,520
about how he was a little green when he started

1164
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,720
in that he didn't really know what a diner was.

1165
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,840
He thought it was like code for a hamburger restaurant

1166
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,680
because he didn't grow up around a lot of diners.

1167
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,460
And also when he were filling one of the early episodes,

1168
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:52,080
a chef referred to chicken soup as Jewish penicillin,

1169
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,640
and Guy Fieri just lost his fucking mind

1170
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,920
because he thought the chef made that joke up.

1171
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,400
So he was just like losing it

1172
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,420
at this hilarious, hilarious joke.

1173
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,400
So that's been Guy in the Sky slash Fieri Walk With Me

1174
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,000
slash Guy Another Day.

1175
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,760
All right, Justin, do the next question.

1176
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,380
You got it, brother.

1177
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,280
So my friend, we'll call him Oswald,

1178
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,260
has been telling us for the last decade or so

1179
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,960
that he is horribly deathly allergic to red meat

1180
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,700
and that his throat will close up

1181
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,140
and he will die if he consumes any.

1182
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,040
The other day, I walked into the room

1183
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,120
and he was chomping down on some chips and queso.

1184
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,840
The kind of, I know this is a typo

1185
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,040
which we don't normally highlight,

1186
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,840
but the question asker did type

1187
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,680
the kind of quest with beef in it.

1188
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,760
And I know they mean queso, but I prefer that.

1189
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,560
The kind of quest with beef in it.

1190
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,400
When I dive into a bowl of hot peppered cheese,

1191
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,520
it is kind of a quest for me.

1192
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,580
And the reward for that quest is going to be toilet time.

1193
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,160
I checked the container he got the queso in

1194
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:03,160
and it told me it was, in fact, true beef.

1195
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,280
Season three.

1196
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:09,280
With Mark Paul Gosler and Paul Giamatti.

1197
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:11,920
One's a cop.

1198
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,760
The other's a cop.

1199
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,920
They're both by the book.

1200
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,920
Now, are we doing a true blood thing

1201
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,280
or a true detective thing or both?

1202
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,920
Paul Giamatti's a vampire.

1203
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,240
Mark Paul Gosler is also a vampire,

1204
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,900
but very straight laced.

1205
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,700
Super cool.

1206
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,040
Okay, so in fact, he was eating true beef.

1207
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,040
He isn't dead and it has me wondering,

1208
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,040
what the fuck is going on?

1209
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,000
And how would I go about confronting Oswald

1210
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,180
about this weird thing?

1211
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,240
That's from beefing in Baltimore,

1212
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,380
a name that Travis made up.

1213
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,920
Everybody's gotta get the drop on someone.

1214
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,280
Like everyone's, it's an exciting feeling, I know.

1215
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,120
When you think in your mind

1216
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,120
that you have an opportunity to get the drop,

1217
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,760
it's so, it's exciting and I get that.

1218
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,040
But I don't understand necessarily

1219
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:02,720
why you need to like put your buddy on blast.

1220
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,520
I don't know why this is like, oh boy,

1221
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,160
time to really put Oswald in his place.

1222
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,440
Here, okay, here's why,

1223
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,440
just to give the question asker a little bit of credit.

1224
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,320
This isn't like someone saying,

1225
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,360
oh, I'm gluten intolerant.

1226
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,080
And when you really press them about it,

1227
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,280
like they just don't wanna eat bread or whatever,

1228
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,220
but they're just making that.

1229
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:29,260
Why would someone be like, yeah, red meat, it will kill me.

1230
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,100
Okay.

1231
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:33,440
Like why would you say that if it weren't true?

1232
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,960
Maybe you live in a fairly small town

1233
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,640
and your only two restaurant options are Sizzler and BW3s.

1234
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,400
And of course this person wants to go to BW3s

1235
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,680
and get those good hot chicken wings.

1236
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,820
And so this is their thing.

1237
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,680
But that's just a lie.

1238
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,780
Okay.

1239
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,180
Well, maybe they're not allergic to ground beef.

1240
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:52,000
And I don't know, there's a lot of different explanations.

1241
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,880
Do you think once they grind it, sorry,

1242
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,160
they grind it and then it's no longer an allergen?

1243
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,320
Is that what you're suggesting?

1244
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,080
Yeah, it changes sort of the, it lets out whatever,

1245
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,000
you know, carbon dioxide is just sort of released

1246
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,080
when you grind up the meat

1247
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,240
and the carbon dioxide goes up into the atmosphere

1248
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,680
and makes the ozone layer, I think or something.

1249
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,480
This is one of the problems with 20 grifting.

1250
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,680
We didn't really think through it,

1251
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,200
but a lot of people started grifts in 2015,

1252
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,840
but we didn't necessarily have an off ramp

1253
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,440
for all those grifts, you know?

1254
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,360
Some of you might, we told you the con was off,

1255
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,640
but like for many of you,

1256
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,980
the con may still will indeed be on.

1257
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:29,820
Yeah.

1258
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,720
And you just don't know how to get out of it.

1259
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,560
It wasn't like January 1st, 2016,

1260
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,720
people are like, should all the acquaintance be,

1261
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,520
I can eat red meat by the way, got you motherfucker.

1262
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,920
And days of auld lang syne.

1263
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,560
That would have been, by the way,

1264
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,240
you didn't need us to help you find that.

1265
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,260
That would have been amazing.

1266
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,100
That would have been really good.

1267
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:46,920
And you all should have done that.

1268
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,020
If you didn't do that, then it's on you.

1269
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,540
I would like to paint you a picture

1270
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,480
that makes this all make sense to me.

1271
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,040
It's so clear to me now.

1272
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,840
All of the elements have been uncovered

1273
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,640
and I can see everything.

1274
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,400
I see how it all connects.

1275
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,560
What happened was,

1276
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:05,440
someone who did not know Oswald's allergy

1277
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,360
bought him some of the most delicious queso

1278
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,820
they had ever had.

1279
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,940
And Oswald accepts it as a gift

1280
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:15,140
because Oswald was too polite to say,

1281
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,560
are you trying to kill me?

1282
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,480
And there it sat in Oswald's fridge.

1283
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,640
And on the same day this queso was about to expire,

1284
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,280
Oswald realized their EpiPen was also about to expire.

1285
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,840
And they thought, well, let's not let either go to waste.

1286
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:36,540
And so in one hand, chips, in left hand, EpiPen.

1287
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,400
Okay, so you get a good dunk.

1288
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,880
And it would probably be a pretty fucking good dunk,

1289
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,960
I think.

1290
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,480
Like if you need to fucking like,

1291
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,880
if after consuming it,

1292
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,840
you have to also just pop in the bezoar

1293
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,580
to like sort of nullify the meat poisons.

1294
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:57,740
It's probably like a pretty good bite of food, I bet.

1295
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,880
A lot of people pay a lot of money

1296
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,680
to go to like a restaurant that is certified

1297
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,280
to serve you fugu fish.

1298
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,960
And this is like this experience just for like a whopper.

1299
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,020
You know what I mean?

1300
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,160
How much of the whopper would you risk eating

1301
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,040
before you put the EpiPen?

1302
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:19,040
I would try to cram basically the whole kit and caboodle.

1303
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:19,880
As much as I could.

1304
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:20,720
Yeah.

1305
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,400
Why would you lie about being?

1306
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,740
Maybe they don't know.

1307
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,560
Maybe they don't know.

1308
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,680
Maybe they were, fucking,

1309
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,700
Rachel went to the doctor when she was like seven

1310
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,160
and they were like, she was sick with something.

1311
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,000
And they're like, oh, well,

1312
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,800
it's because you can't ever have a chocolate.

1313
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,000
And so for like fucking 14 years,

1314
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,140
like Halloween's no chocolate, no candy.

1315
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,440
Like she would go and go trick or treating.

1316
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,400
And I guess just throw it all in the dumpster or something.

1317
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,700
And then like when she was 20, they're like,

1318
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:48,880
oh, nope, guess we wanged it.

1319
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,720
You can have chocolate

1320
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,280
and you could have had chocolate this whole time.

1321
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,480
And maybe this person was told they can't have red meat.

1322
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,400
So they just didn't eat red meat for a long time.

1323
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,040
This is a great, you have great news for them.

1324
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,080
Great news.

1325
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,360
Beef it up.

1326
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,120
Go beef crazy.

1327
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,640
This is, you get to be the messenger

1328
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,200
for probably the best news this person will ever receive

1329
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,160
in their entire life, which is go have a beef party.

1330
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,920
You've earned it.

1331
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,200
Do you think there could be something

1332
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,160
in the melted cheese that like neutralizes the toxins?

1333
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,800
Oh, Jesus, Travis.

1334
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,020
Yes, definitely.

1335
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:20,960
Jesus, Travis, of course.

1336
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,960
I'm a scientist.

1337
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,680
No, yes, you are though.

1338
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,520
There's a tick called the Lone Star Tick

1339
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,760
that if it bites you,

1340
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,960
you can develop an allergy to red meat.

1341
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,360
Horrible news.

1342
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,200
Thank you for that one.

1343
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,180
I've never heard such a thing.

1344
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,840
So keep, I guess, I guess I just said that

1345
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,760
so you would know it.

1346
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,760
So keep your head on a fucking swivel, I guess.

1347
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,640
And be sure to interview ticks

1348
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,600
to make sure they're not that kind

1349
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,960
because that would sure be the pits, huh?

1350
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,800
You know what?

1351
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,620
Allergies are weird though.

1352
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,680
Allergies can come and go.

1353
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,520
You never know.

1354
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,880
Oh, wait, hold on, hold on, Justin, hold on.

1355
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,720
Griffin, sit back.

1356
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,720
This is Justin's tight five on allergies.

1357
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,560
Hold on, let him go.

1358
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,380
Okay, here we go, Justin.

1359
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,220
Sorry, go nuts.

1360
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,060
Let me just tell you guys a little something

1361
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,080
that I co-host a medical history podcast called Salvo.

1362
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,440
So I'm half a doctor pretty much.

1363
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,120
And let me just say that like refuse to have allergies.

1364
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,480
This is what I'm saying to you.

1365
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,880
Do not let yourself be bound by your allergies.

1366
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,360
Just refuse to have them.

1367
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,780
I used to be allergic to cats

1368
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:18,840
and I wanted a sweet cat of my own, of my very own.

1369
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,880
You know what I did?

1370
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,280
I just decided to not be allergic anymore.

1371
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,020
And today I'm here to tell you

1372
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,720
that I'm not allergic to cats anymore.

1373
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:29,040
And I cured myself from my allergies by inspiration.

1374
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,760
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1375
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,760
A lot of people lie to you

1376
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,480
and say you can cure your allergies with diet

1377
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,120
and different things like that

1378
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,180
or crystals or whatever, herbs.

1379
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:43,160
I love every time we take one step closer to having a cult.

1380
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,600
I love it.

1381
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,120
It makes me feel like we're finally doing something.

1382
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,240
How many cults started as a joke

1383
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,840
and then people just kept coming

1384
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,200
and then they're like, I guess we need guns.

1385
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,400
Cause this is getting very, this got very real.

1386
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,440
There's 30 of us.

1387
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,280
I guess we need guns.

1388
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,280
We should get guns.

1389
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,620
Can I do one last yahoo real quick?

1390
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,080
We're running pretty long.

1391
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,200
Oh my God, my desk is tilted 45 degrees sideways.

1392
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,540
Justin, we've only been recording for 20 minutes.

1393
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,380
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

1394
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:14,080
Don't fuck with me right now, please.

1395
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,920
It's not like this.

1396
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,720
I just had to change my clock on my computer

1397
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,040
cause it was three hours slow.

1398
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:20,880
Oh geez.

1399
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,720
Oh God.

1400
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,800
Real quick, this is a level 9,000

1401
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,020
yahoo juju Davenport joint.

1402
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,040
So you know it's gonna be good.

1403
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,320
It's from yahoo answers user dedicated to evolution

1404
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,920
who asks, when you go to the bathroom in a movie theater,

1405
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,600
can you ask a stranger what you missed?

1406
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,040
Now let's pretend that run P is an app that doesn't exist

1407
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,840
and hasn't solved this problem for us.

1408
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,120
But when I read this, I guess they're talking about

1409
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,480
just you pop back into the theater

1410
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,960
and you sit down next to somebody who's like,

1411
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:45,800
hey, what happened?

1412
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,240
And I think that's unacceptable.

1413
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,320
You do that shit in the draft house

1414
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,920
and you get sent the fuck home.

1415
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,920
I think there could be an attendant.

1416
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,040
This is the only sort of bathroom attendant

1417
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,000
sort of situation that I would be cool with

1418
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,200
where you go in, you use the potty

1419
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,440
and then you go and you're washing your hands.

1420
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,280
And while you're washing your hands,

1421
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,720
you're like, okay, so what did I miss?

1422
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,440
And say you were seeing a rival

1423
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,480
and it's just like Amy Adams and Hawkeye,

1424
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,560
they had a conversation in the dark.

1425
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,400
All right, cool.

1426
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,920
Thank you.

1427
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,960
I do wanna point out.

1428
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,760
I love this, but I do wanna point out

1429
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,440
this would require a human being

1430
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,600
to know concurrently what's happening

1431
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,800
in every movie at the same time.

1432
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,640
Yeah, no, they would memorize.

1433
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:24,560
What are you seeing?

1434
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,680
You're seeing Logan.

1435
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,400
Okay, the 745 showing.

1436
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,720
So right now, all right.

1437
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,560
Yeah.

1438
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,400
Okay, let me think about it.

1439
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,680
Let me play it in my mind palace.

1440
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,120
And okay, I think I'm pretty sure Professor X

1441
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,640
and Wolverine just had a conversation in the dark.

1442
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,440
Yeah, I would much prefer they would.

1443
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,680
Why is it always that?

1444
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,840
Cause half of every movie that comes out

1445
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,080
and I've been watching a lot of movies

1446
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,600
cause I've just been consuming a lot of content

1447
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,920
cause I live at home forever now.

1448
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,240
It's just half of all movies.

1449
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,320
It's just conversations in the dark now.

1450
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,920
And I saw a rival and it was like,

1451
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,600
most of that movie was just people having dark room convos.

1452
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,480
So.

1453
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,280
Have you guys also gotten very aware of movies being,

1454
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,720
as long as we're talking about this,

1455
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,560
since you've had babies,

1456
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,680
have you become very aware of movies

1457
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,240
that are unable to properly mix sound and dialogue?

1458
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,520
Oh my God in heaven.

1459
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,480
It's just fucking Amy Adams is like, I don't know.

1460
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,200
I don't know how to have a communication with these aliens.

1461
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,840
And Jeremy Renner's like, yeah, I know, it's weird, isn't it?

1462
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,160
Just shouting and yelling at Amy Adams.

1463
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,960
There's a space explosion.

1464
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,800
Yeah.

1465
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,360
I've been rewatching West Wing

1466
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,840
and every episode ends like the most dramatic

1467
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,280
and everyone's like, yeah, we're going to war.

1468
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,600
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1469
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,560
Blazing, Twin Peaks is the worst about it.

1470
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:44,600
Twin Peaks is like very quiet, like Agent Dale Cooper.

1471
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,840
And then we did solve the mystery.

1472
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,000
And then like the sound of the devil.

1473
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,840
Yeah.

1474
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,280
Blah, this is screaming.

1475
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,720
It's like, well, this is pretty spooky,

1476
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,760
but mainly because I have to watch it with a toddler now.

1477
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,760
Thank you, David.

1478
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,200
I think it'd be better if the usher in the bathroom

1479
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,720
just pulled open his vest

1480
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,720
and he had a small screen in there

1481
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,960
and it was just sinked to wherever you left off.

1482
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,920
That would be better and more believable, I think, to me.

1483
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,920
If you could just pull open his vest

1484
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,640
and there was a screen for you to continue watching the film.

1485
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,760
This is a thing that I've actually,

1486
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,040
in live theaters, I've seen before,

1487
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,800
that one, there's a screen out in the lobby,

1488
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,180
but also I've seen or heard, rather,

1489
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:25,120
they pipe the sound through the bathroom.

1490
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,080
So while you're in the bathroom,

1491
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,440
you can still hear the play going on.

1492
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,640
See, I could have used this when we first,

1493
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,320
you remember when we first saw Hamilton

1494
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,680
and I very much, very almost nearly did shit my pants

1495
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:37,720
during it,

1496
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,920
because I did not want to miss a second

1497
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,320
of our friend Len's good play.

1498
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,000
And so, I just, He worked very hard on it.

1499
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,760
He worked really, really hard on it.

1500
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,360
And so like, by the time Battle Yorktown rolled around,

1501
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,000
my world was almost turned upside down.

1502
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,140
And I was very much, My underwear was turned inside out.

1503
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:59,720
The shorts turned inside out.

1504
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,120
But I was very much like, okay, yeah,

1505
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,020
can we please just beat the British already?

1506
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,760
Go, do it.

1507
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,040
Here's machine guns.

1508
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,640
Here's machine guns, just go.

1509
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,560
We got to sneak up on them and reconnoitre the hills.

1510
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,240
And then we're going to come up with a plan.

1511
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,440
No, just shoot them up, please.

1512
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,960
I don't want to be the first person

1513
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:26,560
to ever shit their pants at Hamilton, please.

1514
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,920
You wouldn't have been Griffin, don't worry.

1515
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,280
Please hurry up.

1516
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,440
Mr. Washington, I'm not sure we can do it.

1517
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,960
You can, trust you on this one.

1518
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,320
And then we won the war.

1519
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,060
Oh, thank God, time for your intermission.

1520
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:41,640
Now, here's what we did after the war.

1521
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:45,360
Please, please, please, please, God, please.

1522
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,560
No, come on, please.

1523
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,760
This has been our comedy podcast,

1524
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,400
my brother, my brother, and me.

1525
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,320
If you have some free time,

1526
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,640
we have so many delightful offerings for you.

1527
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,920
I guested on Court Appointed,

1528
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:06,880
which is a legal show explaining the law.

1529
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,880
I guested, it was sort of a co-branded episode

1530
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,440
with another show I do, Sawbones.

1531
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:19,020
And it was about HIPAA and patient privacy.

1532
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,280
That show's called Court Appointed.

1533
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,480
You can find it on iTunes.

1534
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,680
Also, the Grifster and I did something really fun.

1535
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:28,040
We appeared on a YouTube show called Drawfee.

1536
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:31,360
It's D-R-A-W-F-E-E.

1537
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,440
And we helped create the hottest new board game.

1538
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,680
And it's really fun as we sort of created it

1539
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:39,720
with the Drawfee fellas.

1540
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,840
They drew our dumb board game idea,

1541
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:46,080
which is actually a really sick board game idea, by the by.

1542
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:50,700
But just check YouTube for Drawfee and you'll find it.

1543
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,200
As long as you're on YouTube,

1544
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:57,060
I also, my friend and co-host of Trends Like These, Brent,

1545
01:03:57,060 --> 01:04:00,160
has made a party game called Use Your Words.

1546
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:04,480
And me and Tybee and some friends and Brent played it

1547
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,120
when he was in town visiting me.

1548
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,840
And we filmed the whole thing

1549
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,040
and he did some Q and A's in there.

1550
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,040
So you can see us play the game and try it out.

1551
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,800
Just go to his YouTube channel, Brentlefloss,

1552
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,920
and you can find it there.

1553
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,960
It was super fun.

1554
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,920
It's coming out soon.

1555
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,400
Use your words.

1556
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,860
And he hasn't asked me to plug this or anything.

1557
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,480
I'm just very proud of him and of the product.

1558
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,400
And it's really good.

1559
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,820
And of course, you can also check out

1560
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:32,840
my film review series, Carry On.

1561
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,920
Oh, Jesus.

1562
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,640
Still stuck at episode two.

1563
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,000
I need to record episode three.

1564
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,880
It's hard to get over that hump, man.

1565
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,720
It really is.

1566
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,840
What was episode two?

1567
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,320
Episode two was Copper Mountain,

1568
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,880
a two-hander with Jim Carrey and Alan Thicke

1569
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,700
that contains very little story.

1570
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,760
And it's mostly, it's actually called

1571
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,920
Copper Mountain Club Med Adventure,

1572
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,360
or Club Med Experience.

1573
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,000
Are you shitting me?

1574
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:56,820
I am not.

1575
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:00,520
It is both movie and infomercial for Club Med.

1576
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:04,040
It contains nine different musical numbers

1577
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,600
in a 45-minute long made-for-TV movie.

1578
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,020
Oh, boy.

1579
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:09,900
It is a real treat.

1580
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,600
You can watch all our shit at McElroyShows.com.

1581
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:13,860
We have all our podcasts and stuff there.

1582
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:14,700
You can also go to-

1583
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:15,520
I put Carry On?

1584
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,360
I don't know.

1585
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,200
You should.

1586
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,220
I think maybe once you get to three apps,

1587
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,960
you can put it on McElroyShows.com.

1588
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:20,800
Yeah.

1589
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,640
I'm really close.

1590
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,680
Actually, a listener sent me the next four movies.

1591
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,720
So I have them all sitting next to me.

1592
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,720
Well, don't please.

1593
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,000
Don't spoil what they're gonna be

1594
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,880
or talk about Carry On anymore.

1595
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:32,720
Okay.

1596
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,080
This is a film-by-film review of Jim Carrey's career.

1597
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:39,120
It's a very exciting new property.

1598
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,360
You can also go to MaximumFun.org

1599
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,240
and check out all the great shows on MaximumFun.org.

1600
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,160
And we're gonna be talking a lot about Maximum Fun

1601
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,400
over the next couple of weeks during the Max Fun Drive,

1602
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,280
which kicks off Monday, March 20th and runs for two weeks.

1603
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,720
And we're so happy to be a part of this network

1604
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,680
and I'm so grateful to all of you for helping support it.

1605
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,960
I also wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1606
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:58,880
for the use of our theme song

1607
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,720
as a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1608
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,840
Juice, you got to hang out on that big, beautiful ocean

1609
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,680
with John Roderick.

1610
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:09,360
Yes, never enough time, but he's a solid dude as always.

1611
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,920
He's the best dude.

1612
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:11,960
Anything else?

1613
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,400
Yeah, we also should say, one,

1614
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,280
we have a TV show on see-so.com.

1615
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,760
If you haven't already checked that out.

1616
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,440
They're constantly, like every Monday,

1617
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,040
putting up new bonus content.

1618
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,960
The deleted scenes, or was it the bloopers?

1619
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,240
The bloopers for episode two is 17 minutes long.

1620
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,560
It's a lot.

1621
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,880
But, so check that out, see-so.com.

1622
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,880
And then also, we're gonna be in Portland this weekend

1623
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,640
doing a show. Oh shit, yeah, fuck.

1624
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,680
I can't believe that's now.

1625
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,000
So if you're gonna be at the show

1626
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,160
and you want us to do a question,

1627
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,640
make sure you email it to us with Portland Show

1628
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,880
in the subject line.

1629
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,520
And just to be clear, we didn't organize this show,

1630
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,360
so we're not sure about like meet and greet

1631
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,600
or anything like that.

1632
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,120
So we can't promise anything,

1633
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,980
but we are gonna have posters made at the show.

1634
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,200
Well, they'll be made before.

1635
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,700
They're not gonna be like printers running

1636
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:00,180
while we do our unique brand of comedy up on stage.

1637
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:01,020
Yeah.

1638
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:02,340
And that's done for us by Emily,

1639
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:05,120
who is at Corrupted Jim on Twitter.

1640
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:05,960
They're really great.

1641
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,800
They're really great. I'm very excited.

1642
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:07,800
Yeah, I can't wait.

1643
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,900
You want that final?

1644
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,080
Hell yeah.

1645
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,800
Sent in by a couple folks, actually.

1646
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,440
Level9000, YajuJuju Davenport, and Christopher Lockhart.

1647
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,280
Thank you both.

1648
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:20,640
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Stevan, asks,

1649
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:25,360
will the Loch Ness monster get into Christian heaven?

1650
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,680
Yes!

1651
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:27,520
Yes!

1652
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,360
Yes!

1653
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,560
When he was Justin McElroy.

1654
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,480
I'm Travis McElroy.

1655
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,760
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1656
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,000
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1657
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,300
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

1658
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:41,300
Hey, good girls, do you wanna just say hey, I wanna?

1659
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:44,620
Do you wanna just say hey, I wanna?

1660
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:55,500
Maximumfun.org.

1661
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,620
Comedy and culture, artist owned.

1662
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:58,820
Listener supported.

1663
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:00,780
Hey, Ben.

1664
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:01,600
What's that, Adam?

1665
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,660
Maximum Fun has asked us to make a new promo,

1666
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:04,940
and I think the best way to do it

1667
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:06,700
is to tell people what our show's about.

1668
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:07,940
Oh, that's pretty easy.

1669
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:10,380
The Greatest Generation is a hybrid podcast

1670
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:12,100
that guarantees you a good night's sleep

1671
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:15,660
with a combination of both latex foam and memory foam.

1672
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:18,020
No, it's actually a show that allows you

1673
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,940
to skip the post office by printing out your own postage.

1674
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:23,760
No, it is a podcast that allows you to design websites

1675
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,100
by using award-winning templates.

1676
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,860
Ben, it is most definitely not that.

1677
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:30,180
The Greatest Generation is a Star Trek podcast

1678
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:31,660
by two guys who are a little bit embarrassed

1679
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:32,980
to have a Star Trek podcast.

1680
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:35,860
New episodes come out every week on Maximum Fun

1681
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:40,860
or wherever you download podcasts.
