1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:40,880
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:53,520
We're coming to you today. We're coming to you today. So loud. So loud. Shhh.

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:02,400
Quieter still? Yeah. Ow, ow, ow. Travis, drink this oyster water. Thank you. Hello, everybody.

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Welcome. Welcome. Shhh. Welcome to my brother, my brother and me. It's an advice show about quiet

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:18,000
people for quiet people who don't make a ruckus and don't turn on the light. For the love of God,

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,640
just leave it off. I know it's dark in here. Sit down on this futon and relax. Oh, my nose is

11
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:32,080
bleeding. Oh, God. Oh, that's bad. That's bad. It's green. That's not normal. That's the worst.

12
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,560
That's the worst, yet authentic. That's a lot of food coloring in your diet you had to put in there.

13
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,880
I am wearing five sleep masks. So loud. Sorry, sorry, sorry. So loud. Sorry. Please,

14
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:53,280
just can we all just be quiet? It's the day after St. Patrick's Day and Travis and Griffin

15
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,480
are really hungover. And I'm sort of hungover because I was cleaning up pet stains all night

16
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:08,480
with my new spot bot by Bissell. So I guess we all had pretty crazy nights. This is an

17
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,760
advice show for the modern era. I guess our first piece of advice is don't- Don't drink.

18
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,160
Don't ever drink. Don't drink. Don't drink ever again. I had six sore teeth last night.

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,040
No, Griffin, no. Six of them. Bartrand was just like, you want any more? And I said,

20
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,120
yes, one more. And I did that five times after the first one. I had eight baby makers. Oh,

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,160
wowsers. Oh, wowsers. That's the one that actually has turpentine in it, doesn't it?

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:44,160
Yep. It's like a Boilermaker, but you drop in a shot of turpentine. Yikes. Yeah, I was only

23
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:53,520
supposed to use one third parts pet stain remover to water. And I said, what if I did half and half?

24
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,360
You said these are some hearty stains. And you burned right through your carpet.

25
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, no, I mean, I drank it. Right. Yeah. But no, no, I did. I did really eradicated,

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,120
really eradicated the pet odor. CJ's got some hearty piss. I've always said that.

27
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,320
Gotta go industrial on that shit. Well, and she did drink yesterday. Oh, I see. Yeah. So she-

28
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,160
Oh, this is not a goof. I feel like dog shit. Well, I'm goof- Travis, how do you feel?

29
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,520
I actually feel great. I went for a walk this morning. I went out in the sun.

30
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,800
I felt great. I sprung out of bed with a spring in my step, sat down, played some Mass Effect 3,

31
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,200
and then I felt great. And I burped, and that burped turned into a throw up. And I was like,

32
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,880
what? You burped. But I felt great, body.

33
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,040
It's the older- Cindy gets this. It's passed down on her mother's side of the family. They call it

34
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:59,680
the Meadows Reversal. You wake up feeling good, and then oopsies. It's done in reverse. Anyway,

35
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,840
this is an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your

36
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,280
middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Griffin, these footprints

37
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,160
in the sand will be where Travis and I carried you. Yeah. I don't know how sick you are. We're

38
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,320
going to help with the chuckles. If you vomit on my jacket, I will leave you on the beach. Vomit

39
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,280
on my sandals. This place on the beach where you are sleeping is where we left you because you

40
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,880
vomited on Travis. Because you threw up on my Sweet Members Only jacket, and I left you behind.

41
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,040
We paid a hobo $3. And then when the tide came in, he pulled you off the beach a bit,

42
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,480
and he stole your jacket. These drag marks are where he dragged you. These drag marks are where

43
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:48,320
he dragged you. Does the dookie stay? He's homeless. I don't know. He's had a rough life.

44
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,240
Listen, he's a vet. He gave everything. Some gave all, all gave some. He's played by Danny Trejo.

45
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:05,040
He is played by Danny Trejo. Danny Trejo's finest acting role was as the homeless man who drug me

46
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,720
in a story that Justin and Griffin made up about me.

47
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,080
Can we start the show so that we can be done with the show soon?

48
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,200
So you can go die? Yeah. Your last will and testament will be this program?

49
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,600
Yes. I have two really good friends, and they both have girlfriends, and I feel left out.

50
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:32,080
People, have we helped you too much? While the universe itself continues to put questions into

51
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,760
the Yahoo Answers system that are both terrifying and wonderful, I feel like our listeners don't

52
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,040
need us as much as they used to. We get questions that are easy, easy stuff.

53
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,000
But I like this. It's a nice slow ball to kind of get us past St. Patrick's Day.

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,200
Okay, yeah. We'll start. We'll warm up. I have two really good friends, and they both have

55
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,040
girlfriends, and I feel left out. What should I do? Get yourself a girlfriend.

56
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,680
Get a girlfriend. See, that was an easy one.

57
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:11,360
Wait, hold on. You guys. See, this is... 96 episodes ago, this is the caliber of advice

58
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,880
that we were handing out, but we've come so far. Holy shit, our 100th episode is getting up very

59
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,960
soon. And then we cash it in. We've come so far, we've got to come at it like a raptor,

60
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,920
like two raptors. Pince it. Give it the pincer. What if I told this guy, or girl,

61
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,200
guy, well, I don't know, either way, you got to get new friends.

62
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,000
Okay. How about that? Or a whole new life.

63
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,000
Like witness protection kind of thing. Okay.

64
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,200
Wait a minute, that seems drastic. In this modern world, you got to take drastic steps for results.

65
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,880
I don't know. I feel like the witness protection program...

66
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,440
Oh, the third wheel protection program.

67
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,600
Yeah. There's a mystique to the witness protection program,

68
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,920
because we've all thought about in some point during our lives, usually during middle school,

69
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,960
like, everything's awful. What if I could just start over?

70
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,400
Witness protection program will give you that kind of service.

71
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,560
I think that maybe as we move into the next era, My Brother, My Brother and Me 2.0,

72
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,240
that kicks off with episode 100. When we go public.

73
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,400
When we go public. We do our IPO.

74
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,320
IPO, yeah. Maybe the new pack your bags and move away is pack your bags and inform on the mob,

75
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,400
because then that's a clean start. It doesn't matter. How many of your good friends have

76
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,920
girlfriends? Hey, have you considered trying to split them up like in a Jennifer Aniston movie?

77
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,400
This is great. Give it to Janiston.

78
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,600
Give it to Janiston. Go find one girl. Sleep with the guy. Wait, hold on.

79
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,840
What messes up? This isn't good advice.

80
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,440
Sleep with both guys.

81
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,360
Turn into a Rupert Everett movie. Pit the couples against each other.

82
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,440
Oh, my God. End up double there.

83
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,200
Oh, my God. Hunger Games.

84
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,920
Hunger Games for your love. Here's what you should do. Here's what is easy.

85
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,640
This is a way better answer to your problem. Hunger Games.

86
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:23,680
Have you considered Hunger Games? Hunger Games is the new pack your bags and inform on the mafia,

87
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,080
because if you have Hunger Games- Pack your bags, eat your friends.

88
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,320
Pack your bags and eat your friends. I don't think that's what happens in

89
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,920
the Hunger Games. I've never read it,

90
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,240
but I assume it's a lot about cannibalism. Fuck, I'm hungry. Let's play Monopoly.

91
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,240
Winner take all. Winner take all your bones. Winner take all the bites.

92
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:48,560
So if you eat their girlfriends- Then you've won. You've won the Hunger Games.

93
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,560
Here's a medal. That is the way the Hunger

94
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,360
Games are played. What a weird fucking board game.

95
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,200
What is this movie rated? It seems unseemly.

96
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,480
I watched Woody Harrelson eat Staley Tucci and he unhinged his jaw and swallowed him whole.

97
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,600
Is Tucci and Harrelson really in it? Oh, yeah, the Tucci's lose.

98
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,560
The Tucci's lose. The Tucci's fully loose in Hunger Games.

99
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,040
Woody Harrelson plays- Well, I'm not going to let in on how much

100
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,840
Hunger Games insight I have, but- Have you read the books, haven't you?

101
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,560
All of them, baby. And here's the thing,

102
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Travis is on the money. Yeah?

103
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,520
It's all about cannibalism. I knew it.

104
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Yeah, Woody Harrelson plays the drunken tutor of the lead lady,

105
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,520
and Stanley Tucci is sort of the talk show host that makes her a star.

106
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,680
All right. And then they eat each other?

107
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,080
Well, yeah, Woody Harrelson unhinges his jaw. Now, Griffin, I don't want you to be scared.

108
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,720
It's all special effects. Because the twist is,

109
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,720
as Woody Harrelson is eating Stanley Tucci, Stanley Tucci is eating Woody Harrelson.

110
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,160
Right from the inside out. And here's the weird thing.

111
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,400
You remember Coach, the original bartender on Cheers?

112
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,040
He finds a baby one inside Woody Harrelson's belly.

113
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,720
Wow. Yeah, apparently,

114
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,560
Woody Harrelson ate Coach on Cheers, and that's how he got to be famous.

115
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,360
I see. So, Tucci goes on a fantastic adventure

116
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,240
inside of Woody Harrelson? Right.

117
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,560
Have you seen Innerspace? I've seen Innerspace.

118
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,400
It's like that, but what if they didn't shrink?

119
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,560
You could just see Stanley Tucci's weird bald head poking out from the

120
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,200
distended belly of Woody Harrelson. That's like three fourths of the Hunger Games,

121
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,960
right there. That scene.

122
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,320
We need a retroactive spoiler warning, retroactively.

123
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,440
Retroactive spoiler warning. We spoiled your life by talking about this,

124
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,320
and we're sorry. So, I guess that should solve your problems.

125
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,840
Guys, I have a handful of choice, just dank Yahoos.

126
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,840
This one was sent in by Tim. Thank you, Tim. It's by Yahoo Answers user,

127
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:07,120
Anatolia Monster, who asks, Monsters, what do to for Lady Gaga's birthday?

128
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,680
What? Mother Monster's birthday is approaching.

129
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,960
Have you decided what to do to celebrate? I'm planning on making a video for her,

130
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,600
even if she won't see it. Have you got any better ideas?

131
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,920
We've got 10 days to Lady Gaga's birthday, and I haven't made her a goddamn thing.

132
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,760
Why do you know that? What?

133
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,360
What? Why do you know that?

134
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,520
How could you know that? It, because I remember it,

135
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,960
it's pretty easy to, it's not like I'm a super fan or anything, it's pretty easy to remember.

136
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:49,680
I have tickets to the Monsters Ball on June 19th, and that's exactly 87 days after her birthday.

137
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,840
So that, it's pretty easy to remember when you're using that, when you're using that metric, you know?

138
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:00,640
Do you read the Hunger Games at the Lady Gaga party out loud?

139
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,320
She projects them on a screen.

140
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,840
There ain't no reason for me to eat Stanley Touche tonight, baby.

141
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,560
Come on, Woody Harrelson.

142
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,000
If that were true, I would, I would get the whole Lady Gaga thing, finally.

143
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,400
Finally. She sits there and reads Hunger Games to you.

144
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,520
I get it. Additional details. I was asking little monsters only.

145
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,840
As opposed to like, medium average monster? Like, what?

146
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,840
Well, like the Lady Gaga fans come in three distinct size sets.

147
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,720
You got little monsters.

148
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,920
Starting with Savage.

149
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,520
Which is, it's actually exclusively for Savage. Fuck, I feel bad.

150
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,440
I'm gonna drink some water.

151
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,400
Okay.

152
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,840
You got medium monsters.

153
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,520
Now, what is a media monster? Like, what does that entail?

154
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,480
You ever just look at a person and you learn their name, and then you look at someone else to,

155
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,320
like, have a conversation, and you immediately forget the face and name of the person you were

156
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,520
just talking to?

157
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,080
Uh-huh.

158
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,520
That's a medium monster.

159
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,160
Got it.

160
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,660
Okay.

161
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,920
And then there's huge monsters, which is fat people.

162
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,400
Okay.

163
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,680
Which actually makes up 89% of the population.

164
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,200
Okay. Which actually makes up 89% of the Lady Gaga fan base, which is interesting enough.

165
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,480
So, yeah, you slot in one of those three, and then you know,

166
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,400
you know, like, which monster union you belong to.

167
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,120
Mm-hmm. Now, the title monster, is that like a self-imposed thing by the fans?

168
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,240
Are they like, we are monsters? Because I agree.

169
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:43,360
Um, no, she's actually, uh, she is actually Chupacabra.

170
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,200
Right. She is Chupacabra made woman.

171
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,520
Yes.

172
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,040
She's been given a, basically-

173
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,920
Well, that, that is-

174
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,960
Tape on the woman's body.

175
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:58,160
That's one of the powers that Chupacabra brings to the table, is lady transformation.

176
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,720
That's why they get-

177
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,680
Look at the lip.

178
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,960
That's right. That's how it gets you.

179
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:07,200
And also, can eat just piles of lettuce. Just disappears.

180
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,560
You try to leave it around her, and it's like, whoop, gone.

181
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,560
Travis, I want to get into something. What is your, what would you say is your,

182
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,880
what's your beef with Gaga? What is, what's your problem?

183
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:26,240
Well, my issue is this. I have no problem with, like, the persona of Lady Gaga.

184
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,840
I have a problem with that she is Lady Gaga all the time. Like-

185
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,360
You know that. You're not at her house. You're not watching The Bachelor with her.

186
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah.

187
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,640
I can't believe that she's not. I can't believe she goes home and, like,

188
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,240
takes off a funky wig, and she's like, whoo! What a day!

189
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,280
Takes off her-

190
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,760
She-

191
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,880
Takes off her bacon dress.

192
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,920
That's the face. You only get that face of her. That's-

193
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,520
Momma Monster is a character that she is playing, right? And when she's at home-

194
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,920
See, I don't think that's true. I think that she has serious, like, psychological issues.

195
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,040
Like, I worry for her.

196
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,360
You're leveling some heady, dank flames on Momma Monster.

197
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,480
Serious stuff.

198
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,560
I worry for her. I'm concerned.

199
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,240
Momma, Lady Gaga is her public face, and you only get to see her public face.

200
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,720
Because Travis, you're a lot of things-

201
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,520
When she's Mrs. Gaga.

202
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,600
You're not her, you're not her close friend. When she goes home, she's just deaf.

203
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:24,320
Eatin' cookie dough, watchin' The Bachelor. She's just deaf. Normal, normal stuff.

204
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,680
And her studio apartment.

205
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,040
When I'm gonna get her for her birthday, is I'm going to

206
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,040
convert Travis into a real monster.

207
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:44,320
Which is the highest level of Lady Gaga fandom, is the ah, real monster.

208
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,440
That's it. I have no problem with the music.

209
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,560
It's that I just don't like-

210
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,360
Got a heart, don't you? You have two ears? Of course.

211
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,840
Yahoo! Insta's user, Carl Walker, responded to the query of what due to for Lady Gaga's birthday.

212
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:10,240
And he said, I will probably go to the bathroom, and take a dump, and watch some TV, and then sleep.

213
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,720
You know, actually live instead of freaking over a person that I'll never meet.

214
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:22,400
That guy's like the fourth brother. He's like an honorary brother right now.

215
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:30,400
Me? I'm gonna go to the factory, I'm gonna make some salt, and I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna

216
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,560
watch The Bachelor with Steph, who is my wife in real life, and not Lady Gaga.

217
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,960
Now, Justin, first of all, I love that fiction that you're spinning.

218
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,080
Second of all-

219
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,640
That's what her husband does. He works at a salt factory.

220
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,880
Lady Gaga's husband works at a salt factory?

221
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,520
Yes, now-

222
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,320
Mr. Gaga.

223
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,920
Lord Gaga.

224
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,080
Should Lord Gaga do something for her birthday? Probably.

225
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,720
I mean, Steph has the same birthday as Lady Gaga.

226
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,880
Take her out to TGI Fridays or something.

227
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,560
Is he the daddy monster?

228
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,600
Yeah.

229
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,560
Yeah, yeah.

230
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,240
I mean, I like this idea of like a Bernstein Bears thing going on.

231
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,920
Yeah, there's so many different levels of Lady Gaga fandom. That's the hardest thing,

232
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,360
is like, fans will have these squabbles, these inter-monster squabbles, and it's like,

233
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,560
I thought we had this all situated, but I guess we gotta get the sorting hat back out,

234
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,120
and figure out what kind of monsters everybody is.

235
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,320
I just love her music. I don't know what to say. Love her music.

236
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,400
What's not to love?

237
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:40,240
Just love her music. Pulse- pulse pounding, rhythms, all the beats. Miracle fancy.

238
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:47,280
Hey, my girlfriend and I recently got engaged, and we're looking for out-of-the-box wedding

239
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,400
venue ideas that are relatively cheap. Both of us want a short,

240
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,640
non-church related ceremony and a cool reception.

241
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,840
So you don't want your wedding to count?

242
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,800
Yeah, you don't want Jesus to recognize your marriage? That's fine. We are thinking

243
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,760
March of next year, and since we live in the deep south, something outdoor is easily an option.

244
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,760
Help us, brothers!

245
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,880
Don't do an outdoor wedding.

246
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:09,680
No.

247
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,440
In Louisiana. Don't do an outdoor wedding. What if it rains? How's that?

248
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,000
It will rain.

249
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah. You ever see- you ever see November rain? You ever see that video? How'd that-

250
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,200
how'd that squeak out? How'd that go? Axl Rose died, that's how. Got shot or something,

251
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,560
or some plates fell on him. I don't remember the video very well.

252
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,360
It ended poorly.

253
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,840
It did not go well. In the cold November rain.

254
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,880
McDonald's Play Place?

255
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,280
Now, what are the advantages there?

256
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,880
Uh, it's a wide selection of ring bears.

257
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,440
Ball pit.

258
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:53,120
It's a honeymoon suite built right in. Just drape some tarp over it and go to town.

259
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,400
Travis, I like the idea of dragooning toddlers into your wedding.

260
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,560
You, you're the priest now.

261
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,840
You, you've been conscripted. You're my best man. What's your name?

262
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,520
Ralph?

263
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,480
You're my best-

264
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,360
You got an old man name. Come here. Hold this ring. I'm so nervous, Ralph.

265
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,400
Don't put it in your mouth.

266
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,280
Ralph, talk me through this.

267
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,680
Freaking out, Ralph.

268
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,720
Freaking out. I'm gonna bolt.

269
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,760
Ralph, your hair is so slippery from cheeseburger grease. Can you hold these rings?

270
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,200
What'd you get? Is it- Ralph, did you give me a McGriddle ring?

271
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,320
You're always there for me, Ralph.

272
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,120
You're always there for me. You're right. I love Susan so much.

273
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,360
Oh, shit. I don't have a wife. You, come here.

274
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,400
Ralph, what's your name?

275
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,840
What's your name? Sislegal? Probably not.

276
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:49,680
Wait, is her name Sislegal? Why would she be named Sislegal? No one has ever been named that.

277
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,640
I said, is this legal? Not Sislegal.

278
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,840
Come here, Smeagol. I love you. How old are you? Six? Fuck.

279
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,480
Oh, well. You want some fries?

280
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,120
I gotta get my green card. That's all there is to it.

281
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm marrying one of you little kids today.

282
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,280
One of you is about to be a seven-year-old divorcee with a Canadian husband,

283
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,360
a Canadian ex. I promise I will let you live your life.

284
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,000
Which one of you has an old soul?

285
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,640
Which one of you has an old soul, like in the luckiest?

286
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm gonna need that one because this is gonna be bad otherwise.

287
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,360
I am 45.

288
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,560
I'm 45 years old and I want to stay in America. I love it here.

289
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,480
It's the greatest country on earth, but they will deport me.

290
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,920
Look at the size of these fries.

291
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,760
You can't get extra large fry in Canada.

292
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,880
If I put this extra large fry in your hand, it looks like a bouquet and I'm ready to do this.

293
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,480
I'll throw the fries, honey. No, really don't. They're delicious.

294
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,600
Ronald McDonald's gonna give me away with the purchase of an extra large volume.

295
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,440
He will give me away.

296
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:57,940
Okay.

297
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,920
Why don't, let me ask you, why can't you marry kids at, hold on, at McDonald's only?

298
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,840
That's the only situation.

299
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,480
So it's only binding in the city state of McDonald's.

300
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,400
Right, in the, yes, in that fiefdom.

301
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,960
Then you leave, you get married to a real woman who is your age,

302
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,480
and she's like, let's go to McDonald's.

303
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,040
Anybody like that?

304
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,520
I can't.

305
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,720
That would be complicated.

306
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,360
We cannot go there. Our relationship that I love and treasure will be null and void.

307
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,880
It will be dissolved.

308
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,680
I know we're goofing about kid preachers, but wouldn't you,

309
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,160
you would have to get married by Grimace, right?

310
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,640
Yeah, he, I mean, he is ordained. I've always thought that he was the holiest.

311
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,600
Wait a minute, or Mayor McCheese.

312
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,400
Oh, it's definitely Mayor McCheese. You want somebody official.

313
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:47,600
Right.

314
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:55,840
Grimace is the one who stands up in the back and he's had like one too many McFlurries and he objects.

315
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,760
And the other thing is that

316
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,920
Mayor McCheese is a preacher in that racist church that protests gay people's funerals.

317
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,240
Bet you didn't know that.

318
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,440
That is true.

319
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,000
That's true.

320
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,880
I was about to say in Fred Willard's church, but I don't think that's his name.

321
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,400
The Church of Comedy Goose.

322
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,520
You know who you gotta watch out for?

323
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,880
The Hamburglar.

324
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,800
Yeah, because he'll steal your bride. He'll steal your toddler bride.

325
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:19,760
He will.

326
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,080
And I'll keep an eye on Dr. Apple Pie.

327
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,480
Okay, you made him up.

328
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,880
No, Dr. Apple Pie, he's a newcomer. Have you not heard of him?

329
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,360
It's a doctor in history. It's not like a medical doctorate.

330
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,000
Everybody in McDonald's is getting so sick from eating McDonald's foods nonstop.

331
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,640
Why do I always feel sleepy and dead?

332
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,140
Uh-huh.

333
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,520
My liver is just like, it's just full of fat. Just full of it.

334
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,920
And it looks like a marbled steak down there.

335
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:57,920
Can someone please, please invent a caretaker for us peoples?

336
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,480
Also, nobody was buying fucking apple pies anymore because it's not 1952.

337
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
So they wanted to get that brand awareness going.

338
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,200
And now they, and now they, apple pies have fruit in them.

339
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,160
Yeah, I'm a doctor. Trust me, you're not a doctor. You're a caretaker.

340
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,120
You're a caretaker.

341
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,840
They have three to 3.5 essential vitamins that you need for life.

342
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,080
Including bread, apple, and syrup. Crunchy.

343
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,400
This has got vitamin syrup. Delicious.

344
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,320
How do you prevent scurvy? That's how. Vitamin crunchy.

345
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,360
A little vitamin syrup.

346
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,480
I like him a lot better than a strange Uncle McRib.

347
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:40,980
What?

348
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,000
He only comes in town every so often.

349
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,680
Uncle McRib, it's been a while.

350
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,760
Yeah, I was hanging out with your Uncle Bratwurst and your Uncle Pizza.

351
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,240
And your Uncle Fajita for a bit.

352
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,040
They're all dead.

353
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,160
Dr. Apple Pie killed them.

354
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,400
But listen, Ronald, I want you to know I'm clean, I'm sober,

355
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,680
and I'm gonna stick around this time.

356
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm gonna be here and I'm gonna be a real member of this family.

357
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,520
Three weeks. Always.

358
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,720
Three weeks he lasts.

359
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,440
He's drunk on the couch. He's making out with Wendy.

360
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,240
And he's back to wherever he goes.

361
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,800
Pulling the tubes out of Grandpa Speedy's nose.

362
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,720
That was a deep McDonald's cut.

363
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,560
Next up, Griffin Goose about McPizza or something.

364
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,400
I already did that one.

365
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,360
God, hey, you know what?

366
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,280
McPizza was good.

367
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,080
McPizza was good.

368
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,320
McBratwurst was fucking delightful.

369
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,600
Okay, Griffin, I've never heard of McBratwurst.

370
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,200
Oh, I remember McBratwurst.

371
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,640
I remember McFajitas too.

372
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,240
I used to always get McFajitas.

373
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:52,160
Sometimes McDonald's sets their eyes on these, like, fucking like,

374
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,120
Jack in the Box, like their menu is just like freestyle jazz.

375
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,080
Like, what do you want?

376
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,920
Slurpee, sure, fucking throw them in.

377
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,120
McDonald's is like, you guys know your thing already.

378
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,840
You don't have to have, you don't have to have slurpee.

379
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,480
What do you got?

380
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,120
Pasta?

381
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,240
Put that away.

382
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,680
You don't, they don't know what they're doing.

383
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,640
They just want to be involved in another part of your life.

384
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,120
They want to stick their finger in all sorts of pies

385
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,920
because their own pies are the worst pies.

386
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,840
They're like hot pockets of dump.

387
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,560
Have you ever had a holiday pie at McDonald's?

388
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,280
A holiday pie is like an apple pie outside.

389
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,400
It's got sprinkles on top and inside it's filled with, I kid you not, hot custard.

390
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,120
Mmm, happy holidays, everyone.

391
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,760
Happy holidays.

392
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,360
You're crying.

393
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,000
You're sad.

394
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,640
You're so sad.

395
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,040
You're sad.

396
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,440
What's that?

397
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,800
You're eating hot custard pie.

398
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,200
What's that?

399
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,960
It's dribbling down your chin.

400
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,040
Is that hot custard and sprinkles?

401
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,480
Oh, it's December the 24th.

402
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,800
Happy holidays.

403
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,440
Now I get it.

404
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,400
Happy holidays.

405
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,600
You look awful.

406
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,280
I don't think we answered that at all.

407
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,520
Yeah.

408
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,640
I feel like we covered it.

409
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,800
Yeah, we touched on it.

410
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,880
We touched on it.

411
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,200
That's, I mean, the McDonald's play place is a pretty good suggestion, I think.

412
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,520
Yeah.

413
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,800
Where else would be a great place to hitch your wagon to somebody else forever?

414
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,320
You could look into independent concert venues.

415
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,320
Like what?

416
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,440
What?

417
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,160
Like theaters that, you know, that, you know, take, there's one here in Cincinnati called

418
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,680
the Redmore and basically it's like an open event location.

419
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,680
Okay, like an outdoor amphitheater.

420
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,080
I'm with you.

421
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,280
Yeah, that kind of deal.

422
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,400
That's pretty good.

423
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,720
In a church.

424
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,880
In front of the eyes of the Lord.

425
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,240
Maybe you want the Lord to come.

426
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,000
He is everywhere.

427
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,760
Maybe invite your friend God.

428
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,120
Maybe have God come.

429
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,880
You know, God is everywhere except when people are getting married outside of churches.

430
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,320
God is everywhere except outside of churches.

431
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:59,120
I'll get married, build a big, like, lead line bomb shelter and say no God allowed

432
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,560
because I guess he can't get through lead.

433
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,880
Keep God and Superman out.

434
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,440
Get out of here, Superman.

435
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,760
You know, our step sister Abby got married in a park and that was very nice.

436
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,720
It was lovely.

437
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,120
Yeah.

438
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,320
I mean, it's such a risk.

439
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,600
Yeah.

440
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,840
If it pans out, you know, you've got, well, I was going to say the Lord's blessing, but

441
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,040
obviously you won't have that if you're not in a church, but you have the blessings of Gaia.

442
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,520
Gaia small fire.

443
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,320
I went to a wedding a few months ago in New Orleans at a wax museum.

444
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:41,760
It was really, really cool because the building was really quite lovely.

445
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,280
And the upstairs is like a reception hall and that's where the reception was,

446
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:55,520
uh, natch, and I got drunk up there and then went downstairs where all the wax statues were

447
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,760
recounting recounting the history of New Orleans, which I don't know if you guys know.

448
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,520
This is horrifying.

449
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,040
Is the scariest founded city ever.

450
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,000
Did that now these weren't celebs.

451
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,600
These weren't celebs.

452
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,360
These were, uh, historical representations of events.

453
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,760
Like the, the Mexican jail massacre.

454
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,640
All right.

455
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,760
This is pretty good.

456
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,840
I've had about 10 seven and sevens.

457
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,520
So this seems, this seems like a pretty good fit for my current state of being.

458
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,400
Oh, what's that?

459
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,360
Oh, a voodoo ceremony where they tear snakes in half.

460
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,560
Great, great, great.

461
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,760
I always cry at horrifying weddings.

462
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah.

463
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,000
There was also a nightmare done.

464
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,800
I'm not making this up.

465
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,000
There was a nightmare dungeon section for the people who don't give a shit about New

466
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,520
Orleans history and it had like, uh, uh, it had Sasquatch.

467
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,280
It had Frankenstein.

468
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,320
It had Jason.

469
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,960
And, uh, it also had the man in the wax museum, which just stop it.

470
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,760
What I'm not ready.

471
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,280
Man in the wax museum.

472
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,680
Yeah.

473
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,720
It was like two people.

474
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,680
It was just a mirror.

475
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,800
Two people.

476
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,160
Behold.

477
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,920
This is the greatest monster.

478
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,120
You, you know, do you know how, how, uh, much of a lusher you're going to feel like when

479
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,880
we get a call from that wax museum tomorrow and they say, we don't have a nightmare dungeon.

480
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:25,040
They haven't, we found you crying on the floor of the gift shop.

481
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,920
You were actually on the floor of the gift shop begging for help.

482
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,680
There is no nightmare dungeon here that, oh, I'm sorry.

483
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,040
That was the, that was the origins of Mardi Gras exhibit.

484
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,440
There were a lot of feathered masks.

485
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,120
Girls who have to go wild forever in perpetuity.

486
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,520
They will, they're locked in a state of wildness.

487
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,120
We'd like just one quiet night.

488
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,640
I don't think that's, I just want to stay in and watch the bachelor with Steph.

489
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,480
Justin, did you watch, did you watch the bachelor?

490
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,720
Is this why you've referenced it four different times?

491
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:55,780
No.

492
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,200
Well, it's tied.

493
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,880
This, the bachelor is tied to the fiction of Lady Gaga at home.

494
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,720
So the two are being mentioned in conjunction.

495
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,920
I'm only asking because I watched every single episode of the bachelor.

496
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,560
This season, I was hoping we might have bro chats about it.

497
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,280
Did she end up with the, did he end up with the bad girl?

498
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,320
I don't want to spoil it.

499
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,960
So take your earphones off everybody.

500
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,460
Yup.

501
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,680
Really?

502
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,180
Yeah.

503
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,760
I'm glad I didn't watch it.

504
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,720
That would have been hard.

505
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,400
It was rough.

506
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,640
He got, he got rid of KCB, America's sweetheart.

507
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,040
Like, like four episodes from the end.

508
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,640
Like what are you doing, brother?

509
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,680
See, now they're married.

510
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,640
I've never watched the bachelor before, but now that he's made his film,

511
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,360
but now that he's made his final choice, they're married.

512
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,160
No dog.

513
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,680
They went totally Splitsville almost instantly.

514
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,800
Then what's the point?

515
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,400
What is the point, Travis, of love?

516
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,840
If love can't thrive in a reality TV show or at McDonald's, then what's the point?

517
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,320
Or a reality TV show set at McDonald's.

518
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,920
I would watch that.

519
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,240
I know.

520
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,120
Oh my God.

521
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,200
In a play place, you're just, it's like sister wise.

522
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,280
On the next episode of kid marriage.

523
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,600
We're canceled.

524
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,320
Sorry, police.

525
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,120
We did not know.

526
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,680
On the next episode of kid wives,

527
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,480
we formally apologize to the families we've devastated.

528
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
We did not know about the laws.

529
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,720
On the next episode of kid wives,

530
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,760
we do an unintentional mashup with to catch a predator.

531
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,840
Is that Chris Hansen?

532
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,880
Ah, fuck.

533
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,560
God damn it.

534
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,360
I love her very much.

535
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,240
I love her very much.

536
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,840
I just like Smirnoff.

537
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,120
I like to drink it myself.

538
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,640
This is for me.

539
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,920
This Smirnoff is for me.

540
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,200
I bought this for me.

541
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,800
I bought this for me, Chris.

542
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,200
I bought it for-

543
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,240
This is a treat for me because I had a hard drive here.

544
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,360
I've earned it.

545
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,000
Oh, I haven't?

546
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,960
I'm a pedo?

547
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:47,840
Okay.

548
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:54,320
If you are going to go to an underage girl's house to sleep with her,

549
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,840
and you are bringing a lot of alcoholic beverages, don't do that.

550
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,200
But if you do, take two cups with you.

551
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,440
Because when he asks you what the Z was for,

552
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,280
it is such a baller move to say,

553
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,640
it's for us, Chris.

554
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,840
Let's sit down.

555
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,200
Let's crack one of these open.

556
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,320
This one's for us, big guy.

557
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,040
Let's bro out.

558
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,000
This is for us.

559
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,920
You never get to hang with anybody.

560
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,800
You just sit in kitchens all day like a creepster.

561
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,440
Yeah, no, Chris.

562
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,480
Chris, I'll go quietly.

563
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,680
But let's talk about you.

564
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,440
Chris, I'm your biggest fan.

565
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,760
I got into touching kids just for this moment.

566
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,480
Just to meet you.

567
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,360
Love you.

568
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,160
Just for this moment.

569
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,880
I love you so much.

570
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,920
You do such good work.

571
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,080
Peto's gross, but I'll become one.

572
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,120
To meet you.

573
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,760
To meet you.

574
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,480
Oh, Peto's, you're the pit.

575
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,920
You know how we catch predators?

576
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:58,320
That's what the money we earn from the money's at?

577
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,680
We're out there every day.

578
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,440
When we're not recording these podcasts,

579
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,040
we're busting Peto's.

580
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,680
Yeah.

581
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,040
A lot of people know that.

582
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,880
This message is for Merrily Bramblepelt Griffin

583
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,360
and Holly Lillipad Gibbs.

584
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,320
And it's from Nadja, Will, and Tom.

585
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,040
Travis, what's the message?

586
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,240
Well, I can give you what I'm guessing

587
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,400
is the first nine tenths of the message

588
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
because unfortunately it cut off.

589
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,160
But here's what we've got so far.

590
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,400
We would like to give a birthday shout out

591
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,800
to the almost twin mayors of Birthday Town,

592
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,760
Merrily Bramblepelt Griffin, March 16th,

593
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,400
and Holly Lillipad Gibbs, March 23rd.

594
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,240
Holly and Merrily are super fans

595
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,360
of my brother, my brother, and me

596
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,760
and been spreading the McElroy Brothers gospel

597
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,600
since they started listening to The Advice Show.

598
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,800
Our quintet has been getting it every...

599
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,280
And then the message cuts off.

600
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:49,600
Okay.

601
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:50,960
Okay.

602
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,440
So.

603
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,040
Hold on, we can figure this out.

604
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
Our quintet has been getting it in every...

605
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,120
Back alley.

606
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,520
No.

607
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,400
Oh, God, no.

608
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,120
No, no, no, no, no.

609
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,200
That's the worst thing you could have said.

610
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,560
It's the worst answer.

611
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,880
I want you guys to know that I censored myself

612
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,800
for the other terrible things I was going to say.

613
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,680
Oh, good.

614
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,560
Wonderful.

615
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,560
You get that in NBNBAM XXL.

616
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,520
Get raunchy.

617
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,000
You guys say the rump.

618
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,760
Good one, Dirty Dram.

619
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,040
You skunked him again in your dirty ways.

620
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,360
This is the best CD I ever bought.

621
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,480
How is this only $3?

622
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,320
NBNBAM XXL get raunchy.

623
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,640
Why is it extra large?

624
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,440
Because it's so dirty.

625
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,920
Because it can't contain all the raunchiness, Griffin.

626
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,800
The raunchiness is bulging at the seams.

627
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,320
No one CD can contain all that raunchiness.

628
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,960
The corporate suit said make two CDs.

629
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,720
We made a giant one.

630
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,200
It looks like a laser disc of raunchiness.

631
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,000
Of raunchy.

632
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,240
You can't fit it in anything?

633
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,280
Fit it in your rump.

634
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,920
It's brad.

635
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,960
Is it your grandma's CD?

636
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,600
Sorry, people.

637
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,720
Turn it down.

638
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,080
Too much raunch.

639
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,160
So happy birthday.

640
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,280
Happy birthday.

641
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,840
Sorry about everything.

642
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,800
Sorry about Travis.

643
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,680
Specifically me.

644
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,240
I'm so sorry.

645
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,760
And hey, don't forget, MaxFunDrive's coming up.

646
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,720
Get your get your given hat on.

647
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,240
Because we are planning a salvo of awesome shit

648
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,880
to give away to people.

649
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,240
I'm gonna throw our hat over the fence.

650
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,080
It's okay.

651
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,960
It'll change you.

652
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,640
Whoa.

653
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,320
In ways you can't even imagine.

654
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,720
You will.

655
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,240
Well, you can probably suss it out.

656
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,640
But you will be changed.

657
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,520
You will be defined.

658
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,000
And for the better, you ask?

659
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,280
I don't know.

660
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,080
Not necessarily.

661
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,120
It's impossible to say.

662
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,120
I know what will change you for the better.

663
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,400
It's another show on the Maximum Fun Network.

664
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,080
Like this one.

665
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,320
Hello, fake radio listeners.

666
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,400
I didn't see you over there.

667
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,760
This is Judge John Hodgman relaxing in his chambers.

668
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,320
You know, I've resolved the greatest moral conflicts of our time,

669
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,360
like the potluck problem, snob versus slob,

670
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,440
and of course the toot dispute.

671
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,960
Do you have a pressing issue that needs swift, decisive justice?

672
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,120
Visit us at www.maximumfun.org slash JJHO.

673
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,240
That's JJHO for Judge John Hodgman.

674
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,520
And here are the results of each case on my weekly podcast,

675
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,720
Judge John Hodgman.

677
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,200
This is the sound of a gavel.

678
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,800
That is all.

679
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,000
I have a Yahoo answer that was sent in by gollyayolly.

680
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,560
Thank you, golly.

681
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kevin Crawford, who asks,

682
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,720
if I go to Italy and talk with an Italian accent,

683
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,320
would I offend the Italians?

684
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,400
I'm going to Germany, Austria, and Italy, May 23rd for 11 days.

685
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,120
I just wanted to ask, I talk with an Italian accent,

686
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,960
but don't speak Italians.

687
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,720
Would the Italians find that offensive?

688
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,240
I can't imagine why.

689
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,040
Why would they?

690
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,920
I think they'll find it flattering.

691
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,160
They might think they're having a stroke.

692
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,840
Why do I understand?

693
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,920
I don't understand what you're saying.

694
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,960
But it's Italian.

695
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,680
It's Italian.

696
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,240
It's Italian.

697
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,560
I don't understand what you're saying, but it's Italian.

698
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,680
It's got to be.

699
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,720
It's got to be Italian.

700
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,440
Look at you.

701
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,880
What are these new words?

702
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,760
God, the kids.

703
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,880
He's an innovator.

704
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,240
He's a pioneer of the Italian language.

705
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,280
I don't understand any of it.

706
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,640
You douchebag.

707
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,200
This you doucher.

708
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,840
This is either like you either are planning on doing this,

709
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,800
which is bad, or you already speak with an Italian accent,

710
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,560
but you don't speak Italian and your name is Kevin,

711
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,120
not from Italy originally.

712
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,360
Do you know why people have accents?

713
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,400
Do you know how that happens?

714
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Because they're from the place, Kevin.

715
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,440
Jesus, Kevin.

716
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,160
Kevin, you are from Nebraska.

717
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,840
You speak with a Nebraska accent.

718
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,400
An Nebraska brogue.

719
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,200
I've never been to a foreign country,

720
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,640
but I have to imagine that it would be the same

721
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,080
as if anyone from Italy rolled up to America.

722
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,600
It was like, now I'm going to speak with an American accent.

723
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,040
I don't hope for that.

724
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,560
It wouldn't be a thing because I don't think-

725
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,600
It would be like, como esta mi amigo?

726
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,200
Donde esta la biblioteca?

727
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,640
I'm no Espana.

728
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,760
Donde esta la biblioteca?

729
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,200
Can't tell me, amigo.

730
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,240
I sound like the DNA strand in that part.

731
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,640
Yes, you do.

732
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,480
Dinosaur me amigo.

733
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,360
De ñ a a.

734
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,760
Es tu amigo.

735
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,200
Oh my God.

736
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,600
Donde esta los thunder lizards?

737
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,480
Vim con amigo a Jurassic Park.

738
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,680
¿Qué es tu nombre?

739
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,320
Mi nombre es Jose Hammond.

740
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,920
¿Qué es lo problema, amigo?

741
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,160
Tassera tops.

742
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,280
I wish I knew more Spanish, but I don't know any.

743
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,480
I know how to ask for the library or maybe bookstore.

744
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,360
I know how to say bathroom and Mr. Ian Malcolm.

745
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,080
Mepa finds a way.

746
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:54,900
Christ.

747
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,680
Yeah, oh God, don't do this thing, Kevin.

748
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,840
Kevin, just go to Italy and enjoy it and talk like yourself.

749
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,920
Yeah, just go and talk really loudly and slowly in English.

750
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,600
Yeah, that's what people like over there.

751
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,400
They want the one thing people always say this.

752
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,680
Why should I try to speak in the language even if I don't know it?

753
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,360
And the answer is yes, always.

754
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,880
Because the one thing that people in other countries like to feel is superior to you.

755
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,600
Oh, yeah.

756
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,000
And if they can't kind of tilt their head to the side.

757
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,600
Okay, come here little slow person.

758
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,480
Come with me.

759
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,360
You're adorable.

760
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,120
I'll protect you.

761
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,920
I don't know.

762
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,520
They might actually appreciate the comedy of this.

763
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,520
You think?

764
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:37,840
Yeah.

765
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,840
Like, hello, I'm trying to go up and a sandwich.

766
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,040
Which way?

767
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,840
Tell me, please.

768
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,040
Why is the Italian Borat?

769
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,880
My brother, my brother, me come for the child marriage.

770
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,920
Stay for the accents.

771
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,600
Oh, like you guys could do a better Italian.

772
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,440
Griffin, I did Mexican.

773
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,480
I didn't Mexican English DNA DNA.

774
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,000
So yeah, I could probably swing it.

775
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,560
I'm not just not going to lower myself to that because it's offensive to Tony Danza

776
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,760
and all the other fine people of the Italian faith.

777
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,840
And we can all agree that Kevin's Italian accent is he's just doing Mario, right?

778
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,960
Yeah, right.

779
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,280
Okay, it's me, Kevin.

780
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,240
He just comes out.

781
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,920
Every other American is doing when they do Italian Mario.

782
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,880
I'm a Kevin.

783
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,920
I'm going to win.

784
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,560
Or the something about spicy people.

785
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,360
This seems to be the two things that everyone says in their Italian accents.

786
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Here's a Yahoo answer that was sent in by Keith Marnock.

787
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,720
Thank you, Keith.

788
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,960
It's by Yahoo answers user Matilda, who asks opinions on the name baby for a girl.

789
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,760
I'm sorry, but I love this name.

790
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,840
It is so graceful, elegant and formal upper class name and all caps.

791
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,480
I want to call my kid.

792
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,080
I want to call my kid this please.

793
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,960
Opinions, please.

794
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,280
I think anytime you have to ask a question that starts with I'm sorry,

795
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,640
you've answered it for yourself.

796
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,760
Yeah, that's that's a fine point, Travis.

797
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,520
So what I'm sorry, I have this opinion.

798
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,960
I'm so sorry.

799
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,440
You can't what in what?

800
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:29,440
What OK, if you think about class, the idea of class, it is tied pretty much in, you know.

801
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,840
Inherently to maturity, you know, classy, mature.

802
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:43,440
How could a name that means the least mature thing be a classy name?

803
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,960
So like, let's let's walk this backwards.

804
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,560
Can you name your child grandpa?

805
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,840
This is for a girl.

806
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,840
This is my baby, Grandpa Baby.

807
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,760
I love him very much.

808
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,720
He's a classy guy.

809
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,840
You know, baby.

810
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,200
What I'm picturing it and just makes you really happy.

811
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,320
A grandpa baby.

812
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,040
So I go on.

813
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,320
No, this is I love it when you interrupt the show with your own brain pictures that nobody can see.

814
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,520
Tell me again, does it please you?

815
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,560
Are you imagining a still frame from Benjamin Button?

816
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:22,000
Are you looking in your commemorative Benjamin Button view master that you receive at the screen?

817
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,960
Yes.

818
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,160
Click click.

819
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,880
He's older.

820
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,440
Click click.

821
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,320
He's young.

822
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,520
I love this view master.

823
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,400
Why is the writing backwards?

824
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,480
Ah, fuck the things in backwards.

825
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,360
But these are so hard with those.

826
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,680
Do you think do you guys think view masters would still have the power to entertain and

827
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,800
insource all the youth?

828
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,320
Or do you think their their novelty will have worn off?

829
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,560
I don't understand the thing that doesn't exist anymore.

830
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,160
They don't make view masters anymore.

831
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,440
They probably do for like the the toddler is toddlers and hipsters.

832
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,920
Yeah, I could see that.

833
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,480
It's like a disk of PBR pictures.

834
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,960
These are real things that people spent money on.

835
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,200
And I imagine that the replay value on a view master disk is negative 10.

836
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,200
You flip through it.

837
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,000
There's eight pictures.

838
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,800
You flip through all eight.

839
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,240
You're like done.

840
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,360
Thank you for buying this dad.

841
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,000
How much was it?

842
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,720
250?

843
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,280
Yowza.

844
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,000
You got burnt dad.

845
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,560
Would have maybe spent that on milk or gas.

846
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,080
But this is great.

847
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:24,400
Thanks.

848
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,960
It lasted me four and a half seconds.

849
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,520
So thanks.

850
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,480
It was really it was really super fun.

851
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,280
Next toy.

852
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,640
Again, something with electricity, please.

853
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,760
Can I get a light bright up in this bitch?

854
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,600
Man, don't name your fucking baby baby because that baby is never going to grow up.

855
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,880
It's going to be a forever baby.

856
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,000
That baby is never going to grow up that baby.

857
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,360
If that baby is a is it a baby girl, baby boy doesn't name it.

858
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,160
Baby girl.

859
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,920
Let's say baby girl for a girl.

860
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,960
Oh, right in the question right there in bold.

861
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,840
Don't do this.

862
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,680
This baby is going to be 15 and it's going to hate you already.

863
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,280
But you know, it's going to make it double hate you.

864
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,640
You know, it's going to make it double hate you.

865
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,720
So when you go, hey, baby.

866
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,760
Bring me down my socks, baby.

867
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,520
Give me socks, baby.

868
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,720
Give my drinking socks.

869
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,480
No, they're next to the meth socks.

870
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,280
So next to my meth doing socks, baby.

871
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:33,840
You know, you people get mad at adults who wear diapers as part of a sexual or, you know,

872
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,880
sexual pleasure thing.

873
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,840
Oh, you mean age play?

874
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,520
Age, people get mad about age play.

875
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:46,400
But I think if your name is baby, you pretty much have carte blanche of for sexual dysfunction.

876
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,120
Not to say it's a dysfunction.

877
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:54,960
It is a it is a perfectly viable, erotic alley.

878
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,920
All of the cronosexuals out there, like you keep chasing your dream.

879
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,880
And like, we are not going to stand in the way because who are we?

880
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,240
Um, but you should stop listening right now because that's gross.

881
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,640
The big diapers aren't what bother me.

882
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,600
What's a pacifier?

883
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,640
Is it a pacifier?

884
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,320
For me, it's the goo goo's and the gaga.

885
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,520
See, for me, it's the bonnet.

886
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,000
I can't get behind the bonnet.

887
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,000
Yeah, it it and it always is a big fat man.

888
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,440
It always looks like someone put a diaper on a giant egg.

889
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,200
Now and I hate it.

890
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,000
I hate it too.

891
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,080
But if they put it in a Cirque du Soleil, I'd pay $100 to see it.

892
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,600
I would pay $100 to see it.

893
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,560
So oh, so what you're saying is you have a problem with amateur baby dress up,

894
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,720
but professional baby dress up is fine.

895
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,840
Professional age play is is a is a sight to behold.

896
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:52,080
If I saw a fat man in public and he was wearing a diaper and a very snug shirt

897
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,960
that looked like a weird fucked up version of Jack the movie

898
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,320
Jack by somebody who had never seen the movie Jack but was told to recreate it.

899
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:07,520
Um, I would get angry at that scene until I said, Hey, brother, what's your name?

900
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,120
He said, My parents named me baby.

901
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,720
Then I would say, I get it.

902
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,240
I get I understand everything.

903
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,440
Everything is illuminated.

904
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,200
My love is your love.

905
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,160
My I'm with you.

906
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,960
I miss you, Whitney.

907
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,400
Um, I kind of get it a little bit.

908
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:22,960
Hold on.

909
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,640
The baby naming a baby on one level.

910
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,640
Okay, what's the one level once you get it?

911
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,640
Travis is that when you have this baby, if you're a stupid person,

912
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,360
you look at it and go, this is a baby.

913
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,240
Like, but what I what I can't envision doing is looking at a baby and saying,

914
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,840
like, this is a Eustace.

915
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,120
Yeah, this is a Hortense.

916
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,200
But that you realize that that's not how people don't look at their babies and just go pizza.

917
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,800
No, I'm saying in the naming process.

918
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,040
It's a really difficult thing because you're looking at this thing.

919
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,520
This baby and saying, like, I'm going to label this thing for,

920
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,280
you know, possibly 100 years.

921
00:47:59,280 --> 00:47:59,920
What's this thing?

922
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,120
What's this thing?

923
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,960
Is this Doritos?

924
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,000
Nah, table?

925
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,560
Nope.

926
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,520
No, it's a baby.

927
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,840
Put that down on the certificate.

928
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,240
Are you saying that it's okay if you as a parent lack the conceptual

929
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,200
the the ability to abstract a baby from like to it to an actual name?

930
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,240
Like, yeah, you can't.

931
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,120
I'm saying that if you have to go on Yahoo Answers Question and ask,

932
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,960
then chances are you're lucky the baby's not named Doritos.

933
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,520
This is my baby Doritos.

934
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,880
This is a Doritos.

935
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,520
It's not though.

936
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,720
Two A's on the certificate.

937
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:41,840
Stepping up to the plate, it's Doritos Atkins.

938
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,120
He's had a hell of a season.

939
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,720
And earlier when I said plate, I meant podium because he's the president.

940
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,720
He's the baseball president.

941
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,880
President Doritos Taco Bell Shell.

942
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,480
Our baby president is also a baseballman.

943
00:48:59,280 --> 00:48:59,920
Doritos.

944
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,720
He goes by one name now, like Madonna or Kony.

945
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,320
Just Doritos.

946
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,000
So this has been our dumb show.

947
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,120
My brother, my brother and me.

948
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:11,920
We gotta stop.

949
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,760
We gotta stop Doritos 2012.

950
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,560
We can't stop Doritos 2012.

951
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,120
Bring him down.

952
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:23,840
Uh, thank you so much for, for listening to it and hopefully making it to the end of this very,

953
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,960
very strange episode in what is already a pretty strange show.

954
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:35,280
Um, if you would like more, go to iTunes, search for NBNBAM and you can find

955
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,880
95 episodes of this stuff and you can listen to all of them and maybe leave us a rating or

00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,240
a review while you're there.

957
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,160
Subscribe there and, um, spread that, spread that around.

958
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,160
That's the best way you have of growing the show and making sure others get to enjoy it.

959
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,920
Um, uh, and remember coming up is, uh, max fun drive and you're going to help support

960
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,400

962
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:09,440
We have been on the network for a year and, uh, it was, you know, a year ago that we did

963
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:15,920
the last max one drive and the extent to which we have grown and been able to do new stuff.

964
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,280
Because of the people who supported us last year, like thank you guys so, so much.

965
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,040
We don't thank you enough, uh, for, for the people who, who already are donating, but

966
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,440
it's been absolutely incredible and we couldn't have done it, uh, without everybody's support.

967
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,520
So, uh, hopefully, uh, people will come out this year and we'll be able to grow even

968
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,240
more into 20 Bakers Does.

969
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,160
Thank you, John Roderick, the long winners for letting us use their song.

970
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,520
It's a departure, uh, from the album, putting the days to bed.

971
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,160
You can find that on all your music outlets.

972
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:51,920
Thank you to everyone who tweets about, uh, the long winters, uh, for attaching the MBMBAM

973
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,960
hashtag.

974
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,120
I don't know why you guys attach the MBMBAM hashtag to some of the things you attach it

975
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,640
to, but God bless you because it makes that stream.

976
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,600
If you don't have that, that, uh, that stream saved in Twitter, it is, uh, it gets pretty

977
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,640
rambunctious in there.

978
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:14,720
If you use the MBMBAM, uh, hashtag, uh, thank you to everybody tweeting about the show this

979
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,760
week with that.

986
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,120
it's my MBMBAM.

987
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:51,840
Let's shut it down.

988
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,600
Let's shut it down.

989
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,000
This final Yahoo was sent in by Lisa Holofield.

990
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,640
Thank you, Lisa.

991
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:02,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Mr. Cool, who asks, is there going to be a good Burger

992
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,800
Two movie coming out?

993
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,160
I'm just a bad girl.

994
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,040
I'm Travis, not good.

995
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,160
I'm just a bad girl.

996
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,080
This is my brother, my brother and me.

997
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:12,720
Kiss your dad.

998
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:18,960
It's all the way on the lips.

999
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,720
Keep your heart, Three Stacks.

1000
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,680

Hey, keep your heart, Three Stacks.

00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,000
Three Stacks, these girls are smart.

1005
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,400
Keep your heart, Three Stacks.

00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:32,960
Keep your heart.
