1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,680
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,360
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,600
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,560
Well, it's happened again. What has?

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,960
It's November, and that means it's time for music reviews.

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,560
Oh yeah. Oh man, it's always my favorite time of year when November music reviews time rolls

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,800
around. I feel like we never get to talk about music the rest of the year. It's always so nice

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,160
to hit, I think, what is it? I think it's the third Monday or the second Monday of the most musical

13
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,360
month of the year. Yeah, so I'd like to start out by talking about a new album that's very important

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:34,960
to me. It's the new opus from Jimmy Eat World. Whoa, what do you got? And it's called We Ate It

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,200
All Up. Dinner's Done. We Done Ate the World. And so I'd like to go sort of track by track,

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,240
because these boys, these Jimmies are really wearing their hats and hearts right on their

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:54,240
sleeve with this one. A lot of their pathos is present in a lot of the tracks, and you really

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,000
feel like in the first track, which is called, really, seriously, we're going to eat the whole

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,400
world like Galactus did, they have a lyric in the chorus that's like, yum, yum, eat it up, whole

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,240
planet, yum. And when I hear that, I just think like, yeah, that's today. That is today.

21
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,640
I've got an album that I'm really actually very excited about, and it's a new one. Guess who's

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,760
back? It's Sting. Sting is here. Sting's here, everyone. Hey, everyone. Sting's back.

23
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,120
I've been hoping to hear about this album and your sort of skewed perspective on it here in

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,240
Music November. So I'm hoping that you can sort of give me, just like break me off a little piece

25
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,920
of that Kit Kat bar. Well, I hope that you're not like expecting some hard criticism because I am

26
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,160
so excited about 57th and 9th, named after, of course, the intersection he crossed on his way

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:03:00,320
to the studio where he recorded it. Wow, really grass and straws there. Gordon just looked outside

28
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,080
and said where he was, and this was the record he made. So what sort of melodic delights does Gordon

29
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:14,080
have for us this time, Justin? Well, Gordon has been away from pop rock music for 13 years since

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:24,640
his 2003 album Sacred Love, but he's back after 13 years with a big disc of 10 songs. So if you're

31
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,600
wondering, it's a big, it's like physically large. No, it's just a 10 big hits that took him 13. So

32
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:39,840
if you're wondering the rate at which Gordon Sumner comes up with good songs, it is 0.75 songs

33
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,480
per year because it took him 13 years and he's back with 10 songs. He's got everybody on this one.

34
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:56,400
Garth, Madonna, Tony Bennett, just everybody's on this one. And everybody likes to make jokes about

35
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,240
his dick and how it takes him a long time to nut. But I think that maybe this man just like

36
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:10,560
is sort of, has like a sloth brain in there. Well, he might just be moving on like a different

37
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,920
time scale than the rest of us. He will live to be 300, but his 300 years will be the same as

38
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:24,160
100 human years. Travis, what sort of melodic delights do you have for us? And also I'm gonna

39
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,080
black ball fallout boy. I'm gonna- That's fair. That's fair. Veto power. That's fair, Griffin.

40
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:39,040
Well, I'm very excited because for the first time ever, there's a six LP set. It's a career spanning

41
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,960
vinyl box set that encompasses the entirety of the Evanescence studio albums. They're all available

42
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:54,960
now. Fallen, The Open Door, Evanescence, and those last two, according to the Evanescence website,

43
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,920
are making their vinyl debut. And for the first time ever, the commercial debut for the previously

44
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,240
unreleased demo album, Origin. KevinEssence is the- KevinEssence. That was the original name

45
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:16,720
of the band. And it was this man named Kevin and his essence. It was sort of a book

46
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,360
report on a man named Kevin, but then things got kind of dark. And it also features the first

47
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,960
new Evanescence studio recording in years, even in death, recorded in 2016.

48
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:36,720
Dad, you're still at it. RIP Evanescence. RIP KevinEssence. Devoted musicians, thank you for your

49
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,640
sacrifice. Yeah, that's what- Leslie Odom Jr. Hey! Here's good news. He's got a Christmas record

50
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,360
out called Simply Christmas. That sounds like- That's amazing to hear. Fucking good, doesn't it?

51
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,040
Oh, he should have called it Odom Are You Faithful. Odom Are You Faithful would have been a very good

52
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:02,400
name. It would have been a great name. It would have been a very good name. But- I'm very tired.

53
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,480
You know what would have been a great name for Gordon's new- Oh, Travis, I'm so fucking tired.

54
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:13,920
Fucking tired. So tired. Fucking tired. Fuck. You know what would have been a good name for-

55
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,960
You know what would have been a great name for Gordon's album? What? Fucking anything else, Gordon.

56
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,680
Maybe Gordon's tired too. I'm so excited.

57
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:34,480
And Slaybells is back. Slaybells, fuck, what'd you name it? Slaybells is back, but it's not a

58
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,520
Christmas album called Jingle Bells, because that would be a very good name for a Christmas record

59
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,520
from Slaybells. No, it's called Jessica Rabbit, and I'm sure it's very good. I like Slaybells.

60
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,720
Pink Floyd's back with a record from 1967. It's the early years of Pink Floyd. Oh man,

61
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:02,480
we've had a lot of music. Let's- Can we just head down, ass up, do these fucking advice questions?

62
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:09,600
Yeah, of course. You know, the Hold Steady just re-released some albums of bonus tracks.

63
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,680
Got to pick up those- Separation Sunday and Almost Killed Me. Those are out. Love them.

64
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,080
Give them- Fork them over. Okay. If you don't want to hear about any- Trish and Garth are back

65
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,080
with a Christmas record, by the way. If you want to get that in Leslie's record and just play them

66
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,880
at the same time and just have a really good- They sync up. They sync up perfectly. It sounds

67
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,840
like a trio. A triad. Yeah. I mean, yeah, originally that was sort of the arrangement

68
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,240
as they were doing all these beautiful three-part harmonies, but there was beef. And so, you know,

69
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,840
you know how it goes. You know how sometimes they take harmony albums and they split it up

70
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,960
and they release them in separate. Please, I'm so tired. Can we please get to the first advice?

71
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,600
Of course we can get to the first advice. Deep Blue Something's back. I knew it, you son of a bitch.

72
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,040
You are literally killing me in hell. At Denny's for their shift.

73
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:06,320
No, no, I'm sure that they're still killing it. I'd go see Deep Blue Something. They're not

74
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,040
together. I'm sorry, I'm such an idiot. Please, please, please set me free. Is there anybody

75
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,560
else you want me to check on real quick? Please, please set me free from this genie's curse.

76
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,000
Please, God, start reading another question. Let Griffin become Jen. I'm sorry about Deep

77
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,760
Blue Something if you're listening, by the way. You seem like swell guys. I'm just kidding.

78
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,640
My wife and I recently moved into a new house. This week I came home. I've done it. I've ascended.

79
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:41,120
Our neighbors had left us a gift on our front porch. It was the new Christmas album.

80
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,640
Oh no, I'm not Jen anymore. I'm back in the back of the lamp. Damn it.

81
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,480
Robbie Williams is back and Robbie Robertson is actually back also. And it seems like they could

82
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,640
have worked that out better because that's going to cause some market confusion, I worry.

83
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,560
But no, they left a gift and it's not unusual in their neighborhood because they've previously

84
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,240
relieved, received potted plants, loaves of bread, bags of apples. No, no, no. Thank you.

85
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,600
No, sorry. What?

86
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,120
Thank you for the chore and the mold and the rot. I really appreciate all this in my trashcan.

87
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,160
However, this week's gift was slightly more different. We received a book. Specifically,

88
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,480
we received come a sutra, a classic love making techniques reinterpreted.

89
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,560
Travis, there, there was an attached photo. Did you check there? Just trust me.

90
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,800
I trust you. I don't need to see their dirty book. My question is twofold. One, how the fuck do I

91
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,560
face my neighbors after they've given us such a thing? And two, what do I say if they asked me

92
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,680
if we got their gift? That's a clever location based name. I'll answer the second one first.

93
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,920
You say, oh yeah, we got it. And then there's a wink a bunch till they leave.

94
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,240
We've got it all night long.

95
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,120
Make a ring with your finger and then with your fingers in your left hand and then make a second

96
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,880
very skewed ring with your pinky and ring finger on your left hand. And then put like two of your

97
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,520
fingers or your right hand into them in and out, in and out, in and out in like different ways

98
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:21,760
until they leave you alone forever. This won't happen, right? You got my fuck,

99
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:30,720
like strategy guide, right? You got my pro strat no scope fuck guide, right?

100
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,920
Yeah. You got my game facts to vagina. You got my fuck tome, didn't you? It was the one

101
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,040
my fucker and Omicron. I got you the fucker and Omicron. You're supposed to open it and just like

102
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,960
let it free the fuck within you, the undead fuck all around.

103
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,000
You got my, you got my prima game strategy guide to letting that hog go wild, right? You got that?

104
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,200
Yes. Good. Excellent. It shows you where to find all the secret collectibles in there.

105
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,960
You got my chick track about dick tracks, right? Right.

106
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,000
So I don't think this is going to, I don't think somebody's ever going to come up to you and be

107
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,680
like, you got that dick book, right? Good, good. Well, there's two. Okay. There's two things though.

108
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:21,680
It's one of two scenarios. Either the one who gave you this is like the weird beard who's,

109
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,320
you know, that's not fair. Maybe they're just a little too open. It's the person who's a little

110
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,920
too open with all the neighbors and like everyone's like, yeah, that's Gary. That's who Gary is.

111
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,640
Or it's somebody who thought this would be really funny.

112
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:43,600
Yeah. So fun. It's and like, let's be honest, it's hysterical. It's pretty good.

113
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,200
Your reaction to it is making it even better. Here's where I'm at. I also think the act of

114
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,640
leaving a bag, a big old bag full of apples on somebody's front doorstep is also pretty funny.

115
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,560
I use the apples. Here's the apples. Here are the apples. Now they're your apples.

116
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,480
These are your apples now. Now you're the apple man. Now you have all the apples.

117
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,880
What are you going to do with this power?

118
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,400
Bread and a potted plant I get. Like I bake this bread. Enjoy it. This is like,

119
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,560
I went to the store and I saw a bag of apples and I was like, this is Trisha all over.

120
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,520
But the thing about it is there's an inherent weirdness though to just leaving on the porch

121
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,080
versus knocking on the door and handing it to them. Like that's a welcome to the neighborhood.

122
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,720
Now we've had a face-to-face conversation as neighbors versus like this sneaky,

123
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,320
like thief in the night gift giving process that makes it inherently weird.

124
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,400
I'm trying, I just like went on a visual journey in my head trying to imagine coming home after a

125
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:50,640
long day at going to the BP to get beer and coming back and finding a bag of apples on my doorstep

126
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:58,640
and just thinking about the procedure. Now you want me to eat them with my mouth? Like if I,

127
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:04,880
listen, if I buy a bag of apples at the store, that is symbolic of a new commitment I've made

128
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,560
to wellness. You cannot force this on me. Like you can't force this lifestyle.

129
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,720
I would feel like I was in like a nineties movie about the fear of surveillance.

130
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,800
I just like spin around staring into the bushes and trees, screaming, who did this?

131
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,040
Yeah.

132
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,560
Who did this to me?

133
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,600
Now I do want to point out so dark the con of man that we are so distracted by this apple bag

134
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:35,040
that we are not considering the boner, the boner guide that they, that this person really did

135
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,400
receive and how to, how to struggle with that reality that they find themselves in.

136
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,960
I think, I feel like, I feel like a good, I think you could like cut out a lot of the

137
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,080
potential conversations that may happen about this book by letting the neighborhood

138
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,480
know that you got it. If you know what I'm saying, I'm saying-

139
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,960
What Xeroxes? Like pictures around a yard sign?

140
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,560
No, no, no. I'm saying you open up those windows.

141
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:00,960
Uh oh.

142
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,080
And you just let-

143
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,560
And you open up a webcam site.

144
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,320
No, no, no, no, no. Just open up those windows and let the, just the stink lines come out.

145
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,080
Hell yeah. You open up the windows and when your neighbor walks past, you're just like,

146
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,280
hey, remember that book you got me? I adapted it into a movie.

147
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,760
Yeah.

148
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,960
And then just go for it.

149
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,800
And then just let them feel the reek of it, you know?

150
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,120
Yeah. I adapted it into a stage play. This is a live theater happening.

151
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,800
Do you guys want a yahoo?

152
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,080
Yeah, please.

153
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,000
I got a lot of good ones this week. Thank you all very, very much.

154
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,120
I want to make clear out all of that. We're not kink shaming anyone who uses-

155
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,600
No, not yuck, yuck, yuck. It's just like a weird-

156
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,080
It's just presumptuous or funny. It's either presumptuous or very funny.

157
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,200
I think it's very funny.

158
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,000
I think it's very funny. I might think it's very funny.

159
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,280
It is also representative of like how weird we are about sex.

160
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,760
It's just like that's a very personal-

161
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,400
If it's not funny, it's a very personal thing to suppose.

162
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,400
I don't know. That's a weird-

163
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,280
No, sorry.

164
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,120
Listen, we're the most accepting people you'll meet on the face of the earth,

165
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,600
but there's still social norms that we have to try to cling to, I think.

166
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,360
Please don't leave a fuck by numbers on my front porch.

167
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Don't get funny and mail us one. Fuck you.

168
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,200
Nope.

169
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,920
I'm cutting it off now.

170
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,240
It's already done. It's already done. We already have them. We have six.

171
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,920
We have seven. We have 12 now between the three of us. That's fine.

172
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,000
We'll donate them to Goodwill. Don't worry.

173
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,280
Nope. Hey, I'll fucking use it.

174
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,160
Brooks Oglesby sent this in. Thank you, Brooks. It's by Yahoo Answers user.

175
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,400
Please load. Please Yahoo. Please Yahoo. Please Yahoo.

176
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,480
Please Yahoo. I already lost Vine. I cannot lose you as well.

177
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,000
This morning I was on the John, loaded up the Vines.

178
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,760
They won't load. I think that's it.

179
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,440
Are you kidding me? We're done.

180
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,320
Time of death. Kevin Essence asks,

181
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,160
how can you cheat at laser tag?

182
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,640
I am going to play laser tag sometime, I guess.

183
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,280
They've made their beats with it.

184
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,720
I need to know how to cheat so that I don't lose and so I can beat some little losers.

185
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,280
Any ideas for cheating would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, bros.

186
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,760
Just off the top of your dome, how old is this question asker?

187
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,360
Like 26 years old.

188
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,040
Cool. Right there with you.

189
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,520
How do you fucking cheat at laser tag?

190
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,360
Hand across the vest, next question.

191
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,200
Yeah. Hand across the vest.

192
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,880
This sensor could be in the gun, though.

193
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,920
You know, there's like, and also it's like infrared beams,

194
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,120
which I think can penetrate Travis Fletch.

195
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,880
You're going to need a lead skin suit.

196
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,040
Now that's, now we're talking.

197
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,240
Now we're talking.

198
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,200
If you go in there with a bulletproof vest over the laser tag vest, then you might be okay.

199
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,360
It's not cheating.

200
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,360
Putting the arm across the vest isn't going to guarantee a win.

201
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,800
It just gives you an edge.

202
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,440
What's your laser tag edge, Griffin?

203
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Because there's also just like blind firing where you just like pin yourself behind a wall

204
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,360
and like you lean out so like there's no sensor visible and you're just fighting.

205
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,680
But I do want to say if there was a gunfight happening and I was in this gunfight

206
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,280
and I just like poked my arm out around the corner and blind fired,

207
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,680
I don't think the person I was in the gunfight with would be like,

208
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,600
Hey, that's cheating, sir.

209
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,480
That's a, you know, Griffin, you're, it's an excellent point.

210
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,640
Why are you, why, we shouldn't call it cheating.

211
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,840
This is laser war.

212
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,520
You know what I mean?

213
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:45,120
If I put a guard over my sensor, I think that we are enders gaming our children here

214
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
and teaching them laser war.

215
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,360
Yeah.

216
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,400
I mean, yeah, that's the only war of the future.

217
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,640
Sure.

218
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,600
Yeah, laser war.

219
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,400
We're training an entire generation for laser war.

220
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,080
I guess, yeah, it's hard, right?

221
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,160
Cause this is like a physical folk game.

222
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,120
It's hard to like, you can't really like plug a game genie into your vest.

223
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:08,480
Um, so in terms of like cheating this physical thing, I think the right answer is like

224
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,880
steroids, human growth hormones, things like that.

225
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,400
I was going to say training, but yours is way easier.

226
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,480
Well, training, oh God, Travis, training's not cheating.

227
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,600
I feel though, if you, okay, I kind of think that if you play laser tag to get better at it

228
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
for like an event you have coming up,

229
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,520
that's such a weird thing to do that it almost is cheating.

230
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,320
Like that's basically everyone should be going in with the same level of incompetence,

231
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,800
I think, except for the assumption that I think everybody who has played any amount

232
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,920
of video games makes it.

233
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,560
Like when I get in there, I'm going to fucking savage them.

234
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,200
No, you're not.

235
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,560
I've been training for this, you're not.

236
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,680
You're going to get so tired, so fast from running around so much and hiding and trying

237
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,560
to do these fucking like metal gear, solid dives.

238
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,200
You're going to dive.

239
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,920
You're going to land right on your keys and that's it.

240
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,760
You're going to get savage by these like little 12 year olds who have a tenacity and ferocity

241
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,880
that has been forever lost to you, a 36 year old man.

242
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,400
Laser tag falls under this category of things like bowling and darts for me, which is like

243
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,800
if any significant amount of time has passed between the last time I attempted them,

244
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,880
it's very easy for me to convince myself that I think I'm pretty good at it until I try again

245
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,320
and I'm like, oh no, wait, I'm done with this.

246
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,480
That is why I'm going to just jam this needle right into that buttock and I'm going to get

247
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,400
you huge and crazy in there.

248
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,640
Everybody else is going to roll up and they're going to be on a fairly even playing field,

249
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,840
which is that they're going to get very tired very fast unless they're young children,

250
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,240
except for you with your huge, crazy, big body.

251
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:56,480
And you are going to be indefatigable, you will not be able to be fatigued, you will

252
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,400
be able to jump super, super high and just rain lasers down upon all these tweens and

253
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,200
stuff because your body's going to be-

254
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,840
But for how long?

255
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,760
How long will this treatment last, Griffin?

256
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,280
I mean, it depends on the strain, right?

257
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:16,000
Like I've got that Michael's secret stuff that I jam every time I'm about to go tagging and it

258
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,440
makes me big and crazy and it really gives me a lot of, not only mass that I can use

259
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:28,480
to be big and strong, but it also just makes me really, just really crazy aggressive.

260
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,280
Like very, very, very, very aggressive.

261
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,240
It shuts down whatever inhibitors I have that keep me from getting crazy in there.

262
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,680
Hey, here's one that might be cheating that people would never do is hostages.

263
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,720
That's one that you never see people do that.

264
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,320
Just like grab that 12 year old.

265
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,160
You still got body mass on him.

266
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,720
Grab that 12 year old and just use him as a human shield.

267
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,160
Like his team's going to be terrified to take the shot.

268
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,760
They won't be able to take the shot.

269
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,680
And if they shoot in the head, it does nothing.

270
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,120
So shoot through me, shoot through me.

271
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,400
You have to take him out.

272
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,480
Skyler, Skyler, it's okay.

273
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,240
We always knew this would happen.

274
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,560
This is always a possibility.

275
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,360
We trained for this.

276
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:19,120
There is, that does break one rule, which is to say legal laws, federal legal laws.

277
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,160
Like it may not break laser tag rules.

278
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,880
I don't think Billy Bob's is going to have like a don't grab and use kids as human shields,

279
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,320
but I'm pretty sure that is in like the constitution somewhere.

280
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,320
So, so like, but it is cheating, but that's cheating, Griffin.

281
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,880
Like if you don't break rules, it's not cheating.

282
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,560
If I could rob a bank and I get caught and be like, I'm just cheating.

283
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,400
Take it up with the ref.

284
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,920
It's just, it's a game shark.

285
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,560
Chill, dude.

286
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,760
Well, okay.

287
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,560
But they do.

288
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,600
Okay.

289
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,160
Laws are different on a football field.

290
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,600
Do those.

291
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,440
Cause like if you did football things to people in real life, you go to prison.

292
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,760
That used to be the case.

293
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,560
I don't know.

294
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,080
But you, if you do football things to people in real life, you go to prison.

295
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,200
I don't, I don't know if that applies in laser tech.

296
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,000
Like I want to be a fly on the wall for that manager conversation with the Billy Bob's.

297
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,240
Hey, listen, guys, I don't want to, I don't want anybody to take advantage of this.

298
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,600
But I do want to let you all know that when you're in there, it's basically international waters.

299
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,040
Think of it as like the laser tag embassy.

300
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,880
There's really no laws in there.

301
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,280
So if you guys are going to go smoke your pot, please do it in the laser tag arena,

302
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,120
where it is 100% legal.

303
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,080
You'll see in the one quarter, I do have a fairly robust grow operation,

304
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,560
but John law can't touch me because it is in a laser tag arena.

305
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,060
Yeah.

306
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:57,520
And also when you, when you in the, in a laser tag arena, the manager can marry you.

307
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,400
If you were on a football team, a professional football team, and it was Sunday,

308
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,160
you're geared up for the big game.

309
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,400
If you sat down and stole somebody's identity from the opposing team,

310
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,160
would they be able to stop you?

311
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,720
Like, could they?

312
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,000
Well, you'd have to do it on the field with like your iPad and your hand running.

313
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,800
That's what I'm saying.

314
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,360
Like as the play is going on, you're stealing his identity.

315
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,840
Like as you run past him, you're like, Hey, look at me now.

316
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,640
I'm Chad OchoCinco.

317
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,040
Sorry.

318
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:30,000
I don't have a lot of football players on of the current age at my fingertips.

319
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,400
Um, I think that would be legal.

320
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,560
Um, whoa, whoa, whoa.

321
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,400
This just came in hot, hot off the press.

322
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,040
It's hot.

323
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,360
Whoa.

324
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,520
This one is, is, is burning my hands here.

325
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,120
It's a, I got a haunted doll watch.

326
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,480
Oh, good.

327
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,480
Good news, guys.

328
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,360
I've been combing eBay for some of the latest and greatest and haunted doll, uh, advances.

329
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,760
And I got for you a real treat today.

330
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,000
It's a haunted doll named Samantha.

331
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,080
Um, and spooky name.

332
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,200
She was as all haunted dolls must legally be found after the seller's grandma passed away.

333
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,720
Um, they're having that's what, that's what keeps this economy afloat.

334
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,280
It's always just making more ghosts.

335
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,720
Just making more ghosts.

336
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,200
There's not a lot of haunted doll stories to start with.

337
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,920
So I was walking through the Kmart and there on the shelf was a Barbie was a Barbie.

338
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,720
It was weird.

339
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,680
It was weird. My grandma was a kind, loving spirit.

340
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,680
And my aunt Angelica was a healer and a psychic in her country.

341
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,440
I guess they crossed the boundaries.

342
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,800
We're like, well, I've lost it.

343
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,320
I was taken care of by my aunt.

344
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,560
So I learned how to perceive and work with energy.

345
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,560
So they're just like, yeah, they're just establishing their bonus fee days, uh,

346
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,760
using different forms of communication, such as a pendulum and automatic writing in order

347
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,080
to give my buyers as much information as I can about my spirit.

348
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,400
Okay.

349
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,720
We try it.

350
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,680
We trust you.

351
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,320
We trust you.

352
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,440
This doll's name is Samantha.

353
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,320
Porcelain head, arms and legs, 16 inches tall, blonde wavy hair, Victorian attire.

354
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,840
It plays music, which is just, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't believe that.

355
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,000
So here's the thing about Samantha.

356
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,200
That's real fun.

357
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,280
She's an angel of healing.

358
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,840
Well, hold on, hold on.

359
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,040
She has the ability to heal those that are in need.

360
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:25,440
She uses her eyes to transmit healing energy and with a beam of white ethereal light,

361
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,040
she can be asked to heal a particular part of the body.

362
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,520
Her gaze is very intense.

363
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,680
You can almost feel her scanning your entire being with her eyes.

364
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,320
Okay.

365
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,080
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

366
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,400
Yeah.

367
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,840
Oftentimes in a Hanado watch, the seller will say things like having them around affects

368
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:52,640
your luck or like their very presence will make you upset or something.

369
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,680
Will move energy orbs while you're not looking.

370
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:02,640
The idea of saying her eyes emit a white beam of light is a pretty testable claim.

371
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,360
What do you got?

372
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:03,840
Goiters?

373
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,680
One thing though is this seller has 210 transactions with 100% positive feedback.

374
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:13,920
Yeah.

375
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,680
My goiters are gone.

376
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,560
I don't know what to say.

377
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,000
My goiters are gone.

378
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,640
Bought the doll, goiters up and left, moved out.

379
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,840
So when you wind her up and you listen to her melody, you gaze in her eyes and you can

380
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,920
feel a warmth think of your being.

381
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,400
This is the time that you focus on the healing that you need.

382
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,200
And the shingles just fall right off and they're gone.

383
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,560
Thank you, angel doll.

384
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,080
100% satisfaction.

385
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,520
Excellent.

386
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,080
Just what I just what I needed to answer your two biggest questions.

387
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,920
Yes, this person is selling their magic doll that heals people.

388
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,240
And they're doing it for a starting bid of $55.

389
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,680
So yeah, which seems like a kind of a steal for a magic doll that heals you with eye beams.

390
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,320
Yeah, my really want to buy a triple a video game.

391
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,760
My goiter medicine $70.

392
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,120
So this is this is an excellent bargain.

393
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,160
And their last line is eBay forbids the sale of inanimate objects.

394
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,080
Therefore, this is being sold as a doll and for entertainment purposes.

395
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,040
They do not.

396
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,360
They do not ban the sale of inanimate objects.

397
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,960
No, I don't think you know.

398
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,480
I don't know what you think inanimate means, but it's not that it's not ghosts.

399
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,480
I recently bought an SNES cartridge of Chrono Trigger and it doesn't up and fucking move.

400
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,800
But if it did.

401
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,320
But if it did, but if it did, can I say something?

402
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,560
I have a thing that I want to sell on eBay.

403
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,880
I have an Oculus Rift that I want to sell on eBay.

404
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:54,080
And I feel like this this program has delegitimized the platform to the point where I wonder if

405
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,760
that's even a good idea.

406
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:02,160
Well, you can't sell it unless it like does it sprout legs and unless it can like banish

407
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:10,640
your dark thoughts, then I don't think unless like my my, you know, great great aunt died

408
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,520
and inhabited the virtual reality headset.

409
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:20,160
And now every time I try to play, you know, some sort of fun fun 3D space shooter, my

410
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,920
my great great aunt appears and is like, let me get that dark energy out of you.

411
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,440
I don't think it's applicable for the platform.

412
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,960
Correct.

413
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,360
Where does the music come from from the porcelain doll?

414
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,320
Right wind up.

415
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,600
Yeah, you wind it up and the music to start and the healing energy.

416
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,480
She's Bluetooth.

417
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,000
You just connected to your phone.

418
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,240
Do you think it even does play music?

419
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,640
Like if they're willing to say it shoots healing being like, is that what you're going

420
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,600
to be upset about?

421
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,720
Like this music doesn't work like the healing though.

422
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,760
Top notch 100%.

423
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,040
But like I couldn't get the music to play.

424
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,320
I mean, that is a great question.

425
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,920
Justin, there's a lie on the description.

426
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:09,120
So am I going to get this thing and it's actually wood, not porcelain, like painted

427
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,280
wood like, oh, this sucks.

428
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,240
Contact the seller.

429
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,120
Hey, this is painted wood.

430
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,840
This isn't porcelain.

431
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,720
Like, yeah, dude.

432
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,680
All that was lies.

433
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,720
I said it was a healing angel.

434
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,040
You should have known that everything I say is bunk.

435
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,440
Yeah, it's and it's wild, by the way, that people can run all this fucking game.

436
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,760
And then at the very end be like psych.

437
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,760
eBay says I have to say psych.

438
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,880
So psych like, oh, well, why did I?

439
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,040
You should have put that first.

440
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,200
Also, I will say bullshit.

441
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,680
It seems like a weird skirting to be like, and now after I've claimed all that, it's

442
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,760
just a doll like eBay.

443
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,840
Yeah, like, why is they're doing it?

444
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,080
They're working around the system, eBay.

445
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,440
Yeah, I have to make a penis cake for my sister's bachelorette party.

446
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,400
Hey, should we?

447
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,960
Yeah, have that be like the have that like be the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, like to be

448
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,280
continued teaser to get people to listen past the advertising break.

449
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,800
Yeah, this is a new thing we're trying.

450
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,200
And so so, you know, that's waiting for you.

451
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,880
But first, let's go to the money zone.

452
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:27,760
Let me tell you about Squarespace.

453
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,880
Alright, my brother, my brother, me is sponsored in part this week by Squarespace.

454
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,080
Hey, you're not reading this, are you?

455
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,680
This is all coming from the heart, right?

456
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,240
That actually just came off the top of my dome.

457
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,440
I don't know if you know this, Kevin.

458
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,760
This isn't our first money zone.

459
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,680
We've actually talked about Squarespace a lot.

460
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,800
And you know, here's the thing.

461
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,320
Maybe you've heard it a bunch, and it's kind of gone in one ear and out the other.

462
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,040
But you know what?

463
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,080
Maybe in your heart, you've been planning a website for too long.

464
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:02,880
It's sat there just in your heart, growing fallow because you did not water the seed

465
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,520
of your idea for a website.

466
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:12,560
But you should, you should plant it in Squarespace and water it with the Squarespace water.

467
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,840
I might have lost the point.

468
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,080
Yes.

469
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,920
Not your best metaphor, I would say.

470
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,640
I thought it started strong, but then definitely kind of spun into Sleepy Travis.

471
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,440
I mean, yeah, your metaphor was just like, it's like a farm and it wasn't good.

472
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,600
Well, I thought it was clear because Squarespace, it's easy.

473
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,800
They have a lot of different options.

474
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,080
Like farming?

475
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,520
Like farming.

476
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:43,760
They have a lot of like, a lot of tools that will help you make a fast and awesome website.

477
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,640
They got like tractors and shovels on the farm, so.

478
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,040
Exactly.

479
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,240
They have beautiful templates.

480
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,720
That's not a farm.

481
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,240
And also website designs.

482
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,800
Is that a thing?

483
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,200
Yeah.

484
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,440
The way that they lay out the rows of peas.

485
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,680
Or like a Travis, like a barn.

486
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,680
Yes, exactly.

487
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,760
And they have a really awesome 24-7 customer support.

488
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,000
That's hay.

489
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,360
Like farm wizards.

490
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,200
Like farm wizards, exactly.

491
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,600
So no matter what your technical concerns are, customer support can help you.

492
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,560
Oh yeah, corn.

493
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,760

497
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,720
highly recommend.

498
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,080
I made a website there, mackerelshows.com.

499
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,760
Took me like 40 minutes, and I'm very happy with it, and I brag about it all the time.

500
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,240
I think I brag about it every time we do a Squarespace ad.

501
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,680
So trust me, they make it fast and easy.

502
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,440

They give you all the tools you need, plus the customer support.

504
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,120
Go check it out.

505
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,520
Squarespace.com slash my brother.

506
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:03,680
And you get 10% off your purchase, and that's like when you go to a farm

507
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,560
and you blackmail them for free vegetables.

508
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,120
Exactly.

509
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:14,960
The hardest thing about being a farm wizard is that when the farmer assumes

510
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,760
just because they bring the cord of virgin blood and the eye of tree frogs that you demanded,

511
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,080
they don't also have to bring seeds.

512
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,520
It's like, you have to meet me halfway, you know?

513
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,240
Where am I supposed to pull these potatoes out of my ass?

514
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,640
Because I can.

515
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,280
That is where they come from, yeah.

516
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:31,760
But it's a lot harder.

517
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,600
I'm an amazing wizard, but it's tough.

518
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,320
I want to tell you all about Blue Apron.

519
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:42,960
We've talked about Blue Apron so much, and for good reason, because I really, really like Blue Apron.

520
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,760
I've learned how to cook because of Blue Apron.

521
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,200
The way that it works is for less than 10 bucks a meal, Blue Apron.

522
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,720
They will deliver seasonal recipes along with pre-portioned ingredients

523
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,160
to make delicious home-cooked meals.

524
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,680
This month, they have stuff like pan-seared chicken

525
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,320
with roasted fall vegetables and butter caper sauce,

526
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,920
spicy lotus root and purple carrot stir-fry with sweet potato noodles,

527
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,760
lemongrass roasted pork, and Romanesco cauliflower and coconut rice.

528
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,040
The meals are really, really great and easy to prepare,

529
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:21,360
and they teach you so much about learning the fundamentals of cooking

530
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,560
so that even when you're not cooking a Blue Apron thing, you're better at it.

531
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,480
It's a really wonderful thing that I cannot imagine going without.

532
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,880
You can check out this week's menu and get your first three meals for free

533
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,240
with free shipping if you go to blueapron.com slash my brother.

534
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,120
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

535
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,000
Blue Apron.

536
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,920
So we've got some Jumbotrons to share with you,

537
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,800
but first we do want to remind you that the My Brother, My Brother and Me

538
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,560
Jumbotron window is going to be opening back up November 28th at noon Pacific,

539
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,040
and there's the potential of them selling very quickly.

540
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,800
They have in the past.

541
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,560
That's why we kind of had to put a pause on them so we could catch up a little bit.

542
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,080
So if you have been interested in picking up one of those spots,

543
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,560
just know it's going to be first come first serve

544
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:18,960
starting on November 28th at noon Pacific and those spots will run sometime in 2017.

545
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,600
So let's get into the Jumbotrons for this week, though.

546
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,920
The first one is for Richard, aka Daniel Jackson.

547
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,880
Okay, it's an odd nickname.

548
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,380
Fine.

549
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,360
The message is from Craig, aka twobbles1.

550
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,080
I never would have thought that Halo 3 would increase our friends

551
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,800
and increase our friendship from cousins to besties.

552
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,120
No, it's dead.

553
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,520
It's gone.

554
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,000
It's dead.

555
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,480
Let it go.

556
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,880
We might make one for Christmas.

557
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,160
I don't get it.

558
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,280
What's it about?

559
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,080
Our trip to North Carolina to watch Griffin help me.

560
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,600
Eva?

561
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,720
Eva 3.0?

562
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,760
Maybe Evangelion?

563
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,560
I don't know.

564
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,060
I don't know.

565
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,440
It's still one of my favorite memories,

566
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,680
and I'm really honored to be one of your best friends.

567
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,720
P.S. Happy birthday.

568
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,320
That's awesome.

569
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,440
Yeah.

570
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,240
It's really nice.

571
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,000
It's Evangelion 3.0.

572
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,040
You cannot redo.

573
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,640
It's a fantasy science fiction anime film from 2012.

574
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,600
So you got it in one.

575
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,880
Got it in one.

576
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,920
Happy birthday.

577
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,840
Congrats on getting those sick KD ratios in Halo 3.

578
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,680
Finish the fight.

579
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,760
I'm gonna give the Covenant back their bomb.

580
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,880
Master Chief.

581
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,640
Cortana is back doing their thing.

582
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,760
Look out for the flood.

583
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,280
There's some nasty customers.

584
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,560
Warthogs.

585
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,760
Phantom Menace.

586
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,320
Phantom Menace and Anakin Skywalker.

587
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,960
I have a message for Teddy,

588
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,120
and it's from your brothers Will and John who say,

589
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,240
hey brother, this is from your brothers

590
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,920
by your favorite brothers.

591
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,840
Have a great birthday and rock on.

592
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,720
And then guitar riff.

593
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,080
Justin, can you do the thing with your mouth?

594
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:12,400
Wait, hold on, was that the Star Spangled Banner?

595
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,520
It sounds like the Star Spangled Banner,

596
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,200
but Jimi Hendrix keeps getting sleepy.

597
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,240
Is that Phantom of the Opera?

598
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,280
Well, it's Phantom of the Opera.

599
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,000
What are you doing?

600
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,480
That's good.

601
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,640
I'll do another one.

602
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,600
That's Oklahoma.

603
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,080
This is fun.

604
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,240
It's like a hard rock show tunes.

605
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,920
It's a belly high.

606
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,400
Wow, you got it in very quickly.

607
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,320
I will play this game for another half hour.

608
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,960
Yeah, here we go.

609
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,440
Gonna wash that man right out of my hair.

610
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
You're on a real South Pacific.

611
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,120
I was trying to trick you.

612
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,880
Yeah, real South Pacific bender.

613
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,200
Just trying to trick you with that one.

614
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,720
It didn't work.

615
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:05,200
Well, this has been our fun new game.

616
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
I shouldn't have picked a Hilton song with more melody.

617
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,000
I think you're having a stroke.

618
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,680
Are you just doing guitar for the rap words?

619
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,720
I was doing guitar for the rap words.

620
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,360
Sorry, that was not very good.

621
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:29,840
I can see why they use words and things now.

622
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,880
Yeah, sorry.

623
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,920
What garbage.

624
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,560
Pick up the fucking Hamilton mixtape.

625
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,480
It's all Justin making his fucking distorted kazoo guitar noise for all the songs.

626
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:40,880
Sorry.

627
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,400
What movies should I go see this weekend?

628
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,560
Should I care about the Emmys?

629
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,800
Is this meme already dead?

630
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,080
Is VR cool?

631
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,600
What happened to Choose Your Own Adventure book?

632
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,280
Are the Kardashians for real?

633
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,400
For answers to these questions and so much more,

634
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,720
come on over to Pop Rocket, a pop culture roundtable show with me, Guy Branham.

635
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,760
Winter Mitchell.

636
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,640
Margaret Wappler.

637
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,680
And Oliver Wang.

638
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,040
Catch us every Wednesday on MaximumFun.org or wherever you decide to get your podcasts.

639
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,000
I'm not gonna judge.

640
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
Give me that dick question though.

641
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,520
Oh yeah, that's right, the dick question.

642
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,640
I have to make a penis cake for my sister's bachelorette party.

643
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,400
What type of penis should I make?

644
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,080
There are so many variations.

645
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,120
Additional note, my sister and her fiancee are both officers in the Navy.

646
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,200
I would like to incorporate this into the penis cake somehow.

647
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,160
That's from Matron of Dishonor in California.

648
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,360
Maybe an anchor tattoo on there?

649
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,960
Yeah, a lot of, uh,

650
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,080
a lot of our sailors.

651
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,160
Sailor Jerry tattoo, mm-hmm.

652
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,200
Um, is it, I mean, there's bigger questions that we need to ask first.

653
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,560
Like, is this, is it cut?

654
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,040
Well, when they serve the cake, it probably will be.

655
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,640
That's fun.

656
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,360
Oh, that's something you can do, like a layer of fondant

657
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,240
that you sort of briss right off there.

658
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,200
Oh, that's fun.

659
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,960
I would watch an entire season of Great British Bake Off that was just

660
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,440
phallic novelty cakes.

661
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,920
Hard, hard, yeah.

662
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,200
Oh, I disagree, Paul.

663
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,640
I think it's a very good bake.

664
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,040
I think it's a wonderful penis.

665
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,640
I think it's a wonderful bake.

666
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,240
You know, how many people do you have to serve?

667
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,280
Because this is like, that's going to inform the scale that you're working with.

668
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,400
Are you dealing with 10?

669
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,000
Are you dealing with 30 people?

670
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,240
Hey, Tammy and her family aren't going to make it, honey, so let's go flaccid.

671
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,640
Yeah, babe, just a little chubbins.

672
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,160
There's going to be like eight of us.

673
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,120
It's going to be like eight of us.

674
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,800
We just need like half masks.

675
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,200
Like you're watching a, uh, like a really sexy lingerie commercial.

676
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,800
Like that kind of, kind of vibe.

677
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,640
Like a JC Penney's catalog page that you shouldn't be looking at.

678
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:04,960
One of those.

679
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,800
Like watching a Benedict Cumberbatch movie when he does the thing

680
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,120
with his eyes where he's like looking straight into the,

681
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,720
you know what I'm talking about?

682
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,600
When he barrels the camera, barrels the camera, barrels the camera.

683
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:21,120
You get a, you get a Cumberbatch half chub, you know, you know, a Cumberboner.

684
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,600
You want a good Navy, uh, joke in there.

685
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,480
You could tattoo welcome aboard on the penis.

686
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,400
Yeah, that's a reference to every Navy man's favorite movie.

687
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,280
Down Periscope.

688
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,120
Sorry, Kelsey Grammer.

689
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,880
It could also say mission accomplished.

690
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,520
That's fine.

691
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,880
That's a dick that did it.

692
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,240
Yeah.

693
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,080
Or just like a jaunty cap on there.

694
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:45,280
Like a, like a Naval, you know, a Naval officers jaunty cap on there.

695
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,480
And maybe it's winking.

696
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,840
Is it too weird to make it like an anthropomorphicized wiener?

697
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,040
Absolutely not, Travis.

698
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,360
Eyes and mouth, like saying like, hey, come eat me up,

699
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,760
ladies and gentlemen and whoever's present.

700
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,240
Um, what we're dancing around this question.

701
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,160
Justin, you've got, you've, you've got the flour.

702
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,880
You've got the pastry spoon.

703
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,280
What kind of ding-a-ling are you, are you doing?

704
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,000
Straight up and down.

705
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,720
Traditional circle, circle, oval.

706
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,240
What do you do the balls?

707
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,680
Is it weird without balls?

708
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,120
Yeah, it's pretty weird without balls.

709
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,560
I think it's kind of balls are sort of the balls are the easy thing.

710
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:24,800
Yeah.

711
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,520
But the balls are just form the shape that without balls.

712
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,120
It's you would have to sit there.

713
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,080
It's a penis.

714
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,480
Yeah.

715
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,440
The penis.

716
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:31,920
It's a penis.

717
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,240
Everybody.

718
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:32,800
It's a penis.

719
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,760
Is that clear?

720
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,160
Is it clear?

721
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,800
I made it.

722
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,120
Okay.

723
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,760
You guys get it.

724
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,000
Okay.

725
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,320
Have you guys ever seen a penis cake?

726
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:38,800
Yeah, dude.

727
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,800
I've seen more penis cake.

728
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,280
I'll see more.

729
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,760
I've seen more penis cakes than you'll ever forget.

730
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,480
The only time I ever saw one is the first time and only time that I did mushrooms.

731
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,800
And I thought that I had gone, gone down.

732
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,400
I thought that I had gone way past way out there on the edge.

733
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,960
Cause my Jason's brothers made him a penis cake.

734
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,240
And I thought that I had done lost my mind.

735
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:04,480
Yeah.

736
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,520
You dreamt it.

737
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,360
It was a wonderful dream that you had.

738
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,720
No, I woke up the next morning.

739
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,280
It was still there.

740
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,880
And I was like, well, thank fuck for that.

741
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,280
Yeah.

742
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,560
At least it wasn't, you know.

743
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,760
That pastry dick was your constant in that moment.

744
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,640
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

745
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,480
You know what would be impressive?

746
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,600
I guess not.

747
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,400
I've been watching a lot of those like baking competition shows on Food Network.

748
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,880
3D like standing cake.

749
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,080
Not laying down on a tray.

750
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,160
Everyone does laying down on a tray.

751
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:41,840
I'm talking a vertical build with maybe some smaller penises on like scaffolding.

752
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,120
Edible, all edible.

753
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,280
Like a dozer scaffolding in Fragile Rock.

754
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,520
Littler penises around it.

755
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,080
Like they're building the bigger penis in the middle.

756
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,680
Like the dozer scaffolding in Fragile Rock.

757
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,280
Like the dozer scaffolding.

758
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,120
When the dozers build penises.

759
00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:00,640
So you want them to make like basically fucking bear a door out of penises.

760
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:11,120
Just like reaching up to a monument that will live past the time of the penis upon which it is based.

761
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:11,360
Sure.

762
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:17,280
You know, something to remind future generations of the penis that existed once.

763
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:17,600
Yeah.

764
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,720
I think that that's really inspiring, Travis.

765
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,400
I'm just saying if you're going to do the thing, do it.

766
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:24,960
You know what?

767
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,280
Yeah.

768
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,440
Win the penis cake competition.

769
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,720
So let's never talk about penis cakes ever again.

770
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,080
Or penises.

771
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,040
You know, we could do like a fun moratorium on talking about dicks.

772
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:35,760
That would be good.

773
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,480
A little self, and here's a jar, and I'm going to put a quarter in it.

774
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,280
It's the cock jar.

775
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,920
So no, don't put that in there.

776
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,880
Stop it, Daniel!

777
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,680
Daniel came along, and you know what he did?

778
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,520
He's fired.

779
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,640
He put his wormy in the jar.

780
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,520
He put his wormy right in the jar.

781
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,000
He's always misinterpreting intentionally.

782
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,960
This one was sent in by fucking Brooks Oglesby again.

783
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,480
Somebody needs a nickname for this.

784
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,240
Somebody needs a nickname, huh?

785
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,800
Or an honorific at least.

786
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,440
We'll think about it.

787
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,880
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

788
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,840
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

789
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,080
There's a Keebler commercial at the top of the page.

790
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,680
So we'll say it's sent in by Garrison Keebler.

791
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,600
Thank you, Garrison.

792
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,480
It's by Yahoo Answers.

793
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,400
Oh, I already said who it was by.

794
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:16,960
So tired.

795
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,400
Garrison Keebler asks, homemade trampoline?

796
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,200
Would it be possible to make your own homemade trampoline?

797
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,560
And what materials would you need?

798
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,600
This is great.

799
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,240
It harkens back to a simpler time.

800
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:32,800
Yeah.

801
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,040
Back when everything wasn't store-bought,

802
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:40,080
when we used to use our hands to make the trampolines we needed.

803
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,560
Yeah.

804
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,120
We weren't just going to the trampoline store and buy,

805
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,040
you know, the big box trampoline store and just buying a trampoline.

806
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,720
We were crafting the tramp-

807
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,200
We had our own, like, heirloom trampolines that, like, our grandpapas made

808
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,680
that we used to bounce on and remember the time before the Great War, you know?

809
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,800
And now everybody's just going to, like, the tramp store and buying a trampoline

810
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,920
that means nothing to them.

811
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,560
And then they throw it away each season and buy a new one.

812
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,060
Yeah.

813
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:14,240
Everything, everything you could stand on is a trampoline.

814
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:20,480
It's just the degree to which it is a good and serviceable trampoline, right?

815
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:27,360
Like, the carpeting, a bad trampoline, beds, a slightly better trampoline.

816
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,160
Do you measure that?

817
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,760
Do you measure, is the metric how fun and bounceable it is

818
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,360
or how the potential for child harm?

819
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,040
Because that's what I, like, if I'm going to pop my own knee up

820
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,280
and bust my nose with my own fucking knee, that's a trampoline.

821
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,320
What I just did.

822
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,160
Have you done that?

823
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,680
Oh, everybody's done that.

824
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:48,820
Yeah.

825
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,480
Riley broke her leg on one.

826
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:50,980
Yeah.

827
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,080
It's like a bad bounce.

828
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,040
Just a bad bounce, Mary.

829
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,880
Yeah, that's a bad bounce, Mary.

830
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,400
Isn't a trampoline fun?

831
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,800
Because you think about the idea of the number of things that, like, we've gotten rid of

832
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,280
because of the threat that they put, like lawn darts.

833
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,320
We've gotten rid of toys that have threatened children and yet trampolines seem to endure.

834
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:17,040
No, it's not. Like, no amount of child injury will ever undo the trampoline from, like, our consciousness.

835
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,520
We have definitely, as a society, like, turned a blind eye towards trampolines.

836
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,600
We've all just accepted the risk of, like, no, listen, I know.

837
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,360
But, like, I'm not, what am I going to do?

838
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,560
Not have a trampoline?

839
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,120
My friend's trying to get clever and put that fucking net, that netting up around the trampoline.

840
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:41,120
And it's like, dog, all you've done is created a goal for me to try to bounce over.

841
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,520
You put that net up, it's like, how high is that?

842
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,080
Eight feet?

843
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,240
Okay, mission accepted.

844
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,040
Here I go.

845
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,000
Popcorn me, Dylan, I'm out of here.

846
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,080
I need to go to fucking Jupiter.

847
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:52,800
Bounce me, bro.

848
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,960
Hey, at any point during this conversation, and please be honest,

849
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,200
have you guys had the fleeting thought that, man, it'd be pretty fun to jump on a trampoline right now?

850
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:06,960
I think I, it would go, I think I could get three jumps on a trampoline before my spine just telescopes.

851
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,720
For me, for me, Justin, trampolines are the child version of the hot tub.

852
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,760
Let me explain.

853
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,200
Seems like super fun idea.

854
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,400
And then three minutes after you've entered it, you think, so this is it?

855
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,400
This is what I, this is what I'm doing now for, like, I just jump on it?

856
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,600
I'm just, okay.

857
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,920
How long should I stay up here so it doesn't look weird that I didn't just, like, get immediately out?

858
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,640
Um, but how do you make one though?

859
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,640
Cause I can't, yeah, springs seem important.

860
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,440
And like, I can't think of what the trampo material there at the top would be,

861
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,920
except reclaimed trampo mesh from another trampo.

862
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,800
You go harvest, you know, if you steal one, that's another, that's a pretty big heist.

863
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,960
But what about tarpaulin?

864
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:58,320
Could you use just a big tarp and some springs and then a room?

865
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,440
Just a room?

866
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,720
This might be a little bit off the beaten path, but I think if you're going to build your own trampoline,

867
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:10,240
you should really make it like an in-ground trampoline and maybe cover it with leaves

868
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,800
and then like jump off a balcony and like really scare the shit out of your friends.

869
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,480
Just to prank people.

870
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,840
God, God, Yahoo Answers has the worst commercials.

871
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,920
Imagine, oh, imagine like you call your friend Dylan over to your house and you say,

872
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,520
Dylan, last night I was struck by lightning and I've developed these magical powers.

873
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,040
And then just go running across the yard and jump where you know the trampoline is

874
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,520
and spring way higher into the air than you should.

875
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,080
And just see how long Dylan buys your new personas like the springer.

876
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,520
Yeah, until the first time he's like thinks he's funny and then

877
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,120
throws your frisbee up on top of the house.

878
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,040
And he's like, well, it should be no problem, right?

879
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,280
Yeah, come on, I can't control the powers, Dylan, come and go.

880
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,160
How dare you?

881
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,320
I just like-

882
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,920
You know that, Dylan.

883
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,960
Yahoo is showing me an ad right now.

884
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,120
And you remember when they said Melissa McCarthy died?

885
00:49:59,120 --> 00:49:59,760
Uh-huh.

886
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,720
Trying to get me a click.

887
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,960
Now it's Ellen's shocking goodbye.

888
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,080
Her fans were stunned by her leaked secret.

889
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,480
She kept it hidden from the world the whole time.

890
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,400
And this is linking to a website called pretty skin store.com.

891
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,720
So many secrets are just revealed through these official Yahoo advertisements

892
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,040
that Ellen's skin was purchased from another person's body.

893
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,560
We have to help some more people.

894
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,840
I'm going to speed up some of these questions.

895
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,240
Please.

896
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,960
I was on a popular dating app looking for local singles.

897
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,320
And while swiping, I came across my friend's fiance and her dating profile.

898
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:38,880
Oh, God.

899
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,160
They have been together for at least a couple of years.

900
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,160
And we meet weekly to play board games.

901
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,240
I've been able to play it cool so far, but it is slowly eating away at me.

902
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,400
I screenshotted the profile photo.

903
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,280
Good job, fucking ace detective.

904
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,400
But I don't know what to do.

905
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,680
Look at the spy over here.

906
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,640
Fucking check out encyclopedia Brown.

907
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,080
Could they be in some sort of open relationship type thing?

908
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,200
And how do I find that out?

909
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,920
Or did I just stumble on the worst thing ever?

910
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,040
Please help.

911
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,960
I didn't swipe right.

912
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,360
And that's from please let this be an open relationship thing

913
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,400
in Washington state.

914
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,520
Hey, hey, hey.

915
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,840
You need to destroy your phone and you don't.

916
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,520
And you need to destroy your phone.

917
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,680
And then like it's in the cloud, Harriet.

918
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,360
So maybe you could go into your cloud and remove that too.

919
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,880
And forget this ever happened and move on with your life.

920
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,600
There are I'm like fucking opening my third eye and there's no.

921
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,680
I'm looking at all the outcomes possible.

922
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,160
And there's none good for you.

923
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,080
Well, here's what you have to do.

924
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,880
You have to go and talk to the fiance that you found on the dating profile

925
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,440
and say, hey, what's the deal with this?

926
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,320
And if it turns out to be something shady,

927
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,440
then they need to tell their partner or you will.

928
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,640
And then you have to build Bixby your way out of town

929
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,200
and move on to the next town where you'll make new friends

930
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,080
and start a new life.

931
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,760
That's exactly it.

932
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,720
Travis, you can.

933
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,960
If you want to do this, you're going to have to pack your bags

934
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,280
and move away because there's no reality in which this breaks good.

935
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,960
No reality.

936
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,560
No, you're the messenger here.

937
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,280
And it tends to go bad for the messenger.

938
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,800
I got news for you, buckaroonie.

939
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,280
If you really, really stumbled onto something like unscrupulous and shady

940
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,600
and you confront this person about it, guess what they're going to do?

941
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,840
They're going to lie.

942
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,840
They're going to lie about it because they are a shady person.

943
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,600
And if they're not, unless they're not.

944
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,800
This is what I'm saying, Griffin. And if they're not, mind your fucking business.

945
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:48,960
There's this note.

946
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,400
What I'm saying is I'm not presupposing anything about anybody in it.

947
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,160
If you have an open relationship, that's great.

948
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,080
Again, none of your business.

949
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,240
You can't.

950
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,760
You can't.

951
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,320
You can't.

952
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,920
If you do, if you decide to, just know, listen,

953
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,080
I get that impulse of wanting to protect your friend.

954
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,560
And I think that that is very admirable.

955
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,280
Just know, nobody gets out of this clean.

956
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,120
If it breaks bad, nobody comes out of this shining.

957
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,680
Because you're going to be the person.

958
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,640
Even if you did the right thing and you told your friend

959
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,720
and you saved them from entering this shady relationship permanently,

960
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,560
you're still the one who broke them up.

961
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,960
Even if you did the right thing, it breaks bad.

962
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,160
So just know that.

963
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,120
Please, listen.

964
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,880
Let's do something light.

965
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,920
Let me do one last Yahoo before we get into the outro.

966
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,800
Because that one got pretty heavy.

967
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,160
Okay, go.

968
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,000
It's from broxilicalsb, again, hat trick.

969
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,320
Well done.

970
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:42,960
It's from Yahoo!

971
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,640
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

972
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,920
It's from fucking Ellen.

973
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,480
Thank you, Ellen.

974
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,520
It's by Yahoo!

975
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,880
Insta's user, Ellen, who asks,

976
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:54,320
how many of you think Adam Sandler is misusing his talents in movies?

977
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,320
First off, let me say that I do realize

978
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,960
Sandler's roots are in comedy as a former comedian.

979
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,960
And he found himself in a niche with kids and slapstick humor.

980
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,440
That said, I think he's misusing his talents as an actor.

981
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,760
Personally, my two favorite movies of him

982
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,760
are Spanglish and The Wedding Singer.

983
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,520
Because he's actually playing an adult,

984
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,520
not a juvenile, infantile character designed to reach people over the age of 10.

985
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,080
He's clearly smart, and he has talent.

986
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:23,520
But the Billy Madison or obscene movies he has directed, like Mama's Boy,

987
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,080
showing college kids having sex with grandma,

988
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,400
or seniors having their diapers changed,

989
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,200
is rude, disrespectful, and frankly, TMI.

990
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,040
Hold on.

991
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,640
I just hope as he gets older, he will use his brain more in moviemaking

992
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,240
and go for a more grown-up audience.

993
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,440
Well, he did make a movie called Grown-Ups.

994
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,960
He did. He made two movies called Grown-Ups.

995
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,080
I don't know if he thinks he's appealing to the common man with his older movies.

996
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:50,080
And if he does, it's a sad testament to how far our society has regressed.

997
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:50,880
Don't get me wrong.

998
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,760
The kids' movies were funny, but they get too old.

999
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,440
And then there's an update that I don't...

1000
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,440
People get very defensive.

1001
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,040
It's very interesting that...

1002
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,720
It's interesting you should bring up Adam Sandler in this episode,

1003
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,400
because the one and only time I did Mushrooms,

1004
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,840
I watched Punch Drunk Love and it became a cartoon

1005
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,160
and bled out on the walls and was incredible.

1006
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,360
And I've never had the courage to watch it again since,

1007
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,720
because there's no way it lives up to that experience.

1008
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,960
But I do remember thoroughly enjoying it.

1009
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,640
I do want to also say I'm a cop,

1010
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,520
and this whole podcast has been a long sting.

1011
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,600
And both of you guys are going to drug jails.

1012
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:28,720
Oh, no.

1013
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,400
Mr. Sandler, the diaper changing, it's gotta go.

1014
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,760
It just has to go.

1015
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,920
It's because it's TMI, Adam, Mr. Sandler.

1016
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,560
I wish he would grow up from the movies he made first

1017
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,240
and now he's making older movies.

1018
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,680
That's how time works.

1019
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,560
That's how linear time works.

1020
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,760
I don't like the movies where he's a young man making young jokes.

1021
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,760
Yeah, not if you have the click remote.

1022
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,000
If you have the click remote, it doesn't have to work like that.

1023
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,320
It's just so funny to me to say,

1024
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,160
I think he's wasting his time doing comedy.

1025
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,520
He should do more movies like The Wedding Singer.

1026
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,320
A comedy.

1027
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,760
He should do more Spanglish.

1028
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,720
Spanglish 2.

1029
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,880
What are they going to do this time?

1030
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,200
What's that crazy family going to do this time?

1031
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,480
Rain Over Me 2.

1032
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,440
Rain Over Me 2.

1033
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,120
He's still very, very upset.

1034
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,280
Cobbler 2, still.

1035
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,080
Coblin.

1036
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:20,720
Coblin 2.

1037
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,200
God, somebody's got to put these fucking shoes together.

1038
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,480
Adults do.

1039
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,920
No diapers in this one.

1040
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,800
That was my review.

1041
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,720
Six stars.

1042
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:33,040
I'm pretty sure Blended was not a comedy.

1043
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,520
Shaquille O'Neal was in it.

1044
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,440
And everything he touches turns to joke gold.

1045
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,240
But that was the hat trick of the Barrymore Sandler combo.

1046
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,880
And I like how mature it was.

1047
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,360
Sensitive subjects handled sensitively.

1048
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,000
It was really dealing with some real ass shit, you know?

1049
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,480
Because they did, you know, Wedding Singer,

1050
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,280
which I guess was pretty adult.

1051
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,120
And then 50 First Dates.

1052
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:02,480
A lot, a lot of heavy themes in there.

1053
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,640
And I think in Blended, they were both single parents.

1054
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,600
And maybe they killed someone together.

1055
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,320
I didn't see it.

1056
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:15,360
Can I go and go back to bed?

1057
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,320
And Justin, you could go too.

1058
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,360
And Travis, you just recap the entire plot of Blended.

1059
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,880
And then I haven't seen it.

1060
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,880
But I can tell you what I think happens in it.

1061
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,560
Okay, and when it's over, that's the end of the episode.

1062
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,000
All your usual stuff.

1063
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,600
Thanks, John Rojcik and the Long Winches, Maximum Fun,

1064
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,160
and all that stuff.

1065
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,880
But I'm not going to talk anymore about Blended.

1066
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,760
Not till I see it.

1067
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,960
And then I will report back.

1068
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,120
It'll be like a book report, but for movies.

1069
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,560
I'm very much looking forward to that.

1070
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,640
I cannot wait for your book report on Blended.

1071
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,720
Yes, something to, finally, something to look forward to.

1072
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,400
So we'll have that next week.

1073
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,840
It's just going to be all about Blended.

1074
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:56,640
And we are going to, here's one thing that's kind of fun

1075
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,640
on the horizon.

1076
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,840
We do a podcast with the fellows from The Worst Idea of All Time.

1077
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,320
It is an annual, eternal podcast that will never stop,

1078
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,280
no matter what, called Till Death Do Us Blart.

1079
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,480
And every year on, we release it on the American Thanksgiving

1080
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,360
every year, and it is a review of the film.

1081
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,720
We're going to be recording that soon,

1082
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,000
and that'll be there for you.

1083
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,080
So if you don't, if you missed that the first time around,

1084
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,440
go ahead and subscribe, catch up.

1085
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,320
You don't want to be lost.

1086
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,480
The film is Pablo Marcob 2.

1087
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,360
Did you say that?

1088
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,160
I believe I did.

1089
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,480
But Pablo Marcob 2 is the name of the film.

1090
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,960
It's such a good film because it's impossible to say quickly.

1091
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,080
Like you just heard Justin try.

1092
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,200
Pablo Maca.

1093
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,080
Pablo Maca.

1094
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,140
Two.

1095
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,080
Hello, I am Pablo Maca.

1096
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,440
I am the man sent here to kill you.

1097
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,720
I also wanted to, I'm working on a project,

1098
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:53,200
a little bit of a fundraiser, there are some people.

1099
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,800
So I recorded a quick chat thing,

1100
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,040
a little message to people, eight minutes long.

1101
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:03,280
And as part of it, I talked about that if you're scared

1102
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,920
and feeling alone, I'm holding your hand.

1103
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,640
And some people really kind of took that

1104
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,080
and ran with it online to try to make sure

1105
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,000
that everybody knows that they're supported

1106
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,120
and that they're all connected

1107
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,200
and that nobody needs to feel alone.

1108
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,360
And it inspired me to take it one step further.

1109
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,200
And I had a bunch of awesome artists,

1110
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,800
including Kate Leth and David Pemberton

1111
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,120
and Taylor Smurls working on one for me

1112
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:30,240
and a ton of other people on Twitter submitted designs

1113
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,640
for I Am Holding Your Hand buttons that I am selling

1114
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,240
and the profits for it are going to support the ACLU.

1115
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,120
So if you're interested in checking them out,

1116
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,880
you can go to bit.ly forward slash I Am Holding Your Hand.

1117
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,720
All one word, all lowercase.

1118
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,600
And maybe buy a button for a good cause.

1119
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:53,120
And then also wearing the button could signal someone

1120
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,360
who needs to know in the moment that they're not alone.

1121
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,280
It could say like, hey, I'm here for you.

1122
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,480
That was kind of the impetus for the whole project.

1123
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,720
And if you find yourself needing to hear

1124
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,760
a little bit more in depth what I talked about

1125
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,760
on that eight minute recording,

1126
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,400
I've got it pinned to the top of my Twitter account

1127
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,920
and you can listen to it there.

1128
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,840
Thank you for your support.

1129
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:24,160
Is there anything else major on the horizon?

1130
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,120
One more thing, only cause I forgot to mention it last time.

1131
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:31,600
I did get a new Cincinnati P.O. Box set up.

1132
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,640
It's under Macro Shows content.

1133
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,960
Some people asked me with the baby being born

1134
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,640
if I had set that up yet, I did.

1135
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:46,400
It is P.O. Box 36384, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45236.

1136
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,280
So yeah, if you got stuff for all three of us,

1137
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,000
I know it's a pain, but it would really help

1138
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,320
if you would just send those to the boxes

1139
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,320
cause we don't live together and it just ends up,

1140
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,640
I don't want anything to get lost in the shuffle.

1141
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,440
I guess that's what I'm saying.

1142
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,440
Yeah, I also just want to say and I don't want to get too heavy

1143
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,520
cause I think that folks don't want more heavy stuff right now

1144
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:12,320
but like how much I appreciate this community

1145
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,040
and the support y'all show each other and us

1146
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,640
is like the kind of the thing that helped me get through

1147
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,320
when I guess when this goes up last week.

1148
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,360
So from the bottom of my heart, thank you all very much

1149
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,560
and we'll keep trying to make a fun show

1150
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:30,800
that you can listen to and just put all your-

1151
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,440
No, we're not gonna try, we're not gonna try.

1152
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,000
We're gonna do it.

1153
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,800
We're not gonna try.

1154
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,000
We're not gonna try, we're gonna fucking continue to do it

1155
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,840
and it's gonna be better than ever

1156
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,080
and everybody's gonna listen to it in the world.

1157
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,360
That one's a little over a bit of an overreach

1158
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,240
but we are gonna continue to be here.

1159
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,880
Nothing can stop this ever.

1160
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,560
I'm just like guys, I'm just like this Yahoo page is open

1161
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,920
and the ad is forget needing a gun.

1162
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,640
This tactical flashlight can blind a bear.

1163
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:07,040
And now it's a Philadelphia cream cheese advertisement.

1164
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,160
Yeah, it can blind a bear.

1165
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,200
If you click it, it links to fucking slow cooker recipes.

1166
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,680
There's just no consistency.

1167
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,560
There's no, no.

1168
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,520
Okay, Griffin, give me that final Yahoo.

1169
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:17,840
Yeah, thanks.

1170
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,520
Also thanks to John Roderick and Long Winters.

1171
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,800
Thank you to Maximum Fun.

1173

It's got all our shit.

1174
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,360
Okay, final Yahoo.

1175
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,760
Sent in by Morgan Davey.

1176
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:26,800
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

1177
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Robert.

1178
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,800
Robert, one loaded.

1179
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,480
It's from Robert.

1180
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,640
Everything's gonna be okay.

1181
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,440
Robert asks,

1182
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,120
what was that cartoon movie that had a bunch of cars?

1183
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,560
My name is Justin McElroy.

1184
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,680
I'm Travis McElroy.

1185
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,800
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1186
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,080
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1187
01:02:54,080 --> 01:03:00,160
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

1188
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,520
Instead of door busting for a plasma TV this Black Friday,

1189
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,560
how about you stay in and snag the best deal of all?
