1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you change your mind on the first in line Honey I'm still free take a chance on me

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you need me let me know I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh friends, dear, dear friends, we're here again, gathered around the internet to talk about life.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's my brother, my brother, and me, NBNBA and the Mamba.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I am Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm Griffin McElroy. Who's everyone rooting for in the 2010 World Cup?

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Honduras!

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Really?

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm, I'm rooting for America.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah, that's the correct answer. Thank you, Travis.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I don't think it matters. I've been loosely following it through everyone's tweets and Facebooks and Friendster updates and it sounds like every game is just tying.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So far the score for the World Cup is four to four.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What I've decided is not to root for anyone because if I make a choice I am rooting for soccer and that goes against everything I believe in.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So if you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This is an advice show for the modern era.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We take your questions, we answer them.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If you want to learn how to get your question answered by us, stay tuned at the end of the show.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We will provide that information.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Our first question comes to us from Mike.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
He writes from Gmail.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He says, I'm in a bit of a pickle.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh, Mike, that sounds bad.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I live in Columbus, Ohio where our annual community festival or ComFest is held every year on the last weekend of June.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I look forward to ComFest every year and it's usually the highlight of my summer.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Unfortunately, this year my family is planning a family reunion in Kentucky during the ComFest weekend.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm thinking of skipping the reunion in favor of ComFest at risk of disappointing my moms.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Do I fake sick?

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Should I just suck it up and go to the reunion?

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, Mikey.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Dude, you can't skip.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You can't skip ComFest.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Did you guys see the ComFest lineup this year?

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Who they got?

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Who's blowing it up?

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh my God.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
On the main stage.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
They got Black Diamond.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They're on Who.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
They've got Major Lazer.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Girl Talk.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's basically, they're replicating.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Are you making this up?

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
They're replicating the Burning Man 2007 lineup, which is a gold.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That was the best one.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That was totally the best one.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
ComFest looks bomb this year.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's what we're saying.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What's the lineup at the family reunion?

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Lineup at the family reunion is Uncle David.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's pretty much it.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's just Uncle David and his banjo.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No, fuck that.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Go to ComFest, dude.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I mean, your Uncle David's a competent banjo player, but you really can't, he's no Major Lazer.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You'll be surprised at how quickly you'll forget about a bad family reunion, but if

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
something crazy goes down at ComFest.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Have you thought about maybe merging the two events and inviting your family to ComFest?

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Be like, Uncle Dave's rolling on Molly over in the cool down tent.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
There's one important part here that we're forgetting, disappointing his mom, which makes

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
me think it's not really your decision, Mike.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You might feel like it is, but it's not.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This has already been made for you, Mike.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Have you considered kidnapping yourself?

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, shit.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Where did Mike go?

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He was kidnapped to ComFest.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I've always wanted to do that.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Black Diamond took him with his music.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If I had to live like I was dying, like Tim McGraw says, that would be the only thing

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I would do is pretend to have myself kidnapped.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's a good plan.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It works.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No skydiving, no Rocky Mountain climbing.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Mike, have yourself kidnapped.

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Nationwide manhunt.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It'll be a family reunion, but it'll be a family reunion based around praying for your

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
swift release.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Just make sure that Denzel Washington isn't your bodyguard or else he'll probably kill

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
a lot of innocent people trying to find you.

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Oh, man.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I got to watch that movie.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Dope movie.

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I want to watch that right now.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm getting off the podcast.

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm going to go watch that on fire.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
An anonymous user on FormSpring asks, I like my best guy friend, but I'm 95% sure he doesn't

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
like me like that.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What do I do?

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, I'm 95% sure you shouldn't do anything.

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You know, we get a lot of questions like that, and that is your boilerplate answer.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Where is your romanticism, Travis?

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I think that love conquers all.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Love is all.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But this is like saying, I really want to eat a peanut butter sandwich, but I'm 95%

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
sure I'm allergic to peanuts.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, that's a pretty hardy risk there to take.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You know what I mean?

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Risks are made to be took.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Plans are made to be broken.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If it is truly your best guy friend, then don't fuck that up.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I am a romantic.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Swallow those feelings.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Bottle them up.

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah, if you're 95% sure, what has he done to you?

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That means he spends 95% of the time you guys spend together, giving you the distinct impression

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
that he would not want to spend his life loving, laughing, living, and learning with you.

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Sarah, I'm having such a great time hanging out, but I would never ever date you, you

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
cow.

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I would never want to convert this to anything romantic, Sarah.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't try and transform this into romance, you big animal.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No, I just want to know if you want to go to the snow cone place.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Listen, don't make this about you.

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I said no strings.

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You should get a boyfriend that's not me, because, oh, I retched a little just even

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
thinking about it.

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I just retched on my chucks.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You are a great friend, but a disgusting person.

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Cow.

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I am sick when I look at you.

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I've sickened, I'm the last single guy in my circle of friends, not me, and this is

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Warm Spring again, and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that all their wives slash girlfriends

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
profoundly dislike me.

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What can I do to cope with the awkward tension of any social gathering with my bros and

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
their hoes?

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't.

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Well, here's the suggestion.

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You want them to like you more.

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
God, man, from the jump.

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let me help you.

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Don't say hoes.

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah.

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Go ahead and avoid that.

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Stop saying hoes, and then pack your bags and move away.

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You're not wanted there.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Imagine this.

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
One of the next questions we get is like, I love all my friends, and they have a great

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
group of girlfriends, and we're all really close, but every once in a while, this zilch

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
comes around.

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
None of us like.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
How do we awkwardly tell them to pack his bags and move away?

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This guy sounds like a real Dupree.

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Owen Wilson.

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What I love about the question is he doesn't say, what can I do to stop the awkward tension?

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
He says, what can I do to cope with it?

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I know it's going to be there.

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I accept.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Ladies, I know this is weird.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I get it.

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's ride it out.

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I know I'm a terrible person, and you hate me, but let's just deal with it.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yahoo Answers user Mr. Stinky Booty asks, do I even need to anymore?

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No, keep going.

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He asks, my mom won't let me have a gun yet, and I want to hunt stuff.

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Can I just use an ax or a machete?

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes, you can.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh my god.

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Coolest kid ever.

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay, there's some problems to address.

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
One is the ambiguity, I think is the main problem.

165
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's not that he, it's not the spore of hunting.

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's that he doesn't need to kill, and he wants to kill stuff.

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Just whatever homes into his field of vision.

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
He's going to kill it.

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I have to imagine that he's a younger person.

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
By the way, I refreshed the page to see if any good answers had come up,

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and he has changed his name in the interim from when I loaded the page to when I refreshed the page

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
from Mr. Stinky Booty to True Survivor, which I think is pretty awesome.

173
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
To Dr. Stinky Booty.

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He must have had a rough afternoon.

175
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I think if he is a child, I would say eight years old,

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
if you can manage to catch an animal in the wilderness and kill it with an ax,

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
then I think he should be allowed to do that because it would be a real growing experience.

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Well, if he's eight, what kind of liberal mom has he got that's not letting him get a gun?

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
His index finger is working just fine.

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He needs to kill stuff.

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He needs to kill.

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And when you need something, that's a responsibility.

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Take living, breathing creatures and turn them into a pile of organic material.

184
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Just start that degrading process.

185
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hey, Food Size More wants to know on Twitter, he asked us,

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
is it ever appropriate to ask out your cute barista?

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Rarely.

188
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If you can accept that you're the 20th person that day to do it.

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah, cute barista is like begging for it.

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah.

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I think that there's something very safe about asking somebody who's in a service position.

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's almost kind of creepy.

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
They're already bringing you coffee, so maybe go off menu and ask them for their hand.

194
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I think it's a little weird.

195
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll take a date with you.

196
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Can I get a grande dinner and a movie?

197
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's pretty good.

198
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Here's the thing to keep in mind, she's getting paid to be nice to you,

199
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
so it gets into a tricky kind of, is she really being nice to me,

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
or is she doing her job kind of thing, and it's too precarious.

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I think it's too dangerous.

202
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I think we may have actually had this exact question in a prior episode.

203
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I think our answer then was, are you good looking?

204
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yes.

205
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Are you a good looking dude?

206
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's always appropriate.

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And it's always okay.

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
When she asks you your name to put on the cup, say Mr. Stinky Booty,

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and then if she continues talking to you, she must really like you.

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
9micor9, what?

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, you got it.

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay, 9micor9 from Twitter says,

213
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
My friend Arthur has never been in a fight and always complains about it when he's intoxicated.

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Should I punch him in the face?

215
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Oh shit, we got the best game for you, dude.

216
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You and your friend Arthur need to play Lockjaw.

217
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah.

218
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Lockjaw.

219
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Here's what you do.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You go to Arthur.

221
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You guys have both been drinking.

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You put your fist six inches, this is important, from his face.

223
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Then you say, Lockjaw, Lockjaw, Lockjaw, like that.

224
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And say it three times to give him plenty of warning for what's going to happen.

225
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And then you pop him.

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You pop him in the jaw.

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Now here's the important thing to think about this game is you take turns.

228
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Right.

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You are going to get it back.

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So whatever you dole out, you will get back to you.

231
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I think Arthur's problem isn't that he's never been punched in the face.

232
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Because I think everyone in some way has been punched in the face.

233
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I think there's a difference between the controlled environment of Lockjaw and just a primal, just a rage fight.

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Just a cathartic, uncontrolled punch festival.

235
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I've never been in one.

236
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I got punched in the face one time when I was six years old by John Crider.

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Because I cut in the four square line.

238
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Asshole.

239
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
God, I know.

240
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You were asking for it.

241
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I really was.

242
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And he was like seven feet tall.

243
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And he laid me right out.

244
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Why did a teacher punch you?

245
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
No, he was an adult. He was a man child.

246
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't know.

247
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It was one of those jack deals.

248
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But I think you should probably punch your friend in his face.

249
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah.

250
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's what I'm saying.

251
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We took the long way around.

252
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
No harm could possibly come from this.

253
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
He won't be upset too.

254
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Because then you can be like, hey, you asked about it.

255
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Don't punch your friend in the face.

256
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What's the proper etiquette for the following situation, guys?

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Etiquette time.

258
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Put your etiquette hats on.

259
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Etiquette.

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I am walking one way, and a person passing me going the other way says something along the lines of, how are you doing?

261
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Am I supposed to tell them how I am doing?

262
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That involves too much conversation.

263
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Plus then I feel required to ask them how they are.

264
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
This can end up taking too much time.

265
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
If I say nothing, then that is rude.

266
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Am I supposed to just say it back?

267
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh, man.

268
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Here's my suggestion.

269
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Turn around and start walking beside them and just start talking.

270
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Well, I'm glad you asked.

271
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I've been having a rough day and just give them really personal details and teach them a lesson about being polite.

272
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I got this a lot in college.

273
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm sure everyone has.

274
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You got one of those faces.

275
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Sure.

276
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I mean, I knew a lot of people at my college, but I wasn't friends with a lot of people at my college.

277
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So I would be walking in a class and would pass somebody in the commons, as the kids say.

278
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And they would give me a, hey, what's up?

279
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And there's no way that you can answer that question.

280
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You have to measure out the distance between you two, and are you supposed to slow down?

281
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Or do they really want to know what's up?

282
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Or is that just their way of saying hi?

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So this is so pathetic, and you're going to think I'm joking, but it's totally the truth.

284
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
If I ever saw somebody in the distance walking my way that I thought I knew, totally I would fake a phone call.

285
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh.

286
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh, yeah, I can't.

287
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Sorry.

288
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's my dentist.

289
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You know what?

290
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I would mock that, but I was about to say the most awkward thing is when you make eye contact from like 40 feet away,

291
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and then you have that entire 40 feet of walking at each other, where it's like, well, I've already acknowledged that I kind of know them,

292
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and now I get a long time to not remember who they are.

293
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Oh, but now I got this phone call.

294
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm going to just look at the ground because this conversation is so intense.

295
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I need to focus on my feet.

296
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Why don't you go with staring right in the eye, say, what do you care pervert?

297
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And then push him down a well.

298
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Or just say, what the fuck is that supposed to mean?

299
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Because what I'm saying to you is if you do that once, you will never have this problem again solved.

300
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Because they won't want to be your friend anymore.

301
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Solved for good.

302
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Also, what you can do is just repeat their question back at them.

303
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They don't care.

304
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What is up?

305
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
How are you doing?

306
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
How are you doing?

307
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yahoo Answers user Aisha asks, what is my body shape?

308
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,000
She expounds on that initial question saying, I'm finding it really hard to know what my body shape is.

309
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I think I'm an hourglass, but then again, my measurements make me wonder if I am a spoon or even a rectangle.

310
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's waist 31, hip 37, bust 37.5.

311
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Not that that matters.

312
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The comedy in this situation.

313
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Have you ever heard the term?

314
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah, she's got this fine little spoon frame.

315
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Is it upside down spoon?

316
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
She's got herself a real tight rectangular chassis.

317
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
She's got that dodecahedron going.

318
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You know what's up.

319
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
She's got one of those figure eights.

320
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You know what I'm talking?

321
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah, real good.

322
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Little in the middle.

323
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Here's my question.

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Did she attach a picture?

325
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Profile.

326
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
She's got a body like a pie symbol.

327
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The symbol for pie.

328
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
She doesn't have a torso.

329
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Just two wide legs.

330
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Two wide legs, no torso.

331
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Looking real good.

332
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Is there a pic?

333
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Is there a picture?

334
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No pics.

335
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
No pics?

336
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That's a random question to ask without people being able to see you.

337
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That's like asking the question, what color shirt am I wearing?

338
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's something you would know better than me.

339
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah, to answer your question, you're shaped like a stupid person.

340
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Big, stupid refrigerator.

341
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Big, stupid refrigerator.

342
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Open up the door, get some ass and pickles, and you're stupid still.

343
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Some of my coworkers have asked me to go out on a night out.

344
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Okay, let me start again.

345
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Some of my coworkers, I'll edit that out and post,

346
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
some of my coworkers have asked me to go on a night out,

347
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
but they want to go to a strip joint during the night.

348
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Is there any way I can persuade them to do other stuff?

349
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Strip joints make me feel gross and pervy.

350
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Do you know why they make you feel gross and pervy?

351
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Because people you don't know come and put their privates near,

352
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
around, and on you.

353
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It is gross and pervy.

354
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It is legitimately gross and pervy.

355
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
If you ever go to a strip joint and leave feeling classy and clean,

356
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
then you were not at a strip joint, my friend.

357
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You were at a burlesque show, perhaps.

358
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You were at an IHOP.

359
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You were at an AutoZone and you embarrassed yourself.

360
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
This is the weirdest strip joint ever, but these pancakes are delightful.

361
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Wow, can I have some more cream?

362
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What? Are you serious?

363
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yay. Here's the answer.

364
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You look them dead in the eyes and you tell them the stone truth

365
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
that they're your coworkers and you get paid to be around them.

366
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So unless someone's going to cut a check,

367
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
you're going to go home to your family who you love.

368
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yep.

369
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's what I say.

370
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What if the strip joint is his family?

371
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Did you think about that?

372
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The problem is the strippers are my real family.

373
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Well then, yeah, that's gross and pervy, my man.

374
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yeah, that's why you're so grossed out,

375
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
because that's your Aunt Deborah.

376
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You also got to consider, if you work at a Hallmark store

377
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and your coworkers want to take you out to a strip joint,

378
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
how awkward is it going to be once you've seen them in that environment?

379
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Once you've seen Pamela get all messed up

380
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
during kegs and eggs and legs Thursday mornings,

381
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
you can't look at her the same way ever again.

382
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Amateur night, what's up? Pamela, no.

383
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Here's what you need to do.

384
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Sue your business for sexual harassment.

385
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I've seen these videos.

386
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That's a classic example of sexual harassment.

387
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Get paid, son.

388
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You know what you do with that money?

389
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Go to a strip joint.

390
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Make it rain.

391
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
To convince them to do something, to get out of this,

392
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
all you need to do is, when your coworker asks,

393
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
sit on their lap and say, I can just get it started right now.

394
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
If I go to the strip club, I can bring the strip club to you.

395
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Anyplace I go is a strip club.

396
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Look at this zipper.

397
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's halfway down just through this sentence.

398
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
All my clothes are tearaway.

399
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm going to demonstrate, but they're not tearaway.

400
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
See this suit? It's a nice suit, right? Watch this.

401
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Rip.

402
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I use the bus a lot, and I thought I could use that time

403
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
to practice my less-than-stellar social skills.

404
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
How can I start a conversation with people

405
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
without coming off as either creepy or annoying?

406
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'd love to meet some new people to hang out with.

407
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah, this is a toughie.

408
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
This is something that I have a lot of problems with sometimes,

409
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
is just seeing a stranger where you don't have a good opening,

410
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and you might as well start a conversation.

411
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I mean, this is where the classics and sort of boring,

412
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
like how about this weather, kind of plays in.

413
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
This is why people talk about the weather,

414
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
so it's always above you unless you're a spaceman,

415
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and then you're just fucked.

416
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You know what? I actually have a trick

417
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
that I finally coined a phrase for,

418
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and it's beautifully awkward.

419
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's always going to be awkward, so acknowledge that.

420
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I went to a show the other day,

421
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and there was this girl that was in the show

422
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
that came out afterwards, and I'm pretty sure I met her.

423
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I looked at her, and I said,

424
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I don't know your name. I think I met you,

425
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
but I don't know your name.

426
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We were right out there and honest about it,

427
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
and we got into a conversation about how we couldn't remember each other.

428
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So you just confront the awkwardness full on.

429
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Full on. That's the Travis approach.

430
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah. Just like if you're on the bus, just be like,

431
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
hey, I know it's creepy, but I just wanted to say I really like your shoes.

432
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Or something like that, where you say,

433
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
hey, I didn't want to interrupt you, I didn't want to bother you,

434
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
but that's a great jacket.

435
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What if you try and pull that game, though,

436
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
and it's like, I think your face is familiar,

437
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and I think that I know,

438
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
but I don't know how we are acquainted,

439
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and then it's like, I am your aunt.

440
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm your aunt.

441
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That's just a serious problem.

442
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You're putting singles into my G-string.

443
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
This is awkward.

444
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What I normally end up doing,

445
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I had to do a lot of this when I was working at the newspaper.

446
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I had to do a lot of man on the street interviews, stuff like that.

447
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Justin McElroy, the Justin McElroy you know,

448
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
with any luck love, internet gadabout,

449
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
media personality, cost celeb,

450
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
not cost celeb, I do have many cost celebs that I care about,

451
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
whales and things.

452
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't go up to people,

453
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
but I can pretend to be the sort of person that goes up to people.

454
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
In my mind, just decide that you're that kind of person.

455
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That's not really you, but they don't know you,

456
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
so they don't know shit.

457
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
They don't know anything about how awkward you are,

458
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
so you just trick them and pretend you're not an awkward person.

459
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Or put in those ear buds,

460
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
keep your eyes closed.

461
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Here's the beautiful thing about the bus,

462
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and any kind of situation like that,

463
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
you're only going to have to deal with that awkwardness

464
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
for like five minutes.

465
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's a perfect time to practice doing that.

466
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yeah, you got an exit plan.

467
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
If it fails, then you're quiet for the rest of the time.

468
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I don't think you can meet people though.

469
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I can't meet people.

470
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm moving to Chicago soon.

471
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't know how I'll be able to have the focus required

472
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
to meet people when I know that I'm in an airtight tube

473
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
that's full of pathogens and maybe terrorists.

474
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You need a starter that you can always bring with you.

475
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
A baby is good, or you can get a dog is good,

476
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
or you can get one of those giant pinwheel lollipops

477
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
and just in the bus just go to town on it.

478
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
They're going to look because you're being so loud

479
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
with the slurping and licking, and when they look,

480
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
just be like, you want to get down on this?

481
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And that's a great way to get down on this sucker with me.

482
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
These right here, these are moon shoes.

483
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I want to get to know you.

484
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Always carry skis with you.

485
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
A bouncer.

486
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yeah, I'm off to ski.

487
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm going to skiing mountain.

488
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Yahoo Answers user Dakota's Mommy asks,

489
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
help me name my mobile spray tanning business.

490
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Any suggestions would be appreciated.

491
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It is a spray tan business where I travel to your home.

492
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Please let me know what name you like the best.

493
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Caribbean tan to go, Caribbean tan to you,

494
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
tropical tan to you, tropical tan to go,

495
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
beach tan to go, beach tan to you,

496
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
tropic tan to go, tropic tan to you.

497
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
When I read this, I didn't read it very well, I guess,

498
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and I just read the words mobile spray tanning business

499
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
and I thought of like a food truck.

500
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It would see these pale people on the street

501
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and just like pull over and be like, hey,

502
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
just hop in this bus with really tinted windows

503
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and take all of your clothes off and I'm going to spray you

504
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
with oils and you're going to be darker when you get out of it.

505
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It's basically just like a mobile rape den,

506
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
but I guess if it comes to your home.

507
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I think the important part about naming any business

508
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
is looking to the future, seeing how your business

509
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
is going to grow and change and kind of trying to anticipate that.

510
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So I recommend bankruptcy.

511
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
How about casing the joint?

512
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Let me in your house and I'll spray you with stuff.

513
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Dark skin spray, here it comes.

514
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Dark soes.

515
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Van and tan.

516
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I don't think that we have a good one for her.

517
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I really don't want to give up on Dakota's mom

518
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
because she's had a hard year and I think she could use

519
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
any assistance we could afford her.

520
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:38,000
How about you call it the Dakota Memorial spray tanning mobile station?

521
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And then people say, oh, I'm so sorry, did your daughter die?

522
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And you look them straight in the eye and say, someday.

523
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And then see if they still want to spray tan.

524
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I bet you they will want to look youthful and full of life

525
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
and vigor more than they ever have before and you will be able

526
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
to really get them on the add-ons.

527
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Like the complimentary fake teeth.

528
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
How about spray tan for shut-ins?

529
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Because they can't get the UV rays, the vitamin D

530
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
that you really need to get a good base going.

531
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So I think that maybe you should just put your target audience

532
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
right in the name.

533
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I say name it all over tan, which has a double euphemism there,

534
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
a double entendre, where one, you're all over the city,

535
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
you're traveling, but also that awkward moment where they have

536
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
to get naked in front of you.

537
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So just all over tan.

538
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
That's copyrighted.

539
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Hey guys.

540
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Oh yeah, sorry.

541
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Hi gentlemen.

542
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I live in Connecticut and I just started dating a guy in NYC.

543
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm gay, by the way.

544
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Ew.

545
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Come on, come on.

546
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
We were all thinking that.

547
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We get along great and I think this has some real potential.

548
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Congratulations.

549
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Okay.

550
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
The only mismatch is that he likes to go out all the time

551
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
and I'm more of a homebody.

552
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
How can I make this work?

553
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Wow, I have that exact, I have had that exact same problem

554
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
in my relationship.

555
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I feel like we've kind of dealt with it.

556
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You dated a dude in New York City?

557
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yep.

558
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
No, Griffin.

559
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I've been a homebody.

560
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I am someone who likes to stay at home.

561
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I don't like to go out.

562
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And Sydney, especially when we were still in college,

563
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
she liked to go out a lot.

564
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And what's hard is that for all the things in relationships

565
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
where like you want to be with somebody that you click with,

566
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
inevitably there's going to be something that is just,

567
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
it's endemic to who you are and it's not going to change

568
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
and it's not complimentary with your partner.

569
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Be that man or woman.

570
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You're going to find things like that in a relationship

571
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and the best thing to do is not to hope that it gets better.

572
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The best thing to do is to confront it like grownups

573
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and say I feel differently than you do,

574
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
but let's work it out.

575
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Let's go out three nights a week and stay in three nights a week.

576
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You're going to have to give and he's going to have to give.

577
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And the good news is that it's perfect.

578
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I think that that is the perfect setup

579
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
because if you both wanted to go out all the time,

580
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
that would get old and if you were both homebodies

581
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and wanted to stay home all the time, that would get old.

582
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
This way you can kind of split the difference

583
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
and it's a better match than you think

584
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
because if you were both one or the other,

585
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
it gets really old.

586
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm kind of in a similar situation but roles reversed

587
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
where I like to go out and Teresa likes to stay home

588
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
and so there's nights when she's not feeling it

589
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and I'm like all right, great, we'll stay home

590
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and we'll watch Avatar and hang out

591
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and then there's nights where I really want to go out

592
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and she's like all right, let's go

593
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
and it's a compromise kind of situation.

594
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I go out and stay home on my own damn schedule.

595
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
All right.

596
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And sad.

597
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And this has been the Lonely Heart Corner with Griffin.

598
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It's a regular feature on the show.

599
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Go to sleep earlier, you dummy.

600
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Let's lonely times.

601
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So here's the deal.

602
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Let me give it to you straight, Griff.

603
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Back in February, I met a girl who's with the Marine Corps.

604
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
At that time, I was in the process of joining but hadn't yet.

605
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You guys know that I know his pronounced core right now.

606
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I don't think they appreciate it when you actually say the words

607
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
in conjunction with each other.

608
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yeah, together they weren't, I didn't map it out.

609
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I needed to think about that a little bit more.

610
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Thank you for your service.

611
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
We became friends and I started liking her.

612
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Now I've sworn into the USMC and it turns out she likes me.

613
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But if we get into a relationship,

614
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
it could technically be considered fraternization.

615
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
What should I do?

616
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Tristan.

617
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
That's some hot shit.

618
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Man, this sounds like a Richard Gere movie.

619
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I love it.

620
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Sounds like a...

621
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
This is scintillating.

622
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Danielle Steel.

623
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Court-martial at the heart.

624
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Heartbreak on the waves.

625
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
An officer and an officer.

626
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Of differing genders.

627
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Important to note.

628
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Not that there's anything wrong with that,

629
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
especially love on the high seas.

630
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
You find out where you can get it, right?

631
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Did you join the USMC to be closer?

632
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Because if so, you did not plan this shit out, my man.

633
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I'll say this.

634
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
This is friend of the show, Tristan.

635
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
He is dedicated to serving our country.

636
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I've been talking to him for a while now

637
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
about his dedication to the country.

638
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Thanks again, Tristan.

639
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Doing a bang-up job of it.

640
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You're doing great.

641
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah, go ahead and fraternize.

642
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Hey, how about this?

643
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
How about this, Tristan?

644
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
We're at war.

645
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
How about you put your mind on your duty?

646
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
No, no.

647
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
To protect me and my freedom.

648
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Dude, listen.

649
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Tristan is doing something.

650
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I listen.

651
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
The three of us could never do.

652
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I have a busy schedule,

653
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
and I need people to protect me day in and day out.

654
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And Tristan is thinking about swoopin' Poon,

655
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
and I need him to be thinking about swoopin' Osama

656
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and getting him into the tunnels and go get him.

657
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
But with that constant...

658
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
He might be on the water.

659
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
That's why we haven't found him.

660
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
With that constant, beautiful reminder

661
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
of swoopable Poon right next to him

662
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
as he's fighting side by side

663
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
against Osama's evil forces, against the axis of evil,

664
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
he's gonna fight that much harder

665
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
because he knows he has something to protect,

666
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
and so will she.

667
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm saying that if anyone's gonna take down Osama,

668
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
it's gonna be Tristan or his girlfriend, Isolde.

669
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And by which I mean anyone.

670
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Personally, Tristan will be the one,

671
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and that will make the end of that movie so much better.

672
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Tristan's gonna take him down.

673
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
His girlfriend's gonna hold the camera up

674
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
while he is hog-tying him.

675
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
He's gonna make Osama bin Laden say,

676
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
my brother, my brother, and me is the best podcast.

677
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
What if you only have time, though?

678
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
What if he's put into the classic Batman situation?

679
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Oh, God.

680
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You know, where it's like...

681
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
He has to either save our podcasters, girlfriend...

682
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
If you go this way, you can capture Osama

683
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and promote my brother, my brother, and me.

684
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
If you go the other way, you'll save your girlfriend.

685
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
What do you do?

686
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I didn't think about it like that.

687
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I trust Tristan to figure out the correct choice.

688
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Yeah.

689
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Which is, I think you throw the girlfriend at Osama.

690
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah.

691
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And then you shoot him...

692
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You shoot Osama, and it's like...

693
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You take it, but you wing him, right?

694
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And you take him in.

695
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You're a hero, and who cares who you fraternize with?

696
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
This is the solution.

697
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Catch Osama, and you can fraternize with whoever the fuck you want.

698
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I love it.

699
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You're a national hero.

700
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I already think he's a national hero.

701
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Okay, okay.

702
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You just go ahead and do whatever you want, Tristan.

703
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Yeah.

704
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Ain't no law against it.

705
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
There might actually be...

706
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Except for the laws that are definitely against it.

707
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I think there actually is.

708
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I will grant you regional hero at this point,

709
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
but not like a national, like global hero,

710
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
except to people who hate our country.

711
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's my hero.

712
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
P-dunk.

713
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Not a good start, but keep going.

714
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Hey, guys.

715
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Is it wrong to be in a long-term relationship with a girl,

716
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
even though you know it's not going to be a happily ever after kind of thing?

717
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And if so, how long is too long?

718
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
P-dunk, why are you wasting your time?

719
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah.

720
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Why are you wasting her time?

721
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah.

722
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Boo, yeah.

723
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Does she know?

724
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Yeah, that's the thing.

725
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I think that might be step one,

726
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
and then maybe we can plan out a future after that.

727
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Let me give you that future.

728
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Living alone.

729
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
No, you guys are living in the future.

730
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
P-dunk, you got to live in the present.

731
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
If you're having a good time with her,

732
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
even though you know that it's, you know,

733
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
she ain't marriage material, or maybe you're not.

734
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
That doesn't make any sense.

735
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
But the problem, Griffin, is long-term relationship.

736
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It's one thing to go on a couple dates with a girl knowing it's not going to work out.

737
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
It's another to be with a girl for like a year and a half,

738
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
but sitting there thinking, well, this is going to end in February.

739
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Like, we've talked about this before.

740
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Once you make that decision that this isn't going anywhere,

741
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
you're never coming back from that.

742
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And he could miss out on like the special somebody of his life

743
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
because he's dating this spoon-shaped harpy.

744
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
P-dunk, I'm going to be just brutally honest here.

745
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I would call that behavior selfish because it's saying,

746
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I don't want to be alone right now,

747
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
and then I'll keep my options open if something else comes along.

748
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
So should we break up with P-dunk's girlfriend for him right now on the show?

749
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Oh, God, yeah, our first breakup.

750
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Hey, Margaret.

751
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Hey, Margie.

752
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Hey, spoon-shaped harpy.

753
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Listen, we don't know anything about you except that you don't make our boy P-dunk happy enough.

754
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You are a marriage material, my babe.

755
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Sorry.

756
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
You've done good.

757
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
You've put in a good effort.

758
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But your 100% just wasn't good enough for the dunk.

759
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And you know what?

760
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
All the pressure off him, he didn't say a word to us.

761
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
We made this decision after observing how you guys were together.

762
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So don't be mad at him, be mad at us.

763
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And Margot, you can do better.

764
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
He calls himself P-dunk unironically.

765
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Is that the kind of guy you want to take home to meet your folks?

766
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
You can't do better, though, because P-dunk is, I mean, he's a solid dude.

767
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
He's a good dude.

768
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
He helped me move, gave me a ride to the airport.

769
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So you just got to come and pack up your shit.

770
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I have a conundrum.

771
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Okay.

772
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
This is from Stacy.

773
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Here are my brother and my brother and me.

774
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
We turn conundrums into funundrums with our advice.

775
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
My brother and I, my boyfriend and I.

776
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yowza.

777
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Yowza.

778
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
My boyfriend and I are celebrating our three-year anniversary in a week or so.

779
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You should know that.

780
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Maybe you want to pin down that date, Stace.

781
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Unfortunately, I'm far away in grad school and dealing with crazy family times.

782
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
This is where you come in.

783
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I need ideas for gifts, and I am certain he would love anything you suggested.

784
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Well, shit, Stacy.

785
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Thanks for telling us so very much about him to base this decision on.

786
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So like an object, a physical object in the world.

787
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
A gun rack.

788
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Let's just, let's just.

789
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
A mug, a nice mug.

790
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
A segue.

791
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
A printer.

792
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
A chalice.

793
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
A lamp.

794
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
A guitar tuner.

795
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I'm looking at things on my desk.

796
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
A jar of jawbreakers.

797
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I'm just looking at things.

798
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
A leg lamp.

799
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
You know what's good?

800
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
A guitar.

801
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Not just a gift, but a hobby.

802
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
You know?

803
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Here's the important thing.

804
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
What about a high-quality webcam for both you and him, and then you can have video chats.

805
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I like that.

806
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
From far away from each other.

807
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I think that that's good.

808
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
On any anniversary gift, the important thing is to, it's a test.

809
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
To prove how well you know them.

810
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It is.

811
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So get them something.

812
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Get your bow something that is specific to him.

813
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Get him a bowstaff!

814
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Get him a crossbow with which he can blink in the wild.

815
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
A crossbow that shoots bowstaffs.

816
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
A giant bow shooting crossbow.

817
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
A bow crossbow.

818
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
A bow crossbow.

819
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
A ballista.

820
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
A crossbow that shoots bows.

821
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
A barista.

822
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
A crossbow that shoots baristas, and then you go to jail for murder.

823
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Because you just shot a Starbucks employee.

824
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Why did you do that?

825
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Stacy, that was the worst present ever.

826
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I got you this dead Starbucks employee.

827
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I got you a boom rat for murder.

828
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You're going to want to leave the country.

829
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
No, I think the webcam's a car.

830
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Three year, that's a car, right?

831
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Three year's the car.

832
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Fourth year's the dead stuff.

833
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I want to ask a question.

834
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Well, someone else asked it, but I want to read it.

835
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It's from a website called Yahoo.

836
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
User Just Another Human asked,

837
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Is it weird to like animated characters more than real life people?

838
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Let's say a cartoon figure, I think.

839
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Depending on the cartoon, some females look astonishingly beautiful.

840
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And usually they have a great personality.

841
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I start to imagine how it would be to date such a character.

842
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And the outcome is, it's better than real life.

843
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I don't really like real life females much.

844
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Most of them, not all, are really superficial.

845
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And usually just want something from you.

846
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Don't misunderstand.

847
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I can clearly see the line between fantasy and real life.

848
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's just that fantasy is so much more appealing to me.

849
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Hey, buddy.

850
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Can we talk about, like, okay,

851
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
your problem with women is that they're superficial.

852
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And you're telling me you're attracted to celluloid people.

853
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm in love with Warcraft Avatar.

854
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I like how they're only two dimensional,

855
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
and they don't talk back.

856
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And I can turn it off.

857
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
That's pretty nice.

858
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And they're glossy.

859
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
If this guy finds out that those things were animated by real life people,

860
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
and written dialogue by real life people,

861
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
and voiced by real life people, he's going to lose his shit.

862
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Please, nobody tell him that.

863
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Here's the funny thing.

864
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
This is the Yahoo Answers equivalent of the neighbor who says,

865
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
he always seemed like such a nice boy.

866
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Like, this is step one to ten years down the road,

867
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
he's killing women.

868
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
That's what the internet teaches us, right?

869
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
It's not that he was always such a nice guy.

870
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It's that you never read his posts on Yahoo Answers.

871
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Trust me, he was a monster the whole time.

872
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Real people are just too, they're like big sacks of blood.

873
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Don't you just want to stab them and see what's inside?

874
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Is that weird?

875
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Here's a pro tip, bro.

876
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
If you have to ask, is it weird?

877
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Yes.

878
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Odds are problems.

879
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
If you have to make the statement,

880
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I can clearly see the line between reality and fantasy,

881
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
you can't.

882
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
You can't see that line.

883
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
You are justifying.

884
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And you know it's bad when dude is like,

885
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I'm so crazy, but I'm going to step out of that.

886
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It's gotten to a point where I can actually sense my own perversion,

887
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
like rearing its head.

888
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Like, I don't think this is normal.

889
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I'm pretty sure it's weird.

890
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
But that's how weird it is, that like even me, a weird guy,

891
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
is like, I don't know, Ken.

892
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I'm going to be honest with you guys.

893
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I am freaking myself out.

894
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm freaking out by me, just me being alone.

895
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I'm freaked.

896
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So hopefully that'll help you, Kev.

897
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Kevmo.

898
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You are a weird guy.

899
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Creepy Kev.

900
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I want to hear our last question, our one to grow on, if you will.

901
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But first I want to tell you how you can seek out our advice.

902
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Oh, hold on.

903
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I got a good one here.

904
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
From Delia.

905
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm 22 and a hopeless romantic.

906
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I've been blown away, not in a good way, from the desires of men that I meet.

907
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I don't see why it's so hard for a guy to take a girl out,

908
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
or at least open a door for her, buy a beer or dinner.

909
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
They all just want to screw and fool around.

910
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Why are you separating them?

911
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Do they mean different things than I thought they meant?

912
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
They just want to have sex and then put on clown costumes.

913
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I'm not saying that it's a bad thing, lol.

914
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm not looking for a serious relationship.

915
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
But why have men thought that dinner or drinks is no longer necessary?

916
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
It's making my loving heart sad.

917
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Keeping the ears open.

918
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Loving you three.

919
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Delia.

920
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Delia has a strange way of talking.

921
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But I dig it.

922
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I'm just saying.

923
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I dig it.

924
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It's strange.

925
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
But I dig it.

926
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I don't know, Delia.

927
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Chivalry is dead.

928
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Go to a church, Delia.

929
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
That's where you're going to meet a nice boy.

930
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Go to our Facebook appreciation group and meet a nice boy.

931
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
All gentlemen.

932
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
There are still gentlemen in the world.

933
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I open a door.

934
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Here's why.

935
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Those kinds of guys will do as little as they have to do.

936
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,000
So, you know, make sure you keep your standards strong and require them to do these things.

937
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And they will do them or just go out with a better quality of man.

938
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And keep in mind, 22 guys, 22, they're basically children.

939
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
They're like babies.

940
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
They don't know real skills like a man.

941
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
They really don't start to ripen and mature as a person until 23.

942
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
That's true.

943
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Take it.

944
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Yeah.

945
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Yeah.

946
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Take it from Griffin.

947
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Delia, date older men.

948
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Yeah.

949
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Date older men that go to church.

950
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Just go to your local church.

951
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Find the oldest guy you can.

952
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Jack up.

953
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Get hitched.

954
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Make sure he's got some do-re-mi in the back though, if you know what I mean.

955
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Can't buy the cow and milk it.

956
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And then you drink the milk and make you strong and then you kick a dude.

957
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I think I messed up the metaphor.

958
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Yeah, I think so.

959
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I want to hear Griffin's laugh.

960
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Also, Delia, I'm confused by your email.

961
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Are you down to bone?

962
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Because...

963
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Or do you want to fool around?

964
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That's all that I was getting.

965
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You know what?

966
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It may be that you are sending out the wrong signals that you're down to bone on the 24th

967
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
set.

968
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Maybe you should scale it back a little bit.

969
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Maybe wear something more conservative.

970
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Go ahead and lock that up.

971
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
That's your treasure.

972
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Maybe when you meet a new person, this is a great way to meet somebody on the bus.

973
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Hi, my name is Delia and I'm not down to bone.

974
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Yes.

975
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So don't even try it.

976
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Don't even try it.

977
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But do you like Scrabble?

978
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Because I will play some Scrabble with you tonight.

979
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I will play Scrabble.

980
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Or your tiles.

981
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
The road to passion is on lockdown, if you know what I'm saying.

982
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
That's not even a metaphor.

983
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's just on lockdown.

984
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
But then feel free to give it up on second date.

985
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Second date.

986
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I think you got to go naked date, too.

987
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I want to hear the last question in actuality now.

988
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I'm not just threatening to hear it.

989
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
But I want to tell you how you can seek out our advice.

990
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
As always, these messages are available on mybrotherandmybrotherandme.com, which is not

991
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
a website.

992
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
M-B-M-B-A-M.com is.

993
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Glad to say this has been a really well oiled show.

994
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Really.

995
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Yeah, really working the kinks out for sure.

996
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Well, we've all been burning the candles at both ends and a little bit in the middle.

997
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Yeah.

998
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
So just bear with it.

999
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Yeah, just hang in there.

1000
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
You can get us on Twitter.

1001
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Use the hashtag M-B-M-B-A-M.

1002
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
We read all those always.

1003
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
We see them as soon as you say them.

1004
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
If you want to get to us directly, that's a great way to do it.

1005
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
At M-B-M-B-A-M is our Twitter account.

1006
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
If you want to find out what's new, what's the latest.

1007
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Want to make a love connection or maybe just meet a friend.

1008
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Go to our Facebook group.

1009
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Huge thread on Facebook.

1010
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Huge thread on Facebook about meetings.

1011
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Is it really?

1012
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Yeah, it's blowing up.

1013
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
If you want to go there, just meet people, make a new friend.

1014
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
There's no evidence of actual...

1015
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I haven't seen any evidence of kids swapping tartar sauce yet, but I'm hoping in the near,

1016
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
near future.

1017
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
You want them to get down and swap it.

1018
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And it goes without saying, picks only, no fatties.

1019
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Picks only, please.

1020
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
We're professionals here, providing a professional service.

1021
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Thank you so much.

1022
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Thank you.

1023
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Yeah.

1024
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
You guys have been so great.

1025
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Everything is growing.

1026
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
It's on the G-R-O-W tip.

1027
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Every day we are expanding our reach, our influence.

1028
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:22,000
We've been in the top 20 on iTunes for the last, episode wise, for the last two weeks.

1029
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Have we?

1030
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yeah.

1031
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
We also want to remind you, as always, to not do anything that we say to do.

1032
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Don't listen to a...

1033
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
God damn word.

1034
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
But do tell a friend.

1035
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Tell a friend.

1036
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Burn a CD.

1037
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
You can fit two episodes of our show on a CD and you can give that to a friend.

1038
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Subscribe to the podcast on iTunes, drop a review.

1039
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Whatever.

1040
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
You know what we need.

1041
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Just give it to us, Delia.

1042
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
We need your love.

1043
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
We need your love, please.

1044
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Your treasure.

1045
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
It's the second date.

1046
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Griffin, what's our last question?

1047
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
This question comes to us from Christian.

1048
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Just Christian.

1049
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Who asks, what is Justin Bieber's cell phone number?

1050
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I'm Justin McElroy.

1051
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I'm Travis McElroy.

1052
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm Justin Bieber.

1053
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
My Bieber, my Bieber and me.

1054
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:52,000
You never know me.

1055
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
You never know me.
