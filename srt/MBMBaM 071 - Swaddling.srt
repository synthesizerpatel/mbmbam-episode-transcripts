1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,720
Ladies and gentlemen, we are recording this on September 11, 2011, which is of course

6
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,200
10 years after the tragic terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. In times of strife,

7
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:12,160
we look to some of our generation's wisest men. You, you work all night, and when you work,

8
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:21,680
you don't feel all right. And when things stop feeling all right, and everything is all right,

9
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,480
we will never-

10
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:30,880
I'm gonna stop right here. It sounds like you're suggesting that people have a 9-11 party.

11
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,960
No, I'm not saying people need to have a 9-11 themed party. What I'm saying is,

12
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,680
in the face of opposition, in the face of tragedy, in the face of suffering,

13
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,080
we get a party going. Now it's time to party, and we'll party hard. Let's get a party going,

14
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,760
let's get a party going. When it's time to party, we will always party hard, party hard.

15
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,520
Party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard, party hard.

16
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,760
Let's do a show. This is my brother, my brother, me, in a vice show for the modern era,

17
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,240
undaunted by terrorism. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

18
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,120
I'm Travis McElroy.

19
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,920
I am Griffin McElroy. You know, it's a shame.

20
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:10,960
What? Yeah.

21
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,160
You know, it's a real shame.

22
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,680
Yeah. We just talked about it.

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,800
Yeah. But also, I'm looking at the observances, because we forgot to do them last week,

24
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,360
and spoiler alert, we're gonna do them later this show, but I'm looking at the daily observances.

25
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,040
And September 11th has Patriot Day and Remembrance Day, which makes sense.

26
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,960
September 11th is how? Depending on your political affiliation, presumably.

27
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,240
September 11th is also National Hug Your Hound Day, and I feel like people, I feel like that,

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,560
I feel like there's a lot of unhugged hounds out there. I feel like they get lost in the shuffle.

29
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,840
Mm-hmm. Yes. Is it also called 9-11 Day? Am I making that up?

30
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,480
No, I think Patriot Day is-

31
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,240
9-11, wait, hold on, hold on.

32
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,560
I feel like I've heard it called 9-11 Day.

33
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,920
Are you suggesting to me that September 11th is also

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,400
colloquially or officially referred to as 9-11 Day?

35
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,920
This might only be at my local supermarket where they're offering 50% off American flags.

36
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,840
Still doing it, huh?

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,720
Mm-hmm. Still doing that thing.

38
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,480
And you know what? I think what I hate most about 9-11 Day is how commercial it's become.

39
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,160
It's just run by the greeting card and tiny American flag companies.

40
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:37,840
Here's a fun fact. This is one of those crazy years where September 11th is also

41
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,920
National Grandparents Day. It's the first Sunday after Labor Day that's today. It's September 11th.

42
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:50,560
And I feel like hounds and grandparents are going to be underappreciated on this most faithful day.

43
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,840
I think that's probably- I would say, you know what? Take your time,

44
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,760
think about the people we lost on that day, and go hug your grandpa.

45
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,840
Or go hug your grandpa's dog.

46
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,680
Peepums, I love you. I love you, Peepums, but my mind is in other places.

47
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,800
It's elsewhere.

48
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,960
Baxter, which is the name of my hound, I am also sorry to you, but I just don't have the bandwidth.

49
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,400
People are listening to this on September 12th, and in a way I feel like it's-

50
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,080
they try to cauterize today. Expurgation of pity and fear, just get it all out.

51
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,440
And then today we're like reopening it, like we're digging around in there.

52
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,080
And now they feel bad because they didn't hug a dog.

53
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Good news tomorrow, people. It's National Boss Employee Exchange Day.

54
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,440
Can we take a moment to talk about the show Tomorrow People?

55
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,680
Yeah.

56
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,320
Yeah.

57
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,360
The Tomorrow People?

58
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,600
Yeah.

59
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
Today is National Tomorrow People Remembrance Day.

60
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
Remember that that was a pretty good show.

61
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,920
God, it was a wicked show.

62
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,560
It was a good show.

63
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,920
This is- our show is neither a September 11th memorial,

64
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,040
or a show about futuristic teens that can travel through time and space.

65
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,400
It's an advice show for the modern era.

66
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,320
And let's get into our first question.

67
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,720
I've started seeing this guy.

68
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,320
I like him a lot, and everything's going well.

69
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,920
But it's only been about two weeks, so it isn't very serious yet.

70
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,920
His birthday is in a couple weeks,

71
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,280
and I'm not sure what the expectation of me is this early in our relationship.

72
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,400
Do I buy him a gift?

73
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,080
Take him out to dinner?

74
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,920
Bake him a cake?

75
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,960
I'm still in school, so my budget is limited,

76
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,760
and I don't want to freak him out with something overly extravagant.

77
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,200
What's an appropriate birthday experience for a relationship

78
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,960
of not even a month my barely boyfriend's birthday?

79
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,160
Um, first off, I'm going to have to put the blame on you

80
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,480
for starting dating him at such a terrible time.

81
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,120
Yeah, don't start dating someone two weeks before their birthday,

82
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,560
or two weeks before Valentine's Day.

83
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,240
Or two weeks before Patriot Day.

84
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,200
Yep, it's a mistake.

85
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,720
Um, Christmas is the worst.

86
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,800
Because then there's all these expectations of like,

87
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,320
are you going to come over and like-

88
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,040
Oh yeah.

89
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,960
Chill with my fam, my peeps.

90
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,280
Then you have to worry about getting their family presents.

91
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,720
It's a little sticky morass.

92
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,280
This is my something.

93
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,680
Hey, I've had exactly 14 minutes of contact with you,

94
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,480
so I got you a walk in the clouds on DVD.

95
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,640
I think that don't take him to dinner,

96
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,560
because he's probably already got other plans.

97
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,560
Get him a gift.

98
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,240
That's cool, that's a cool bet.

99
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,640
Well you don't think he's going to do like a party

100
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,240
or his friends want to take him to drinks,

101
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,560
and he blows off his friends to go out to dinner

102
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,920
with his two-week girlfriend?

103
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,080
Well-

104
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,800
How was your birthday?

105
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,920
How was your birthday, Martin?

106
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,200
Uh, it was okay.

107
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,720
I'm super hungry.

108
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,080
I am just the most hungry,

109
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,000
because all my friends thought that the other friends

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,240
were going to take me to take me to Applebee's.

111
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,280
Pretty cool birthday.

112
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,040
I stayed in and I heated up a Marie Callender

113
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,720
stuffing and chicken and gravy in my stove,

114
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,400
and I ate it and I watched like half of Miss Congeniality 2.

115
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,680
To be fair, a Marie Callender pot pie is good at any time.

116
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,160
Except when it's your birthday and you're alone.

117
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,120
Except when it's your birthday

118
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,280
and you put a candle in it, unlit, and cry.

119
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,400
Oh, man.

120
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,720
Um, I think, okay, let's set a price point of gift.

121
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,200
What's the most you spend on a two-week boyfriend?

122
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,520
30.

123
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,400
You think 30?

124
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:12,640
Yeah.

125
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,160
30's too much.

126
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,360
20.

127
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,720
30 is too much?

128
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah, I would say a new release DVD, nothing more than that.

129
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,000
This is awkward, Travis, because you've just outed the fact

130
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,440
that I am rolling in so much Mad Scrilla,

131
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,840
and you've got some, you're working with table scraps.

132
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
Listen, it ain't about your budget.

133
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,000
It's about the statement you're making with the present.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,440
It is completely and entirely about your budget.

135
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,360
No, if you go and like buy a really nice present

136
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,120
that they're not expecting, well, no, wait.

137
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,200
I take that back, because it's different

138
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,280
because you're not exchanging presents.

139
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,800
If you are a rich dude

140
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,520
and you spend more on your free-range toilet paper

141
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,560
than your gift for your two-week girlfriend,

142
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,040
you are actual.

143
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,040
Torture-free, torture-free toilet paper.

144
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,080
Torture-free TP.

145
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,280
I'm gonna say spend a lot of money, set a precedent.

146
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,120
If you set a precedent and spend a lot of money,

147
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,280
then next time it's his turn to give you a present,

148
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,800
you've set the precedent that you get each other awesome things.

149
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,320
Oh, man, that would be terrible.

150
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,280
No, wait, it wouldn't.

151
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,280
Honey, I got you this Zune HD for Easter.

152
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,920
Holy shit, it's Easter.

153
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,440
I just need some Cadbury ice,

154
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,120
and you went and you busted out a Zune HD.

155
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,480
You're the best.

156
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,120
That's one thing.

157
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,480
This is an awesome idea.

158
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,320
So go nice, do something awesome.

159
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,320
Yeah, go like really good.

160
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
I don't think anybody feels like,

161
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,120
okay, listen, what's your worry?

162
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,280
The worry is that if you have to split up,

163
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,080
it'll be weird.

164
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,800
Is that the thing?

165
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,800
I think our worry is that

166
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,400
she's gonna get him something too awesome

167
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,160
and he's gonna realize she likes him a lot.

168
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,240
Really, that's what it is.

169
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,680
Oh, fuck it.

170
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,040
Just throw your hat over the fence.

171
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,560
Go buy him a Zune HD.

172
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,360
Yeah, dude.

173
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,320
Draw a line in the sand and say,

174
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,840
this is for serious.

175
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,320
Hey, I bought you this discontinued touchpad.

176
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,200
It's $100.

177
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,120
That's good because that says nice gift,

178
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,200
but hey, I'm budget conscious.

179
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,440
I'm all about charging forward as fast

180
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,800
and recklessly as you possibly can.

181
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,040
Sure.

182
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,760
Buy him a house.

183
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,320
Buy him house on DVD.

184
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,040
That's good stuff.

185
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
Hey, I'm really friendly

186
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,960
and I like to make lots of different friends.

187
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,440
I consider a lot of people my BFF.

188
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,680
Well, that's a logical fallacy,

189
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,040
but my mom says that it is not possible

190
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,800
for me to have so many BFFs.

191
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,840
How many can I have without being excessive?

192
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,160
And that's from your BFF, Sarah.

193
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,400
Two.

194
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,360
What?

195
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,040
That's how many you can have

196
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,320
when you start to get excessive.

197
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,920
BFF is best.

198
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,440
That's a superlative.

199
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,880
Best friend forever.

200
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,080
You can literally, literally only have one BFF

201
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,600
because even if you had a BFF that you would

202
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,720
eventually fall out with,

203
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,920
you could replace with another BFF

204
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,800
at some point in your life.

205
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,160
This is your BFF.

206
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,440
You're saying the forever part is what is-

207
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,520
If you declare someone your BFF,

208
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,040
you are cryo locked.

209
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,520
Locked in.

210
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,320
I think what I do to get around that,

211
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,200
the loophole I use is to qualify everything

212
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,120
as like this is my best Cincinnati friend.

213
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,640
This is my best Huntington friend.

214
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,560
This is my best friend since second grade.

215
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,200
And I'll tell you,

216
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,800
as someone who's been on the receiving

217
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,000
end of one of those compliments,

218
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,920
they go down real smooth.

219
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,840
Oh no, it ain't about them.

220
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,720
It's about me.

221
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,320
Just making myself feel better.

222
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,200
What were you?

223
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,680
I was his favorite brother in Huntington.

224
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,560
This person isn't talking about

225
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,320
geographically locating these friends.

226
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,640
They're just, can they have more BFFs?

227
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,600
I'm gonna throw this out.

228
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,800
They literally can't.

229
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,640
I think the problem is that it's something

230
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,600
we've talked about before

231
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,040
and that we throw out words

232
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,640
without really thinking about what they mean.

233
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
And it's probably that you like these people,

234
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,920
that they are your friends,

235
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,000
but are they your best friend?

236
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That seems like a stronger commitment

237
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,960
than you're really making here.

238
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,680
Like people that say,

239
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,720
I love my friends.

240
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,680
I love that guy.

241
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,640
I love this person.

242
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,400
And you're not thinking about what love means.

243
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,680
I think that your best friend

244
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,280
is a very special upper echelon thing

245
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,520
that you should save for someone

246
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,320
that's really important to you.

247
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,400
What I have done as I grew older

248
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,880
is I have sort of moved the goalpost back a little bit

249
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,720
in that I don't have that many friends.

250
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,520
I have many social acquaintances.

251
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,400
I have peers and cohorts and contemporaries.

252
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,440
But I don't have,

253
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,600
I've got like maybe five or six friends.

254
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,400
And then when it comes to like best friends,

255
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,960
I mean, man, if I had to pick,

256
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,480
that'd be tough.

257
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,280
A BFF?

258
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,400
I don't even think I'm old enough

259
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,440
for that kind of commitment.

260
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,120
No, it's a huge commitment.

261
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,080
People have to live in the world

262
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,240
for at least 30 years before you know what's up.

263
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,560
Yeah, just get less friends, everybody,

264
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,920
I think is the trick.

265
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,040
I just, you can't,

266
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,200
I don't care how many friends people have.

267
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,080
I don't care about telling people you love them even.

268
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,960
I would rather someone get divorced

269
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,280
and make those vows and then break them

270
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,680
than to have the English language

271
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,120
just sort of bandied about like a play thing.

272
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,600
If you say someone's your best friend forever,

273
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,840
you can never have another best friend

274
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,360
and you can never like someone,

275
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,800
like the use of the word forever

276
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,840
supersedes any sort of future relationships

277
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,640
that you might have.

278
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,760
That's forever.

279
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,240
And why can't people just be your friend?

280
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,600
Like who's sitting there going,

281
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,640
oh, so I'm just your friend,

282
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,440
not your best friend?

283
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,480
I see how it is.

284
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,280
And you can't,

285
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,680
you're not gonna be my best friend in two infinity?

286
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,360
Oh, okay, fine, whatever.

287
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
See if I loan you any DVDs again,

288
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,840
if I loan you any DVDs again.

289
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,800
Justin, I'm interested in another thing

290
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,520
you just said about BFFs being stronger

291
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,080
than a matrimonial bond.

292
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,880
Is there any way that we can incorporate that

293
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,600
into the terminology of marriage?

294
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,480
For instance, would you consider Sydney

295
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,640
to be your best wife forever?

296
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,000
Yes.

297
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,080
Well, Sydney's also my BFF.

298
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,360
I made that commitment.

299
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,760
I bought her a second BFF ring that she wears.

300
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,120
And when you put them together,

301
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,880
it spells best friends forever

302
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,760
and you have half of the heart

303
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,480
and she has half of the heart.

304
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,360
Exactly, yes.

305
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,840
Yeah.

306
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,440
You should marry your BFF.

307
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,400
That's why I'm saying,

308
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,000
don't throw these words around.

309
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,680
Like they don't mean anything.

310
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,000
They do.

311
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,400
I think you should be forced to marry your BFF,

312
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,560
whether it is your partner or your friend.

313
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,080
Oh, man, that's so good.

314
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,720
There should be a ceremony with a priest

315
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,360
and like you get a license and everything.

316
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,960
So like at age 13,

317
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,840
you're like, oh, Michael, you are my BFF.

318
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,880
And then like 20 years later,

319
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,640
it's like, I gotta marry Michael.

320
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,040
Yep.

321
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,120
He's a bro and I'm a bro and I'm not down,

322
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,960
but like, sorry, Michael.

323
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,080
But then the nice thing is

324
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,080
you get all of the wedding presents

325
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,880
and you have a really nice reception.

326
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,080
Sure.

327
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,560
And you know what?

328
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,640
Maybe Michael is the one.

329
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,160
Yeah, maybe that's what you learned.

330
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,440
Maybe that's what you learned about yourself.

331
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,080
Everybody's best friend is Jesus.

332
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,440
That's what I'm saying to you,

333
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
is your best friend forever is Jesus.

334
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,160
The only reason you should say someone is your BFF

335
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,640
is if you are trying to show off.

336
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,000
Like if you say,

337
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
like, I don't think BFF is something

338
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,440
I would say to make that person feel special,

339
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,360
but I would tell it to somebody else

340
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,560
to make myself feel good.

341
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,840
Like, oh, hero pilot, Sully Sullenberg,

342
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,960
he is my BFF.

343
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,320
And they would think-

344
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,360
Oh, John Stamos?

345
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,840
John Stamos?

346
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,480
He's my BFF.

347
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
He is my bestest best friend forever, ever.

348
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,680
Yes.

349
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,720
He's my BFF.

350
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,000
I love John Stamos so much.

351
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,040
Hey, do you guys want to Yahoo?

352
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,600
Yes, please.

353
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,000
Always.

354
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,520
This one was sent in by...

355
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,160
This one.

356
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,680
This one was sent in by Jesse Thorn.

357
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,840
Thank you, Jesse.

358
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,360
It's by Yahoo Answers user,

359
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
Miserable Little Smug Bastard.

360
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,480
Oh, oh my.

361
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,120
Who asks, ladies.

362
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,920
Already winning.

363
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,960
Ladies, if someone paid you $300,000 or pounds

364
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,560
to sit on a real human skull,

365
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,360
would you sit on it?

366
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:08,960
What?

367
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,080
Would you cross your legs?

368
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,960
If you did, you would get an extra 300,000.

369
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,520
I have actually asked this question before.

370
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,600
Sincerely, Skeletor.

371
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,080
Love, Jack Skellington.

372
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,240
So many questions.

373
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,080
First off, ladies,

374
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,760
if you pick the $300,000 above the 300,000 pounds,

375
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,200
then you are a rube.

376
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,760
Yeah, I was going to say conversion rate.

377
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,720
I think maybe that's it.

378
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,160
It's like a deal or no deal thing.

379
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,280
Like you could take the $300,000 or...

380
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,840
Or 600,000 if you cross your legs while you do it.

381
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,040
Or you can get it in pounds

382
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,520
and have to spend 10 minutes getting it converted at a bank.

383
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,040
Yeah, but that's an awkward story to tell the cashier.

384
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,960
Hey, how'd you get these 600,000 pounds?

385
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,600
I sat on a real human skull.

386
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,960
These smell like calcium and taint.

387
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,200
Are you one of those bone jockeys?

388
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,240
Are you a bone jockey?

389
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,080
You're people sick of me.

390
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,880
Hey, Carl, we got another one.

391
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,840
Look at this one.

392
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,680
She sat on a human skull.

393
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,800
She got boned.

394
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,280
She got boned.

395
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,960
And then they all chuckle, chuckle.

396
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,400
There are so many questions.

397
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,000
God damn it.

398
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,880
Is this skull inside of skin and muscles of a living human being?

399
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,080
Is it a last request kind of thing?

400
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,520
Is this how someone wants to get buried?

401
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,200
It's what I'm saying.

402
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,560
Is this a Devo video?

403
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,200
Are we talking about a Devo?

404
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,360
Is this a Devo right now?

405
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,800
Are you pulling a Devo on us?

406
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,480
How much?

407
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,360
Like a bloody Devo?

408
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,680
Why does the price point start out at $300,000?

409
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,760
Why wouldn't you, why wouldn't you haggle up?

410
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,280
I just noticed in the related questions on the sidebar.

411
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,560
This question by miserable little smug bastard.

412
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:10,080
Ladies, if someone paid you $100,000 or pounds to sit on a real human skull, would you do it?

413
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,120
He's driving a hard bargain.

414
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,040
What do I have to say to get you on this skull

415
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,080
before you leave today?

416
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,000
If you're offended by this question, then ignore it.

417
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,960
Would you cross your legs?

418
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,080
If you did, you would get extra.

419
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,840
It would be the skull of a serial killer.

420
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,320
You laughed that out when you brought it to $300,000.

421
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,640
He's trying to, he's driving a deal.

422
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,680
He's trying to make this happen.

423
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,440
Griffin, what is this username again?

424
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,920
Miserable little smug bastard.

425
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,040
Miserable little smug bastard.

426
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,600
He's like, he's been negotiating this.

427
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,240
For all his foibles, he's a pretty smart negotiator.

428
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,800
He started low and made a serial killer skull.

429
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,160
He's like a, he's like a Ron Popeil.

430
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,240
Like, okay, I'll take out.

431
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,680
It's no longer a serial killer skull, just a regular skull.

432
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,200
Just a real human skull.

433
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,440
And also this set of Sham Wows.

434
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,960
Yeah, I will throw in a solid flavor injector.

435
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh God.

436
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,360
Would you slap chop a real human skull for, I'm gonna bump it up to 400K.

437
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,960
You do have to sit on it before, but afterwards,

438
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,040
you'll slap chop it into non-existence.

439
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,240
It would just be dust.

440
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,080
I will sit on two horse skulls for 50K.

441
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,440
You know, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that this is one of those circumstances

442
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,360
where I would rather that this were not a hypothetical question.

443
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,440
Because if he had some purpose behind this,

444
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,960
for some reason that makes it okay than him just sitting around wondering.

445
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,120
Travis, the amount of work that he has put into negotiating,

446
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,920
just yelling into the internet, it has to have been resolved, right?

447
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,160
It has to, it has to have happened.

448
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,960
It has to have, has to have happened by now.

449
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,640
Do you realize how much money 300,000?

450
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,360
What would I not do for $300,000 or pounds?

451
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,680
Cause sit on a real human skull?

452
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,160
Yes.

453
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,280
It ain't on that list.

454
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Yeah, I would make the skull.

455
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,080
I would.

456
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,960
Knife and waiting.

457
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,880
I would turn the person into a skull is what I'm saying.

458
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,320
I'm such a fucking sucker though,

459
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,360
because that first time around when he's like 100K,

460
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,200
I would have jumped at it.

461
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,920
You would have taken it.

462
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,680
I wouldn't even thought to hold off.

463
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,480
You gotta check the trade magazines.

464
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,880
What's the going rate right now?

465
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,040
For a, you know, I actually got a Groupon for sitting on a human skull.

466
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,320
Yeah, a bunch of my friends and I are going to do it for 50K.

467
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:46,800
The problem is-

468
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,600
The same skull?

469
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:47,920
Yeah.

470
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,120
Yeah, it's the same skull.

471
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,800
So there's always a huge line.

472
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,440
You really gotta-

473
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,160
And after a while, you know, yeah, it gets warm.

474
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,760
That skull is pretty rowdy.

475
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,520
The thing is, is he doesn't even clarify and say like,

476
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,760
you have to be nude or it has to be set.

477
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,880
He just wants you to sit on it, cross your legs and get off and leave.

478
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,040
Can we, let's talk about the crossing the legs thing.

479
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,200
Is he wanting us to incubate this skull?

480
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,960
Like a, like a, like a mama bird?

481
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Keep it secret, keep it safe.

482
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,000
You get $300,000.

483
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,160
But he doesn't say naked.

484
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,080
So what he's saying is just sit on, just-

485
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,320
You just roll up in your mom jeans, sit on it, cross your legs, get off, leave.

486
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,960
Get out of here.

487
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,840
Get your money.

488
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,000
I need to know, can a human skull support the weight of a fully grown adult woman?

489
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,760
It takes like 14 pounds of pressure to-

490
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,280
We are, we are just skeletons with a big egg on top of our necks.

491
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,640
So it's just a big egg in there.

492
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,120
It's just a big, it's just like a big stupid egg in there.

493
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,080
And it's, if a human being, if it was like a tiny, if it was a baby maybe, but-

494
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,720
Oh, maybe he's doing that like age old, like seventh grade science experiment

495
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,320
where you have to like build a bridge to like save an egg.

496
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,880
You know what I mean?

497
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,600
And like, you have to walk across it and see if it destroys the egg.

498
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,080
There was so much goddamn dumb stuff in that sentence.

499
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,480
You just say, it'll take us a week to tear it apart.

500
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,680
It was, it was a seven layer bar of dumb shit.

501
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,040
You know, an egg bridge.

502
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,320
You know, egg bridge.

503
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,880
I saw it on Mr. Wizard.

504
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,640
Five different science projects.

505
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,000
I was like, you know, an egg bridge.

506
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,960
And then you put baking soda on it and-

507
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,920
And then it's a volcano.

508
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,640
It's a volcano.

509
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,840
I'll never forget the events of September 11th, 2001 when a volcano bridge burned down an egg.

510
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,680
Jimmy, your book report sucks.

511
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,360
A book report?

512
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,480
What book is he?

513
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,320
Your book, Jimmy, your book report on the 9-11 commission is the worst I've ever read.

514
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,440
Did you even read it?

515
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,040
You didn't, did you?

516
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,080
Thank you. I did not.

517
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,320
Myth and legend.

518
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,400
You know that in like a hundred years, myth and legend.

519
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:04,800
That's all.

520
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,560
There will be no excellent records.

521
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,560
It'll be so open to interpretation.

522
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,320
I've seen enough futuristic movies to know.

523
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,080
Oh, God damn it.

524
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,840
Let's stop talking about sitting on skulls.

525
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,360
Because it's literally making my grundle uncomfortable.

526
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,000
Like, just the thought of trying to perch myself on a cranium.

527
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,680
I don't think it would feel good.

528
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,200
No, I wouldn't think so.

529
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,720
But you know what would feel great?

530
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,120
I could buy myself a new grundle with 300k.

531
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,440
Or 300 pounds.

532
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,240
Jesus Christ.

533
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,840
This guy, this fucking guy.

534
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,400
Do you think he's normal in his day to day?

535
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,240
You think it's somebody really nice and well respected?

536
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,440
Do you think it's Tom Hanks?

537
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,600
Oh, couldn't-

538
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,680
Wouldn't you believe it if somebody was like,

539
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,480
yeah, he's a great actor and like, he's a real sweetheart.

540
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,600
He's got this one thing.

541
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,320
My wife and I have a four month old son who will soon be celebrating his first Halloween.

542
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,160
And we are at a disagreement as to what kind of costume our child should wear.

543
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,800
My wife wants him to be dressed as an animal such as a turkey, a skunk, or a monkey.

544
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,840
I would prefer to dress him as something cool and nerdy.

545
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,600
This is where I need your sagely advice.

546
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,320
Can you give me some cool and nerdy costume ideas

547
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
with which to put this argument to rest?

548
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,200
And that's from Kevin.

549
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,040
I got a cool nerdy one.

550
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,640
Do a genetic hybrid of all three of those animals.

551
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,320
Go- go as a most skirky.

552
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,200
This is my son Skylar.

553
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,040
He's dressed as a most skirky.

554
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,400
Just- Justin, that is a-

555
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,440
I almost made a furry joke and I didn't.

556
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,000
Would you say-

557
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,160
Are you happy with the level of restraint that I have adopted since I started doing this show?

558
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,640
Yeah, we made a 9-11 joke 30 seconds ago.

559
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,160
We won't make a furry gag.

560
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,480
How is that?

561
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,120
You're welcome.

562
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,320
How's your sensitivity?

563
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,440
Not great.

564
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,520
I'd sit on a most skirky skull for you.

565
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,440
Your son is going to be-

566
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,680
Let's see, if he's four months old now, he'll be like six months at Halloween.

567
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,760
I think he's gonna need to go as Ash from Evil Dead.

568
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,400
That would be good.

569
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,520
A little fake wig.

570
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,640
What about a zygote?

571
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,080
Who would get a real kick out of that?

572
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,880
You could do a combination costume with the mom

573
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,640
and do the alien popping out of the stomach as an alien.

574
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,800
You guys are not thinking like problem solvers right now.

575
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,800
What you gotta do is you gotta have a nerdy, cool costume that is also an animal.

576
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,440
And the answer is Bucky O'Hare.

577
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,160
Oh, yeah.

578
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,440
Bucky O'Hare.

579
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:33,760
I love it.

580
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,840
Got a rabbit in there, but he's also got a space gun.

581
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,520
Are there any other cool nerdy-

582
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,960
You could go as the cat from Red Dwarf for this one.

583
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Cool nerdy animal.

584
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,560
A ninja turtle.

585
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,120
That is a-

586
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,400
That's a-

587
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,000
I could go as a biker mouse from Mars.

588
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,680
Loving it.

589
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,920
You could go as a llama, but also it's Doctor Who.

590
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,600
Okay, so hold on.

591
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,240
Let's explore this.

592
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,080
Is this a-

593
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,520
Is this a time king?

594
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,800
Yes, it's a time king.

595
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,600
A time king llama?

596
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,520
Time king is a-

597
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,000
No, no, a regeneration-

598
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,360
Okay, Doctor Who-

599
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,920
Okay, so like-

600
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,400
Was dying.

601
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,760
Matt Smith, Doctor Who dies.

602
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,320
Matt Smith dies.

603
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,040
He regenerates as a llama.

604
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:27,120
The only thing nearby, he funnels the regeneration energy into the llama to try to cast it off,

605
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,560
and it becomes a Time Lord llama, and you dress your baby like that.

606
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,720
Does the llama speak English?

607
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,200
Well, if it's near enough to the TARDIS, of course.

608
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,760
Okay, great.

609
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,360
And translate all languages.

610
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,280
Does it remain on two legs, or does it become like a-

611
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,160
Are we talking about a joke?

612
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,960
Cool.

613
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,080
Does it need to-

614
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,320
Well, it depends on how much ground it needs to cover.

615
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,760
If it needs to cover ground quickly, it will run on all four legs.

616
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,240
I hope someone somewhere at BBC is listening to this, because we've just figured out the

617
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,120
next series.

618
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,680
Yeah.

619
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,400
I've always thought that that show needed a little extra spice.

620
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,920
That's llama.

621
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,640
Yeah, time king llama.

622
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,640
And that spice is apparently a desert pack mule.

623
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,000
Yeah, I think it would go great.

624
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,080
Here's a fun suggestion.

625
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,360
I think it's fun for the whole family.

626
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:18,560
Dress your kid like a doggy, and then put it in a cage, and then leave it home, and

627
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,920
go get drunk.

628
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,420
What?

629
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,000
Party for Halloween.

630
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,520
The spirits are out tonight.

631
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,160
Me and mom going out, and you're gonna be all right in your cage we made for you.

632
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,360
Just throw some candy in there.

633
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,000
It'll be fine.

634
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,560
Throw some candy in the clothes hanger cage that we made for you.

635
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,440
You just re-bend them.

636
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,320
You just bend them in the bar.

637
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,360
These babies aren't strong.

638
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,240
It won't take long.

639
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,320
Just go out and get drunk with mom.

640
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,360
You guys deserve it.

641
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,240
You've earned the night off.

642
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,280
It's 10 p.m.

643
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,560
Do you know where your baby is?

644
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,440
Yes, in a cage.

645
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,560
He's in the baby dog.

646
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,280
It's okay.

647
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,240
You dress up like a dog.

648
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,760
He's a baby dog.

649
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,880
That makes it better.

650
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,800
The kind of irreparable harm you've done to your relationship by arguing about costumes.

651
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,320
You've got to get on a retreat.

652
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,080
And by a retreat, I mean go to Shakey's and get you drunk.

653
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,000
Make sure you take lots of pictures of that too,

654
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,160
so that when your kid turns 18 and kills everyone he knows,

655
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,840
you can show those pictures to the news.

656
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,360
Just throw some Alpo in the cage and go get your drunk.

657
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,840
Get that drunk.

658
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,680
Mr. Stevenson, I'm sorry I'm placing you under arrest.

659
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,040
Your son was locked in a cage unsupervised.

660
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,680
What the fuck?

661
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,960
That's a dog.

662
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,760
That's a dog.

663
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,560
That is actually your child in a dog.

664
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,880
Well, color me embarrassed, officer.

665
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,000
Look at his nose.

666
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,720
I have painted it brown like a dog's nose is brown.

667
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,200
I have-

668
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,520
Officer, you are terrible at improv games.

669
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,000
I- yeah, you're supposed to say yes.

670
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,640
And we buy-

671
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,200
Yes, and.

672
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,080
Yes, and.

673
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,640
Yes, and my baby's a dog in cage.

674
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,040
Yes, and do you want some of this beer?

675
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,960
I have extra because we have so much in us.

676
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,960
Do you want a brewski?

677
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,160
And we'll forget about this.

678
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,040
And also, forget about the kid, he's fine for another hour or so.

679
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,840
Let's go play some foosball.

680
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,640
Let's go play-

681
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,160
Let's go foos it up, copper.

682
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,560
And then it turns out that the cop is a baby dressed as a cop.

683
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,040
Incepted.

684
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,320
Baby police, you just got busted by the highest authority in the land.

685
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,280
Baby police?

686
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,120
Baby police are the highest authority in the land.

687
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,680
Sentient babies.

688
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,360
We are under baby martial law.

689
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,320
It's adorable.

690
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,000
And also restrictive.

691
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,120
This is a baby police state.

692
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,040
All TVs will watch Nick Jr.

693
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,000
All things will go boring when you hit them.

694
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,280
The cow says moo, you say nothing.

695
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,880
I snap my fingers, you pull out a tit.

696
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,920
This is baby law.

697
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,520
We're running things now.

698
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,920
You know, I would watch a legal drama called Baby's Law

699
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,280
where it's just about a baby lawyer.

700
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,280
Baby law and baby order?

701
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,800
Yeah!

702
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,920
No, if we don't need-

703
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:05,920
If there's-

704
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,680
Okay, if there's baby martial law,

705
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,520
baby order doesn't have any place in it.

706
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,400
How about baby chaos?

707
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,440
Baby chaos?

708
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,520
That, you know, you mean babyarchy.

709
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,800
Babyarchy.

710
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,600
Babyarchy, yes, thank you.

711
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,760
Babies don't grow up to be adults because this is what you do.

712
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,000
You think about baby anarchy.

713
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,200
Which is adorable and terrifying at the same time.

714
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Hey, can we-

715
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,040
I want to take a brief hiatus here to tell you about the text

716
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,880
that I just got from my father, our father.

717
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,080
Did you guys get-

718
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,120
Me too, yes.

719
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,560
Okay, so he just sent a text that says, in quotes,

720
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,440
it says, what day is it, son? What day?

721
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,680
What could that-

722
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,120
Is that a reference to the hit film We Are Marshall?

723
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,520
I think it is.

724
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,720
I think it has to be.

725
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,560
I think the response to that is football day or something.

726
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,840
No, listen, listen, let's explain this

727
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,880
because people are going to think our dad is like some sort of crazy 9-11 guy.

728
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,760
I don't think he knows it's 9-11.

729
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,920
I think the three of us should probably text him.

730
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,600
I'm texting right now and I'm asking him if he means September 11th.

731
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,280
Okay, hold on, let's all take a moment.

732
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,880
We need to text him back because I don't want our dad

733
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,880
walking through the day with a spring in his step.

734
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,880
It's game day!

735
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,960
Hey, everybody, are you excited?

736
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,160
Okay, my message is sent.

737
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,520
I've been looking forward to today for so long.

738
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,600
Yeah, it seems like it's been 10 years since this last happened,

739
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,640
by which I mean football.

740
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,040
I love football, getting the points, scoring points.

741
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,800
I get all the points.

742
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,680
Should we even address the fact that we are in a family football pool?

743
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,280
It seems like such a ridiculous...

744
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,080
Oh, my God.

745
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,120
No one will believe it.

746
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,680
If someone can give us some advice on what teams are going to win each week.

747
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,680
Do you know how I pick my teams?

748
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,280
How I pick the winner?

749
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,440
I read them out loud to Teresa and said,

750
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,960
which city do you like better?

751
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,440
Oh, yeah?

752
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,120
That was my method.

753
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,720
Now, if I win, God bless it, it'll be awesome.

754
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,840
Take it to the dog track.

755
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,340
Yeah.

756
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:22,020
I think that the three of us should have some sort of on-air agreement

757
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,100
to the winner should have to do something and the loser should have to do something.

758
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,900
Okay, here's what it is.

759
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,940
Put some skin in the game, because I feel like this is a kind of low pressure situation.

760
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:37,620
The last one to forget that we're doing it and stop picking teams is the winner.

761
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,460
That hangs in there the longest and continues to make their picks unabated.

762
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,100
I think that would be good.

763
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,940
I failed on that in previous years, and I think that I'm going to hang in there this year.

764
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,940
I think that this is the year I stick with it.

765
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,740
I've already told myself I'm going to watch every single Packers game,

766
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,700
and it's going to be trying.

767
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,220
It's going to be difficult, you guys.

768
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,420
I will watch at least one football game that's not the Super Bowl.

769
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,020
That's my commitment.

770
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:07,460
I feel like we joke about not watching sports a lot.

771
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,940
I think it's time we reverse it, our position.

772
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,620
We joke about how much we love sports.

773
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,620
We joke about how much we love sports, but we don't know.

774
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,220
Do we actually have to watch sports?

775
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,780
Yeah, I think we should watch more sports is what I'm saying.

776
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,980
Okay, here's what it is.

777
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,260
Somebody on Twitter, after listening to the show,

778
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,020
tell me what team I should follow and why, and I'll do it.

779
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,100
That's how committed I am to this.

780
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,300
You bring it, I'll do it.

781
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:31,860
I don't care.

782
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,140
You should follow the Reds.

783
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,940
We'll take a vote.

784
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,100
I follow the Reds.

785
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,740
You should also follow the Bengals, maybe, because you also-

786
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,860
It's a new day. We'll let Twitter pick.

787
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,780
Just make sure when you're telling Travis what team he should follow,

788
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,580
use that NBNBM hashtag, and go ahead and put a link out to our sampler.

789
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,420
Bit.ly forward slash smoothing bam.

790
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,220
People love it.

791
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,420
People go crazy for it.

792
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:59,220
Hey, what I'm doing right now is shilling, and like Kurt Shilling,

793
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,660
popular sports star who I enjoy, still pitching.

794
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,180
See, Griffin, sports.

795
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,580
He pretty sure does not pitch anymore, does he?

796
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,300
I don't think he pitched ever.

797
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,180
Here is what the response from Clint.

798
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,860
Okay, well, I was going for a game day.

799
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,620
Gotta play till the last whistle blows.

800
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,620
But there's your thing, too.

801
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:38,340
Let's go to the Money Zone.

802
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,180
This week on the Money Zone, the driver is Duodater.

803
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,020
Oh, fuck yeah.

804
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,020
Okay.

805
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,340
Okay. Sorry, go ahead.

806
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,060
You seem wicked excited about duodater.com.

807
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,020
So this is crazy.

808
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:58,340
My group of friends here in Austin had come up with this idea for a website

809
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,900
where couples would go on dates with each other to make it

810
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,260
like as low-precious a situation as they possibly could.

811
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:10,420
Only they called it Wings, W-Y-N-G-Z, like wingman.

812
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,940
And then they later found out that that site already existed,

813
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,300
and it's called Duodater.

814
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,420
So Duodater is a, here's the idea.

815
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:23,540
It can be a little uncomfortable going out, you know, with a complete stranger.

816
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:30,100
So what you do is you have a friend and you go on double dates with them.

817
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,900
So it's like a dating website, but for like double date instead of late.

818
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,940
Yeah, that's awesome.

819
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,060
Yeah, like pairs of dudes meet pairs of girls, and it's like comfortable.

820
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,700
Your friend's there.

821
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,660
It's a way more, you know, relaxed situation.

822
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,340
And then it all ends up in a hot tub and where it goes from there.

823
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,580
Is there an option for an established guy-girl couple

824
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,980
to meet up with another guy-girl couple and just make a fuck pile?

825
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,660
Do the old swap-rooney.

826
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,180
Oh, at fuckpile.com.

827
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,580
Yeah, you'll want fuckpile.com for that.

828
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,260
Boy, we need to register that one if that's not already.

829
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,540
Yeah, but Duodater is a really cool idea,

830
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,540
and you can go to duodater.com and just get your best bro.

831
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:20,660
Do work out a hand sign for if you think you're going to be able to get some sex

832
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,740
and you're going to need your friend to peel off.

833
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,900
Like if you're going to need them to split the duo, like you have to have like,

834
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,220
I think you have to have two keys that you insert at the same time and turn

835
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:36,980
and it splits the duo and then one duo can go make whoopee and the other one can have aqua coffee.

836
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:41,300
Actually, if you try to do that, a Duodater officer will come and stop you.

837
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,460
It's a baby officer.

838
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,740
You have to preserve the sanctity of their website's moniker.

839
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,740
Also, Duodater, I feel like you owe us some residuals because that is totally wings.

840
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,300
With a Z.

841
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:55,860
With a Z.

842
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,860
So crazy if they follow us and that's...

843
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,060
Thank you, Duodater.

844
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,860
Thank you, Duodater.

845
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,260
Griffin.

846
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,900
Oh, fuck, I need to write a song for him.

847
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,140
Yeah.

848
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,140
Hold on, Duodater.

849
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,460
See, I just keep wanting to sing about wings and I feel like that that would be...

850
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,180
You could sing about the TV show Wings.

851
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,260
What's better than going on a date with someone you don't know?

852
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:29,140
Going on a date with two people that you don't know

853
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,300
and one friend who's got your back.

854
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,780
That's the idea behind Duodater.

855
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,860
It was the idea behind Wings first, then they stole it, and that's okay with me.

856
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,420
That's okay with me.

857
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:49,380
Visit Duodater.com and get your ideas stolen.

858
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,940
They're a bunch of fucking Inception mind thieves.

859
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,020
I'm sure that was...

860
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,540
That was way angrier than I meant it to be.

861
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,780
You think that's what they had planned on?

862
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,700
I'm sorry about the jingle that I wrote for you.

863
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,820
I should have talked more about your goods and services.

864
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,780
Please accept my apologies.

865
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,300
My roommate and I are pretty good friends.

866
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,140
We watch movies and TV together, eat meals together, play games with each other, etc.

867
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,740
But sometimes I just want some time to myself, go in my bedroom and close the door,

868
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,700
but he always stops by to ask what I'm doing if I want to hang out.

869
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:42,180
I end up making an excuse, like saying I'm not feeling well, I'm working on something.

870
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,940
But really, I just want some peace and quiet.

871
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,220
I don't like lying to him, so is there some way I can tell him

872
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,300
I want to be left alone without hurting his feelings?

873
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,900
That's from Bothered in Berkeley.

874
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,700
So how do I jerk off in a room and with a roommate?

875
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,500
That's what he's saying.

876
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,300
It's tricky.

877
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,100
You gotta fake a nap.

878
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,820
Yep, I'm taking a nap.

879
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,660
It's gonna last about 15 minutes.

880
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,100
It's pretty short for a nap.

881
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,100
But long enough for the other thing.

882
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,180
Don't you tell.

883
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,780
It's a secret forever.

884
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,500
Don't you ever tell.

885
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,140
God, it is, it is, it is, it is tough.

886
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,020
See, I don't know though, because I got lucky because my roommate in college and I

887
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,900
seem to be on the same schedule of like, hang out, hang out, hang out,

888
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:31,140
and then we break to our rooms and leave each other alone, you know?

889
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,820
Like, we'd watch TV together for a while,

890
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,940
and then we just kind of simultaneously get bored with each other.

891
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,140
What roommate is this?

892
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,780
That was Brent.

893
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,060
Brent O'Floss.

894
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,860
Hit internet personality Brent O'Floss.

895
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,260
Yes.

896
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:47,700
The problem is you could be friends with your roommate.

897
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,220
You should be friends with your roommate, but you shouldn't be their only friend.

898
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,100
And that sounds like the kind of situation that you have going on.

899
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:58,100
You shouldn't either, but you should not be FF with your roommate before you get married.

900
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,820
It sounds like, yeah, it sounds like you're kind of filling a lot of roles

901
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:09,060
for your roommate if he or she wants to spend like every second with you.

902
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:18,100
Yeah, yeah, I would say that honestly, in this case, I think it's best to be honest.

903
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,060
Just say like, no, I'm just going to hang out by myself.

904
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,700
I just need some time right now.

905
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,940
But what if they're like, oh, come on?

906
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,940
What if you scheduled time?

907
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,540
Like if you said, hey, don't forget tonight, you know,

908
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,380
Tyler's and Tiara's at 10 o'clock.

909
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,580
Oh, I like that actually.

910
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,220
And so that way you've set a time that you're going to hang out.

911
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,420
So up until then.

912
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,460
Well, at that point, Travis, at that point, you are dating them.

913
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,340
Well, yeah, I mean, it sounds like you are anyways.

914
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,780
They're just really needy.

915
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,100
Yeah, and you don't get your thing touched.

916
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,900
You know what you should do?

917
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,300
Oh, synergy.

918
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,980
Do a date with them.

919
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,480
Oh, fuck.

920
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,660
Go on a do a date with them and then they're done with you.

921
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,900
Yeah, I love that.

922
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,900
Go on a do a date with them.

923
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,500
We need to get do a date on this show so we can talk about like,

924
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,940
I want to know about this statistic.

925
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,300
I want to know about the best practices.

926
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:14,580
Like how often do two dude couples, a dude couple and a lady couple,

927
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:19,220
or two pairs of oppositely gendered friends, go on a do a date?

928
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,180
Go on a do a date, but with intent?

929
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,740
Like, do you think they assign who gets who at the beginning?

930
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,740
Like I get Susan, you get Margaret.

931
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,820
And then you get down there, you get on the fucking ground,

932
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,980
and then like you want to swap, and then you swap.

933
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,180
I bet that happens like 75% of the time.

934
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:36,100
What if you did like the two pairs were a guy and a girl and a guy and a girl?

935
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,340
So it's like a female best friend and a male best friend.

936
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,140
Then they're like, they're getting each other's backs.

937
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:42,980
That could also happen.

938
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,500
There's so many sexy options.

939
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,140
I love this.

940
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,300
I like that one better, actually, because it's like

941
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,100
like that there's not any other option.

942
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:50,820
There's no other way.

943
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,100
Oh, but you know what?

944
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,540
You guys know how that one ends, right?

945
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,580
Oh, then they realize they're in love with each other.

946
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,220
They actually call that the Tom Hanksman grind.

947
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,060
You can get that combo.

948
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,820
It is at a discounted rate.

949
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,860
Oh, that's nice.

950
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,820
Because you should have realized it in the first place, you dummy.

951
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:10,020
As much as I appreciate Duodater, I have bad news,

952
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,500
and that is that I have opened up triodater.com.

953
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:17,540
And just your, your, your fuck pile expands by 50%.

954
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,700
That is a 50% spread on the fuck pile.

955
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,460
We got sex math right there.

956
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,420
You can't deny it.

957
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,100
Oh God, I love the phrase sex math now.

958
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,580
Do you?

959
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,100
Cause I got, I got, I got skeezed out a little bit.

960
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,260
Yeah, a little bit.

961
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,420
The whole fuck while thing is really grossing me out.

962
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,460
I'll tell you why it's grossing me out.

963
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,540
Because when Scriven said triodater,

964
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,580
I almost said you ever wanted to, uh,

965
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,140
date three brothers who do a comedy podcast.

966
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:47,940
Oh no.

967
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,980
And then Scriven took it to-

968
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,940
Well, you took it to the weird place of sexums.

969
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,820
You want me to like fucking, like,

970
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,820
throw a picnic by the lake and then-

971
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,980
You're talking like a Chase fuck pile.

972
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,420
Yeah, Chase, we're going to sit around.

973
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,580
We're going to, you bring your parasols

974
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,100
while the gentlemen play bocce ball.

975
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,620
What's wrong with a picnic?

976
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,060
Why does it have to be a sexnik?

977
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,140
Why can't it just be a regular picnic?

978
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,940
A dicknik.

979
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,540
You're thinking of a dicknik.

980
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,040
Yeah.

981
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,620
So your roommate, um, just have that conversation with him

982
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,220
and he'll never want to hang out with you again.

983
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,100
Just play this last segment for them.

984
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:22,580
Yeah.

985
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,460
Say, this is-

986
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,300
I nod at him a lot and smile.

987
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,340
I'm not kidding.

988
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,620
Duo date with him.

989
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,900
Duodater.com.

990
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,620
I love it.

991
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,500
I think it's a great idea.

992
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:30,980
You know what else is great?

993
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,180
Yeah, get him out of the house.

994
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,540
Here's another great idea.

995
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,740
Get in a circle of people.

996
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,100
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Catherine Mrow.

997
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,300
Mrow.

998
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,020
What?

999
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,300
M-R-A-U-L-E.

1000
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,620
If anyone has a better way of pronouncing this name.

1001
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,020
Apparently I pronounced somebody's name wrong last week.

1002
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,060
I am off my game.

1003
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,340
If you can say that last name without sounding like a bear,

1004
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,940
I will give you a dollar out of my pocket.

1005
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,100
Now what's the question?

1006
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,540
It's asked by Yahoo Lady, who asks,

1007
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,180
this one might be too gross.

1008
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,480
We'll see.

1009
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,580
How is that penis put inside vagina will be held all the night during sleep time?

1010
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,060
What?

1011
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,660
I really don't know if that is a good or bad for my health and my partner's health,

1012
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,460
either if he puts his penis inside my vagina all the night.

1013
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,100
What a love.

1014
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,220
That would be my first time like that.

1015
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,940
What?

1016
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,180
What a love.

1017
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:24,740
So what are you saying?

1018
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,820
What Yahoo Lady?

1019
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,220
I'm going to be straight up, guys.

1020
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,780
I have a problem of falling asleep while cuddling.

1021
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,420
Yeah.

1022
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,620
Let alone.

1023
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:34,820
Let me get...

1024
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,860
Let me just...

1025
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,360
OK.

1026
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:36,860
Night.

1027
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,540
Is this good for you?

1028
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,500
You set the alarm?

1029
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,300
Good night.

1030
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,340
Sweet dreams.

1031
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,380
Don't shift around too much, please.

1032
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,380
Please don't roll over.

1033
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,820
I had the weirdest dream.

1034
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:02,260
You cannot imagine the dream I had.

1035
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,220
Hey, I love you.

1036
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:03,720
I love you.

1037
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,180
I love you, too.

1038
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,820
Do you want to fall asleep in this manner?

1039
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,620
I just devise.

1040
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,700
There's no love that great.

1041
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,340
There's no love.

1042
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,220
No, it doesn't even seem like sexy at all.

1043
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,580
It just seems like utilitarian, like put it in and let's go to bed.

1044
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,020
Like, what?

1045
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:19,340
What?

1046
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:20,700
That's weird.

1047
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,580
That's very weird.

1048
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,700
Listen, I have chronic wiener coldness.

1049
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,860
It is a real thing not invented.

1050
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,900
Can you help a brother out?

1051
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:35,340
Can you swaddle my wiener, please?

1052
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,740
I don't see anything weird about this.

1053
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,700
Nothing weird about it.

1054
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,380
Just tuck him in and let's go to bed.

1055
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,660
Just swaddle me with you.

1056
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:46,780
For $300,000, would you swaddle a skull all night?

1057
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:52,700
Can we please, please, please, God, I've never wanted anything in my life as much as I want

1058
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,660
to get my own sex term coined, and that is swaddling.

1059
00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:02,540
And that is when you enter a lady and then you just zonk it for eight.

1060
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,140
And then doze off.

1061
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,980
Get your foot on purpose.

1062
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:09,420
Get your 40 winks and get your tiddly winks.

1063
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,660
With swaddling, the new thing that exists.

1064
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,220
God, I can't wait till it gets on Seinfeld.

1065
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:18,940
What a love.

1066
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,540
What a loving man.

1067
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,180
What a love.

1068
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:22,860
I ask it.

1069
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:26,620
Your love is so great that it's killed my belief in it, in the concept.

1070
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,980
So I guess it's a pretty good love.

1071
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,860
God Vulcanon responded.

1072
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,140
I know some friends who do this.

1073
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:33,500
What?

1074
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,460
They actually cuddle with him inside her all night long.

1075
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,700
I don't see anything wrong with it so long as you're both clean.

1076
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,700
No reason to get a yeast infection over this.

1077
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,020
What?

1078
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,140
What?

1079
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:47,180
Hey, if you want to do this all night, odds are that's not healthy for you.

1080
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,340
Here's my problem.

1081
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:57,660
Once you have penetrated, once you have kicked off the swaddle, you are no longer cuddling.

1082
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,500
Sorry, that's no longer cuddling.

1083
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,460
You're fucking.

1084
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,740
You are fucking at that point.

1085
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,660
Hey, here's a funny story.

1086
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,340
For my formative years, I thought this is what spooning was.

1087
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,100
And you were thinking of swaddling.

1088
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,220
I was thinking of swaddling.

1089
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,140
I confused swaddling and spooning.

1090
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:20,620
Oh, man, you could have been the creator of this new hate sex sensation.

1091
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,580
I could have made the t-shirt for everybody.

1092
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,340
That is wholly upsetting.

1093
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,420
That is entirely upsetting.

1094
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,460
You know what's even more upsetting?

1095
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:35,020
That this person, the answerer, claims that their friends tell them about it.

1096
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,660
Hey, Debbie and I had a fun night last night.

1097
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,340
Hey, let me tell you about my Tuesday.

1098
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,860
I'm in no way ashamed or secretive about this.

1099
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,900
We went and saw Contagion, got some great Thai food,

1100
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,980
and then I fell asleep with my wiener in her.

1101
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,140
It was great.

1102
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,340
Oh, that's called swaddling.

1103
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:54,300
I didn't even know I thought we invented it.

1104
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:54,780
Hey, Urban Dictionary, what's up?

1105
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,580
You're saying it's a new sex sensation that's sweeping the nation.

1106
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,260
Swaddling.

1107
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,780
Swaddling.

1108
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,620
If that's not in Urban Dictionary by Friday, I'll be despondent.

1109
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,100
I will burn you.

1110
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,660
And then soon it will be in every R&B song.

1111
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,180
Or at least every R. Kelly song, at the very least.

1112
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:15,420
Hey, when this episode airs, I'll be in a truck with my dad,

1113
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,220
driving from San Antonio, Texas, to Georgetown, Massachusetts,

1114
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,460
with a number of stops in between.

1115
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,820
Brothers, what are some good ways to keep up morale on the long and tiring road?

1116
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,700
And that's from Fred.

1117
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,020
That's a long drive.

1118
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,700
It is a long drive.

1119
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,980
If you get on a long stretch where there's no other cars or people around,

1120
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:36,220
and like, you know, it's a long drive,

1121
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,140
and it's just flat, bad land all over the place,

1122
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:43,580
pretend you're in a post-apocalyptic world where you're the only ones left.

1123
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,220
I feel like that could be pretty epic.

1124
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,380
Keep up morale.

1125
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,380
Keep up morale.

1126
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,060
Keep up morale.

1127
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,660
I don't think that fits the bill.

1128
00:47:55,660 --> 00:48:03,020
Just recreate that book, The Road, by Norm MacDonald.

1129
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,740
I do not think so.

1130
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,940
Rory McClure.

1131
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,380
Rold Dollarson.

1132
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,740
Rold Roger.

1133
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,260
Rold Dr. Seuss.

1134
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:11,900
Tony Hawk.

1135
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:17,420
You know what did it for me on my drive from Chicago to Austin?

1136
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:18,940
Was just podcasts.

1137
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,180
My friend was in the car,

1138
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,660
and we just listened to podcasts pretty much the entire way down.

1139
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,820
And like, I'm not saying, like, listen to our podcasts.

1140
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,100
I'm saying listen to-

1141
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:27,820
I'm saying listen-

1142
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,260
I am saying listen to our podcasts.

1143
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,060
Well, if you-

1144
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,740
And now, Travis, when Travis went to-

1145
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,780
When Travis went to Louisville to see Point Break Lie with me,

1146
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,260
what podcast did you listen to to help pass the time?

1147
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,780
Oh, we listened to our own podcast.

1148
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,140
I listened to our podcast.

1149
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,100
Did you really?

1150
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,660
Yes, I did.

1151
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,100
Travis, that is creepy.

1152
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,140
With his girlfriend in the car.

1153
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:44,860
No, I don't believe so.

1154
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,060
With your girlfriend-

1155
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,700
Baby, baby, here comes my favorite goof I did.

1156
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,300
Listen, I did it so good.

1157
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,140
Well, she hadn't heard the episodes,

1158
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,500
and she wanted to listen to them.

1159
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,940
But you were in the car giving, like, director's commentary?

1160
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,220
Like, here's what I was thinking.

1161
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,780
No, she would actually ask questions and I'd shush her.

1162
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,460
Questions and I'd shush her, like, just listen.

1163
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,580
Shush, shush, shush, shush.

1164
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,140
Just listen.

1165
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,420
We explained all that.

1166
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,060
You talked during Justin's part and Griffin's part.

1167
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,180
This is my-

1168
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:09,980
Not during this guy's.

1169
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:11,820
Not during this guy's.

1170
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,740
I think the best thing about listening to podcasts,

1171
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,260
because I just told my friend about this-

1172
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,220
Is when you talk in them?

1173
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:22,460
Yes, is that for those long, awkward pauses

1174
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,820
where you can't think of anything to say

1175
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,020
with your traveling companion,

1176
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,620
podcasts are like other people are having the conversation

1177
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:30,860
for you in the car and you don't have to say anything.

1178
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:31,900
It's great.

1179
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,700
It's better than music in that respect, I think,

1180
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,900
because it fills up the conversation voids.

1181
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,980
And it can also give you a lot of new stuff to talk about.

1182
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,740
Don't be afraid to pause and talk,

1183
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,180
because that can really help pass the time.

1184
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:47,100
Especially with podcasts like How Stuff Works and Radio Lab,

1185
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,260
where, like, they're talking about interesting ideas.

1186
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,780
You know what I mean?

1187
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,940
I think it's great conversation starters.

1188
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:55,180
Sometimes I listen to Radio Lab with a friend,

1189
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,780
and then we have entire discussions about

1190
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,860
how to pronounce Jad Abumrad's name.

1191
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,340
Yeah, I always say Applerod.

1192
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,700
I say Abum-RAD.

1193
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,220
Here's another one, Meth.

1194
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,260
Yeah.

1195
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,180
Yeah, makes it fly by.

1196
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,340
Just chomp it down like trail mix.

1197
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,300
Also, trail mix.

1198
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,940
It's a great snack for the road

1199
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,580
when you're on the trail, the modern day trail,

1200
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,180
the highway mix.

1201
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:22,800
Corp.

1202
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:25,900
Corp's delicious.

1203
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,260
Can I do another Yahoo?

1204
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:28,620
Yeah.

1205
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,900
We have a lot more ground to cover,

1206
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,580
but let's just burn through this Yahoo,

1207
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,700
because I feel, you know, it's important.

1208
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,780
This one's sent in by Isi Mendenhall.

1209
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,220
Thank you, Isi.

1210
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:42,140
It's by Yahoo Answers user Anonymous.

1211
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,500
Okay.

1212
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,540
Who asks, what are some really sassy baby names?

1213
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,940
My baby girl needs to be a diva like me.

1214
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:53,280
Uh-huh.

1215
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,420
I'm angry.

1216
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,380
Oh, I'm so angry.

1217
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,860
That one girl ruined Precious.

1218
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,060
Do you want me to go down the list?

1219
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,500
That's not sassy.

1220
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,340
Do you want to hear some of the suggestions

1221
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,460
that Yahoo has provided?

1222
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:09,840
Yeah.

1223
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:14,460
Eden, because she's a cutie patootie.

1224
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,340
Cutie.

1225
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,660
A cutie patootie.

1226
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,700
Sadie, Jackie, Jamie, Maddie, Brooke.

1227
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,340
Brooke is good.

1228
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,020
These are all regular names.

1229
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:26,220
What about Sarsi?

1230
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:26,780
I spoke too soon.

1231
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:27,500
Hey, guys.

1232
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,540
How about SARS?

1233
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:34,300
You can't take the adjective and then throw an R in it.

1234
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,100
This is my baby.

1235
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:35,820
She's a diva.

1236
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:36,940
Her name is Durva.

1237
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:37,440
Yeah.

1238
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,500
I need a melancholic child name.

1239
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,700
Call him Melanchorlic.

1240
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,360
Crystal.

1241
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:47,500
Bristol?

1242
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:48,560
Crystal.

1243
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,620
All right.

1244
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,660
What about Bristol?

1245
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:55,180
Crystal, Chloe, Silver, Giselle.

1246
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,380
Wait, jump back.

1247
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:56,940
Silver?

1248
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,500
With a Y.

1249
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,140
Like the horse?

1250
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,500
They have spelled it with a Y.

1251
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,180
Yeah, because that's not going to have any jokes about it

1252
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,460
whatsoever in grade school.

1253
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,340
What about, like, what if you called your baby, like,

1254
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:10,700
Bitch Patrol?

1255
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:15,900
That's sassy, isn't it?

1256
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:23,580
What about, this is my daughter, No Scrubs.

1257
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,140
Don't even trip.

1258
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,660
This is my baby, Creepin'.

1259
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,540
This is my baby, TLC.

1260
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,460
Wait, I don't think...

1261
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:35,020
The name of that song wasn't Creepin', was it?

1262
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,060
It was just Creep.

1263
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,580
I think it was just Creep.

1264
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:37,820
Yeah.

1265
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,180
If you name your baby Creep.

1266
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,540
This is my baby, Radiohead.

1267
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:43,740
She's sassy.

1268
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:49,500
What if you name your baby after, like, sassy women who have gone before?

1269
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,500
And you're like, this is my baby, Joan of Arc.

1270
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:51,660
Yeah.

1271
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,060
What if you just called your baby, Uh-Uh?

1272
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:56,700
Not on my watch.

1273
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:58,940
No, sir.

1274
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:00,940
What if you name your baby...

1275
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:03,660
That was it.

1276
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,340
Was it those three snaps?

1277
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,460
Just three snaps.

1278
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,540
If you make your baby, if you want a sassy baby,

1279
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,260
give her a name that humiliates people to pronounce.

1280
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:15,980
So if you said, my name is Destiny!

1281
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:16,460
Eeeeeee!

1282
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,500
And it's got forty Es at the end.

1283
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,740
And some of them are capitalized, and some of them are not, and you have to voice that.

1284
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,980
If you don't address me as Destinyeeeeee!

1285
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,660
I will not respond.

1286
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:26,380
The.

1287
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,060
That sounded like it was, like, 38 Es.

1288
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,820
That's gonna be tough to put down on her SAT.

1289
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,100
That's gonna be...

1290
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,380
I'm gonna need another sheet.

1291
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,340
That's gonna be a lot of Bubbles on that crazy matrix.

1292
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:42,400
I don't think that's gonna be a problem.

1293
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,400
Destiny!

1294
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:52,480
You know what, I am not gonna undersell Destiny and I'll tell you why.

1295
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,880
I don't think her name is going to prevent her from achieving the goals she wants in

1296
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,880
life.

1297
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,680
I want her to be the first lady president of the United States of America.

1298
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,680
Wow!

1299
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,520
Madam President Destiny!

1300
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:10,340
I'm a ghost.

1301
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:17,940
Hey, uh, so did you always, uh, think you would be president?

1302
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,940
Uh, yes.

1303
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:21,140
I always assumed that I would.

1304
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,780
So what would you say that is?

1305
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:26,940
Would, would it, I guess it was my fate?

1306
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,860
Uh, my fate to be, no, no, no, no, no, like.

1307
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:30,860
Predisposition?

1308
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:35,820
No, I mean like, what, what, if you thought you were always going to be it, it would be

1309
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:41,300
like your calling, like my calling?

1310
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,620
My destiny with Hawaii?

1311
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,620
I don't understand.

1312
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,620
I don't understand.

1313
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:50,140
Um, do you guys know what day it is?

1314
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:51,140
Game day?

1315
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,140
Game day?

1316
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,860
It's September, it's the first week of September.

1317
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:55,860
No.

1318
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:56,980
No.

1319
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:01,660
And as it is that, as is our calling, we're going to do things and we're going to talk

1320
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:02,660
about it.

1321
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:06,100
And we're going to talk about the things that are important this month and we're going to

1322
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,100
talk about them.

1323
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,100
Okay.

1324
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,620
It's fall hat month.

1325
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,340
What?

1326
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,820
It's also happy cat month.

1327
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,300
Oh, right.

1328
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:20,660
Now I don't know if that's saying happy cat month, everybody, or your cat looks bummed.

1329
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:27,300
Uh, it is national coupon month.

1330
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,300
Obviously.

1331
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,300
Yeah.

1332
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,300
It is.

1333
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:34,140
Can we talk about, when was the last time you guys used coupons?

1334
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,140
I used one literally.

1335
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,340
Coupons are the worst thing to ever happen to our economy.

1336
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:40,380
I literally used one last night to buy a chocolate cake at H-E-B.

1337
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,380
Really?

1338
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,300
Coupons are bullshit and they're ruining our economy.

1339
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,700
I don't think that's true, Travis.

1340
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,700
It is absolutely true.

1341
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,140
That sounds like a dumb thing you're saying.

1342
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,980
No, think about those people that walk in and use coupons like on extreme couponing

1343
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:54,500
and they end up paying like ten cents for a hundred dollars worth of food.

1344
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,540
I can't think of those things that you just said because they're not, like any rational

1345
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:01,140
person, those things you're talking about are not in my memory.

1346
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,140
Thanks.

1347
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:05,500
Dude, I work, I worked retail where people brought in fucking coupons all the time.

1348
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,500
Oh, shit.

1349
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,500
They're annoying and I hate that shit.

1350
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,500
Guys.

1351
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,500
What?

1352
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,500
It's pleasure your mate month.

1353
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,500
Whoa.

1354
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,500
No.

1355
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,500
You know what?

1356
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,500
Have you heard of swaddling?

1357
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,500
That seems to be big.

1358
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,140
I heard about it on the news last night.

1359
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,420
It was on 2020.

1360
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,140
Update your resume month.

1361
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,740
You're fired.

1362
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,820
I think you extrapolated you're fired.

1363
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:30,340
Those are the ones we're working with, it looks like.

1364
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,020
Library card sign up month.

1365
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,220
Okay, that's good.

1366
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:34,220
You don't have to use it.

1367
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:39,460
I'm having a hard time coming up with things between happy cat month and pleasure your

1368
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,460
mate month.

1369
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,820
Can we make a combo month?

1370
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:44,380
That's what I'm saying.

1371
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,940
Pleasure your fall hat month.

1372
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,420
Really get in there.

1373
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,060
Really get in there.

1374
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:54,540
When they say fall hat, is that like putting some fake leaves all over it?

1375
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,540
Go wild during California wild rice month.

1376
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,540
Okay.

1377
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:02,020
Hey, don't tell me how to fucking celebrate my fucking month, September.

1378
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:06,220
Hey, September, you're apparently no one wants this month anymore.

1379
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,060
I can't imagine why.

1380
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:12,060
It's not like it's been ruined for celebrations.

1381
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,060
And it sucks.

1382
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,260
Does not suck because September, it had so much going for it.

1383
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,060
It had that earth winning fire jam.

1384
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,540
Yeah, that was a good jam.

1385
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,900
Think about everybody's birthdays it is today.

1386
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:22,900
It's like-

1387
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,900
It's my grandma's birthday.

1388
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,380
Your birthday was ruined forever.

1389
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,940
Your birthday is actually ruined forever.

1390
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:31,180
Would you rather have a September 11th birthday or Christmas birthday?

1391
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,180
Christmas birthday.

1392
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:33,180
Really?

1393
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,180
At this point?

1394
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,300
At least there's like presents going around everywhere.

1395
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,220
Everyone's in a good mood and there's decorations and it's a happy time.

1396
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,900
Guys, it's pleasure your mate month.

1397
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,900
And you know what that means here at my bim bam.

1398
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,900
What?

1399
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,900
I don't know.

1400
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:48,900
Actually, I'm kind of afraid.

1401
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:55,540
I have all the hot bedroom tips that you can give.

1402
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,820
Oh, okay.

1403
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:01,460
Let me see if I got one here.

1404
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:06,460
Maybe just grab her nipple and just go for it.

1405
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,420
My brother, my brother and me.

1406
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,580
Have you considered a sex nick?

1407
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,140
My brother, my brother and me.

1408
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:17,100
Turn that wiener like a key in a lock.

1409
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:20,100
My brother, my brother and me.

1410
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,100
Helicopter.

1411
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,100
My brother, my brother and me.

1412
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,100
Oh, man.

1413
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,100
What?

1414
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,100
Never mind.

1415
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,100
I'll extract that.

1416
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,100
I don't know, Griffin.

1417
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,100
I'm not fucking Dr. Ruth over here.

1418
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,100
I can't explain it all.

1419
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:30,820
How about this?

1420
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:35,300
Take a moment, look in your mate's eyes, then Superman that ho.

1421
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,300
My brother, my brother and me.

1422
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:37,300
Sure.

1423
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,300
Can you do that while looking in the eyes?

1424
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,140
I don't know the physiology of supermanning.

1425
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:46,380
Can you explain to me what supermanning is and I'll beep the whole thing out?

1426
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:47,380
You promise to beat the whole thing out?

1427
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:48,380
I swear to God I will.

1428
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:49,380
Do you swear?

1429
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,380
I swear to Christ.

1430
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,380
You Superman that ho, you cunt.

1431
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,380
Sorry, radio audience.

1432
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,380
That's what Google's for.

1433
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,380
I'm going to black out.

1434
00:58:55,380 --> 00:59:13,180
That's what you hear when you're doing it so right.

1435
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:17,860
My brother, my brother.

1436
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,040
What would R. Kelly do?

1437
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,040
My brother, my brother.

1438
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,040
Oh, man.

1439
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,040
Then do the opposite thing.

1440
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,660
Yeah, then do the exact opposite.

1441
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:28,060
For the love of destiny.

1442
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,140
How about this?

1443
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,980
True pleasure awaits.

1444
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:33,980
That's what-

1445
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:34,980
Is this like tantric shit?

1446
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:35,980
Are you talking like what would Sting do?

1447
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:40,180
I'm talking about tantricize that until you're married to it.

1448
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:45,980
Oh, so what if pleasure mate month means take the whole month and really just get some Clif

1449
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:49,820
bars and some energy drinks and let's do this.

1450
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:54,820
What if pleasure your mate month doesn't mean mate in the American sense but mate in the

1451
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:57,100
British sense where it's just like-

1452
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,780
You're saying like, hey buddy.

1453
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:00,780
Hey, pal.

1454
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:05,940
Is this the month for you?

1455
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:10,060
Why do you have to pleasure him with adult things?

1456
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:15,580
Or can't you take him just get some fish and chips by me, right?

1457
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:16,780
Back rubs galore.

1458
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:22,820
Take your mate to Buffalo Wild Wings and Weck and enjoy some buffalo wings together.

1459
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,180
And that'll be delicious.

1460
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:26,860
And then later, Superman that ho.

1461
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,260
And then just Superman him.

1462
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:33,060
By which I mean, he's gonna do it.

1463
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:34,060
Yuck-o.

1464
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:39,460
Hey, I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first I want to remind you that this is

1465
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,020
my brother, my brother and me.

1466
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:46,340
If you have someone in your life that is not listening to our program, send them this link

1467
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:50,500
bit.ly forward slash it's my bim bam.

1468
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,740
Tweet it, mail it to people.

1469
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:54,020
I don't care.

1470
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:56,460
Just get it out there and write it on a piece of paper.

1471
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,460
Get new people on board.

1472
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:02,340
Transcribe our entire podcast by hand and bind it in a book.

1473
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,420
And then can I have it?

1474
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:08,260
If you want us to be on your podcast, just let us know.

1475
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:09,300
We'll do that too.

1476
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,300
We're flexible.

1477
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,300
Yeah.

1478
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,300
We'll do anything.

1479
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,660
We're looking to make some guest spots.

1480
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:15,900
We'll do a guest spot on your show.

1481
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:19,780
I'm actually doing a piece on Radio Lab.

1482
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,500
They're doing a whole episode on swaddling.

1483
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,500
Uh-huh.

1484
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,740
I was catching on that quick.

1485
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:33,860
I found this elderly couple that has swaddled every single night for 90 years.

1486
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,140
They're actually setting a record.

1487
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:36,140
They've never stopped swaddling.

1488
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:37,140
They have been swaddling.

1489
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:40,860
It makes it awkward to walk around the house.

1490
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:47,180
I am so yucked right now.

1491
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:50,280
Thank you to everybody who's been tweeting about the show.

1492
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,340
We really appreciate that.

1493
01:01:53,340 --> 01:02:02,420
Thank you to Eminent Emily, Maya Love, Beard of Prey, Brittney Lee, Ducklips513, Chris

1494
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:08,660
Buehler, AlwaysAmyH, MarshallDBDX, BD Sean, everybody.

1495
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:16,460
I want to thank SingleGirl1983 because she sent in like 40 Yahoo answers on the tweets.

1496
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:17,460
Thank you.

1497
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:18,460
Awesome.

1498
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,460
Thank you.

1499
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:24,640
SupplySideJesus, Matt Hutchings, so many people are out there spreading the word.

1500
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:29,400
If you want to do that, use the NBNBA hashtag.

1501
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:34,300
You would suggest, actually, I would suggest at least make a column of the NBNBA search

1502
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:42,300
because you, JBPD did that this week, and you will be amazed at some of the things,

1503
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:48,340
some of the wonders, the delights, the garden of earthly delights that is the NBNBA hashtag

1504
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:49,740
search.

1505
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:50,980
So keep an eye on that.

1506
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:55,780
I really want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of their theme song,

1507
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:59,540
It's a Departure, from the album Putting the Days to Bed, which is fantastic, and while

1508
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:06,460
you're buying that, John Roderick just started up his own podcast with Merlin Mann.

1509
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:08,500
It is delightful.

1510
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,940
It is called...

1511
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:11,580
It's called Roderick on the Line.

1512
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:12,580
Roderick on the Line.

1513
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,580
Thank you.

1514
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:14,580
Boom.

1515
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:18,280
So thank you, John and Long Winters.

1516
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:21,460
And Merlin Mann, just for being you.

1517
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:22,460
So Griffin.

1518
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:23,460
Yeah, I got it.

1519
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,460
I think we're ready.

1520
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:27,980
The final Yahoo answer was sent in by FaeStyle on Twitter.

1521
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:28,980
Thank you, FaeStyle.

1522
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:41,380
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jiraiya, who asks, if you surgically attach two guys together

1523
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:45,580
in a 69 position, will the pee just go round and round in an endless cycle?

1524
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:49,700
I'm genuinely upset, is what I am.

1525
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,220
Oh, God, I'm disgusted.

1526
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:56,900
This is the most upsetting episode, you know?

1527
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:57,900
Yeah.

1528
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:58,900
There.

1529
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:03,820
My brother, my brother, that's where the lips.

1530
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:14,020
Game day.

1531
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:15,020
Keep your heart, three stacks.

1532
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:16,020
Keep your heart, hey.

1533
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,020
Keep your heart, three stacks.

1534
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,020
Keep your heart.

1535
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,020
Man, these girls are smart.

1536
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,020
Three stacks.

1537
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,020
These girls are smart.

1538
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:22,020
Three stacks.

1539
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,020
These girls are smart.

1540
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:24,020
Three stacks.

1541
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,020
These girls are smart.

1542
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:52,020
Three stacks.
