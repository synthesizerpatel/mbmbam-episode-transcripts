1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,360
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,880
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,040
I'm Griffin. I'm fucking steamed, gang. I'm fucking sacked off today,

8
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,360
this morning finds me PO'd. This is interesting energy

9
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,760
to bring to our comedy advice show, Griffin. Well, what am I supposed to do?

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,960
I'm this pissed-tickled, Trav. I'm this frustrated and pissed-tickled.

11
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,240
Just my world's fucking falling apart, Trav, and so I'm really pissed off.

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,320
Why is that? Because of all the really bad stuff that's happening in the world and all the people

13
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,600
that are in danger. Pissed off and ticked on I am because of the, you all saw it, right?

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,560
You all saw it, and it was just a fucking nudge, wasn't it? It was just a little nudge.

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,200
It was a little kiss. Griffin, are you talking about how the Notre Dame?

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not talking about my- No, that's covered by all the trillionaires who have nothing better

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,280
to do. I'm talking about these beautiful beasts, these beautiful Kentucky beasts,

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,360
and then they bumped. That got me really pissed off, what happened because of that. Justin,

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,760
did you hear about this shit? I am so tired of Griffin telling me how over

20
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,760
he is talking about horses, and then he gallops back on the show with another equine-

21
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,120
This isn't even about me talking shit. This isn't about Goose About Horses,

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:16,160
Justin. This is about the gosh dang sport. I did read about it. I just skimmed it. I

23
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,360
didn't really de-breed it, but it's something about one horse would have won, but it humped

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,440
another one. It wasn't even a hump. It was barely a nudge, Travis. Don't be fucking puerile

25
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,960
with your humor when we're talking about something exciting and important as sports.

26
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,080
Griffin, I feel like you might be the only one who knows what you're talking about.

27
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:44,160
Okay. There's this big horse race that Kentucky does sometimes. Maybe you've heard about it,

28
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:52,000
the one with the hats. It's the most exciting 90 seconds in sports because these horses get

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,680
together and they race, and we make jokes about it every year. This time, the joke's on us,

30
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,920
it feels like, because- Oh, the viewers.

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,880
The Maximum Security, which is the horse's name, everybody was like, that's going to win. It's

32
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,080
owned by quote, billionaire philanthropist Gary West. Gary West raises himself a good

33
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,360
motherfucking pony. Maximum Security won the Florida Derby, which is a joke. It's a joke

34
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,680
race that we all like to poke fun at when we're sitting there in our cool hats. Sure enough,

35
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,520
Maximum Security, like a fucking car, like two horses. This guy ran and won the big race,

36
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,560
and then he crossed the finish line, they poured all the milk on his head and poured the milk on

37
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,880
Jockey's head, and everybody was like, yeah. The one who was supposed to win won, and everybody

38
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,200
got a nominal amount of money, except the people who placed stupid bets on weak horses.

39
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,040
Then one of the horses was like, hey, to its manager, hey, you should say something. Then

40
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,600
the team behind this horse, named Country House, the worst horse name I've ever heard,

41
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,320
was like- It is a very slow name.

42
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:54,480
It was like, hey, ref, run back the tapes if you don't mind. Apparently, Maximum Security,

43
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,920
a whiff of skin- Had a lot of fun out there.

44
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,680
Had a lot of fun out there, a whiff of skin, rubbed up against Country House,

45
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,720
they disqualified the fucking horse. Country House was a 65 to one long shot. This horse

46
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,760
is a fucking joke. I could have beaten this horse in a foot race, but it was like, actually,

47
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,000
I got touched. It was in second place, and then it got the win, and then there had to be something

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,920
going on because 65 to one, that's so much money if you bet on that one, even though you're wrong

49
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,920
because it lost because it came in second. Super rich.

50
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,560
What were the odds on Maximum Security, Griffin? One to one, it was supposed to win because it

51
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,040
was in prophecy and shit. Then it got kicked out of the race forever for doing that.

52
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,840
Griffin, I want to try to sum up how you're feeling, and you tell me-

53
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,320
Pissed off.

54
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,040
... if you agree with this.

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,480
I want to try to encapsulate her. You would say the Kentucky Derby decision was not a good one.

56
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,120
I don't think it was a good decision overall.

57
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,880
You would say it was a rough and tumble race on a wet and sloppy track,

58
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,080
actually a beautiful thing to watch.

59
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,320
Yeah, I think that's how I would encapsulate most-

60
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,680
So you're agreeing with that. You would also say that only in these days of political

61
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,920
correctness could such an overturn occur. The best horse did not win the Kentucky Derby,

62
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,600
not even close? I would say factually,

63
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,280
statistically, yes, all that tracks.

64
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,240
Okay, so this entire tweet, you're completely on board with whoever tweeted it.

65
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:24,560
You're probably like, no, that one was our cool president, Donald Trump.

66
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,320
So you, on this one-

67
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,000
You won and won.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,120
Just like the odds for Maximum Security.

69
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,160
Just listen.

70
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,800
Two parallel light cycles, Griffin and Donald Trump agree.

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,240
Two parallel light cycles screaming towards the wall.

72
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,120
Listen, and if they touch, the blue one's out.

73
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,840
It's the whole point of the light cycles is to make them bump.

74
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,400
Listen, fucking, rubbing is racing.

75
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,880
These horses are going to touch out there on a sloppy course.

76
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,240
I don't understand, like, I disagree with everything else he's ever said,

77
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
but this is factual.

78
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,120
I'll take this to its logical conclusion though,

79
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,560
well, you're like, if one horse was running and stabbed another horse,

80
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,760
would you disqualify it?

81
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,080
Well, that happened, of course, in the 1996 Derby

82
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,760
when Murder Boy lived up to his name.

83
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,360
Yes, of course.

84
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,920
And do you think he should have been disqualified for that?

85
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
No, they did book the jockey on that one,

86
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,240
which is good because he was really goading him along.

87
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,440
That was the right decision.

88
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,640
But the jockey didn't do the stabbing?

89
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,000
No, but he was accomplice, and everybody knows horses can be led,

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,280
you can't lead a horse to water,

91
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,960
but you can make it murder somebody

92
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,440
if you say the magic spell in its ear on the racetrack.

93
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,640
The thing that irritated me about the president's cold tweet

94
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,200
is he said the best horse did not win the Kentucky Derby.

95
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,240
Not even close.

96
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,920
I would say, considering the second place horse

97
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,040
was then awarded the victory, he was in fact close.

98
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,200
He was way closer than any of the other horses,

99
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,400
so much so that he was the second place finisher in that race.

100
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,560
I would also argue that the best horse won

101
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,440
and then got disqualified, which is very close.

102
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,840
That's pretty close.

103
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,840
So in either way, the best horse was very close to winning,

104
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,200
either way you look at it.

105
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,360
I can't believe they did the Kentucky Derby on yesterday.

106
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,960
It was free comic book day, May the 4th,

107
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,160
and also Kentucky Derby, like nerdgasm.

108
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,280
Yeah, sure, man.

109
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,840
You know what I mean?

110
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,360
You know what I also find weird?

111
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
That it's kind of like a speakeasy thing

112
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,840
where they never publicize the Kentucky, it just happens.

113
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,480
And if you're not looking, you'll miss it.

114
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,920
Yeah, no one knew it was happening

115
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,000
until the horses were like halfway around.

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,640
Here's a quote from Bill Mott, who's country house's trainer,

117
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,240
that lucky son of a gun.

118
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,280
Bill Mott says, you know, here's the thing about the liberals,

119
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,600
because I am one, but don't they stink, guys?

120
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:39,840
Yeah.

121
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:40,880
Cool.

122
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,240
No, Bill Mott says, with regards to Luis Saez,

123
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,760
who was the jockey on maximum security,

124
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,320
the most powerful and wonderful horse that ever lived on this earth,

125
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,800
and he said of Saez, I think the horse did this on his own.

126
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,760
I don't think Luis Saez did anything intentionally.

127
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,560
He's a friend of mine.

128
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,280
He rides with me.

129
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,880
My heart actually aches for them.

130
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,720
I've been on the other end of this plenty of times,

131
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
just not in the Kentucky Derby.

132
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,680
Eat my whole asshole, Bill Mott.

133
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,680
You know, Bill Mott's like, thanks, Luis.

134
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,360
I don't give a fuck what happened.

135
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,160
I got the money.

136
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,040
I got the money.

137
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,000
My horse's nuts are now worth a billion dollars a piece.

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,200
Everything kicks ass.

139
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,760
This horse, the other horse is going to die tonight,

140
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,040
and that's on me and my good friend Luis Saez,

141
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,760
who I did pay $100,000 to kick the other horse

142
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
like he's playing fucking Road Rash.

143
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,400
Horses are dumb, but I don't think they're so dumb

144
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,640
that they'd be in a race and they'd be debating blasting,

145
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
side blasting one of their compatriots.

146
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,880
It's like, I want to win so bad,

147
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,400
I want to side blast this other horse

148
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,200
so I get executed in the parking lot tonight.

149
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,240
Not only that, but-

150
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,360
That's so worth it to me.

151
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,680
If you think it's the horse's fault,

152
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,960
you shouldn't punish that horse.

153
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,000
It's a horse.

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,720
It's a horse.

155
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,840
It's no horse's fault.

156
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,200
It has to be.

157
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,960
It doesn't know what the fuck it's doing.

158
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,160
It has to be.

159
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,280
Moments in my life, anything that happens out there

160
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,320
has to be the human being, all the horse's fault.

161
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,920
There's no, the horse got to go play.

162
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,720
It depends, right?

163
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,080
We're talking about nature versus nurture.

164
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,440
You grow up in the fields, it's like,

165
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,840
oh man, it's all about just being free.

166
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,160
And if we find some wild oats, hell yeah.

167
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,400
But when you grow up in this environment

168
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,480
with somebody every day yelling at you,

169
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,320
rubbing is racing, rubbing is racing.

170
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,880
Get out there and trade some paint, motherfucker.

171
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,120
Then these, of course they're going to just push on the field.

172
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,800
But again, again though, not the horse.

173
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,400
Like, this person is offloading blame

174
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,560
from the jockey to the horse.

175
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,280
It's like, the horse has no, the horse is no horse.

176
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,240
The jockey's one job is control the horse.

177
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,600
Yeah, don't let the horse blast other horses.

178
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,920
Don't let him side blast another horse.

179
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,360
Hey, side blasting.

180
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,920
Keep on moving forward, not side to side.

181
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,360
Not side to side.

182
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,200
You lose valuable time that way

183
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,600
if you're side blasting your enemies.

184
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
If you wanted to make the Kentucky Derby fun and watchable.

185
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,160
Yeah.

186
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,920
I make it about 40 seconds in every year.

187
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,680
I'm like, which way is the bar?

188
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,800
Yeah, too long.

189
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,400
Too long, a minute and a half, come on.

190
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,160
Which weapon would you give East Jockey

191
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,680
to make the Kentucky Derby better?

192
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,200
Only jockey to jockey violence, right?

193
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,720
I don't want to see no jockeys hurting horses.

194
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,280
Well, more than that.

195
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,760
No, no, no.

196
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,280
Jockey to jockey violence, right?

197
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,360
I would say a net.

198
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,480
A net seems fun.

199
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,160
I think what would be cool is if instead of weapons,

200
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,640
you just, what is there, like 30 horses in this fucking race?

201
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,520
Take 15 of them at the starting line

202
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,080
and you turn them 180 degrees.

203
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,160
And now we go.

204
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,880
And hopefully on pretty much the complete opposite side

205
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,800
of the track, there's going to be a sort of collision field.

206
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,280
A sort of collision-

207
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,640
Kind of a bob and weave, yeah.

208
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,840
Sort of a collision zone.

209
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,600
Every half lap, we're going to end up

210
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,760
entering to the collision zone

211
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,160
and you really need to sort of get around that.

212
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,760
And I think it's just last horse standing.

213
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,600
What about this, tinier horses?

214
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,280
That you would, no, explain.

215
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,320
Explain that.

216
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,440
It's the same exact race, but like miniature horse

217
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,480
instead of full-size horses.

218
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,000
I would watch the hell out of it.

219
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,800
Give me like 12 little Sebastians out there.

220
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,040
Yeah.

221
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,760
Forget about it.

222
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,200
I'm watching the hell out of that.

223
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,200
We could do 29 little horses and one big powerful horse.

224
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,640
And one Clydesdale.

225
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,200
That's got a mighty, mighty hunger.

226
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,320
That can only be satisfied in one dark way.

227
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,880
Okay.

228
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,880
Instead of 30 horses, in the same space, 300 horses.

229
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
300 horses is really good, Trav.

230
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,280
I was actually going to suggest that

231
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,800
when Griffin asked how many horses there were,

232
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,200
I thought he was going to like quintuple it

233
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,280
and just let it get out there and team.

234
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,520
Yeah.

235
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,760
What would be tight is if the track was made out of

236
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,000
just slick stainless steel

237
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,720
and then it sort of sloped inward.

238
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,800
Like it sloped towards the center of the track

239
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,440
so it would collect all the good horse grease

240
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,840
that would be generated by these 300 beautiful animals

241
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,240
just walking all over each other.

242
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,800
Just catch all that grease in a pan in the middle

243
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,680
and then the winner gets to eat it for power.

244
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,720
Check this idea out.

245
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,680
One island.

246
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,160
Okay.

247
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,200
400 oats.

248
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,600
Some horses.

249
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:21,920
Uh-huh.

250
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,360
Race it out.

251
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,200
Race island.

252
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,000
Race island.

253
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,120
I'm telling you, man, if you really want to sell race island,

254
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,000
you've got to get the word horse in the title.

255
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,800
Really?

256
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,680
Race island.

257
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,640
A horse show.

258
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,000
This fall on ABC.

259
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,120
A horse endeavor.

260
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,560
Race island.

261
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,840
A father horse mystery.

262
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,440
The horse is a priest.

263
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,280
Race war.

264
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,480
A horsey story.

265
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,160
Oh wait, it's actually getting worse.

266
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,080
Race island.

267
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,800
Race island.

268
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,840
Helicopters.

269
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,880
It's horses though.

270
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,760
Yeah, but we watch them with the helicopters.

271
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,200
How about 30 horses, one of them's a robot,

272
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,120
and we're not going to tell you which.

273
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,520
All right.

274
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,480
The twist is, they're all robots.

275
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,720
God, that was a lot of horse work we just did there.

276
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,520
Good work, boys.

277
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,880
You begged for it.

278
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,280
Still got it.

279
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,240
You wanted it so bad.

280
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,680
I mean Griffin, not you the listener.

281
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,560
You didn't ask for any of that.

282
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
They've been begging for it too.

283
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,680
I'm a part-time artist, part-time nanny.

284
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,840
I like to combine these talents and get money for

285
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,720
them by offering private art classes to youth.

286
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,120
My biggest worry is getting stuck with a kid who I have nothing in common with, or just a bummer.

287
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,680
How do I set up a screening process to make sure I only had to teach cool kids

288
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,640
without them or their parents realizing they are being screened?

289
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,720
That's from an awfully awkward artist.

290
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:53,520
This is like a backwards Mr. Holland's opus that I really enjoy.

291
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,560
It's Mr. Holland's nopus, and I really like it a lot.

292
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,080
Listen, if I was going to stand and deliver it, I don't want to get halfway through the semester

293
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
and be like, no, you know what?

294
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,760
I can't help you.

295
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,040
I thought I could.

296
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,960
I thought you were cool, but it turns out you suck shit.

297
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,160
Get out of here.

298
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:19,760
Isn't it better to teach a kid to do art and he'll be underemployed his entire life.

299
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,680
Teach a kid to hang and he can chill forever.

300
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,800
Think about that for a second.

301
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,840
Teach a kid to hang art and he might become a docent or something somewhere.

302
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,560
That's a job.

303
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,440
Now that's a job.

304
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,080
That there's a job.

305
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,520
That there's a job that can never be done by a machine.

306
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,400
No, no.

307
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,360
Hanging art?

308
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,240
No, no, no.

309
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,680
You need a human touch for that.

310
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,400
You need a human.

311
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,360
You could dress yourself up like a big child and then see if they bully you.

312
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,520
And then if they ride off on their skateboard after doing so, you're like, okay,

313
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,640
okay, that seems like a popular and I could be with that.

314
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,600
Like you really beg for it.

315
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,920
You wear like a secondhand elf t-shirt.

316
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,400
Yeah.

317
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,320
Yeah, maybe you walk in and you fall down.

318
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,520
And you have like a chocolate pudding stain on the back of your shirt.

319
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,080
Yeah, like shit.

320
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,120
Like shit.

321
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
Get fucking back into me bullying.

322
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,880
And if they don't say anything or if they're like, let's get you to the bathroom and clean it.

323
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,080
Let's find a teacher.

324
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,280
And you're like, ah, damn it.

325
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,120
You're not the chosen one.

326
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,560
I wanted to, the kid in the corner who yelled, is that shit?

327
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,680
Everyone look.

328
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,160
I've got to find out his parents, who they are.

329
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,240
And if they are interested in enriching his mind with artistic endeavors.

330
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:50,480
I think it is more fun if you can sort of make the kid be cool.

331
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,640
Make the kid be someone who is in common with you.

332
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,640
That wasn't a good sentence, but I think you got the point of what I was trying to say.

333
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,480
I actually didn't.

334
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,840
No, me neither.

335
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,040
If the kid's not in common with you, get them there.

336
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,560
Wait, what does that mean?

337
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,920
That one's even worse.

338
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,160
Yeah, so first of all, those glasses have got to go.

339
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,520
Oh, wait, are you She's All That-ing this kid?

340
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:17,040
I think that's, I'm doing a sort of Mr. Holland's All That sort of situation.

341
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,360
Uh-huh, okay.

342
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,880
Mr. Holland gets his groove back.

343
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,920
And boy, I wish I'd seen that movie so I could generate some good jokes here.

344
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,480
But just kind of like, you know what that movie's about.

345
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,320
And it's the things about it that would be funny to poke jokes about.

346
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,400
So you go ahead and do that yourself, thanks.

347
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,200
I mean, you tell the kid you need to buy some weed, right?

348
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,160
I mean, that's how you-

349
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:47,040
That's a dangerous gambit, Justin, because if the kid's not cool, you just lost your job.

350
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,320
Whatever, if the kid tells you he's a fucking narc, you didn't want him anyway.

351
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,040
They can't fire you for telling them that their kid's a narc.

352
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,320
Yeah, they can't fire you.

353
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,800
You quit.

354
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,320
Hold on.

355
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,240
What's up?

356
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,760
Listen, it's not my fault.

357
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,960
I thought your kid was cool.

358
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,880
I think you need to re-evaluate your parenting decisions.

359
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,720
They don't work for a firm.

360
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,640
There's not like a service sending them out.

361
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,720
They're an independent contractor who wants to buy some weed.

362
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,360
Is it weird if you request headshots of them wearing what they think is their coolest t-shirt?

363
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,880
Because that's gonna-

364
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,280
That'll be a good sort of rubric for you to grade these children.

365
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,640
Headshots are good.

366
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,480
Headshots are good, but if they just dress up in their Sunday best, nuh-uh.

367
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:40,480
If they dress up wearing a sports t-shirt or an athlete's jersey, then yes, come on in.

368
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,120
Well, but I think you might also need maybe just like a hundred word essay on the back

369
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,280
explaining why the shirt is cool.

370
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,200
Because like, there is a Garfield t-shirt that I wore unironically when I was like nine, right?

371
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

372
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,560
But if I saw a nine-year-old now wearing that and they were like, this is ironic.

373
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,320
I'd be like, oh, okay.

374
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,560
Yeah.

375
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,000
In there.

376
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,160
But if I saw them and I'd be like, wait, is that ironic or unironic?

377
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,660
Ooh.

378
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,720
I am-

379
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,360
You didn't clarify what kind of artist.

380
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,520
So I'm just gonna assume you're a film director or a director of photography or something.

381
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,600
So all these kids can have a place in your film.

382
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,640
You know, you can ask for headshots.

383
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,240
Tell them you're looking for a bad boy.

384
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,560
If you find the bad boy first out, great.

385
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,720
But if not, then you just find another place to fold them into-

386
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,880
You know, if they're giving off kind of a wimpy non-energy,

387
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,960
maybe they're like behind the bar by the cool kid that you eventually find,

388
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,480
and they get like pulled over the bar and like shot as a beer bottle on their face

389
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,600
or something like that.

390
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,480
There's a part for every kid in your film that you're making.

391
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:46,980
Yeah.

392
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:54,240
I'm just saying, if they're wearing a Darth Maul t-shirt, you might be your redneck.

393
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,560
But if you're wearing a t-shirt with a badass picture of Dave Navarro on it-

394
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,160
What if you're wearing a Darth Maul t-shirt, but Darth Maul is dressed like Dave Navarro?

395
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,640
What if you're wearing a Darth Maul t-shirt and you are Dave Navarro?

396
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,720
I'm short circuiting over here, boys.

397
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,480
We should make a Darth Navarro t-shirt and see who sues us,

398
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,160
because I am curious who would get there first.

399
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,440
I got a Yahoo, can I read it?

400
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:22,740
Sure.

401
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,580
This one was sent in by Austin.

402
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,220
Thanks, Austin.

403
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,060
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call Dave, who asks,

404
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,940
How do I make it seem like I need protein powder for school?

405
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,340
My dad gave me his credit card and told me to order school supplies.

406
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,540
I accidentally ordered over a gallon of protein powder

407
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,740
because I had put it in my shopping cart as a joke.

408
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,460
What school-related thing can I tell my dad it's for?

409
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,580
It was $70.

410
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,580
$70.

411
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,220
Let's talk about this funny fucking joke first.

412
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,300
Was somebody watching you order school supplies on Amazon?

413
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,460
Because that's a weird show for them to be taking in.

414
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,580
Or was it just a little, what if I did get yoked?

415
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,060
I'm just going to add it as a little goof for myself.

416
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:11,780
And I think we all know that you wanted to get completely jacked up, ripped up, and yoked.

417
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,180
And there's no shame in that, but don't call it a joke.

418
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,980
Call it a secret.

419
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:23,620
Protein powder is expensive, especially if you're getting some pure, dope, keto-friendly shit.

420
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,820
Like the real dope fucking shit that's not just ground-up turkey.

421
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,460
Because a lot of protein powders these days are dried-up ground-up turkey.

422
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,180
And they'll flavor it with chocolate or vanilla,

423
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,060
but I know the truth that it's just ground-up turkey.

424
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,700
I want the ones with weird mushrooms in them that's going to freak my muscles out.

425
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,260
Yes, isolates, right?

426
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:46,580
Yeah.

427
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,380
Thank you.

428
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,220
I wanted to get really crazy in there.

429
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,540
I saw fucking Rob Lowe hawking Adkins.

430
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,980
And he was like-

431
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,500
Just like on a street corner?

432
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,620
No, on a commercial.

433
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,980
He's like, this is the shit that works for me.

434
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:08,740
And he's like, I have basically, Rob, lived in your guest house for the past 25 years of your life.

435
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,420
You have never needed this.

436
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,100
You cannot keep anything from me.

437
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,940
I followed you from West Wayne to Dr. Vegas and back.

438
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,740
Like you have never needed this program.

439
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,180
I call bullshit on you, Rob.

440
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,020
Robert, if you prefer.

441
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,540
So why-

442
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,740
He prefers Bob Lowe.

443
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,260
He prefers bobbles.

444
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:31,700
What are we going to say to this guy's dad, though, about this being a vital school supply?

445
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,460
Travis has it.

446
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,020
Travis has it.

447
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,740
Travis has it.

448
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,980
Tell him you have a super yoked teacher who hates apples,

449
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,700
and this is what you're going to put on his desk day one to ensure straight A's.

450
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,300
That's good.

451
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,300
That's good.

452
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:55,940
My teacher of philosophy is star of station screen and the WWE superstar Dave Bautista.

453
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,860
And he loves teaching me about Immanuel Kant,

454
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,900
but when he gets an apple, he throws it back at the child that gave it to him as hard as he possibly can.

455
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,460
Now, if I give him this, it'll appease him like an angry god.

456
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,660
An angry god, and I feel like I'm going to get a lot out of him.

457
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:17,220
Dave Bautista, aka Trunchable, hates apples and kids, and will throw an apple through a kid.

458
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,740
Loves Groot, loves Groot.

459
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,540
Loves Groot.

460
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,420
Loves Groot.

461
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,540
Loves Groot.

462
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:27,620
But if I give him this protein powder, then I'm the Bautista, then I'm baby Bautista.

463
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,180
Remake Matilda with Bautista's Trunchable.

464
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:32,660
Thank you.

465
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,780
Do it, cowards.

466
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,820
Thank you.

467
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,340
It's 2019.

468
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,660
Cast Dave Bautista as Trunchable.

469
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,500
It's 2020.

470
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,460
Cast Dave Bautista as Matilda and call it Bautilda.

471
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,740
Cast Dave Bautista as every part in the movie.

472
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,220
Oh my god.

473
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,620
A one-hander.

474
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,500
Bautista as Trunchable, Bautista as Matilda in theaters 2020.

475
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:52,900
Yes.

476
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,180
This is a film.

477
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:54,900
Now we're back.

478
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,420
Now we're back.

479
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,380
Miss fucking Trunchable tries to piledrive Miss Honey.

480
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,220
Miss Honey reverses it.

481
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,420
Piledrives to Miss Trunchable.

482
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,340
She breaks her neck, dies in the first 10 minutes of the movie.

483
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,420
Cast The Rock as Miss Honey.

484
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,140
Cast what other big boys are there?

485
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:14,740
Get Vin Diesel in there as Danny DeVito's character, Mr. Matilda.

486
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,500
I have a problem.

487
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,000
Fight!

488
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,180
Haters, I want you to imagine something.

489
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:27,220
A tri-fold construction paper display.

490
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,180
And you know how it's always like, what causes volcanoes?

491
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,660
Or like, is coal really the future?

492
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,620
Is coal really the future?

493
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,300
Is coal really the future?

494
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,900
But how about this?

495
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,820
What if you saw a project that just said on construction paper letters,

496
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,020
how jacked is Dylan?

497
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,220
Your science fair project is like, how jacked am I getting right now?

498
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,100
It's just you under a sheet, and when the judges walk by,

499
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,180
you throw out the sheet and yell, real jacked!

500
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,580
I'm extremely jacked is the answer.

501
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,260
And then when the teacher comes by and is like, all right,

502
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,060
so tell me everything about the science details of your project.

503
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:10,740
And you're like, well, protein is an element that gets you totally wild strong,

504
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,860
and if you mix it up with these mushrooms, which is the middle of the food pyramid,

505
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,780
then it makes your pecs go absolutely crazy in there.

506
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:24,980
So my name's Dylan, and I'll take my A plus now, or else you're going in the chokie.

507
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,460
I can put you there.

508
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,780
I can put you there with my huge body.

509
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,940
Now, eat this whole cake.

510
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,100
Eat this whole cake, Batista.

511
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,340
I want to watch damn Batista eat a whole cake, please!

512
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,140
I have a very specific website for you, Trapp.

513
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,540
Let's send that right along.

514
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:49,540
I got a handful of WWE superstars in my employ, and let's just say,

515
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,100
the tables have turned on Mr. Goldust, who recently announced his retirement,

516
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,660
and let's just say, he's coming to me for his lunch these days.

517
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,500
And is his lunch a whole cake?

518
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,780
It's a whole cake, yeah.

519
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,540
And I have him locked up on my roof.

520
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,380
I feed him like a carrier pigeon.

521
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,900
A whole cake?

522
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,620
Yeah.

523
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,740
I have another question.

524
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,220
Yep.

525
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,020
And I've been having the same problem for years now.

526
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,540
People think I dig up dinosaurs.

527
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,900
It's unrelated.

528
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,300
Sorry.

529
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,500
I'm an archaeologist.

530
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,100
I've been having the same problem for years now.

531
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,580
Incontinence and efficiency in my writing.

532
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,660
I put in extraneous details, like my career, whenever I ask the right questions

533
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,460
about incontinence.

534
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,060
Okay, I'm an archaeologist.

535
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,500
I've been having the same problem for years now.

536
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,580
People just think I dig up dinosaurs.

537
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,900
Recently doing my masters in osteoarchaeology has just made this worse,

538
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:43,140
because when I say I work with bones, they say, oh, like dinosaurs?

539
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,580
How do I let people know that archaeology has nothing to do with dinosaurs,

540
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,980
and I dig up people and not plesiosaurs?

541
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,580
That's from Phalacius in the Cretaceous.

542
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,180
Great.

543
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:54,660
Yes.

544
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,660
There were a lot of difficult words in there, Justin.

545
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,060
You did great.

546
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,740
You did a fucking great job, bud.

547
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,140
Thank you.

548
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,620
I started feeling pretty good around osteoarchaeology,

549
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,900
but I didn't want to say anything, because I knew I'd fuck up, like, lit.

550
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,140
Yeah.

551
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,660
Yeah, you were afraid you'd jinx it.

552
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,060
Yeah.

553
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,860
I mean, I wouldn't just assume you dig up dinosaurs.

554
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,740
I would think that you obviously do dig up a lot of dinosaurs,

555
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,260
and that's maybe 95% of your work,

556
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,060
but the other 5% of your work is fighting with Nazis on conveyor belts

557
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,820
and squishing them down into a rock tumbler.

558
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,060
Something along those lines.

559
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,260
I would say that if you're an archaeologist, right, you're doing some digging.

560
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:28,900
I am.

561
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,140
You might accidentally find a dinosaur.

562
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,580
Maybe it's not what you're looking for,

563
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,380
but it's not like if you found a dinosaur, you just throw it away, you know?

564
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,100
If you're looking for, I don't know, dead humans or clay pots or whatever,

565
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,180
and you find a Tyrannosaurus Rex, you'd probably still keep it, right?

566
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,100
So if you are in an area...

567
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,740
Hold on.

568
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,260
Stop the podcast.

569
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,500
If you're in an area where you assume there to be human remains,

570
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,660
and you instead found dinosaur remains among the human remains,

571
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,220
things have gone terribly wrong.

572
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,420
Well, I mean, the other option, Justin, is every time an archaeologist digs for something,

573
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,740
it is where it's supposed to be and they find it.

574
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:13,220
And I would say my scenario is more likely than your scenario.

575
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:13,860
You?

576
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,180
But like, what you're saying is insane.

577
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,820
What?

578
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,140
Like, think about the layers of the earth.

579
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,580
And we found dinosaurs.

580
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,900
Oh, it looks like all dinosaurs were Egyptians.

581
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,860
No, I'm not saying like, if you dig down five feet, right?

582
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,540
And find some old bones.

583
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,980
Then someone has buried a body there and you're not dealing with archaeology.

584
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,260
You're dealing with murder.

585
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,220
Right.

586
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:35,780
Okay.

587
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,820
Say 50 feet.

588
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,700
Whatever.

589
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,340
It's not like if you went a few miles west,

590
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,940
there would instead be dinosaur bones at that exact depth.

591
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,460
I could go outside and die on top of where a dinosaur is.

592
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,660
And then 100 years from now, somebody find my bones and they're like,

593
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,020
well, let's keep on pushing.

594
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,780
And in the same way, I'm sure this person when they're digging and they find dinosaur bones,

595
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,100
they're probably like, well, let's excavate the stomach because maybe it ate a person

596
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,020
and we can find them inside there somewhere and then get a double.

597
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,380
I am just making the case that I don't think you find human remains

598
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,380
and dinosaur bones at the same depth.

599
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,340
Not at the same depth.

600
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,340
But once you find one thing, you don't stop digging.

601
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,020
You're not just like, ah, femur.

602
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,500
Cool.

603
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,780
Quitting time.

604
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,700
Like you do the whole area.

605
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,660
I don't think you say like, well, we've had a very good day of unearthing clay pots.

606
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,900
I'm going to dig another 100 miles under the ground and see what I dig up.

607
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,660
But I'm saying you might accidentally find a dinosaur next to you.

608
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,260
You go 100 feet to the left.

609
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,700
There's some dinosaurs.

610
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:39,300
If the wind sweeps through the desert plains that you're doing your work in

611
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:45,300
and on your way back to the site, there's a whole unearthed Tyrannosaurus rex.

612
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,580
You're not going to be like, ah, the bones are so big.

613
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,980
Let's just keep going to where we intended to dig up some boring ass human bones

614
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,820
and they've only got like 50 bones.

615
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,780
And this T-Rex has like a thousand huge radical bones.

616
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:58,580
Right.

617
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,100
Yes.

618
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,140
Thank you, Griffin.

619
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,780
I'm just saying, I guess my thesis is that dinosaur bones

620
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,580
are better than our bones in every imaginable way.

621
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,500
They're way bigger and there's more of them.

622
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,540
And this person, I want to fix this person's problem.

623
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,740
Okay.

624
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,420
No, I'm saying like, I'm redirecting your energies away from arguing with me.

625
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:16,900
Okay.

626
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,380
Because none of us know anything about what we're talking about.

627
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,500
I've seen the Flintstones.

628
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,540
Okay.

629
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,940
I've seen bones and there's bones literally everywhere, Justin.

630
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,060
Do you think that when a bird is-

631
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,100
Justin, I've got it.

632
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,740
I've got it.

633
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,820
100 years from now, 2000 years from now, someone's excavating a museum.

634
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,180
They find dinosaur bones and human bones right next to each other.

635
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,660
What's up?

636
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,060
What's up?

637
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,540
What's up?

638
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,420
What's up?

639
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,500
Do you think what elephant is walking and then they see a person dead on the

640
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,100
ground but they also wanted to die there?

641
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,060
They're like, no, I'll keep walking another 100 feet so our bones don't get mixed up.

642
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,900
So foolish.

643
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,100
It's so foolish what you said.

644
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,060
Okay.

645
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:56,580
I am, I've found a scientific article here that I'm reading to help with this.

646
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:56,900
Okay.

647
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,540
What can we do?

648
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,860
If human and dinosaur bones are-

649
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,260
Yes.

650
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,260
If human and dinosaur bones are ever found the same layers,

651
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,220
it would be fascinating to both creationists and evolutionists.

652
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,980
So there's a whole new biblical view of history wouldn't be surprised,

653
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,380
but we consider several logical possibilities,

654
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,660
such as human parties invading dinosaur lands for-

655
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:16,900
Okay.

656
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,780
Where is this article from?

657
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,460
Can you tell me the source of it?

658
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,380
This is from answersingenesis.org.

659
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:21,860
I'm sorry.

660
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,980
That's no good, bud.

661
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,180
Okay.

662
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:26,580
All right.

663
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,100
Sorry.

664
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,260
Yeah.

665
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,860
So I think you just have to keep telling them what your job is

666
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,540
so that future generations don't have to.

667
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:38,260
I'm sorry you have to bear the weight of it, but it's just tough.

668
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:38,820
It's just tough.

669
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,260
When I find out you're a bone getter, I immediately go to dinosaurs

670
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,700
because they have the biggest, coolest bones.

671
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,580
And so just let me live in that fantasy because I don't have much else.

672
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,180
The Indiana Jones thing could help, though.

673
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,700
That's where my mind goes.

674
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,940
You never saw Indy digging up bones.

675
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,860
So that's what an archaeologist does, whatever Indiana Jones does.

676
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,660
I'm pretty sure he finds some people bones at some point.

677
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:03,060
I'm pretty sure he makes some people bones with his gun he has.

678
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,460
Do you have a fucking gun?

679
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,380
Because I want to know that.

680
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,580
Definitely.

681
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,380
People don't talk about it,

682
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,140
but it's not like Indiana Jones is in highly trafficked areas.

683
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,700
If Indiana Jones turns you into a corpse,

684
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,500
that's where you shall remain for the rest of time probably.

685
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,900
He also doesn't have a license to kill.

686
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,020
Like he's not like James Bond, but that fool has-

687
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,660
I know they're-

688
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,100
Listen, I know they're villains and in many cases Nazis, right?

689
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,820
I listen.

690
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:33,540
I'm glad he killed them, but he has killed a lot of people.

691
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,180
Just a ton.

692
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:34,740
Like a lot.

693
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,060
Like a metric ton.

694
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,620
Is he sitting there going like, I want to have job security

695
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,820
for archaeologists in the future, so I've got to kill these people now?

696
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,060
Yeah.

697
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,460
He's investing in archaeology future.

698
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:53,780
Well, I mean, his KD ratio isn't quite as hot as the box full of God's anger or something.

699
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,020
Not really quite sure what happened in that one,

700
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,460
but he sure did get a lot of those fellas.

701
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,380
I think it's just pure uncut God.

702
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,940
He just really got in there and really hurt those men really bad.

703
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,740
I got this one, Indy.

704
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,300
Sit this one.

705
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,660
Save your bullets, pal.

706
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,540
Save your leg.

707
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,180
I got this one.

708
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,540
You got me last time, Indy.

709
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,420
I'll get this one.

710
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:12,900
Hey, what are you-

711
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,460
Thanks, God.

712
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,540
I can't look at you or else I'll explode, but what are you doing out there?

713
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,580
Well, I'm kind of just shooting through a bunch of the lower rank ones,

714
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,020
but this big important one kind of make his whole fucking face melt.

715
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,260
Wow.

716
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:22,900
That's cool.

717
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,020
I was just going to shoot him.

718
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,740
No, no, no.

719
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,380
Don't worry about it.

720
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:25,780
You stay-

721
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,380
No, he's a message to the others.

722
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:27,780
It's cool.

723
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,180
It's cool.

724
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,580
It's cool.

725
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,220
Don't look though.

726
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,340
It's super cool what I'm doing, but don't look.

727
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,980
Don't look, it's embarrassing. I'm melting this guy.

728
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,620
Okay, you can look.

729
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,420
No, don't.

730
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:36,660
Don't.

731
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,540
That was a trick.

732
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,180
Okay, bye.

733
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,860
Should we go to the money zone?

734
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,140
I love that.

735
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,700
Let's do it.

736
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,420
Hey, can I tell you about Casper?

737
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,500
I was away from my bed for over a week,

738
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,740
and I hated it.

739
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,700
I mean, I miss my family.

740
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,260
Don't get me wrong.

741
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,580
I miss my wife and my child and everything else,

742
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:11,060
but my bed called to me from across thousands of miles

743
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,700
because I sleep on a Casper mattress.

744
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,020
And man, after you've slept on a Casper mattress,

745
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,500
nothing else will ever hold up.

746
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,220
It has the benefits of a hybrid collection,

747
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,740
meaning it's elevated lift support,

748
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,820
which increases airflow for cooling,

749
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,860
durability for all body types, and enhanced edge support.

750
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,460
So you don't get that thing like where

751
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,860
you know I flop around a lot while I'm trying to sleep,

752
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,500
and you don't just like the edge of this bed

753
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,580
doesn't just like collapse and you roll off.

754
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,140
Yeah.

755
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,660
It's amazing.

756
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,500
And it's my favorite bed in the world.

757
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,900
I can't imagine sleeping on anything else.

758
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,860
Well, you did.

759
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,660
You just did.

760
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,700
So you have to be able to imagine it.

761
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,860
Yeah, but now that I'm not doing it,

762
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,380
I try to remember it,

763
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,860
and it's just a haze of discomfort and pain.

764
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,360
Okay.

765
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,700
And so you have to check out these new hybrid mattresses.

766
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:05,300
And when you do, you can get $100 towards select mattresses

767
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,780

00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,460

775
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,500
Use brother at checkout.

776
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,260
It says here, Casper, sleep better, dream wetter.

777
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,420
It doesn't.

778
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,860
It doesn't say that, I'm sure.

779
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,020
Blue Apron also has a tagline,

780
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,460
and it's cook better, sleep wetter.

781
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,060
And they want to give you a box

782
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,100
that has lots of delicious ingredients in it

783
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,380
that you're gonna be able to use alongside this recipe

784
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,460
that is sort of the codex for the produce mystery

785
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,180
that they provide.

786
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,220
It's like an escape room,

787
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,820
but they tell you exactly how to do it.

788
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,180
And then once you get out,

789
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,580
you have like chicken piccata or some shit.

790
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,580
And it is super tasty.

791
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,860
We've all done Blue Apron.

792
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,620
I learned how to cook with Blue Apron.

793
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,100
It's been a lovely experience.

794
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,220
They make cooking at home

795
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,020
a very sustainable part of your weekly routine.

796
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,580
They got like fresh stuff.

797
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,660
They got a bunch of menu options

798
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,700
that you can pick and choose from

799
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,660
that are designed and tested by test kitchen chefs.

800
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,220
They use unique specialty ingredients

801
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,500
to bring the chef quality recipes to your dinner table.

802
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,700

That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

810
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,740
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

811
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,260
I'm bailiff Jesse Thorne

812
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,820
and justice is within your reach.

813
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,060
My mom refuses to take my phone calls.

814
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,140
My boyfriend says I should take our cats

815
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,180
with me to graduate school,

816
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,220
but I think he should keep them.

817
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,780
In the court of Judge John Hodgman,

818
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,460
justice rules.

819
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,620
My partner's board game collection

820
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,380
is out of control.

821
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,900
My sister won't stop stealing my clothes.

822
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,340
I'm Judge John Hodgman.

823
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,540
I'm tough, but fair.

824
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,780
I'll bring you justice

825
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,900
and I'm only a click away.

826
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,300
Tipping, automotive etiquette,

827
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,620
siblings, roommates.

828
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,460
If you've got a case,

829
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,060
go to maximumfun.org slash JJHO.

830
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,380
Judge John Hodgman is tough, but fair.

831
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,500
Tough, but fair.

Subscribe to the podcast today.

833
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,260
Judge John Hodgman rules.

834
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:25,940
That is all.

835
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,940
Would you guys like to enjoy

836
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,820
the Munch Squad segment?

837
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,340
Wow.

838
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,940
What a polite and calm way

839
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,900
of entering the segment.

840
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,460
Yeah, hold on.

841
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,740
No has never been an option because-

842
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,220
Well, in its twilight years,

843
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,980
the Munch Squad wants to be remembered

844
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,100
for being a considerate segment

845
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,460
that tried to make room for the new kids coming up.

846
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,940
Not that his brothers come up

847
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,900
with segments of their own,

848
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,780
but as it sort of dips into the sunset,

849
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,140
it wants to be remembered as a segment

850
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,940
that made room for the new guys coming up.

851
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,460
But the two segments I've done,

852
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,660
everyone hates.

853
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,140
Yeah.

854
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,100
Which ones are they?

855
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,580
That would be Sad Lives and Riddle Me Piss.

856
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,300
Could you try maybe different,

857
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,180
better ones would be-

858
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,900
I'm doing my best.

859
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,500
And for the record,

860
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,700
Riddle Me Piss has a 100% success rate

861
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,900
and it's never died in the vine.

862
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,300
That's true.

863
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,180
And everyone loves.

864
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,860
It's just harder for you to do,

865
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,220
so you don't.

866
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:25,940
Okay, that's fair.

867
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,740
I'm gonna start doing recaps

868
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,780
of The Good Fight

869
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,180
on the CBS All Access streaming channel

870
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,100
based entirely on guesswork.

871
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,020
And it's called The Good Recap,

872
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,540
and this is something I've been pitching.

873
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,380
And Justin, I guess if you wanna step aside

874
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,900
and let me do The Good Recap,

875
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,060
or are you like dead set on Munch Squad?

876
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,820
No, I got it.

877
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,180
So-

878
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,860
I wish I could do it with strings.

879
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,020
That would be more appropriate in its twilight years.

880
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,140
Oh, like a false-

881
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:16,580
I want a Munch Squad.

882
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,340
So I have a quick one here

883
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,420
that is very good.

884
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,100
It's a Munch Squad Jr.

885
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,500
Kind of Krispy Kreme is launching

886
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,100
a new fruit-inspired donut lineup

887
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,060
instead of just serving fruit.

888
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,780
Yeah, it's actually amazing

889
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,540
because they have four new donuts

890
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,700
that look, that are shaped

891
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,740
and decorated like fruit.

892
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,500
So there's a strawberry donut

893
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,620
and there's a pineapple donut

894
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,620
and there's a key lime donut,

895
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:54,260
but they're all, they're donuts, I guess.

896
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,620
But they try to make it look-

897
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,700
So if someone was like looking at you

898
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:02,180
through the barrel of a sniper rifle,

899
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,980
they're citing you for assassination,

900
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,500
they might think for a moment like,

901
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,220
wait a minute, I think they're eating fruit.

902
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,060
I think we need to call off the hit.

903
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,420
They're turning it around.

904
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,260
I was supposed to kill someone

905
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,540
that was eating a donut,

906
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,060
but this couldn't be them.

907
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,820
Look how healthy they are.

908
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,140
Or alternatively, somebody's looking

909
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,100
for their blind date

910
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,540
and they told them,

911
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,500
I'll be the one eating a big strawberry

912
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,940
the size of my fucking face.

913
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,340
And then maybe a love connection happens.

914
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,780
Maybe it's, and my thing is good

915
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,060
instead of death like yours.

916
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,500
Oh, maybe.

917
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,860
So that's, right now they're doing strawberry.

918
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,740
Get there, just kicked off today.

919
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,140
I think I want to tell you about,

920
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,380
God, I have so many really great ones right now.

921
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,780
McDonald's is doing something new.

922
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,220
They're sunsetting the signature crafted line.

923
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,500
I know, I know, it's really hard.

924
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,180
They were so wet though.

925
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,180
Every one of those I ever ate

926
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,940
was so just sopping wet with too many ingredients.

927
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,260
I love the way it always gooshed out the back.

928
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,900
It gooshed out the back like a guacamole gusher.

929
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,260
I'm heartbroken over here.

930
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,580
So McDonald's is gonna bring

931
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,300
worldwide favorites to the menu.

932
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,060
McDonald's is where you're gonna go

933
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,420
for international cuisine.

934
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,020
It's the next best thing to travel

935
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,060
is just to go over to your local McDonald's.

936
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,060
Some of them have already been tested stateside.

937
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,340
One of the items is called the Grand McExtreme Bacon Burger.

938
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,820
I had one of these in Gay Perry I believe once.

939
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,580
The Grand McExtreme Bacon Burger is from Spain.

940
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,140
Oh, shit.

941
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,580
MC Extreme?

942
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,660
It's a fresh beef.

943
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,820
The McExtreme, like McElroy,

944
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,380
but without the Elroy and add extreme.

945
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,420
The Grand McExtreme Bacon Burger

946
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,260
is a fresh beef quarter pounder

947
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,020
topped with McBacon sauce.

948
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:04,740
Stop.

949
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,780
Bacon, okay.

950
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,220
Gouda cheese and slivered onions

951
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,820
and that was piloted in Florida.

952
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,380
The Spain of America's southeast.

953
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,860
The Stroopwafel McFlurry features vanilla soft serve

954
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,540
with caramel waffle cookies.

955
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,020
Now hold on.

956
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,700
I know I'll fuck with this.

957
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,140
No, I know you'll fuck with it.

958
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,860
I know you will.

959
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,180
But what about Canada?

960
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,100
The tomato mozzarella chicken sandwich

961
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,540
is a Canadian favorite that comes with tomato and herb sauce

962
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,580
and then there's cheesy bacon fries

963
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,660
that are I guess from Australia.

964
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,580
It's what it says here.

965
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,660
So I don't know why McDonald's,

966
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,460
the thing that was notable about this to me

967
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,940
is this idea that McDonald's would say,

968
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,940
oh, you want to know how they do it in other countries?

969
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,460
Well, we can handle that.

970
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,900
Here's what they have in other places.

971
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,220
But this is the way they're doing it elsewhere.

972
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,700
Do you think that there's the same kind of exchange

973
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,900
back the other way?

974
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,020
Where like if you're like in Australia or Spain or whatever

975
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,300
and you go to McDonald's, you're just like,

976
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,420
yeah, there's a hamburger.

977
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,500
This is, we have this exact,

978
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,780
or wait, is this where McDonald's pizza went?

979
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,420
Has McDonald's pizza been living in Italy this whole time?

980
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,300
That's where, yeah, it can't be in two,

981
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,340
every McDonald's has its own custom menu items, Travis.

982
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,300
I'm glad that we finally got around to the real facts

983
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,020
of the matter.

984
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:32,020
This would be more akin to if McDonald's Spain

985
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,740
had a paella that they served

986
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,500
and they'd be like, just like in America,

987
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,820
has it, does it there.

988
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:43,140
I do remember that when McDonald's served bratwurst

989
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,940
and they're like, this is from Germany or whatever.

990
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,540
It's a German hamburger.

991
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,140
It's just they put it in a tube shape.

992
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,420
You don't know, eat it.

993
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,420
You don't know anything, idiot.

994
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,380
You're never leaving.

995
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,180
The McRib is back from Norway, enjoy.

996
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,500
It's like McDonald's is basically betting on people

997
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,860
not leaving the country is the bet

998
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,140
that McDonald's is making here.

999
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,500
Trust us, this is Spain.

1000
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:05,700
This is how Spain does it.

1001
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,980
Making extreme bacon burgers.

1002
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,900
Can I read a Yahoo?

1003
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,420
Yeah, please.

1004
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,420
Here is one that was sent in by level9000.

1005
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,180
Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew Davenport, thank you, Drew.

1006
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,780
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

1007
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,660
who I'm gonna call.

1008
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,860
Kenneth asks, what would surnames be

1009
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,940
if they were invented today?

1010
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,060
If surnames weren't invented until today,

1011
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,100
what would they be?

1012
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,020
Like how many people are named after their job?

1013
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,660
Would they be like Johnny Vlogger, Susan Office, and so on?

1014
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,620
Yes, yes.

1015
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,580
Susan Office is not bad.

1016
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,780
My job is office.

1017
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,020
I'm Gregory Timpson.

1018
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:46,100
Do you think it's weird that all that son stuff is weird, right?

1019
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,380
Like John Son?

1020
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,420
Yeah, that's what our name is.

1021
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,140
Is it the last name?

1022
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,260
McElroy means son of, Elroy.

1023
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,620
But it's not literally just like Mackelson.

1024
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:00,260
What if we were all called, you know, Daddy Son?

1025
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,300
Because we're daddy's three great sons.

1026
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,620
Okay, well, I wouldn't mind that.

1027
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:11,780
I think Griffin Daddison is actually not bad.

1028
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:14,500
If surnames were invented today,

1029
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,940
I would request that they be,

1030
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,580
you choose an animal that you feel best represents you.

1031
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,340
And that is how you get your last name.

1032
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,460
Imagine if instead of your brother, Justin McElroy,

1033
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,540
which we can all agree is a pretty humdrum,

1034
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,780
what if I was Justin Tiger Shark?

1035
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,420
All right.

1036
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,140
Oh, wait, hold on.

1037
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,140
Justin, you are telling me, Mr. Tiger Shark, please.

1038
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,740
Mr. Tiger Shark, you are telling me

1039
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,900
that the animal that best represents you,

1040
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,540
the best sums up what it means to be Justin,

1041
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,500
is a tiger shark?

1042
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:46,900
Well, not right now.

1043
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:51,300
But if I knew that an animal surname was on the line,

1044
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,660
I might try to spice things up a little bit.

1045
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,060
Oh, I see.

1046
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,220
So it's more of an aspirational reference.

1047
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:55,940
Exactly.

1048
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:59,620
That's every day I want to live in a tiger shark fashion.

1049
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,540
I would probably be,

1050
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,620
currently I'd probably be Justin Sugar Glider.

1051
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,180
I don't know if they upgrade it as they go, but.

1052
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,620
This would bring me one step closer

1053
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,820
to my eternal dream of being named Griffin Hellbender,

1054
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,180
which should be radical.

1055
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,300
I think it would be really cool.

1056
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,020
I think it would help me get my autobiography

1057
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,140
on a few more library shelves.

1058
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,860
It would also get me closer to being called Chester Cheetah.

1059
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,060
Yep.

1060
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,060
Admittedly, I'd have to change my first name to.

1061
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,380
Striking Distance, yeah.

1062
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,420
But if I could get that second half, I'm halfway there.

1063
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:36,340
But then we also have a lot of sort of long doctor names now.

1064
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,300
Yeah.

1065
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,660
So it could be like,

1066
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,420
and I don't know any of them off the top of my head,

1067
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,180
but just imagine I did know like the name

1068
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,460
of what a boner doctor would be called.

1069
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,460
And so it'd be like Griffin Boner Doctor,

1070
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,100
but it would be the doctor's name of its profession.

1071
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,180
If we were going to invent surnames now,

1072
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,220
I think it would be like,

1073
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,300
so like my name is Travis, right?

1074
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,540
And say I had a son named Robert, right?

1075
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,700
Now that person's name is Robert Travis.

1076
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,860
And then they have a kid named like Edward,

1077
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:02,020
and that's going to be named Edward Robert Travis.

1078
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,620
And then they have a kid named like Michael,

1079
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,020
and it's going to be Michael Edward Robert Travis.

1080
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,820
And it just keeps getting added on forever.

1081
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,540
That's how it works.

1082
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:10,900
That's how it works.

1083
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,980
You gotta be careful with making it your profession though,

1084
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:15,860
because if it's something like, you know-

1085
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,740
Jeremy Cannibal?

1086
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,740
Jeremy Kittenkicker?

1087
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,220
If your name is like Jeremy Dudekiller,

1088
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,940
then people are gonna, people are, you'll be arrested.

1089
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,900
But then you can also be like,

1090
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,900
please, Mr. Dudekiller is my father.

1091
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,940
Your last name should be the number of followers

1092
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:30,820
you have on Twitter.

1093
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,500
That should be the way we do it.

1094
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,220
All right.

1095
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,140
So I know if I even want to fuck around.

1096
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,260
Or your last name could be like a Yelp review.

1097
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,460
So it is your profession, but also with a descriptive word.

1098
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,460
So it's like Jeremy Bad Doctor.

1099
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,260
And you're like, oh no, Stephen Good Sandwich.

1100
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:46,900
And you're like, okay, cool.

1101
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,580
And you can kind of get it updated.

1102
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,660
People can kind of leave a new last name for you.

1103
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,100
That's fun.

1104
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,940
And if you're a shock shock radio DJ,

1105
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,220
then your name can literally be Dr. Crankenstein.

1106
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:57,860
There you go.

1107
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,700
I think your name should be

1108
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,020
whatever you announce it is in the moment.

1109
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,780
So like, maybe I go to a conference

1110
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,460
and I have a very professional name, right?

1111
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,260
But then I'm going out to do karaoke later

1112
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,900
and I want to be like Jam Jamilton.

1113
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:11,220
Right?

1114
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,100
Okay, cool.

1115
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,020
My name's Jam Jamilton now.

1116
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:14,660
You know what I mean?

1117
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,860
And then I probably am going to need some kind of LED license

1118
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,580
that I can change to fit the name.

1119
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,700
But that's my idea.

1120
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,700
It's just you are whatever you announce.

1121
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,180
So maybe like when you go out to karaoke,

1122
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,460
you have different friends there

1123
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,460
and you want them to call you like Nick.

1124
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,380
So that would be sort of like your nickname.

1125
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:36,260
Oh, you have, right?

1126
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,180
Like I couldn't tell if that was supposed to be a joke

1127
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,420
or just like a good, a good.

1128
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,380
No, it wasn't a joke.

1129
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,700
I was just pointing out that you just reinvented me.

1130
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,700
Yeah, I mean, everybody's name

1131
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,220
should be whatever it's going to be.

1132
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:52,100
I'm talking about specifically just the moray of surnames.

1133
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,020
Now Johnson's gone.

1134
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,060
Johnson's gone.

1135
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,020
Miller's gone.

1136
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,460
All of these old ass professions and naming conventions.

1137
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,020
I really want to dive, dive down deep into

1138
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,100
if can they be aspirational?

1139
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,340
Can I be called that Griffin Blasthoff astronaut?

1140
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,220
Cause I want to be a Blasthoff astronaut.

1141
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,500
Yeah, that's a great name.

1142
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,300
Yeah.

1143
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,340
Is it hyphenated?

1144
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:16,340
Yeah, I mean, so would Griffin basketball superstar

1145
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,100
of the 1996 Chicago Bulls.

1146
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,380
How about Griffin astronaut superstar?

1147
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,300
Astronaut basketball superstar.

1148
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,860
Griffin slam dunk space blaster,

1149
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:29,700
Michael Jordan best friend, 96 Bulls game six winner

1150
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,700
and high point score MVP and that's the end of the name.

1151
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,820
How about Travis just wants to nap?

1152
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,060
That's not a job, Travis.

1153
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,700
Holy shit.

1154
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,660
Get with the program.

1155
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:41,780
No, that's aspirational.

1156
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:46,180
If I can get paid to nap, that's a job and a dream job, Griffin.

1157
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,860
I'd be happy with Justin great dad.

1158
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:48,820
Okay.

1159
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,900
Well, I mean, we'd all like that, wouldn't we?

1160
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,020
If you were a great dad.

1161
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,940
Yeah, but I've been, I'm unimpressive.

1162
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,380
What about Travis great butt?

1163
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,820
Ah, cool.

1164
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,620
Yeah, Travis has all been about how good he is.

1165
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,420
At his ass.

1166
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:05,060
Maybe yours should be the name of your favorite episode of Friends.

1167
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:06,740
Uh-huh.

1168
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:08,500
Travis, the one with the shirt.

1169
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,740
Your first name is your favorite episode of Friends.

1170
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:12,980
Uh-huh.

1171
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,700
Your last name is your favorite episode of French.

1172
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:22,260
You just put it together.

1173
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,540
The one, I like the one.

1174
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:29,700
Mine is the one with the neighbor that jerks off.

1175
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,580
Space monster.

1176
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,460
Mine is the one with the tookie head who kills everybody.

1177
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:41,780
Mine is the one where Joey gets his dick stuck in the bathtub drain.

1178
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,420
Clone enemy.

1179
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,820
My preferred name is the one where Chandler gets caught.

1180
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:54,580
Transilence thought unifier model 11, which is a little bit of a mouthful.

1181
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,020
You can just call me Danny.

1182
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,420
You can just call me Joey gets his dick stuck in the bathtub drain.

1183
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,340
Clone enemy.

1184
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:04,820
I do.

1185
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,100
Actually, I want the whole thing.

1186
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:06,500
Don't shorten my fucking name.

1187
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,780
Please call me by my full name.

1188
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:13,060
Joey jerked off into the bathtub drain clone enemy was my father.

1189
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:17,060
I'm the one where Joey gets his dick caught in the bathtub drain clone enemy.

1190
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,260
Here's another question.

1191
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,260
My wife and I are in our 20s.

1192
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:22,820
My wife.

1193
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,900
Can I have your fucking relations?

1194
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,900
Because she doesn't want to ever physically birth a child.

1195
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,860
I got snipped because it was like a hundred bucks.

1196
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,300
That's not a kid.

1197
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,540
I had a Groupon deal.

1198
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:38,980
Yeah, right?

1199
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,100
I was already in the neighborhood.

1200
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,060
This guy was just doing them in bulk.

1201
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,820
So I got me and 20 of my friends.

1202
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,700
He just went down the line.

1203
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,500
It was Friday the 13th.

1204
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,060
I got that and a cool 13 tattoo.

1205
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,340
My dad had to cancel.

1206
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,380
So I put on a fake beard like him and said, I'm my dad.

1207
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,580
I'll take his vasectomy if he doesn't want it.

1208
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,180
You've already cut the knives and everything.

1209
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,820
I stood around waiting for a last minute cancellation.

1210
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:08,660
Then it says, the problem is we haven't informed her parents.

1211
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:14,740
Obviously it's our life, but we aren't exactly holding this information secret

1212
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:18,900
and don't want them to find out this information from another source besides us.

1213
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,340
How do we tell them this gently?

1214
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:23,700
We might adopt one day, but also that's not a promise.

1215
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,460
So we don't want to lead with that to get their hopes up for grandchildren.

1216
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,700
That's from Snipped in the South.

1217
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,260
I, this is a really delicate and sensitive question.

1218
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,500
We should be very mindful of that while we talk about it.

1219
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,100
And I think when you are talking,

1220
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:44,900
when you are talking to her parents about this delicate thing,

1221
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,780
I think there will be a moment where they are disappointed.

1222
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:52,100
But then when they find out what an amazing deal you got on this vasectomy,

1223
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,940
I don't know how they could be upset anymore.

1224
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,220
Well, we get it.

1225
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,100
Did you say a hundred fucking dollars?

1226
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,260
Holy shit.

1227
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:10,660
I might go get a vasectomy again, just because the price is so good.

1228
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,380
We're sad that we won't have genetic grandkids,

1229
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:23,220
but we are thrilled that Debra married such a trained bargain hunter as yourself, Skyler.

1230
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,620
You know what that was, what, a coupon?

1231
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,420
Nice.

1232
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,380
Hold on.

1233
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:30,420
I want to call my office and tell them this is amazing.

1234
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,340
Is this deal still happening?

1235
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,180
Did you get like a card or anything?

1236
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,740
Like, do we need to refer somebody or?

1237
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:41,220
Dude, it's just, I mean, here's the thing.

1238
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:46,580
You know, it doesn't rule out them, you know, you've said here it rules them out being grandparents,

1239
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:55,780
but all you've said here in the question is that you're not looking like physically sort of do the whole gestation thing.

1240
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,780
So they could pick up some grandchildren, of course, like, obviously.

1241
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:06,260
But you don't want to promise them, and vasectomies, as I understand, are reversible if you do decide to make a choice.

1242
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,780
But that's $10,000.

1243
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,780
But that's, yeah, that's how they get you, huh?

1244
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,780
That's how they get you.

1245
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,780
The first taste is free.

1246
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:25,780
The vasectomy is not, okay, we're obviously talking completely out of court, but you've like asked us this question, so we're gonna do our best.

1247
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:29,780
The vasectomy is not the issue at hand.

1248
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:37,780
You don't need to look in your wife's dad's face and say, I got surgery on my wiener.

1249
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:47,780
Your wife needs to tell her parents that she doesn't feel like having kids, she thinks, probably forever, and that's how she feels, and that's fine.

1250
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:53,780
But like, I don't think the inciting event should be the surgery you have on your face.

1251
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:59,780
You don't say like, hey, I fucked up, went to Vegas, got super drunk, accidentally got a vasectomy.

1252
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,780
Exactly, right?

1253
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:05,780
It's like the cause, it's a symptom, not the cause.

1254
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:11,780
It's a decision, now tell her parents about the decision you made before they hear about your vasectomy on the nightly news or whatever.

1255
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:21,780
This would be like you going to your parents when you're 15 and being like, so just so you all know, I got the surgery to remove that bone in your arm that makes you go to college.

1256
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:25,780
So that won't be happening.

1257
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:29,780
Yeah, I already had the surgery, I'm sorry.

1258
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:37,780
Yeah, it sounds like a conversation that you all should probably have, but it doesn't have to be a conversation about your extremely personal surgery.

1259
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:43,780
In fact, I would almost kind of file that under like, nobody's business but your own.

1260
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,780
Maybe two minutes later.

1261
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:51,780
Like wait until someone else says the word vasectomy in a couple years.

1262
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:59,780
You don't even have to help that much, you can just be the one in the back of the room where they're like, are you sure Vicki? And you're like, I'm pretty sure, I think we're sure on this one.

1263
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:12,780
And then maybe five years later, her dad is like, yeah, so I went down and I found a great, really nice spot in the marina that was open and just got a killer deal on it.

1264
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,780
And he'd be like, you think that's a killer deal?

1265
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:25,780
And then you tell you, you're going to tell him about your cheap vasectomy that you got in the basement of a fucking Dick's Sporting Goods, which is funny in a lot of ways.

1266
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,780
It's very ironic.

1267
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,780
It's very, very good.

1268
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:42,780
I am a little frustrated with you, friend, because you did miss the window where you can tell people these things and they have to be more concerned about the fact that you're having surgery.

1269
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:48,780
You missed the one window where it's like, hey, people need your support.

1270
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:54,780
So it's like, hey, mom, hey, dad, can you bring over a bag of frozen peas for Robert's balls?

1271
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:57,780
I have something to talk to you about.

1272
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:07,780
He needs a bag of frozen peas and a videotape rental with a great film on it.

1273
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:12,780
Oh, best of luck. That is a tender situation.

1274
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,780
But all the best to you and yours.

1275
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,780
Thank you, folks, so much for listening to our podcast.

1276
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:21,780
I bet it's a tender situation.

1277
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,780
Trust me, it is a tender situation.

1278
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,780
Yeah, no, it wasn't a joke observation.

1279
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:30,780
No, it is. I mean, it is. I'm coming from a real place here.

1280
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:35,780
A lot of inflamed tissue, I bet, that hurts quite a bit.

1281
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,780
Yeah, in the genital area.

1282
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,780
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1283
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:42,780
Yowza. I hate to see that, folks.

1284
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,780
So here's the thing, fucking nobody's coming to our Cleveland show.

1285
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,780
We really need you to come buy tickets, okay?

1286
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,780
And try to get friends to buy tickets and trick them.

1287
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,780
We've heard good things about the Cleve. We're excited to be there.

1288
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:00,780
All the other places are doing like really good to pretty good.

1289
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,780
So many, half of their shows are sold out.

1290
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,780
Only it's the half that we're not doing for a while,

1291
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,780
and we're doing this one in a week.

1292
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,780
We're starting to freak out a little bit, please.

1293
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,780
We've been hitting up Dietrich Bader.

1294
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,780
We've been hitting up fucking Ryan Stiles.

1295
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,780
We've been hitting up Christa Miller, like get out to this show.

1296
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,780
And then I find out they don't actually live there,

1297
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,780
and I've been lied to my whole fucking life by the Drew Carey Show?

1298
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,780
Sucks.

1299
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:27,780
And listen, hey, if you need added reason,

1300
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,780
Paul and Storm are going to be there playing.

1301
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,780
It's going to be incredibly fun.

1302
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:35,780
We've never had them open a show for us, and we're super excited about it.

1303
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:38,780
And they're going to do really good music that you're going to like,

1304
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,780
and all your friends are going to like,

1305
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,780
so you should bring them with you to the show.

1306
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,780
Travis, stop fucking selling.

1307
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,780
They can smell this bullshit a mile away.

1308
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:50,780
Guys, all that stuff Travis said was true, but mainly like,

1309
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:53,780
please, we can't all be ruined.

1310
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,780
Please just buy tickets.

1311
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,780
Between this and bean juice, we've got a lot of them lined up.

1312
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,780
It's in a row.

1313
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,780
The mugs are fucking good, and they make the coffee taste better.

1314
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,780
In completely unrelated news,

1315
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,780
if you head over to mcrorymerch.com right now,

1316
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,780
and just suck up on bean juice mugs,

1317
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,780
you'd love to sell a few of those.

1318
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:14,780
Yeah, these things are worth their weight in ceramic.

1319
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:18,780
Which you'll need to craft new stuff in your city.

1320
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,780
Sure, bone spears and stuff.

1321
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,780
They make a great bone spear.

1322
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:26,780
We also have a new I Hate You Ron pin of the month

1323
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,780
that's only going to be available in May.

1324
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:32,780
There's a new Sawbones shirt about vaccines.

1325
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,780
There's some Schmaner's thank you notes over there,

1326
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,780
and a Schmaner's tote bag.

1327
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:38,780
Some really cool stuff.

1328
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,780
There's Rachel's poetry corner from Wonderful

1329
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,780
that I am just a big fan of.

1330
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,780
The pin.

1331
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,780
Yes, the pin.

1332
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:45,780
Thank you.

1333
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:46,780
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1334
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:47,780
for these for a theme song.

1335
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:50,780
It's a departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1336
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:55,780
Just a really swanky, snazzy album

1337
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,780
with a lot of fresh tracks on it, kid.

1338
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:58,780
You're going to love them.

1339
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:00,780
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network

1340
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:01,780
at MaximumFun.org.

1341
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,780
You can find all of your earthly pleasures and delights.

1342
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:07,780
It would probably help if we said that you can get those tickets

1343
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,780
at McElroy.family and click on tours.

1344
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1345
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,780
Or bit.ly forward slash Become the Monster.

1346
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:14,780
Yeah.

1347
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:17,780
It's the first show of this Become the Monster tour.

1348
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,780
It's the first one.

1349
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,780
Please, that'd be so demoralizing.

1350
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,780
I was trying to come up with good ideas.

1351
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:25,780
Wolfman will buy tickets.

1352
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:28,780
We'll do some tricks.

1353
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,780
Justin will juggle.

1354
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:31,780
I don't know, whatever you want.

1355
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,780
I was thinking maybe we talk about Star Wars

1356
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:34,780
for an hour and a half.

1357
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:35,780
Oh, no.

1358
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,780
Yeah.

1359
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,780
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1360
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:39,780
So here's the final Yahoo.

1361
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,780
It's from another anonymous Yahoo answer user.

1362
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,780
I'm going to call Diedrick Bader, who asks,

1363
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:47,780
do you eat celery in the military?

1364
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:51,780
My name is Justin McElroy.

1365
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:52,780
I'm Travis McElroy.

1366
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:53,780
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1367
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:55,780
This has been my brother, my brother.

1368
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:57,780
May it kiss your dad square on the lips.

1369
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,780
Maximumfun.org.

1370
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,780
Comedy and culture.

1371
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,780

Listener-supported.

1373
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:22,780
What are you laughing at, James?

1374
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:23,780
I'm not kidding.

1375
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:25,780
I'm laughing at you.

1376
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,780
What?

1377
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:27,780
And me, too.

1378
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:28,780
Huh?

1379
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:31,780
Our podcast, Minority Corner Silly.

1380
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:34,780
Oh, the one where we talk about topics that cover

1381
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,780
the queer community, race, feminism,

1382
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:38,780
and good old pop culture?

1383
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:39,780
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1384
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:40,780
Yeah, that's it.

1385
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:43,780
Girl, we are so funny.

1386
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:45,780
I was just thinking about something we did.

1387
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,780
Wait, wait, wait.

1388
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:51,780
Are you listening to me or me?

1389
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,780
Both.

1390
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:55,780
Minority Corner.

1391
01:00:55,780 --> 01:01:22,780
Every Friday.
