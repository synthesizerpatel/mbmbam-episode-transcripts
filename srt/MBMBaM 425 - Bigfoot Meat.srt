1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,600
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,400
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother,

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,160
Travis Patrick McElroy. And I'm your sweet baby brother, and 30-30-30, I'm Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:05,040
A lot of busy lives. It's been a busy couple of weeks in the interim of when we've spoken to you

9
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,480
directly. An exciting time ahead of a sect of me. And I want to say, then came up here to Cincinnati

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,720
to the Great Wolf Lodge, including the water park, and I watched that fool in a wave pool,

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,960
and I don't know that I've ever seen a more unhappy human being.

12
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:30,080
Oh, okay. I was, there was a displeasure. I experienced a displeasure.

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,680
Is it maybe because you chose a pool to swim in that kind of goes for your zone?

14
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,400
And more than a regular pool won't sort of come at your zone like a wave pool will.

15
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,840
I didn't choose it, my daughter did, and I wanted to be a great dad.

16
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,280
And I don't know how much you, I do want to talk about one vasectomy-related thing,

17
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,440
but we've got an exciting new feature here on the show where we're going to let you,

18
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:03,040
the listener, vote live as we record on sort of like what you want to talk about.

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,400
So my vasectomy is one of the options. Trav, what do you got?

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:15,920
Well, I went to London for several days, and I came back with this new accent that I just

21
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,440
can't shake. Oh, I want to hear it so bad.

22
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,560
Two things about that is that the what, let me take, if I could, excuse me,

23
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,200
if I could do two things. One, we've done that exact thing before.

24
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,520
And two, you've already talked without the accent.

25
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,560
So I feel like even the cafe of the bits.

26
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,440
It comes and goes.

27
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,480
Also, I did realize, other thing we could talk about.

28
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,560
No, no, no, no, no. We all get one. Quit trying to fucking stuff the ballot box.

29
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,920
Speaking of Cafe B, I went to wrestling last night.

30
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,080
I went to Heck in a Sec down in San Antonio, and it was pretty good.

31
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,840
It ended with a big title match between just famed big man, Braun Strowman,

32
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,680
and other big man Roman Reigns. And the fight was going very bad.

33
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,200
And then the third big man, Brock Lesnar, came in and broke the sec,

34
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,880
kicked the sec door right in, and hurt them both. And that was the end of it.

35
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,560
So I was thinking I could do a funny bit about how if this episode doesn't start,

36
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,760
it just starts sort of flagging, then I could have Brock Lesnar come in

37
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,760
and beat all our asses, and then they would just stop the show.

38
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:37,520
Now I have a suggestion. This is a little radical, but maybe I could do my accent

39
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,600
while we talk about how bad it would be if Brock Lesnar attacked Justin's nuts right now.

40
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, we need to vote on though,

41
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,280
maybe it seems a little shock jock radio to refer to the…

42
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,240
Would it be better if we said testicles?

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,600
No, Strap, because I knew that you were going to say something that would also be bad

44
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,800
that you would enjoy. That would be like a fun sort of,

45
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,840
like a way that an old prospector would refer to the…

46
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,320
Oh, my testicles! That's my new London accent, by the way.

47
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,400
I hope you all enjoyed it.

48
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,560
That's good. It also kind of sounds like how Goofy would say the word,

49
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,640
which I actually am very, very into.

50
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,960
Gorsh! Gorsh, mate! My testicles!

51
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,840
My testicles!

52
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,120
None of this is usable.

53
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,240
All the votes are in, and I'm just going to talk about my vicinity real quick.

54
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,240
I understand some people are uncomfortable with surgery talk,

55
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,360
so if you want to skip ahead 23 to 27 minutes…

56
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,800
No, please don't get clinical about it. Just tell us what happened in the wave pool.

57
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,520
So they told me that for $80, I could have gas

58
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,240
that would make me all silly for the whole time if I gave $80.

59
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,160
So I do want to start off by saying thank you so much, Max Fund donors.

60
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,640
You should know that I did spend a little bit of your money

61
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,040
getting high for my testicle surgery.

62
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,400
Hold on. That's a weird upsell moment of like,

63
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,560
hey, you've come in here for a vasectomy and you're going to be here

64
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,720
and very present for every second of it,

65
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,960
unless you want to give us 75, no, $80.

66
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,320
$80 and then we'll take you to Sillytown.

67
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,720
You want us to Scotchguard those bad boys?

68
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,040
Give you the undercoating?

69
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,840
You want it bigger?

70
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,880
Okay, so I went in, I had the gas.

71
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,120
I had the gas once before when I had wisdom teeth surgery,

72
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,520
and my memory of it was count backwards from one to 10.

73
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,200
10, nine, oh my God, it's done.

74
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,880
And I wake up at right, and it's like I had gone completely out.

75
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,880
And I thought that's what I was in for, for the surgery.

76
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,800
So they give me the tube with the gas in it and tell me to hold it.

77
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,200
And they said, are you a nose breather?

78
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,320
Which is a wild, like I can.

79
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,680
I do both, yeah.

80
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,440
I do both, like all humans.

81
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,120
She said, well, the times when you wake up

82
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,200
are when you let go of the tube

83
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,680
or when you breathe through your nose.

84
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,440
So don't do either of those.

85
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,040
Cool, right?

86
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,320
So I'm doing this and I realized like after a while,

87
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,600
I'm really huffing on this good stuff.

88
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,320
And I realized like I'm not blacking out.

89
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,960
So in my head, what I thought was it's not working.

90
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,760
Oh my God, I'm going to be awake for my testicle surgery.

91
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,080
Oh, please don't let this be the case.

92
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,040
But I guess this kind of anesthesia is patient led

93
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,880
where they don't want you to go too deep.

94
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,600
They want you to be in sort of like a twilight state.

95
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,520
Interesting.

96
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,040
Yes, so I basically spent the entire time high.

97
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,400
And when you're high like this,

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,600
what you want is a nice drug sherpa who's not high

99
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,320
but is going to make a pleasurable drug experience for you.

100
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,160
I was in the literal opposite of a good place

101
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,320
to have a drug experience.

102
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,840
Here are two things that I heard

103
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,800
while I was in this weird twilight state.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,200
The first one was this.

105
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,680
I don't know how the vas deferens ends up like this,

106
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,360
but some are just gnarled and impossible to cut through.

107
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,240
Whoa, like tree bark this guy's deferences.

108
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,600
Hey, hold on.

109
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,120
I don't know how some of them-

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,720
Is that a real thing that was said or just something that you-

111
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,040
That was a real thing that was said.

112
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,880
Okay, that was a real thing that was said.

113
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,840
The second real thing that was said was I started giggling

114
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,280
because I was on laughing gas.

115
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,480
So it struck me as funny that I was awake

116
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,280
while somebody was like,

117
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,600
I would realize like how bad it was for me, right?

118
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,920
So I got kind of tickled that I was awake

119
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,320
for my testicle surgery and I was just like high on this stuff

120
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,920
and it was very funny to me in the moment.

121
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,600
So I started giggling a little bit

122
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,920
and I heard one of the nurses ask the doctor,

123
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,960
have you ever had anyone laughed during a vasectomy?

124
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,160
And he said, no.

125
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,880
Oh, no.

126
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,320
Good.

127
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,600
So just to be clear, this incredibly routine surgery,

128
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
we're in uncharted waters, huh?

129
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,440
What was your iron deference and your jovial constitution?

130
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,440
Holy shit, Juicer.

131
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,160
I was still extremely high.

132
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,440
I cannot, I mean,

133
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,160
cause the whole time I thought I should black out.

134
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,200
So I was huffing this good, good stuff even harder

135
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,560
and just huffing and huffing trying to black out

136
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,800
because I didn't want to be so present

137
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,640
for my penis surgery as I was.

138
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,960
And I real huffed it.

139
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,480
So when I got done with the surgery,

140
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,240
I was still extremely high.

141
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,640
And the first thing that my doctor says to me is,

142
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,280
now remember, you're still fertile.

143
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,480
What?

144
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,000
And I was like, then what the fuck are we doing here?

145
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,680
How could you say that to me, a high person?

146
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,560
And he said, well, and he didn't clarify.

147
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,240
Of course, what he means is like,

148
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,560
it takes a while before everything's like

149
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,960
all the little spermies are dead or whatever.

150
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,840
And then clear the pipes.

151
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,320
Is that what he said, is it spermies?

152
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,080
And then he said, your vas deferens is very knotted

153
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,520
and hard to cut through.

154
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,960
And I was like, I'm high.

155
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,480
I don't know how to process what you're telling me.

156
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,880
So he said, there's a lot of torsion down there.

157
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,040
And what I said to him in the moment was,

158
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,440
my wife and I don't do weird stuff,

159
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,520
but that's fine for people that do.

160
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,800
And he looked at me like I was a moon man.

161
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,960
Like an astronaut moon man.

162
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,560
I can't imagine why.

163
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,200
I love that you were still sex positive in your-

164
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,400
Oh yeah, for sure.

165
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,320
I didn't want, I mean, I have firm beliefs

166
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,320
that I need everybody to get down with.

167
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,880
The, after, then after that,

168
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,200
they sent me home with 30 per cassette.

169
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,840
So I don't know why we have such a problem.

170
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,520
That's the end of this segment.

171
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,480
I'm recovering well.

172
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,080
I'm in a decent amount of pain.

173
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,400
I'm still wearing a jockstrap, which I may never stop

174
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
because it is really nice.

175
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,520
I'm always ready for sports too, which is great for me.

176
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,000
Well, we got a racquetball at noon.

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,480
So let's get rolling on the advice.

178
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,240
Here's our first question this week on the show.

179
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,880
My waitress reached her hand out to take my plate,

180
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,040
but I thought she was trying to shake hands.

181
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,920
So I shook her hand instead of giving her my plate.

182
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,560
Should I dine and dash now before she brings the check

183
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,680
and have to face her again?

184
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,840
That's from I Fucked Up in Texas.

185
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,880
Why did you think contextually in that moment

186
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,160
that your server needed to congratulate or meet you?

187
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,720
Was your plate so clean?

188
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,400
It's so I've never seen one this clean before.

189
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,360
It started off as a black plate and now it's a white plate.

190
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,400
How did you do that?

191
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,920
You dang licked the decorations right off this fancy plate.

192
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,840
Oh man, I don't think that dining and dashing

193
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,760
means you have done two terrible things

194
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,640
to this other sentient living human being today.

195
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,840
And I think you gotta try and with your second act

196
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,720
try and counter the very bad first thing you did.

197
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,440
I think paying double for the meal or tipping 500%

198
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,920
or something, because if you dine and dash

199
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,040
it's just gonna ruin their day even more than it already,

200
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,280
it has just already ruined quite badly.

201
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,080
And I wanna drive that home, you did fuck up pretty bad.

202
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,520
Because here's the thing that I have to point out.

203
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,160
Someone reaching for a plate versus reaching for a handshake,

204
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,360
they are not instantly going to transition their mind to,

205
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,600
oh, it's a handshake now.

206
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,360
So there had to be at least a second of like,

207
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,160
as if you were trying to dock a space shuttle

208
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,480
like with the space station and it turned at the last second.

209
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,840
You're like, well, here we are.

210
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,440
Like there had to be a moment of like, what is this?

211
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
That's what you've gotta unpack.

212
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,320
Before you do anything else, you need to look in that mirror

213
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,360
and you need to take stock of your own shit.

214
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,920
Because I am guaranteeing there is no way

215
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,400
the trajectory of the plate reach is the same

216
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,240
as the trajectory for that a handshake attempt would have been.

217
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,040
They were reaching downward towards a table

218
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,840
to pick up a plate or a tray or whatever the fuck.

219
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,520
That is not the same as a hand coming at you like eye level

220
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,680
straight towards you as if to say handshake.

221
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,040
You saw this hand reaching for a plate

222
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,240
and you wanted it to be a handshake very, very badly.

223
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,960
I'm trying so hard to picture it.

224
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,440
Like I need like a whiteboard.

225
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,080
I need some dry erase markers.

226
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,080
I have to diagram it.

227
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,320
It's funny, you know, I think when tipping was created,

228
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,720
it was obviously to reward good service.

229
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,120
I wish, I have found myself wishing multiple times recently

230
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,200
that I could tip at the beginning just so they knew

231
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,360
that like if you say I'm gonna tip generously,

232
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,600
you should know that upfront, then maybe they would see you

233
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,360
as some sort of like good-hearted, bumble brain eccentric.

234
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,840
And like all these things would just kind of go away

235
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,160
because they know at the end that they would be getting

236
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,680
a good tip, but you can't actually say like I'm going

237
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,440
to be tipping well at the end.

238
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,360
No one does that, you can't do that.

239
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,240
So you have to tip at the beginning.

240
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,080
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

241
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,840
Assholes do that, I bet.

242
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah, but I wouldn't be doing it for like asshole reasons.

243
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I would be trying to buy myself just like,

244
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,240
I know I'm gonna fuck up some things here.

245
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,320
Listen, I know I'm gonna make, I had, okay,

246
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,520
I'll give you a good example.

247
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,840
We were in a Great Wolf Lodge this past weekend

248
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,880
and we had friends there and we had like eight people

249
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,320
and then four of her other friends decided

250
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,920
they wanted to join us for dinner.

251
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,880
And I was like, we're gonna have to drag another table over.

252
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,880
How could that possible?

253
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,200
This place was empty other than us.

254
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,000
And in my head, I could not see a way to get four more seats

255
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,840
that adjoined to our seats.

256
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,720
And I was so terrified to ask, somebody else had to ask.

257
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
And I tried to will the server to know like,

258
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,840
I'll give you a good tip, please don't be mad at me.

259
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,160
Please, I know that this isn't good.

260
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,360
I'm sorry, I'm doing my best here in a bad situation.

261
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,600
I just wish that I could communicate to people

262
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,120
that I'm not an asshole.

263
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,800
I really am not a monster, I promise.

264
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,680
That's why I think, here's my new plan.

265
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,520
This is what I suggest to everyone, tip very well, one,

266
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,960
but also do so in like all 50 cent pieces.

267
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,840
So then they're like, oh, not only did they tip very well,

268
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,760
they're clearly an eccentric, bumble brained kind of person.

269
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,160
And it's like, oh, so this is both a good tip and fun

270
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,760
and lets me know like, okay, that's why they shook my hand

271
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,920
when they were reaching because like,

272
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,240
they're the type of person who tips in 50 cent pieces.

273
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,160
So if it's a big, but if it's a big table,

274
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,320
you're kind of envisioning them carrying home

275
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,000
15 pounds worth of coinage as sort of a reward

276
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,360
for a job well done.

277
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,760
Yes, now that is true because like, say it's like,

278
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,480
oh, I don't know, a large party, it's like $500 meal

279
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,400
and you tip, let's say 30%, right?

280
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:41,120
You have just tipped $150 in 50 cent pieces.

281
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,520
So yes, you have just also granted them probably

282
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,200
at least some muscle soreness,

283
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,240
if not like a dislocated shoulder.

284
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,280
Another good option is when they reach back their hand

285
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,520
from the just really inexplicable strange handshake

286
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,240
you've given them.

287
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,040
They look down in it and there's a single egg in their hand

288
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,200
and then they look back up at you and you say,

289
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,160
nanu nanu because you're a space person.

290
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,520
And it's the only, and they'll say, oh, you shook my hand

291
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,600
because you're a space person.

292
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
And now I understand because of the egg

293
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,120
and that it's a whole mork thing and I love it.

294
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,160
No tip required.

295
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,320
I love your mork thing.

296
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,040
How about a Yahoo?

297
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,160
Shazbot.

298
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,480
Shazbot indeed.

299
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,000
This one was sent in by Emma Roden.

300
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,640
Thank you, Emma.

301
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,880
It's Yahoo Answers user Cassie who asks,

302
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,400
stepdad playing with black magic.

303
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,280
Oh no, that's rough.

304
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,880
Yesterday my stepdad was in the bathroom

305
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,000
and the lights were turned off

306
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,720
and only a couple lit candles.

307
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,280
There was weird spiritual music going off

308
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,600
and he was whispering something over and over again.

309
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,960
I don't know if he was doing black magic

310
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,480
or just relaxing by back, by back.

311
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,320
I'm kind of freaked that he believes

312
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,080
and diabolical shit, I guess, four asterisks.

313
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,120
What do I do?

314
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,840
Wait, hold on.

315
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,480
So within the question, the question poser says,

316
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,000
it's either black magic or he was just relaxing.

317
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,920
Or it was Terry's special time

318
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,160
and he had an audio book going

319
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,680
and he had the scented candles going.

320
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,600
He was either listening to a nice audio book

321
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,320
or speaking with Baphomet.

322
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,280
So what do I do?

323
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,160
It's one of the two.

324
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,440
It was either listening to the new Dan Brown novel

325
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,880
on audio cassette or it was Baphomet.

326
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,920
It might be both.

327
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,200
True, multitasking is huge.

328
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,480
It's 2018.

329
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,080
Yeah, and you know, in Dan Brown,

330
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,280
there is a whole book called Angels and Demons.

331
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,840
In the Outfield.

332
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,440
In the Outfield.

333
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,960
Oh, that's a good one.

334
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,000
Why haven't we seen a Demons in the Outfield movie?

335
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,760
Demons in the Outfield waging war for our souls.

336
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,400
Oh, yes, a remake of Angels in the Outfield

337
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,480
that's about like a literal holy war

338
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,240
between angels and demons and the demons support,

339
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,560
I don't know, the Baltimore Orioles.

340
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,400
It's just the first theme that came to mind.

341
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,600
And they're probably led by Lil' Nicky.

342
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,320
Wouldn't you think?

343
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,400
Lil' Nicky's probably the leader.

344
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,320
Oh, it's time.

345
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,360
It's time to bring out Lil' Nicky.

346
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,840
Holly Weird, get Abby for Lil' Nicky too.

347
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,680
Angels and the Demons in the Outfield.

348
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,920
Demons in the Dugout.

349
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,440
Demons in the Dugout, Travis,

350
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,520
with the slam dunk pitch, green lit.

351
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,080
What do you do, though?

352
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,080
What do you do when your stepdad talks to Baphomet

353
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,360
in the bathroom?

354
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,120
Oh, you know what I would do?

355
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,920
Tattle to mommy?

356
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,400
Well, yes, but I would also,

357
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,320
like before stepdad went in there,

358
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
I would get like a dry erase marker

359
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,000
and like draw like a smiley face on the mirror.

360
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,240
And so that way, when he tries to like look in the mirror

361
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,400
to talk to the devil, he sees that smiley face

362
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,080
and he's like, oh, you know what?

363
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,960
Maybe not today.

364
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,800
Maybe it's just a day.

365
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,000
Maybe it's a day I'm just gonna go outside and smile.

366
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,880
So it's just a situation where he was going to commune

367
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,040
with some sort of elder God or whatever.

368
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,920
But then he saw a picture of a smiley face

369
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,080
like you might've seen on a t-shirt in the 70s.

370
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,160
And he said, nevermind.

371
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,640
Well, my only other suggestion

372
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,840
was to make a real stinky poop in there before him

373
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
so then the devil won't show up.

374
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,720
Yeah, or he does.

375
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,520
And he's like, oh, Terry, you've completed the right.

376
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,320
Oh, Terry.

377
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,360
Oh, Terry.

378
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,240
Oh, Terry.

379
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,520
Oh, Terry, no.

380
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,800
He's just, has he ever done anything good?

381
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,880
It's just like always just,

382
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,000
whenever you hear about him,

383
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,400
it's always bad stuff most of the time.

384
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,720
I don't know, Griffin.

385
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm off two minds, you know?

386
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,360
Oh, no.

387
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,200
Because the devil, he seems bad.

388
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,040
And don't get me wrong, he is.

389
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,080
But without the devil,

390
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,840
would we really appreciate the angels?

391
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,440
Because if everybody was good and angelic, Griffin.

392
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,200
Yes, yes, thank you, yes.

393
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,360
Then maybe nobody is.

394
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,120
There's a user named Leviticus on here,

395
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,160
which is already great.

396
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,960
Who says, if your stepdad wants to play silly games

397
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,640
in the bathroom, then leave him to it.

398
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,840
Which really should be the motto for 2019, I think, maybe.

399
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,600
Like 2018 was Collaborate Teen,

400
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,280
and I don't know that we've been especially good stewards

401
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,520
of that, but I do think that 2019,

402
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,840
if your stepdad wants to play silly games in the bathroom,

403
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,960
then leave him to it is something

404
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,600
we could actually honor pretty easily.

405
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,560
Just let your stepdad do whatever he wants in the bathroom.

406
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,720
Just the silly games, it's fine by me, Griffin McElroy.

407
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,840
Here's what's hard for me.

408
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,880
I'm trying to walk the right path.

409
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,280
Sure.

410
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,200
Trying to be good to my fellow man,

411
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,160
trying to tithe 10%, trying to worship,

412
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,400
trying to keep the Sabbath holy, all of it.

413
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,120
Yeah.

414
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,040
And then I feel this little creeping presence

415
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,360
sneak up from behind and say,

416
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,800
Justin, I'm sure you shouldn't go down

417
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,120
to the betting parlor or what have you.

418
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,840
Put some bets on the ponies,

419
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,840
steal your brother's big screen TV.

420
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,640
Steal that big basketball from the dick sporting goods

421
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,680
you've always wanted.

422
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,400
Yeah.

423
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,520
You know, you could never afford the big basketball

424
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
that they say is just a picture of a basketball

425
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,960
they hung up at the basketball section,

426
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,600
but you know it's a real fully formed basketball

427
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,480
that would be so fun to play with.

428
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
And the devil is the one who's always telling me

429
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,520
to do these bad things.

430
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,280
And I just want to try to live a righteous life.

431
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,280
How about another question?

432
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,080
Yep.

433
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,520
I like to take my family fishing,

434
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,440
but we haven't been fishing for very long,

435
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,960
so we're not very good at it yet.

436
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,120
When we go fishing, we feel like people are watching us.

437
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,880
They're watching us be bad at fishing.

438
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,240
We want to keep fishing,

439
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,320
but we don't want to endure the withering gaze

440
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,400
of more seasoned fishermen.

441
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,680
How do we go fishing without other people looking at us?

442
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,640
That's from Self Conscious 6 in Salt Lake.

443
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,800
PS, we haven't caught a single fish yet.

444
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,040
I think it is,

445
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,680
I think the hardest pill to swallow

446
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,920
in this sort of situation that you've ginned up

447
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,600
is that there are people for whom watching people

448
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,560
not catch fish is a very good thing to watch.

449
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,880
Like one of the things, like we have phones and stuff.

450
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,080
Like definitely, probably they're not going to watch

451
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,240
some people not catch fish, I think.

452
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,720
Sure.

453
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,480
There are TV shows I could watch

454
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,200
where very good fish catchers catch fish like nonstop.

455
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,480
And I'm talking about big fat fish of all shapes and sizes.

456
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,800
And I don't even want to watch that, you know?

457
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,520
Well, and there are whole TV shows you could watch

458
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,040
where people aren't catching fish.

459
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,840
Like there are whole episodes of Law & Order SVU

460
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,760
where no one catches a fish.

461
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,160
Yeah, there's so many shows where no fish are caught.

462
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,520
I love Tara's House, but there's only been like one

463
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,120
or two episodes where they catch fish.

464
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,920
I feel like I wouldn't, I mean, I feel you

465
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,440
because I would not know where to start with this.

466
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,160
I definitely could buy a rod

467
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,400
and I think I could find a place around here that sells worms.

468
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,440
That's as far, yeah, that's as far as I could get.

469
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,680
Do I go early in the day?

470
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,560
Do I go late?

471
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,960
I understand this sort of anxiety this person's experiencing

472
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,280
because I feel like it's such a narrow window

473
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,440
in which you could catch a fish anyway

474
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,640
that there's a real good chance

475
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,840
someone would see you fishing out there

476
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,960
and just know that like,

477
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,680
it's definitely not going to work for you.

478
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,280
Maybe this is like an expectation thing

479
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,480
where like when you get to the lake,

480
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,720
I assume, question mark,

481
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,480
you like loudly announce like,

482
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,240
I hope I don't catch any fish today.

483
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,400
Loudly, loudly I know won't work.

484
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,040
I do know, okay, here, let me chime back in.

485
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,880
Loudly won't work for fishing.

486
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,400
I know that because they hate that.

487
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,240
They hate the sound.

488
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,600
They hate our human noises.

489
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,200
They love their own fish noises

490
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,240
because I watched Fish Tales

491
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,800
and they were always singing and dancing around in that flick,

492
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,640
but they hate our human sounds.

493
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,640
And maybe like a sign like hanging on your boat.

494
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,720
It's like not trying to catch fish.

495
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,080
Like, I know how this looks.

496
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,240
It looks like I'm just trying to soak these worms.

497
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,520
I feel pretty confident.

498
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,040
You're just soaking the worms.

499
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,960
Let's get these wormies wet.

500
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,920
I'm just trying to rehydrate my worm friends.

501
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,680
I feel pretty confident of one thing

502
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,520
because I've eaten fish.

503
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,800
If I were to somehow luck into catching a fish, right?

504
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,440
So I get the fish on the hook.

505
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,640
I zoom him up into my boat and I have him there.

506
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,480
I do feel pretty confident that the look you lose

507
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,560
would then be treated to me bewildered watching a fish die.

508
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
I think that is the next thing that would happen

509
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,600
is I would watch a flapping fish

510
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,880
look around in panic, hoping against hope

511
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,440
that an adult would rise from the sea

512
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,080
to deal with the situation for me.

513
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,200
The best I could come up with,

514
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,480
I'm thinking in the moment,

515
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,600
I think I would probably drop it back into the water

516
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,440
until I came up with a plan.

517
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,200
I think this is the best that I would be able

518
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,400
to chin up in the moment.

519
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,680
Okay, hang out here.

520
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,640
I'll be right back.

521
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,160
I just like de-fish him.

522
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,280
I think would be the best that I could probably do

523
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,640
is like return him to the ocean

524
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,520
and hopefully he found a way to like free himself.

525
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,040
That's the best I could come up with.

526
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,960
And that's monstrous what I've just said.

527
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,080
I would most likely throw the rod in after the fish.

528
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,880
This is yours now.

529
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,400
Yeah, I tell you my great fear is that it would be,

530
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
I would go out on the boat and I would start fishing

531
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,560
and I would fall in the water

532
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,400
and become an incredible Mr. Limpet

533
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,520
because the fear for me there

534
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,840
is not obviously like the trials and tribulations

535
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,960
that he went through as a sea creature in that movie

536
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,360
is that I am happily married

537
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,600
and the father of a beautiful son.

538
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,680
And in that movie, the Mr. Limpet

539
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,920
also has a similar like life situation

540
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,200
where he falls in the water, becomes a fish

541
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,000
and instantly falls in love with a lady fish

542
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,400
who I think he calls Lady Fish.

543
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,840
And I don't know, I guess I'm scared

544
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,920
of sort of like the infidelity

545
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,560
that I think I guess goes along with being a fish guy.

546
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,240
So I never ever get out there on the water

547
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,520
because I don't want to be tempted.

548
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,200
I don't want to be unfaithful, I guess,

549
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,840
like Mr. Limpet was, do you know what I mean?

550
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,800
Because here's the thing,

551
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,280
there are plenty of fish in the sea and that's scary.

552
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,040
And that scares me, that scares me, that scares me.

553
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,680
Because I would never, I'm not tempted in my human form.

554
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,320
You give me a fish brain and it's all instinct.

555
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,080
I don't know, I don't know.

556
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,880
Sure.

557
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,240
It's instant, he falls in the water.

558
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,120
He's like, oh no.

559
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,560
And I guess he sings a song or something

560
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,440
and then there's a lady fish.

561
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,040
He's like, hello.

562
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,880
And it's like, there's a lot of ethical questions

563
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,560
about that, Mr. Limpet.

564
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,600
Hey, just quick question

565
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,240
because I think this marks the 100th time

566
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,400
we've referenced Mr. Limpet.

567
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,880
When was the last time any of us watched it?

568
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,480
Oh, never is my answer.

569
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,680
Okay, because it's a solid at least two decades for me.

570
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,680
I've been waiting because Jim Carrey

571
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,440
was supposed to remake it.

572
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,120
And I just keep hoping that that's gonna

573
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,800
come together eventually.

574
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,200
So I guess he joins the Navy in his fish form

575
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,280
and fights Nazi U-boats.

576
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,440
Yeah, I remember him said it.

577
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,400
I think he sets off like ocean sea mines.

578
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
I think is a thing that he does.

579
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,120
All right, yeah, he forms like a fish Navy.

580
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,440
It's like the glorious, Finn glorious bastards.

581
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,000
Oh no, I guess two Navy officers reach out

582
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,920
to Mr. Limpet in the sea and offer him a commission

583
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,280
in the United States Navy.

584
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,040
It's unknown what becomes of the conversation

585
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,120
for the movie ends with a question mark.

586
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,200
That's pretty fucking cool way to end the flick.

587
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,760
That's kind of like the Brock Lesnar coming out

588
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,440
and beating the shit out of Mr. Limpet ending of the flick.

589
00:27:59,440 --> 00:27:59,760
And I'm very into that.

590
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,960
I would watch that movie.

591
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,480
Yeah, sure.

592
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,080
What do you do when you catch a fish?

593
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,400
You get Brock Lesnar to come punch you a bunch.

594
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,400
He doesn't paint with punches.

595
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,440
That's not really on his palette.

596
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,560
Is he more of a kick man?

597
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,440
He's more of a throw man.

598
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,120
Oh, I see.

599
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,400
All right folks, this has all been great

600
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:29,840
but we need to take a quick sojourn in the money zone.

601
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,440
Blue Apron.

602
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,280
Two words.

603
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,480
Seems so simple, don't they?

604
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,000
They are.

605
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,640
Because Blue Apron is simple.

606
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
This is the danger, folks, if you start talking

607
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,640
before you really decide what words

608
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,280
you want to kind of string together into ideas.

609
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,680
Listen, I've only got the one method, Justin.

610
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,680
I don't know what you want from me.

611
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,760
Sometimes when you're building the plane underneath you

612
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,080
as you fly it, you add in like,

613
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,840
I'm going to add in some big, big speakers

614
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,080
and then I'm going to make sure that the paint color is blue.

615
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,320
And you realize you have not put in wings or a chassis or a-

616
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,480
Yeah, and you're making a Jeep, that kind of thing.

617
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,200
Yeah, you're making a Jeep.

618
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,400
Yeah, it happens.

619
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,360
So Blue Apron's mission is to make incredible home cooking.

620
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,200
Make incredible home cooking accessible to everyone.

621
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,320
And they do.

622
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,640
They do it by delivering farm fresh ingredients

623
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,960
and step-by-step recipes to your door.

624
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,720
I'm a big fan of Blue Apron.

625
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,240
It makes me feel, well, when I started doing it,

626
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,600
I felt like I could cook.

627
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,280
And now having done it for a couple of years,

628
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,960
I will say it has actually improved my cooking abilities.

629
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,440
And Blue Apron is dedicated to supporting

630
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,120
a more sustainable food system,

631
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,800
setting the highest standards for ingredients

632
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,880
and building a community of home chefs.

633
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,480
They just did a Bob's Burgers partnership.

634
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,160
I thought you were going to get kicked out of that.

635
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,760
I loved it so much.

636
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,960
And I got to make the Bob's Burgers.

637
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,240

That's blueapron.com slash my brother

to get your first three meals free.

642
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

643
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,160
Can I tell you all about Quip?

644
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,480
Yeah.

645
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,400
I hate Quip.

646
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,600
Did you know it's opposite day?

647
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,120
Did you know it's opposite day?

648
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,640
Oh, whoa.

649
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,720
I think that could be a really fun way

650
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,160
to start doing these ads.

651
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,760
Do you know what I mean?

652
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,640
Do opposite ads.

653
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,440
Hating them?

654
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,680
Yeah.

655
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,520
It'd be like, oh, it doesn't brush my teeth really good

656
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,760
and make my teeth look white and beautiful.

657
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,960
Just, it's opposite day.

658
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,360
So you have to keep saying that over and over again.

659
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,360
Why don't you do an opposite day for this one

660
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,720
and see if they still give us money?

661
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:33,920
Okay.

662
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,200
Good toast run.

663
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,560
And I'm also, I'm worried, Griffin,

664
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,000
that if you say it's opposite day on opposite day,

665
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,600
doesn't that mean it's not opposite day?

666
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,200
Ah, shit, birds.

667
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,080
Okay, anyway, it's not opposite day anymore.

668
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,120
I love Quip.

669
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,160
And it's because I was brushing my teeth wrong

670
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,680
because I was using the wrong toothbrush

671
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,960
and now I'm using a Quip toothbrush.

672
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,160
It's sleek and stylish.

673
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,960
It's modern.

674
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,800
It is discreet.

675
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,960
And it is an electric-

676
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,400
It'll keep its mouth shut.

677
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,240
It's a new, it'll keep my mouth shut

678
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
while I'm brushing it in and out in there

679
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,360
and it's an electric toothbrush,

680
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,600
so it's a fraction of the cost of bulkier brushes

681
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,440
and it packs premium vibrations

682
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,800
for a perfect two-minute clean.

683
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,680
Plus their guiding pulses remind you when to switch sides

684
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,040
and they'll deliver new brush heads

685
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,720
on a dentist-recommended schedule

686
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,560
every three months for just $5,

687
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,640
including free shipping worldwide.

688
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,200
It's great.

689
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,920
I have one.

690
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,360
It sticks to my bathroom mirror.

691
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,080
I pop it in, brush it, pop it back out,

692
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,520
and then I can travel with it.

693
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,160
It's super easy.

694
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Anyway, Quip starts at just $25.

695
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,560
And if you go to getquip.com,

696
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,320
that's getquip.com slash my brother right now,

697
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,160

698
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,760
with a Quip electric toothbrush,

699
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,600
spelled G-E-T-Q-U-I-P.com slash my brother.

700
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,800
I got a Jumbotron here.

701
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,640
I want to tell you,

702
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,720
hey, do you like people playing video games with a twist?

703
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,240
Check out this YouTube channel,

704
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,560
Espresso Steampunk.

705
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,280
There are no Xs in the word espresso, by the way.

706
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,400
As you can tell by the way I say it, espresso.

707
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,520
He plays scary games while recording his pulse

708
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,160
and pupil dilation, kind of like Blade Runner.

709
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,120
He plays dating sims while giving comedic dating advice

710
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,240
with his girlfriend.

711
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,560
He just wants to entertain you while he chills out.

712
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,440
What could be better?

713
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,280
So once again, that's youtube.com slash Espresso Steampunk.

714
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,000
It's been too long since I've seen Blade Runner.

715
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,600
I don't remember Harrison Ford playing Fortnite,

716
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,840
but maybe that happened.

717
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,480
Did that happen?

718
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,400
Did Harrison Ford do a lot of live streaming in Blade Runner?

719
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,880
Yeah, and he gets his ass completely wracked by these fucking androids

720
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,600
because they have hands that are keyboards

721
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,600
and they use all the cheat codes.

722
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,640
Oh, they have like the turbo button.

723
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,120
They have turbo buttons built into their freaking,

724
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,000
you know, fingers and thumbs and elbows.

725
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,320
And they always do the odd job.

726
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,160
And the only game I can beat them at is Dance Central

727
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,680
because they got no rhythm, but I do.

728
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,360
Can't teach a robot rhythm.

729
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,400
I always say that.

730
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,040
I have a message for Chris and it's from Ana.

731
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,880
And it says, sub handsome.

732
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,720
I can't believe we've been together for 10 years already.

733
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,960
I'm not very romantic, but I figured if I got our favorite brothers

734
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,600
to read this message to you, my love would come through.

735
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,640
Am I good?

736
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,800
Looking forward to many more years of eating chatinos,

737
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,560
hanging out with our cat, Sam, and watching dumb internet videos.

738
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,040
Much love, Ana.

739
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:27,280
And this is for, on or after January 22nd, 2018.

740
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,240
So wowza, did, whoo, woof.

741
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,920
That is bracing.

742
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,240
That is a bracing amount by which to miss this happy occasion.

743
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,680
So thank you so much.

744
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,120
It's been basically 11 years.

745
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,280
So let's go back and fix it.

746
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:43,520
Okay.

747
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,040
Hi, I'm Biz.

748
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,920
And I'm Teresa.

749
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,600
And we host One Bad Mother, a comedy podcast about parenting.

752
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,360
I'm just going to end with this.

753
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:08,000
Everybody, you're doing a remarkable job of swimming

754
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,440

759
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,480
Uh, yahoo?

760
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,080
Sure, yeah, it sounds great.

761
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,680
So this one was sent in by Matt Brown.

762
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,160
Thanks, Matt.

763
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,720
Yahoo answers user star five who asks,

764
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,240
if you were Bigfoot, would you reveal yourself to humans?

765
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,920
Like a flasher?

766
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,680
Probably not a flasher.

767
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,560
Probably like a, you know, an announcement.

768
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,760
Hey, I'm Bigfoot.

769
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,200
It's, it is me.

770
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,720
Let's do this thing.

771
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,760
Me and you together.

772
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,840
Humanity, let's fucking, let's roll.

773
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,120
If I was going to, you'd have to pick the right moment

774
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,880
to make maximum impact.

775
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,400
Right, so it'd have to be...

776
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,840
2020 election.

777
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,200
Yeah, and like announce yourself as like a candidate.

778
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,760
Oh, I think it's just the Bigfoot endorsement.

779
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,880
Oh, okay.

780
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,960
See, but that's the thing is like,

781
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,800
I would want to do it just when I felt like

782
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,160
people stopped believing in Bigfoot,

783
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,640
and that's when it's going to make the biggest impact.

784
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,720
Because if everybody already believes you're there,

785
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,600
big deal, right?

786
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,560
Then you're like, I'm Bigfoot,

787
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,240
and everyone's like, yeah, we fucking know.

788
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,800
But it just feels like if you could wait until

789
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
like the tipping point where most people are like,

790
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,080
yeah, you know what?

791
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,960
There's no Bigfoot.

792
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,360
And then you're just like, boom, I'm Bigfoot.

793
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,240
That weird guy at the grocery store was right.

794
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,680
That would be good.

795
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,040
I'll tell you the problem.

796
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,080
I'll tell you why I probably would,

797
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,320
this would be a firm no for me if I was the Bigfoot,

798
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,800
is I would step up and I'd be like,

799
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,480
hey, I do a press conference.

800
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,000
Hey, Bigfoot, big and hairy, and I live in the woods,

801
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,720
and I just want to chill.

802
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,240
So I just wanted to say, hey,

803
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,400
because I know y'all have a lot of internet fights about me.

804
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,600
I want to put that to bed.

805
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,560
It's me, the Bigfoot.

806
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,880
Jack Links, don't appreciate your whole thing.

807
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:00,880
I'm pretty chill.

808
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,200
So Harry and the Hendershins is the best,

809
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,880
is a great movie, best movie ever made.

810
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,000
They actually got it the closest to right.

811
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,400
So well done.

812
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,000
So anyway, I'm going to go back to the woods.

813
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,400
And there'll be a lot of people who watch-

814
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,920
Also, Jill Stein 2020.

815
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,400
Okay.

816
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,200
Jill Stein 2020.

817
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,320
Just wanted to get that out there.

818
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,680
To get ahead of it.

819
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,560
Don't have a bunch of debates about sort of who I'm going to support,

820
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,000
because Jill Stein 2020, bye.

821
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,800
2020, bye.

822
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,520
There'll be a lot of people who watch that press conference

823
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,360
who didn't have particularly strong feelings

824
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,400
about the existence of Bigfoot,

825
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,640
who would then see it and then say,

826
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,800
wow, I want to eat that thing.

827
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,320
Oh, yeah.

828
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,800
Do you know what I mean?

829
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,480
There'll be people who don't particularly have feelings about it.

830
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,320
They would see the Bigfoot do the press conference

831
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,160
and say, hey, I'm Bigfoot, I'm real.

832
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,120
Jill Stein 2020, legalize it.

833
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,800
And then wander back off in the woods.

834
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,400
And there would be people who would say like,

835
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,000
I wonder what the meat and flesh of that animal would taste like.

836
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,960
Do you know what I'm talking about?

837
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,480
I want to wear him like a jacket.

838
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,440
I want to wear him like a jacket.

839
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,240
There's only one of them.

840
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,480
And I'm sure the meat is maybe tough and gamey,

841
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,240
but it would be the only way to ever have it.

842
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
And there'll be lots and lots and lots and lots of people.

843
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,920
We could not satisfy.

844
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,640
We'd have, unless we did like a real Okja situation,

845
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,480
like we would not be able to fully satisfy the hunger

846
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,360
for this being's flesh and meat.

847
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,480
Griffin, who do you think is the most famous person

848
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,160
who would want to eat Bigfoot?

849
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,000
How famous is Ted Nugent?

850
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,920
Cause that's a hundred percent guaranteed.

851
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,160
Yes.

852
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,880
I bet maybe Gordon Ramsey would want to eat Bigfoot.

853
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,040
Oh, the entire, the chef community would be,

854
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,560
I mean, certainly there are chefs who would be like

855
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,080
more into like sustainable sources of meat,

856
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,280
but then there would be like Wolfgang Puck

857
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,120
would like format it like a militia to get the Bigfoot.

858
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,320
I have a think piece for you.

859
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,520
I have a think piece for you here

860
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,120
that I'd like to craft in this moment.

861
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,840
I was looking up a study and right now,

862
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,400
according to the best research that I could find,

863
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,640
most recent research, around 20% of Americans,

864
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,080
one in five, believe that Bigfoot is real.

865
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,400
Okay?

866
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:10,720
Okay.

867
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,200
One in five.

868
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,560
Okay. If Bigfoot goes on TV and does a press conference

869
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,480
about how he is real,

870
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,040
that is broadcast across all the major news stations,

871
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,320
the next morning, what percentage of Americans

872
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,840
believe Bigfoot is real?

873
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,720
This is like, what I'd like to posit is,

874
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,440
has it changed at all to see that?

875
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,400
Is it less or do fewer at that point?

876
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,560
How many people would watch Bigfoot talk on TV

877
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,240
and say, hi, it's me, Bigfoot.

878
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:42,880
I'm real.

879
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,520
Jill Stein, 2020, legalize it.

880
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,440
How many people after that press conference,

881
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,720
the next morning wake up and then believe Bigfoot is real?

882
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,000
This is an excellent point, Justin,

883
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,080
because there are many people in the world

884
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,920
that I know are real,

885
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,640
but at any given moment when I'm not looking at them,

886
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,240
I don't believe they exist.

887
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,880
What's the number?

888
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,200
I think-

889
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,760
Bigfoot goes on TV, does a press conference.

890
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,120
Before this press conference, one in five Americans

891
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,040
believe Bigfoot is real.

892
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,680
What is that number after the press conference?

893
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,120
Well, fuck, Justin, there was a hologram of Tupac

894
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,440
who just like performed at a thing

895
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,080
and they've got the green screens and the CGI's.

896
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,920
Boy, you are really working so hard to dodge these-

897
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,800
15%.

898
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,600
What?

899
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,400
I think it drops.

900
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:30,800
That's about-

901
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,440
Oh, interesting.

902
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,720
That's actually where I was.

903
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,520
Because I feel like there's a percentage,

904
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,760
there is a not insignificant percentage of the Bigfoot crowd

905
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,800
for whom seeing Bigfoot give a press conference

906
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,480
on the national media would probably lower their chance

907
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,840
of believing in Bigfoot.

908
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,280
I believe that there is a percentage

909
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,880
of the human population.

910
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,800
There would definitely be someone who would see it

911
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,960
and be like, oh no, that's not Bigfoot.

912
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,000
Yes, right.

913
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,200
That's just a large talking ape man,

914
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,800
but that's not Bigfoot.

915
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,160
I mean, if the last- I have drawn Bigfoot and he looks like this

916
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,800
and he has ripped pecs and he has just like a 12 pack

917
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,320
and he kisses real good and that's not him.

918
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,240
I mean, if the last few years have been any indication,

919
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,360
if it does appear on the news,

920
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,800
there will be people instantly on Facebook like,

921
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,400
if they don't look that big to me.

922
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,540
Anyway.

923
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,440
I would want to eat him.

924
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,600
Yeah, I think we'd all want to sliver that-

925
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,960
But not all of them.

926
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,560
No, no, no, no.

927
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,560
Just enough.

928
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,600
See, now I'm picturing some kind of a movie,

929
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,640
a buddy comedy of Bigfoot comes out,

930
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,120
announces himself, then the whole world wants to eat him

931
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,280
and it leads to this worldwide hunt for Bigfoot

932
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,280
and he has one friend who helps him

933
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,240
and it's Guy Fieri and they team up

934
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,400
and Guy Fieri has to protect him

935
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,880
from all the other chefs in the world

936
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,840
and they just go on adventures together.

937
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,360
Maybe it's more of a sitcom,

938
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,000
maybe it's like an hour long,

939
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,920
not really sitcom, so much as a humorous drama.

940
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,920
Yeah, and at the end,

941
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,480
you're envisioning sort of a departed style ending

942
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,080
for this one because really Guy Fieri

943
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,800
is just trying to find a deep fryer big enough

944
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,120
to get the entire Bigfoot in it at once.

945
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,280
At the end, Bigfoot dies of a heart attack

946
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,360
but as he's dying, tells Guy Fieri,

947
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,320
you're the only one who deserves-

948
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,920
It's okay.

949
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,000
Yes, please do it and Guy Fieri's like,

950
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,880
I don't want to, so Bigfoot climbs inside of his mouth

951
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,440
and makes him chew him up and it's really touching.

952
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,120
Do it, Guy Fieri, oh, no, no, no.

953
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:47,680
He jams his huge hairy fist into Guy Fieri's huge hairy mouth

954
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,280
and just makes with his other hand,

955
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,760
just kind of forces Guy Fieri's jaw

956
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,160
to go up and down and up and down.

957
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,560
As Guy Fieri cries donkey sauce.

958
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,440
Yeah, yeah, he cries donkey sauce directly into the mouth

959
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,400
to add the flavorings and take it straight to flavor town.

960
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,680
It's basically like the arm cutting scene in 127 hours.

961
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,480
It is long and it is brutal and you see all of it

962
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,000
but it's pathetic.

963
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,320
If anybody can get Bigfoot and Guy Fieri to commit

964
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,440
and we know which one of those

965
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,640
is gonna be the most difficult,

966
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,360
then I will kickstart that project.

967
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,280
And then after credit scene, Guy's hosting the Triple G,

968
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,840
Guy's grocery games and one of the contestants

969
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,920
runs back down the aisle and he's like,

970
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,960
all right, what'd you get?

971
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,040
And he's like, well, I got some Tabasco sauce,

972
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,800
I got some Panko bread crumbs

973
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,200
and I got one pound of Bigfoot meat

974
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,520
and then it cuts to Guy Fieri's shocked face

975
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,040
and he's like, where did you?

976
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,200
Into a question mark?

977
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:46,640
Okay.

978
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,880
Got a haunted doll watch.

979
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,280
Okay.

980
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,320
It's a brief one.

981
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,920
But this is kind of a unique approach

982
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,360
that I had not seen before.

983
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,480
So I wanted to highlight this haunted doll named Goldie

984
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:05,000
Who I will say Goldie does not look all that creepy kind of a sweet doll if I'm being honest kind of just like a

985
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,420
Just looks like kind of a sweet doll to me

986
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,880
I'm gonna send you all the link so you can enjoy Goldie

987
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,360
You're not gonna be able to find Goldie when you're in this episode because Goldie's only on sale for another 26 minutes zero bids on

988
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,780
Goldie currently starting bid is $38 which is

989
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,420
Kind of a buck wild starting bid amount just kind of seems like you snap that one out of midair, but anyway

990
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,020
This is oh my god, Justin. What?

991
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,440
Just the this supplemental images

992
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,180
Kind of sweet doll, that's all

993
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,180
It's just kind of sweet doll

994
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,180
Anywho, this is Goldilocks

995
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:49,860
This is quote Goldilocks quote. I've been working with her for a while now and discovered. She died a

996
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,380
Horrible death I took pictures of the response

997
00:43:53,380 --> 00:44:00,140
I got when asking her several questions about when she died and who killed her other things that came up were quote violence

998
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:05,140
Hand hell and copper I can send you pictures of these words on my device

999
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,100
If you like I was limited by the number of pictures I can post

1000
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,780
What's the describe the device Justin it is?

1001
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,700
It looks like

1002
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,780
Okay

1003
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,780
It's a phone

1004
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,780
Definitely, it's a phone and

1005
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:30,620
It looks like there's like meters and stuff at the top and then below it. There's like

1006
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,460
the NES font

1007
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,540
basic like Mega Man NES font

1008
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,100
Describing I

1009
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:46,040
Guess what the doll is trying to communicate. I don't know if this is a program or what but it is amazing

1010
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,460
Here are the images like the text on these images is

1011
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,780
inside

1012
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,300
you

1013
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,180
That's the first one and it's the best one

1014
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,420
I wish you had started with another one because it's the best one what possible what?

1015
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:03,000
Possible question could you have posted this hounded doll that the response inside you would be an acceptable

1016
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,740
next seven

1017
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,260
followed by light and

1018
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,900
then believe him

1019
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:17,100
Oh my God, okay, wait over. These are all discrete images gorging

1020
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,980
Maniac

1021
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:25,260
Not brave if only there was a word that meant not brave

1022
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,060
Afraid is the next image Griffin afraid

1023
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,180
Not brave not brave

1024
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:37,060
I know there's one. That's like easier. Hey you have a limited number of images

1025
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:42,060
You can share and you're going to do both not brave and afraid last one is cremate by the way

1026
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:47,580
So you do have that going for you. I don't know what I'm putting out a bounty on this fucking program

1027
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:52,220
Please someone tell me what it is. It looks like an iPhone app, and I need it desperately

1028
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:58,880
So here's the lesson it says right here Justin if you have any questions, please feel free to ask yeah

1029
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:05,420
What app is that please I do I want to say that this is this is the reason?

1030
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,620
I'm I'm reading this and not discuss this these great great

1031
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,380
ghost communication app that apparently exists

1032
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,180
the

1033
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:22,040
After all this at the end this question this Lister says I also ask that you place her in a room you use

1034
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,100
most

1035
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,100
So you can connect?

1036
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:29,980
Spirits take time and the more time you spend with her the more she will show herself to you

1037
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,660
Please be patient. She is an amazing fine

1038
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,740
So it's not just like I'm going to get one of these as like a novelty

1039
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:43,380
It's like I'm going to put this doll in my home in a high traffic zone

1040
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,660
So I can really get comfortable with the ghost that's in this doll

1041
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:51,940
I wanted to be somewhere where companies going to see it. I wanted to be somewhere very prominent. I've never seen

1042
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,780

1043
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:59,340
requirement on a ebay listing I mean it's word of mouth marketing in that

1044

Multi-level marketing shit. I do want to warn you that as you connect with her more and more

1047
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:19,220

1048
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,740

Folks that's going to do it for us this week. Thank you so much for

1050
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,660
listening to our program

1051
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:34,980
I want to say real quick. I got a new podcast. It's a meditative show about cereal

1052
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:41,820
I made it for anxiety sufferers and people who like cereal and people who fit into both categories

1053
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:47,980
I made it with the creator of a cereal blog called serial asleep named Dan Kuber and Dan

1054
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:53,700
And I record this very relaxing show that you could find at bowl dot rest

1055
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:59,420
It's just an opportunity to zone out you can also go to bowl dot rest to support the show

1056
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,860
And I'll proceeds from the show will go to half

1057
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,620
We'll go to keep the lights on over at seal is seriously and the other half will go to

1058
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:12,620
Food pantry in the Huntington West Virginia area, so you're helping support two great things

1059
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,140
And I hope you get a lot out of it

1060
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:18,580
And I hope it'll help you to relax I use podcasts a lot to relax

1061
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:22,540
When my anxiety is at its peak, and I hope that this can be the same for you

1062
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:28,420
So that's the empty bowl bowl dot rest is where you can find that and hope you check it out

1063
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:36,660
Justin how many times now have you told people about this and had to clarify like breakfast cereal not like the podcast

1064
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:42,180
This is the reason that I don't have cereal in the title Travis, so I would not have to repeatedly have that conversation
