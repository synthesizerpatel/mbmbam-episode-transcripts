1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:46,960
Hello, baby, welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,720
Machinera. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,760
McElroy. And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. I feel like I don't even know that I can

8
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:08,000
call myself that anymore. Boys, I got some pa- I got some packages today. They arrived- they arrived

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,800
in the mail, and when I opened all of them- when I bought these packages, or rather the things inside

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,080
of them, I didn't- I didn't think that they created a narrative, but then when I opened them all up and

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,040
laid the contents out, I realized this sort of through line there. And let me start off by saying

12
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,920
I don't really use Twitter pretty much at all anymore, but whenever I do dip my beak in, I'm

13
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,920
still getting a lot of, you know, uh, memes, uh, teen- teen memes, and weird- weird humor that like-

14
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,720
Oh, I love that stuff. I love that weird humor, that kind of like, where are they coming from? What do

15
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,040
they even mean? Sure, and I think I'm getting it mostly because I'm the- I am the only boy- you two

16
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,400
are men now, and I'm still the- I guess I'm still the only boy of the podcast. Oh, thank you. I open

17
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,440
up these packages. They are mostly things I bought in preparation for our, uh, our Disney World trip

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:07,440
next week, uh, as we, uh, as we brave the wilds of, uh, Flowrider. And so there was a fanny pack,

19
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,320
and I did get that for- It's waterproof. It's waterproof. There's pictures on- I got this one

20
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,320
off Amazon, and there's pictures of a guy wearing it, and the guy looks really cool, like a handsome

21
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,520
model boy, and he's wearing it, and he's got it, you know, slung to the side. That's cool. He's-

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,000
Where's it- Is it one of the ones that I picked for you? No, no, no. I- you- Travis sent me some

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,720
great suggestions, but I found a- I found a nice one. He also wears it like a sling bag messenger

24
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,520
bag over his back, and it's like, is that even dumber? Because I feel like if I wear a fanny pack

25
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,960
like it was a backpack, that's gonna make it seem like a big joke, but I did buy this. I just want

26
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,480
to have like a huge laugh at you, uh, and not buy one for myself because it's a great idea, because

27
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,720
god, that'd be very useful. Yeah, yeah. I sort of saw like certain places I should look for a great

28
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,840
fanny pack. I'll send you some links. I'll jokingly send you some links that I was looking at,

29
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,120
Justin, if you want. It'll be a funny, ironic thing, but also very practical and useful when

30
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,600
we're in the Disney. Um, the other thing that showed up is some Tevas, which is the kind of

31
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,040
sandals that, if they were still making, like, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids movies that Rick Moranis

32
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,880
would exclusively wear, um, they're the- they're the- just the- they're just boys. These are some

33
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,600
goof troupe, what are those geek shoes. They're really rough, but they're supposed to be really

34
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,480
comfortable. I got these, I put them on, and I instantly felt myself age 20 years, and I also

35
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,400
noticed that there's a buckle. I can't strap them on the right way and tighten them the right way

36
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,880
so that this buckle that's like on the heel isn't going to rub and give me blisters, and so I did

37
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,120
like do some googling about Tevas blisters, and a lot of people recommend that you do wear socks

38
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,400
with them, so I think I'm pretty much dead at this. I think I'm a dead old- an old dead man

39
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:56,080
and bad dad, and I don't think, um, I just- I- I just need to- this is a quick, I guess, brand update

40
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,400
that is, uh, oh, I'm old and dead. And you're finally a dad. I'm an old dead dad Bones. Essentially,

41
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,680
at this point, yes, a big walking skeleton dad who loves the eagles and wears Tevas with socks with

42
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,000
his- and when he rides a water ride on Disney World, I'll just ball up the socks, shove it in

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,040
my waterproof fanny pack, I have it all figured out. I am old Bones. That is a definite, uh, see,

44
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,800
I would never ride a water ride, and I think it's maybe- if I was doing kind of a new Jeff Fox-worthy

45
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:30,320
bit, if he was coming back for a second, like, you know you're a grown-up when, uh, you- people say

46
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,760
we're going on this water ride, and you think, I'm not going to walk around and squish your shoes all

47
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:41,840
the time. No thanks. No way. On earth, no thanks. There's another thing I got, and it's, um, a book

48
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,520
of sheet music for the adult piano classes I'm taking, um, and this is in the same package as

49
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,320
the Tevas and the fanny pack, and the book is called Adult Piano Adventures. So is it, like,

50
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,680
erotic piano music? Yeah, I used to watch a blurry version of that on Cinemax that my parents didn't

51
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,560
pay for. So just people asking me to, like, dab on them on Twitter just understand that, like,

52
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,720
my arm might go flying out of its socket and, you know, land in the crowd of the Doobie Brothers

53
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,400
concert that I'm at, because I can't anymore. He just can't. What are y'all's Disney World prep?

54
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,480
Because y'all have been, I feel like, more recently than I have. I don't know. I'm afraid I'm literally-

55
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,320
I- you google this shit, and it's supposed to be the most wonderful place on earth, and when you

56
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,280
google it, all you find is, like, 50 dad blogs of people, like, you're gonna fucking die unless you

57
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,920
bring these 80 things. You need a machete. You need some- you need twine. Put everything you own in

58
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,920
baggies, and then look for this guy named Duke. He'll know what to do. He'll know what to do once

59
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,160
you get there. Just start yelling for Duke, and if you see Duke, he's gonna carry you across the

60
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,680
front lines, and then after that, you're on your own. You're gonna have this one knife that you

61
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,640
can slip in your anus, and other than that, your life and death is up to you. And that has nothing

62
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,840
to do with surviving the park. That's just something you can do for you. I just don't- I don't- I see

63
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,920
the teacups, and I'm like, the teacups look fun, and it's like, the teacups will disintegrate your

64
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,120
bones, so start eating lots of iron now, and if you don't eat iron every day for 60 days before

65
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,520
going to Disney World, you can't ride the teacups. And it's like, wow, okay. Here's what they don't

66
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,120
tell you, is that when you walk into the park, they take a picture of you, whether you want

67
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,280
them to or not, and then they try to sell it to you. And when you leave the park, they give you

68
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,960
a grade on how well you were actually prepared for the experience. Right. And most people, F minus.

69
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,360
F minus. Well, with my Tavis, and my socks, and my fanny pack, and my adult piano book, if I can't

70
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,720
at least pull down a C, then what's- what's- what's the fucking point of all this? Here's the amazing

71
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,480
thing I've learned about myself in preparing for Disney. Um, when I was a younger, uh, man, I would

72
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:53,280
have called myself, oh, Travis, so disorganized. Travis is- is quite, uh, the messy, unfocused boy.

73
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:02,560
I find now, there is nothing I love more than a well-organized itinerary. I'm having so much fun

74
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,400
making plans, because I basically go- we go from Disney to, uh, Dragon Con, and then I go to London

75
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,840
Podfest. So I'm like, making like four different trips in one, and I'm loving it. The Disney

76
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,240
planning is really, uh, smart, because I went there, uh, last fall, and it's really smart,

77
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,400
because as soon as you show up, Mickey is gonna be like, haha, you made some plans, huh? Gonna fuck

78
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,800
them. And then he just fucks them. Yeah. Right there in front of you? Yeah, he takes your plans,

79
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,240
he tears it up into confetti, he puts it into a blender, he charges you 13 dollars for it,

80
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,880
then sells it back to you, and force-feeds it to you. Whoa. And Goofy watches, and like, I know us,

81
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:54,400
and there's- there's seldom a week- a week run where one of us doesn't have diarrhea. And that

82
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,520
happens at Disney World, and that seems like it might be the ball- that might be a death scenario.

83
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:07,280
It may be one of the rare times that those three diarrhea's line up at the same time. It's, uh,

84
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:14,000
only every three years, the total eclipse of the fart, and it, uh, it is gonna be- it's a big- it's

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,760
a big deal. And to happen that week, man, I- I can't even imagine. Justin, are you, uh, proud of

86
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:27,040
yourself? I mean, I'm an accomplished entertainer, a father of two. And you also just said eclipse of

87
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,960
the fart. That's what I want to know about, because I'm very proud of you. And now you've said it,

88
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,600
and for- and in grand scope of history, we basically said it at the same moment. If you-

89
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:42,400
if you take a cosmos zoom out on that to all of human history, we said it at the exact same

90
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:48,400
nanosecond now. So we're both equally guilty, I guess. I have a thing to- I have a thing to say,

91
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,360
and it's new. It's- A few words? Yeah, it's new, and- Here at the death of our show?

92
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,200
Well, no, it's new and good, and, like, I just thought of it, and I think it could be, like,

93
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,760
a- a funny joke. And sometimes we, like- and this is behind the scenes, but I will warn the

94
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,040
boys that I have a joke coming up, and I'll say it. If it's not good, we'll just remove it,

95
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,040
but I think this is gonna be a good one. And it's that I think I'm gonna need a vacation from this

96
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:20,160
vacation. I love that. Can we start doing advice? This is advice. This is a special email that

97
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:28,720
we're leading off with as a- a return. Our first ever two-parter. Our first ever, like,

98
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:36,720
serial-style cliffhanger. We'll have more on that in the next week's episode. We got a version of-

99
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,080
well, I'll read the original question, and then, uh, we'll follow up from there.

100
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,400
Hi, brothers. I work at a grocery store, deli, in a rural area, and a few days ago someone came to

101
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,480
the counter who I'm 95% sure is a moderately famous Hollywood actor. The actor is not known

102
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:00,480
to have a house- uh, sorry? No, you read that right. Okay. This actor is not known to have a

103
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,600
house about 15 to 20 minutes away from the store. I have to believe that that knot was a whoopsie

104
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,480
doodle that shouldn't have been in there. Right, because where do you get that- where do you get

105
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,600
that information? Like, how do you search that? Does this person- they're not known to. Okay,

106
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,040
because would you search does this person have a house 15 to 20 minutes of me driving or walking?

107
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:28,880
It's a very specific thing to say he doesn't do. Yeah, it's a wha- yeah, yeah. 99.9% of the earth

108
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,320
is gonna say no to that sentence. Is gonna- is gonna jive with that. Okay, anyway. It's not known

109
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,480
to have a house about 15 to 20 minutes away from the store. Now imagining a radius of like a 15

110
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,600
to 20 minute drive surrounding the store, like they live in- they don't live in this window.

111
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,440
They could be 10 minutes away, they could be 25 minutes away, we literally have no idea.

112
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,360
I will say that I- even Cincinnati I would not say is a- is a rural area, and even here,

113
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,000
if someone even- if a moderate, uh, moderately famous Hollywood actor even like rents an

114
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,480
apartment for a day, like everyone in town knows about it. So- all right, people are- people are

115
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,400
fucking dying because we haven't said who it is. Go. My question is this, should I have asked him

116
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,520
if he really was a celebrity and told him I like his work, or did I do the right thing by just

117
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:21,040
treating him like a normal customer? As well-known people yourselves, ha, do you prefer- I thank you-

118
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,520
do you prefer to be recognized as you're going about your daily business, or would you rather

119
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,960
be left alone to get your deli meat and peas? That's from Starstruckinthewoods, and it says

120
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:37,520
follow up, and here's what y'all been waiting for. I'm pretty sure it was Louise Guzman.

121
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,920
I believe he got some Black Forest ham. Thank you, I would have sent this fishy right back into the

122
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,960
sea if you hadn't said what kind of sandwich they were looking for, so. Very exciting. I think

123
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,160
it probably was Louise Guzman. Here's- okay, can I tell you my- I don't know the accent,

124
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,000
I hope I'm doing the accent right. Guzman. Yes, Guzman. Okay, here's the thing, I strongly feel-

125
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,360
I am- I think about this a lot. I think there are very few actors, performers, recognizable people

126
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,800
that I would recognize on sight without someone saying, that is blank. I think I'd know for sure

127
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:22,960
if it was Louise Guzman. Like, I don't- I don't think I'd have to ask somebody. You are so certain

128
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:28,800
of this, Travis. I am! Like, I'm picturing Louise Guzman in my head, and I've got a crystal clear

129
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,440
picture. Yeah. Just a quick update, he does live, according to his IMDB page, in Vermont, with,

130
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:46,000
quote, his wife and many kids. I hear you, Louise, you and me, buddy. I- okay, so I can- here,

131
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,600
let us personally address this, and I will be- and I think if you're a listener of ours, and on the

132
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,000
off chance that you should spot us in the wild at some point, I want you to remember this exact

133
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,880
thing I'm about to tell you. And I- I can't speak for everyone. I can't even really speak for everybody

134
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,440
in our, like, certain specific class of people knowing who you are, because it's a very specific

135
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:16,320
sort of prism through which our light has to be reflected, in which we look like actual celebrities,

136
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,400
like Louise Guzman, I would argue. But for me, if I'm just walking around and about, and somebody's

137
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:29,840
like, hey, you're Justin McElroy, um, I feel like, uh, pretty good. I feel like kind of a cool dude.

138
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,760
Yeah. Kind of a cool- kind of a cool person who's done some cool stuff and has cool people enjoying

139
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,400
what they do. It's a nice little ego boost, and if I'm with my kids, some people are like, oh,

140
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,440
you're with your kids. I can- they can stand aside for a second. They're always here. They're always

141
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,880
here. You're not. Hello. Hi. Thank you for this. Kate Welch- Kate Welch recently tweeted, uh,

142
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,520
that someone had tweeted at her, saying, I saw you, but I didn't want to bother you. You were

143
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,000
talking to your friends, and she responded, do you know how fucking cool you would have made me look?

144
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,960
Yeah. Every time. Like, oh, Justin. It's so choice. It's so- that's what you- you hope for.

145
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,320
There's a lot of things you can do, and let's maybe separate this from ourselves so I don't

146
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,200
sound, um, you know, shitty when I say this, but let's just say, if you do want to approach Louise

147
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,160
Guzman, there's a few things that you maybe shouldn't do, and that is, one is to not approach

148
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,440
her, but then do tweet later, like, I saw you. That's not good for Louise- I saw you, Guz.

149
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,880
I saw you, Louise Guzman. I, uh, I can- as long as we're- I did it just so it doesn't seem like

150
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,000
her to come down and harm anybody. Did this exact thing to harm our superstar once. Guilty. Yeah,

151
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,160
guilty. Um, saw him in the LAX bathroom. Uh, can I say, though, for me, personally,

152
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,720
I don't- if I wasn't 100% sure it's Louise, and I would be, but if I wasn't, I don't think I'd

153
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,960
pull the trigger on this one, because I don't think there's anything worse than, uh, saying

154
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,040
you think somebody's somebody and then they're not that somebody, especially- The only- Yeah.

155
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:06,960
The only way to kind of give yourself a little wiggle room out is just say, hey, I like your work.

156
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:12,080
Don't say a name and see how they- because if they look at you and go, what? Then you say,

157
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,960
never mind, I thought you were somebody else, right? But if you say the name,

158
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,080
hey, Louise Guzman, and they're like, who the f- I'm not Louise Guzman. That is- I think that

159
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,200
if you say, like, hey, I like your work, and they're like, oh, thank you very much,

160
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,400
then, like, it's probably Louise Guzman. I mean, in this specific one, you could just go,

161
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,640
oh, fuck yeah, Boogie Nights, and then if they're not Louise Guzman, they'll be like,

162
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:43,040
like, um, yeah, it's a- it's a pretty good flick. Yeah. Do you want to buy it? I've got a copy.

163
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,080
I have a copy of Boogie Nights. It's for you. I once did that with John C. Reilly,

164
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:55,360
almost called him John C. McGinley from Scrubs. No way, no how. I did that I- when I met my now

165
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:02,720
friend, um, uh, MC Frontalot, I told him how much I loved his work on Aqua Teen Hunger Force,

166
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:11,600
which is MC Chris. Oh yeah, it's a different dude. I've, uh, never made this mistake, but I've never

167
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,800
also talked to a celebrity, so I- yeah, it's going good for me in my life. If you're not,

168
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,840
here's what- here's- here's would be my one, uh, I don't know, thing that would hang on this.

169
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,000
The people that come out to us, and I think we're probably biased in this way, the people that come

170
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,720
out to us are fans of what we make, right? Like, because you have to seek out our visages, if you

171
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,640
would like to absorb them. You must seek out our visages, so you must be a fan of ours. Um, it sounds

172
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,320
like maybe you just kind of know who Louise Guzman is, and maybe you don't know exactly what they

173
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,640
look like, so maybe not the biggest fan. So it may kind of feel a little bit, I don't know, that may

174
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,680
feel diff- I don't know any people- I know what you're saying. Who are actually famous that we could

175
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,120
at- qual- qualify for this, but like, if somebody's like, hey, don't I know you from TV or something,

176
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,080
I feel like that might feel kind of weird. Like, that might be less enjoyable. I tell you, it- it-

177
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,800
this is like- this is like my number one thing, is I see, like, I've seen so many celebrities that

178
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,040
I'm like, I recognize your face from a poster, but it feels super shitty to just be like, let me get

179
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:23,920
a picture with you because some people not me know who you are. That's gross. That has actually happened

180
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,160
to us before when a crowd of people have been around us, and someone will be like, I don't know

181
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,680
who you are, but just in case, and they take a picture with us, okay? I feel like we should

182
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,560
apologize to those people, like, nothing will ever come of this. Yeah. Let me save you the memory on

183
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:44,080
your iPhone. Um, how about Yahoo? Yeah, yeah. This one was sent in by Merit Palmer. Thank you,

184
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,040
Merit. It's Yahoo Answers User. They are anonymous. I'm gonna call them. Wait, hold on. Did we give

185
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,400
that person concrete advice on what they should do in this situation, should it arise again?

186
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,760
Yeah, it's just yell boogie nights. I felt like that was good. Yeah. Okay. Um, this anonymous user,

187
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:08,080
I'll call him, uh, Ollie, asks, I just got hired at Starbucks, but I don't drink coffee. A friend of

188
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:15,760
mine told me the first day, I have to try all the coffees. Can I opt out? Welcome to Starbucks,

189
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,680
motherfucker. Open up. Here's the funnel. You're gonna hold this in your mouth and your butt,

190
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:27,280
and we're gonna start partying. Here we go. Now, this is the Pike Place Roast. Uh, this is very

191
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,720
good. This is the Caramel Macchiato. You're gonna love this. You don't love this? You don't love

192
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,480
this. Okay, well, you work here, so, love it. You have to love all this different, that's a lot of

193
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,840
different coffee, eh? It's like a lot of different coffee to try. Yeah, they have like four or five

194
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,240
different ones. At least, and in the fall, they have six or seven. Sure. This is a wild, mmm.

195
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,600
This is a, there's so many wild things about this. The first being like, this is definitely,

196
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,000
there is no, they don't jump you into Starbucks by making you drink all their hot, hot beans.

197
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,960
The other thing is, while you're working at the Starbucks, and I get it, times are tight, maybe

198
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,800
this is the only job you could find, but I can't imagine walking into a Starbucks and being like,

199
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,120
mmm, so what's good here? And the person saying like, nothing, coffee stinks, all of it stinks,

200
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,360
it's gross, yuck, yuck, yuck. Do you want a water? Do you want a water? We do some juice, okay.

201
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,120
This is a, this is a fun little language lesson, this question, because when your friend said,

202
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,040
you have to, did they mean like, oh, you have to try, or like, you have to try it? Oh, yeah,

203
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,760
I hate coffee. Oh, you have to try coffee? You didn't listen, you're not listening to me.

204
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,080
Is it going to be weird that you don't like the coffee at Starbucks?

205
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,640
It's going to be weird when somebody asks you what the best one is, and you're like,

206
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,560
I love this one, and it's kind of, it tastes kind of like dirt, and it's like, it's like hot,

207
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,160
dirt water, but like in a good way. Oh, so good, with just a little,

208
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,400
there's some pumpkin in there, I think. Oh, it's so crunchy.

209
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,320
Maybe the problem is that they drink it really fast, like right when it comes out of the pot,

210
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,160
and they burn their mouth horribly every time they drink it, and so in their mind,

211
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,600
coffee is a bad, coffee hurt. Coffee hurt.

212
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,800
Coffee bad hot, and does hurt on the mouth and tongue.

213
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,600
Coffee mouth. Yeah, and I don't think they know

214
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,240
that you can let it cool down, and you can add ice to it.

215
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,800
When I see someone drink fucking like right out the air pot coffee,

216
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,840
it is like I am witnessing Superman with bullets bouncing off his chest.

217
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,160
How, how, how do you, I get coffee and say, I'm going to enjoy this in 40 minutes.

218
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,120
Yeah, right, I'll have this later. This is for later.

219
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,760
I don't want coffee now, but maybe at 10 a.m. I will.

220
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,440
You know, I'm thinking about it, and when I declared my allegiance to the country's best yogurt,

221
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,200
I couldn't really eat much of that stuff because of my stomach shame,

222
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:58,000
and there must have been times where people asked me my recs, and I had to sort of lie,

223
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,640
and just be like, well, the cinnamon swirl is good.

224
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,720
It's my favorite. I eat gallons of it. I'm, when I'm feeling bad,

225
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,720
when I'm feeling bad, I will eat a gallon of this rocky road ice cream.

226
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,800
And it definitely doesn't give me diarrhea.

227
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,000
Yeah, my favorite thing about all of this sweet cream is that it doesn't make me tummy sick.

228
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,120
I like the idea of it. Do you see me y-employee

229
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,200
that just casually mentions that their metrics are in gallons?

230
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,080
Oh, uh, uh, welcome to Madison Robbins,

231
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,880
telling you what a flavor is. What can I get you today? What do you like?

232
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,800
Well, yeah, last night I ate about a gallon of chocolate,

233
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,200
so I can highly recommend that.

234
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,680
Gonna eat a, today for lunch, gonna eat a gallon of quarterback crunch.

235
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,200
So I'm feeling pretty pumped right now.

236
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,600
Can I ask you a quick TCBY hack that I've always wondered?

237
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,280
I would love nothing more.

238
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,880
Can I just get a cup of jimmies?

239
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,400
You can.

240
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,360
I mean, is Todd working?

241
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,720
Oh, if Todd's working, go for it.

242
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,040
I'd say this, as an employee of TCBY, I can have a cup of jimmies in the back room.

243
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,840
I can eat a whole cup of jimmies in the back room

244
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,720
in the one spot where the two security cameras don't see.

245
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
And it's right by the jackets.

246
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,960
I can eat a whole thing of cheesecake top crumbles

247
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,280
right there where the jackets are because there's two cameras,

248
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,440
but they don't see right there where the jackets are.

249
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,480
So I can hang out there and I can play Nintendo DS

250
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,640
and I can eat my cheesecake crumbles in peace.

251
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,000
And that's your time.

252
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,280
And that's Griffin's time.

253
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,440
That was the country's best yogurt's best corner

254
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,280
for eating secret cheesecake bites.

255
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,840
TCBYBC.

256
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,400
You're right.

257
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,520
It's a nail place now.

258
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,520
Yeah, it's a, yeah.

259
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,680
Still that corner though.

260
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,760
Still that corner is where the secrets live.

261
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,760
I have recently picked up skateboarding mostly as a way to get around faster.

262
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,280
I don't know any tricks.

263
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
That's not really my concern.

264
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,120
That's quibble.

265
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,320
That is your concern.

266
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,400
Maybe it does not concern you.

267
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,240
It would be under the category of your concerns.

268
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,160
Who this concern belongs to.

269
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,440
It's certainly not me.

270
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,800
It's not my concern.

271
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,640
If it's anybody's, anyway.

272
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,000
However, I live in Edinburgh, which has a lot of cobbles

273
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,200
and uneven pavements.

274
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,240
And pretty much once per day, I find myself completely eating shit.

275
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,640
Worse than the actual incident is when I have to walk awkwardly

276
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,080
back to get my skateboard, which has shot meters and meters behind me.

277
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,080
Who knows how far that is.

278
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,640
Sounds far.

279
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,920
Is there any way I can make the situation look any cooler?

280
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,520
Don't tell me not to just fall.

281
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,000
That's not an option I'm willing to consider.

282
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,800
It's from McFallen in Marchmont.

283
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,960
I mean, I got a suggestion.

284
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,400
This, guys, this is wild.

285
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,320
This is like saying I have this bike and I ride it to work every day.

286
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,520
But at least once a day, one of the tires comes off and I flip over,

287
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,640
end over end, and I land on my skull every day.

288
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,880
Is there a way to make my fall look cooler?

289
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,560
And it's like, you don't, you can't use this bike.

290
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,040
Any form of transit that involves you eating shit on the daily

291
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,480
is not an acceptable way to get around, I don't think.

292
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,360
Here's what you do.

293
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,400
Here's what you do.

294
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,120
First, you're going to need like, like a boogie board has,

295
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,640
like one of those like wrist straps.

296
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,880
Maybe extra long, maybe it's very stretchy,

297
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,640
like a long rubber band so that your skateboard can shoot backwards

298
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,760
and then return to you, perhaps fast, and in a painful manner.

299
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,680
And fast and in the teeth.

300
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,000
But why, if you feel yourself start to fly off your skateboard,

301
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,400
I want you to yell, I'm so sleepy.

302
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,400
And then when you land, just pretend like you're taking a nap there.

303
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,280
Yeah, that's good.

304
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,200
So you're skateboarding and somebody's like, do a trick.

305
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,640
And you're like, ha ha, I'll do it.

306
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,080
Aw, fuck, bedtime.

307
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,720
And then you just lay there for a bit and then pop up and yawn and stretch.

308
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
And then back, back to your ride.

309
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,560
I feel good.

310
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,960
All right, I would argue, Travis, as we had a lot of fun there,

311
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,600
but that does not get your skateboard back to you.

312
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,160
In fact, I'm pretty sure it gets it stolen and you're arrested as a vagrant.

313
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,320
Maybe tape it to your feet?

314
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,440
Here's what-

315
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,200
Tape it to your feet is good.

316
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,560
You know the child leashes?

317
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
That you tape on to kids?

318
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,880
Well, you don't tape.

319
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,480
You see, you said tape, it fucks me up.

320
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,240
But you like, you like tie them to your kids and it's like your kid can run,

321
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,440
but then it's like yank and they pull them back to you.

322
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,040
That is literally what I just said.

323
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:49,760
What?

324
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,200
That's literally what Travis said.

325
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,440
Yeah, but I have a different one that I'm going to do different.

326
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,760
It's a different style.

327
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,440
Oh, okay.

328
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,400
Mine's different.

329
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:00,960
Go on.

330
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:10,800
Okay, so what if it's like that, but it's made of Twizzler?

331
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:17,440
So after you do it, you could just be like, everybody might still laugh at you,

332
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,120
but then it's like, hey, can we all enjoy this together over some Twizzlers?

333
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,440
And then maybe they would not be mad at you because you got them that Twizzler.

334
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,680
Of course, it's perfect.

335
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,080
I'll tell you what you need to do is you need to pop off those little shitty tires,

336
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,240
I mean wheels that you have on your skateboard,

337
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,080
and you gotta put on some monster truck wheels.

338
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,080
Something that can really eat those cobblestones the fuck up.

339
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,920
Because if you can't find a non-cobblestone route on your way to work,

340
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,760
then I genuinely think you need either a new foreign transit

341
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,400
or just some real monster truck tires on your skateboard.

342
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,960
And maybe get an engine on there and get that-

343
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,520
That'd be good.

344
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,800
You got to have power.

345
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,120
So four big wheels, an engine, maybe get a windshield, some seats.

346
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,560
You have to get off to the races.

347
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,920
I'll tell you what would help keep your skateboard attached to you

348
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,840
is a seat belt attaching you to the seat of the skateboard car.

349
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,800
What if you got Nissan on there somewhere?

350
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,480
Right, Nissan right on the skateboard, yeah.

351
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,640
And windshield wipers because it gets rainy.

352
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,560
Maybe, here's what you do, right?

353
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,320
Skateboard on your feet.

354
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,840
Yes, yes, of course, obviously.

355
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,160
Skateboard on your hands and on top of your head.

356
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,360
So that way, as you're tumbling, now you're just doing a handstand and skateboarding.

357
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,840
You're not-

358
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,360
No, that doesn't work?

359
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,280
I'm hearing a no from Justin.

360
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,360
Can you, can you, can you, can you hire Tony Hawk?

361
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,360
Ooh, to skate for you.

362
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,440
Y'all listen, you feel a crash coming on.

363
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,800
And you try, you can try to make it look like a trick,

364
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,200
but you make your body go into a big bush.

365
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,760
And then a bunch of teens or construction workers

366
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,720
or students walking to class are going to see you point and laugh.

367
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,000
And then Tony Hawk wearing the clothes that you were just wearing

368
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
that you put on that morning comes out of the bush.

369
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,120
And he does a whole 900 and continues the skateboard.

370
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,600
And then people think like, wow, you're so cool.

371
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,720
Or maybe after you go into the bush and people start laughing,

372
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,320
Tony Hawk just walks up to them and says,

373
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,280
hey, don't laugh, everybody falls off their skateboard.

374
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,840
Even I, Tony Hawk, have fallen off my skateboard.

375
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,520
And then they feel really bad.

376
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,240
And they think maybe we're the accident.

377
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,160
Here's one I want to, here's one you could do.

378
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,360
You listen?

379
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,200
Yeah.

380
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,600
Yeah.

381
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,200
All right, I just want to make sure because it's really good.

382
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,760
You could cover yourself.

383
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,280
I mean, really cover yourself in glow sticks

384
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,640
that you have to break to make work.

385
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,960
And then when you fall, just be like,

386
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,040
aw shit, folks, the party started.

387
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:48,880
And you'll be like, make sure to buy a Juicero.

388
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,280
That's right.

389
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,800
It's a startup promotion.

390
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,440
And they pay me to do this all around town.

391
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,680
And buy a Juicero and look by everything.

392
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,560
It's all glowing.

393
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,360
And then you can pass off the glow sticks to people

394
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,120
and we'll be like, instant party.

395
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,240
Just right there.

396
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,040
Instant party.

397
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,200
Yeah, that's good.

398
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,720
If we can invent some sort of impact sensing boom box

399
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,240
that you could also have attached to yourself

400
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,240
that when it could sense a quick shift in speed or momentum,

401
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,320
it starts playing LMFAO.

402
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,480
And then things really, really get going.

403
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,000
Yeah, this is good stuff, Justin.

404
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,560
Could we also do pinatas all over at the very least?

405
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,160
Wonderballs.

406
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,640
Wait, wait, wait.

407
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,000
Wait.

408
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,320
Smaller skateboard in your backpack.

409
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:40,880
Oh, so if you crash, you stand up, you pull, you wait.

410
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,120
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

411
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,000
I got it.

412
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,800
This will work.

413
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,440
This will work.

414
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,120
You crash.

415
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,160
You lie there until people just move on.

416
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:57,120
And then no one will still be there that saw you crash initially.

417
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:04,240
And then you stand up and pull a smaller skateboard out of your backpack

418
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,920
and loudly announce, well, time to start skateboarding for the day.

419
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
I think that could fly.

420
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
Here's what I love most about that, Justin.

421
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,560
What you are envisioning is that I, a bystander,

422
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:27,280
would see a human fly off the skateboard and then lay still.

423
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,080
After a few moments, I would go, huh, and walk away.

424
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,840
It's a cynical plan, I admit.

425
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,720
It's a little black mirror for my taste, for sure.

426
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,040
I like to believe I would help the skateboard man,

427
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,000
but I know deep down I wouldn't, and neither would you.

428
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,960
No, I just assume it was a YouTube prank.

429
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,520
You're right.

430
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,680
Uh, let's go the money zone.

431
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,920
Wow, okay.

432
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,480
I mean, romance me a little bit with it, you know?

433
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,760
Whoa!

434
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,840
Yeah, you just sounded like a businessman, like moving to the next part of the-

435
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,960
I'll do a segway.

436
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,800
Okay, yeah, good.

437
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,320
No, he wasn't riding a segway, Justin.

438
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,440
He was riding a skateboard.

439
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,280
God in heaven, Trav.

440
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,040
No, that wasn't money zone worthy?

441
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,520
No, it wasn't fucking money zone worthy, bud.

442
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,720
You have to know that, right?

443
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,200
Well, like a segway is another thing you can ride and fall on.

444
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,280
I was trying to make it work in my head, Griff.

445
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,320
I couldn't, and I couldn't.

446
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,240
I know, Jesus, I was working on it too.

447
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,560
Travis didn't let that slow him down.

448
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,760
He just went for it.

449
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,880
I was trying to make it work.

450
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,160
It's a segway, you know, which is another means of conveyance.

451
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,480
He's explaining it so much, like that's gonna save it, but it's not saving it.

452
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,520
It's making it stinkier.

453
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,560
Because you would fall on a skateboard, or you could fall on a segway.

454
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,320
I might just fade this out.

455
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,760
This might be our first fade out, not hard cut, just fade out into money zone.

456
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,240
What if we scoot on over to the money zone?

457
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,520
Yeah, what if we...

458
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,480
More, more, more, more, yeah.

459
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,040
Because this is just getting quieter and quieter.

460
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,920
I started to...

461
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,240
Bowen Branch has a special message for you.

462
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,480
Okay, folks, they want to unite the world.

463
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,440
Now, what do I mean by that?

464
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,360
It sounds a little grandiose.

465
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,840
You know, there's so few things that unite us as a world, but you know what?

466
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,760
In the night, we're all going to sleep.

467
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,400
Not Batman.

468
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,840
Not Batman.

469
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,320
Batman is sleeping, though, at some point during the day.

470
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
When does Batman sleep?

471
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,920
Yeah, I don't think so, because he's Bruce Wayne during the day, Justin.

472
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,280
That's probably why he's so cranky.

473
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,120
You'll never believe this, honey.

474
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,440
Guess who I met today in a big business meeting?

475
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,160
Who?

476
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,280
Bruce Wayne.

477
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:47,920
How was he?

478
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,280
So tired.

479
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,400
He seemed like fucking exhausted.

480
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,680
I don't know how that dude's so rich.

481
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,880
Bowen Branch makes sheets.

482
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,200
Really, really excellent sheets.

483
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Thousands of five-star reviews.

484
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,320
Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, and Fast Company are all talking about Bowen Branch.

485
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,960
The shipping, well, it's free, which is one of the lower prices

486
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,200
available to you as a consumer, and you can try them for 30 nights.

487
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,600
If you don't love them, you send them back for a refund.

488
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,840
But I doubt that you'll want to send them back.

489
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,200
There's no risk and no reason not to give them a try.

490
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,960
Coward.

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,040

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,360
My brother.

498
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,440
I'm sorry I called you a coward, everybody.

499
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,040
You're not a coward.

500
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,080
You're great.

501
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,000
Do you want a Stitch Fix ad?

502
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,040
There it comes.

503
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,000
I get the Stitch Fix every month.

504
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,080
It's a box, and inside the box is five different clothes.

505
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,320
And sometimes the clothes are pants, and sometimes they're not.

506
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,400
It changes every time.

507
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,760
And you get a stylist, and they figure out what looks good on your bod,

508
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,920
and then you get, you're gonna get it.

509
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,960
And there's a little sheet of paper, and it shows you how you could maybe dress it up

510
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,120
to look like a, you know, like a mannequin at a store.

511
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,480
You know how you see them wearing clothes.

512
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,040
You're like, man, I wish I could put something together that looks that good.

513
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,600
They send you this stuff in the box, and I've gotten so many clothes like this.

514
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,120
Do you know what they do is really neat if you've been a member there for a little while?

515
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:35,360
They'll send you outfit suggestions based on some of the new stuff you're getting,

516
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,520
combined with old stuff that they know that you bought already.

517
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,920
So like old selections that they've already sent along,

518
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,040
they'll pair with like new things, give you some new altogether outfits.

519
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,640
It's really good.

520
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,400
I really like the Stitch Fix.

521
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,240
It helps make a, you know, style attainable.

522
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,200
Even if you're like me and you don't know anything at all about anything.

523
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,520
So you just go to Stitch Fix and you just, you're going to answer some questions about your sizes,

524
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,520
what kind of styles you like, your budget.

525
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,200
And then however frequently as you want these boxes to show up,

526
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,600
your personal stylist will hand select five brand new clothing items just for you.

527
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,760
You try them on and you only pay for what you keep.

528
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,680
And shipping is free both ways.

529
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,760
So go to stitchfix.com slash my brother and get started now.

530
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,920
If you keep all five items that you receive, you will get 25% off your entire purchase.

531
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,360
That's stitchfix.com slash my brother.

532
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,080
I have a message here and it is for Elowen and it's from Emmett.

533
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,960
Emmett says, hi Smellowen.

534
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,880
Oh, right out the gate.

535
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,920
Well, that seems mean.

536
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,960
We'll see how it goes.

537
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,240
I hope hearing from the brothers is a sweet treat for your ear meat

538
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,360
as you collect little pieces of the street, which I know you do quite often.

539
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,640
You're my favorite human and a wonderful cat mom to Stacy,

540
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,720
even though he's turning purple.

541
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,360
Thanks for being a thoughtful, loving, emotionally intelligent partner.

542
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,640
Love, a good boy.

543
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,040
Okay.

544
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,160
See right there at the end, got very sweet.

545
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,520
Stacy's cat mom has got it going on.

546
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,480
Uh-huh.

547
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,120
All right.

548
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,040
She got a jumbo.

549
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,680
Oh, sorry.

550
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,360
She got an ad on the jumbo, John.

551
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:13,600
Yeah.

552
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,360
How many times can we do this song in the year 2018?

553
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,520
How many times?

554
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,360
Like through five?

555
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,760
I just want to know what the limit is before we do it.

556
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,280
I think there's a 10 reference max in 2018.

557
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,000
Hey, just read this next Jumbotron.

558
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,360
It's a message for Fidel.

559
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,320
It's from dad.

560
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,360
It says, dear Fidel, hope you're having a great big day.

561
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,400
May your chicken always be delicious and your gravy savory.

562
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,680
We'll always be there to scoop you into a family sandwich

563
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,600
or be a solid foundation that you can sit upon.

564
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,440
My love for you is only surpassed by my love for mom.

565
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:51,760
Burn.

566
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,200
Happy birthday, Fidel.

567
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,840
And to more adventures with Kelsey and I.

568
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,800
Love, dad.

569
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,480
This is all time best.

570
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,760
First of all, it was for January.

571
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,560
Sorry, we fucked up.

572
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,320
But holy fucking shit.

573
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,720
Your dad burned you to the ground, Fidel.

574
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,320
I mean, may your gravy always be savory.

575
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,120
The first line, y'all, hope you're having a great big day.

576
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,560
I don't know what that means, but it's so fucking good, Fidel's dad.

577
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,160
Scoop him into a family sandwich.

578
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:18,960
Yes, please.

579
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,480
A solid foundation you can sit upon.

580
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,360
Oh, so nice.

581
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,880
Also, I love your mom more than you.

582
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,240
Awesome.

583
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,640
I know.

584
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,200
Awesome.

585
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,840
Sorry, fool.

586
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,720
Knew her longer.

587
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,760
Anyway, that stems the breaks.

588
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,280
Without her, there is no use.

589
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,720
I have to like her more.

590
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,160
I can make more use with her.

591
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,680
So whatevs.

592
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,480
Whatevs, dude.

593
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,920
Here's a message for Kat, and it's from Max, who says, hello, my love.

594
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,360
I hope all is going well for you.

595
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,680
I mean, I should know since we live together now.

596
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,200
These past five years just keep getting better and better.

597
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,520
I can't wait to see what you do next, whether it's in entertainment, breath work,

598
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,280
or something I can't even imagine.

599
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,480
Like breath work for me.

600
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,240
You're unbelievable and make me smile every day.

601
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,040
I loaf you.

602
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,600
I loaf you.

603
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,600
I'm just going to go ahead and look at what breath work is.

604
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,160
I think it's like when people breathe.

605
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,080
It's like breathing therapy.

606
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,440
Yeah, that's good stuff.

607
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:15,940
Great.

608
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,320
Yeah, I hope things are also going well for you, Kat.

609
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:27,040
And maybe let's just take this moment in Kat's name to just like do a quick one,

610
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,320
a quick long breath.

611
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,720
It's nice to give listeners permission.

612
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,760
You don't have to make it a joke.

613
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,600
It doesn't have to be a joke.

614
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,880
I learned this on Daniel Tiger.

615
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,160
He said to do this every minute.

616
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,720
Podcasts.

617
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,520
Podcasts.

618
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,240
Podcasts.

619
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,480
There are audio programs that tell smart stories in innovative ways.

620
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,840
Using editing techniques like this, like this, like this, like this, but let's face it,

621
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,400
all that smart stuff can be exhausting.

622
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,800
That's where Stop Podcasting Yourself comes in.

623
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,240
It's so stupid.

624
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,400
It's just two stupid dinguses being dumb idiot jerks for 90 minutes.

625
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,800
Stop Podcasting Yourself.

626
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,600
The stupid show that smart people love.

627
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,400
Find it on iTunes or Maximumfun.org.

628
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,400
What?

629
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,400
I said, did you hear me?

630
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:28,400
I've never heard, what is this confused filter you've put on your guitar?

631
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,400
I want to munch.

632
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Squad.

633
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,040
I want to munch.

634
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,520
Squad.

635
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,920
This is a short one.

636
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,280
Just kind of got out of my skin.

637
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,640
Chipotle to start testing bacon in September.

638
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,440
Fuck, I guess my question about this, we're going to get into it,

639
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,960
but where the fuck does Chipotle get off testing bacon?

640
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,480
Don't test bacon.

641
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,000
Well, I have two immediate thoughts about that.

642
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,080
First, I think Chipotle should maybe focus on really sticking the landing

643
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,840
on all their current ingredients,

644
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,680
vis-a-vis not making it make people shit themselves to death.

645
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,880
Like maybe lock those down.

646
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,440
Experiment with not poisoning.

647
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:28,160
Yeah, experiment with not mass poison the biggest attack on our country in decades,

648
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,040
but also like maybe this is why they have to test the bacon out.

649
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,600
Maybe they started doing the bacon and people started getting poisoned

650
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,280
and they were like, I don't know, guys, maybe it's us.

651
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,560
You know, this is the same chain that made a bunch of people butt sick,

652
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,240
and then they're like, this is amazing.

653
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,240
This is amazing, Chipotle.

654
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,280
What are you going to do next?

655
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,680
They're like, cheese sauce.

656
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,480
Read it and weep.

657
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,320
That's where we're at right now.

658
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,520
Chipotle's first big menu test in CEO Brian Nichol's tenure.

659
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,040
Brian Nichol must be a new CEO that is against poisoning people.

660
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,480
Shane announced August 9th it's piloting two new menu items

661
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,800
and promotions in select cities nationwide, et cetera, et cetera.

662
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,360
The first of these efforts is Applewood smoked bacon.

663
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,520
Chipotle said the product received a, quote,

664
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:26,000
tremendous response from customers at its next kitchen in New York City.

665
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,080
Sort of like a test kitchen, I guess, up there.

666
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,580
Sure.

667
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:34,000
This September, bacon will expand to an eight restaurant operations test

668
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,440
in Orange County, California before being considered for a full market test.

669
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,680
Here's what Chris Brandt, the chief marketing officer, has to say in a release.

670
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,680
Customers have always said everything tastes better with bacon,

671
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,360
and that's exactly what we confirmed in our New York test kitchen.

672
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,680
No fucking shit, Chris.

673
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,720
Yeah, dog.

674
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,920
Also, sky is blue, sun is hot.

675
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,960
We found customers added bacon to their traditional bowls,

676
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,200
burritos, tacos, and nachos.

677
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200
Hey, Chris, if you give them a handful,

678
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,920
they would have added it to their Diet Coke, okay?

679
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,360
That's bacon.

680
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,760
And also they enjoyed new items such as the BLT quesadilla

681
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,840
with bacon, lettuce, tomato, top three ingredients.

682
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,880
I love it at BLT.

683
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,440
So totally craveable.

684
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,680
And grilled and cheese grilled to perfection.

685
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,720
Quesadillas are currently only available in the next kitchen, Chipotle added.

686
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
I can't wait before you get too excited.

687
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,160
That seems like the bigger announcement.

688
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,840
Yeah, I know I'm talking a lot about quesadillas right now,

689
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,680
but they are out of your reach.

690
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,440
We don't offer them, and I'm really sorry.

691
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,560
Right after that, they're going to go with nachos.

692
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,400
Nice.

693
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,360
Hey, Chipotle.

694
00:42:53,360 --> 00:43:00,320
Why, why are you testing these things that will work?

695
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,960
Do you know what place has nachos?

696
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,440
Pretty much every place.

697
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,480
You know why?

698
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,880
Because they're pretty good and hard to fuck up.

699
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,960
Like, you don't need to test it.

700
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,920
Just do it.

701
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,400
If you want to put bacon on there, people want it.

702
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,520
Just put bacon on there.

703
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,560
It's fine.

704
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,040
But they're going to have, you know,

705
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,200
head chef Daniel Simpson at the kitchen.

706
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,680
He's like, let's get some tortilla chips.

707
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,800
Let's get some cheese.

708
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,760
Let's get some meat.

709
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,800
Let's have some lettuce.

710
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,760
Let's have some poison.

711
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,800
Time to put tomato.

712
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,360
Time to-

713
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:31,840
Oh, no.

714
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,720
I did it again.

715
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,120
Why do we keep the poison right next to the tomatoes?

716
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:43,040
Here's a little sub announcement they snuck in here.

717
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:53,440
Through September 20th, customers at participating Miami and Dallas locations can now get $2 tacos

718
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,000
with the purchase of any drink after 8 p.m.

719
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,720
These restaurants will also stay open later until 11 p.m.

720
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:10,640
to, quote, satisfy demand for food experiences outside of standard business hours.

721
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,280
Hey, does this franchise know how to party or what?

722
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:20,880
They are so fucking afraid to run afoul of anybody at this point.

723
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,960
What I love is that Taco Bell's like, what's up, doobie heads?

724
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,280
Come eat our trash food at 4 a.m.

725
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,400
Fuck the police.

726
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,720
And Chipotle can't-

727
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,840
Chipotle's your fucking RA who's like, we're up to 11.

728
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,320
Good job.

729
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,400
We're going to have marshmallows.

730
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:43,680
You're going to have a $2 taco experience outside the normal business hours.

731
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,840
Make sure you buy a drink.

732
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,960
Meanwhile, Taco Bell is like robbing the Wendy's next door, like kicking in the door

733
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,720
and stealing their money for weed.

734
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,920
I thought we'd get a little wild tonight and maybe at 10 30 p.m.

735
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,200
we'll put a handful of bacon on those nachos.

736
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,720
Just something new, a little risque.

737
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,120
Oh my, oh my.

738
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:09,760
So anyway-

739
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,480
This is a good one.

740
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,960
I have a quick, can I ask you guys a quick question?

741
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:16,880
Uh, sure.

742
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,920
Just, uh, real quick.

743
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,200
Travis, you look.

744
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:19,440
Uh-huh.

745
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,840
Just, uh-

746
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,640
Just say the riddle.

747
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,760
Just start doing the riddle.

748
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:30,080
I guess I was just wondering, I'm like a dog with a tail that wags and all,

749
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,680
but I am not a dog.

750
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,120
What am I?

751
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,880
Yeah, I mean, dog's the only one with tails, so shit.

752
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,800
Ah, what am I?

753
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:40,400
What?

754
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,400
I am a puppy.

755
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,000
That's pretty good, yeah.

756
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,360
So like, got you.

757
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,880
Very good, very good.

758
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,760
That's a good riddle.

759
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,320
Here's one.

760
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:57,920
Uh, current score on this one is 490 upvotes, 1379 downvotes.

761
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,920
What can be heard and caught, but never seen?

762
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,880
Hmm.

763
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,080
Hmm.

764
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,840
What can be heard and caught, but never seen?

765
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,280
A cold?

766
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,400
Hmm, interesting.

767
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,440
Griffin, do you have a guess?

768
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,440
A butterfly?

769
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,560
It's a remark.

770
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:22,000
You can't see a remark, I guess, is one thing.

771
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Okay.

772
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,680
Like many spoken things, you can't see a remark.

773
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,400
Can't see it.

774
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,280
So like, any spoken thing, really?

775
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,800
Pretty much anything you would say.

776
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,720
I guess any audible thing, too.

777
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:42,160
Like, yeah, like any, pretty much any audible thing, I guess.

778
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,160
The sound of a bell, perhaps.

779
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,480
Um, all right, I'm done.

780
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,000
This is a new Yahoo.

781
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,360
I'm reading Yahoo now.

782
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,120
Okay, bring us a new Yahoo.

783
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,720
I just have to say one more thing.

784
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,240
I pass before the sun, yet make no shadow.

785
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:58,960
What am I?

786
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,480
The wind.

787
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,800
I'm pretty sure that's not accurate.

788
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:12,320
I have to give Phil 9 here, but I'm pretty sure none of that makes any fucking sense.

789
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,240
All right, S. Kirby sent this one in.

790
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:16,720
Thank you.

791
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,320
It's Yahoo Answers user Megan who asks, and maybe this is a riddle.

792
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,000
Which soda stains car seats the worst?

793
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,960
The car seats are light gray, and I want to mess them up.

794
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,720
This is not to avoid.

795
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,360
This is-

796
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:35,860
Oh!

797
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,240
I see.

798
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,440
Yeah, I want to mess these gray seats up with some soda.

799
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,720
So how do I stain these bad boys up with the most stain worthy soda?

800
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,920
Hawaiian punch?

801
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,720
Do they still-

802
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,640
Can you get Hawaiian punch in a drive-thru?

803
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,120
I mean, maybe, but it's not a soda.

804
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,720
And the fact that it was ever available in that context is wild.

805
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,800
Frankly, then it's Mountain Dew Code Red.

806
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,280
You think Mountain Dew Code Red is highly stainable?

807
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:05,360
Well, it's got the dye in it, because it's not a natural red, friend.

808
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,320
It's a good point.

809
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:11,520
If you use like a brown, that could almost look distressed.

810
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:17,040
If the person had like a talented hand in the cleaning up of it, it could just look like character.

811
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:23,760
Whereas like Hawaiian punch definitely is going to look like red, just red.

812
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,240
Very obvious.

813
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,000
But the brown could also look like dookie.

814
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,560
And that's it.

815
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,040
What's up?

816
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,680
We got to talk about what's the worst stain.

817
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:37,760
Because if they make sort of an opaque white soda that you can put all over the seat,

818
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,760
I think you know where I'm going with this one.

819
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,260
Come.

820
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,800
Do you know what I mean?

821
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:51,120
And if they make an opaque white soda, and I'm thinking about it, what this would be,

822
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:51,600
and you spill this-

823
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,160
Like squirt.

824
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,240
Yeah, squirt might work, and you spill this all over the back seat, but like a huge amount,

825
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,800
then it's going to look like a truly just epic amount of jizz.

826
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,160
I would say squirt is probably going to stain the most.

827
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,000
Unavailable in any context.

828
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,440
That's also fair.

829
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,800
Here's what I would suggest.

830
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,520
Can you read the question again?

831
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,520
Are we going through a drive-through in this one?

832
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,960
Which soda stains car seat?

833
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,600
Nah, baby.

834
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,840
World's our oyster.

835
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:26,400
It sounds like this is maybe some kind of fun prank or terrible prank on an enemy.

836
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,920
I would say way more disturbing to me is if you found a way to just-

837
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,200
One, also let me tell you this.

838
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,800
Don't Google squirt to try to find out what color squirt is.

839
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,200
Bad.

840
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:37,840
Bad, bad, bad.

841
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,400
Bad, bad, bad.

842
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,920
It's not a good word on the internet.

843
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,480
Yeah.

844
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,680
Just the word squirt?

845
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,560
Just the word squirt.

846
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:50,560
But what I will say is if I periodically went out to my car to find that not only was there

847
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:55,920
a spill in my car, but a spill that stayed wet no matter how much I dried it or how long

848
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,160
it sat there, that would bother me the most.

849
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:03,360
So you're going to have to like just repeatedly pour soda on the seat until the person gets

850
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,400
rid of the car.

851
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,400
I just, we got to take a brief aside.

852
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,800
Because if you Google the word squirt-

853
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,520
Griffin, I told you not to.

854
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,160
No, I did.

855
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,960
It is mostly pornography on the front page.

856
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,240
And it's like, what if a child is looking for a new super soaker, but they get anxious

857
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,280
and they get overeager and they don't fill out the whole phrase.

858
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,000
And they do that.

859
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,800
Has the word squirt really just sort of-

860
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,360
It's gone.

861
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,720
Has the word squirt is just-

862
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,400
It's gone away.

863
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,040
I've never really seen a word go before.

864
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:40,000
Whoever is like the PR manager for squirt, whoever's supposed to be getting the word

865
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,400
out needs to do some brand management online to try to get that higher up on those search

866
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:46,560
results.

867
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:51,360
The weird thing about it is though, and this is very rare, I think in language, but if

868
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,120
you add gun, it gets a lot more kid friendly.

869
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,200
I don't know how many things you can say that about, honestly.

870
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,320
Squirt soda is not even on the first page of results.

871
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:02,880
It's not.

872
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,720
Yeah, no, it's all, all, all, all, all of it, all of it, all of it.

873
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:12,960
Coke black has not existed since OTT5 or OTT6, but that has to be-

874
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,320
It's up there.

875
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:20,880
Through history, one of the most highly staining sodas because it is like half coffee, half

876
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,280
Coke.

877
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,600
Should I buy an empty bottle of it on eBay?

878
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,440
The shrink wrap is like-

879
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:28,960
It's empty?

880
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,520
It's empty?

881
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,560
Yeah, but the shrink wrap, it's like, it looks really nice.

882
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:34,560
No.

883
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,040
No.

884
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:35,680
$12.99.

885
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,960
Yeah, but-

886
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,200
No.

887
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,280
Yeah, no, that's not a good thing to put money on.

888
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,320
Yeah, no, that's a good point.

889
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,680
I just wish it was full of Coke black because I love some of that wonderful stuff.

890
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,160
Coke black would probably stain a lot.

891
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,360
I feel like full sugar root beer would be very bad.

892
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,080
I'll tell you what's going to really get us there.

893
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:56,640
You know, Jones soda, they don't abide by the fucking laws that the rest of the soda

894
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,280
companies have.

895
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,600
You know, Jones soda has like a cummy soda for sure.

896
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:07,440
Why is it even so narrowly focused?

897
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,400
It's just the wildest-

898
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,040
It's really, it's just amazing to me how Griffin is quickly going back and forth between judging

899
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,680
the internet for taking the word squirt, but also is obsessed with finding the cummiest

900
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,240
soda.

901
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,360
It's just the, it's the wildest stain, isn't it?

902
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,440
Orbits?

903
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,640
Orbits.

904
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,000
Orbits would be good.

905
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,280
It's got chunks.

906
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,880
It's got chunks right in it.

907
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,880
Are there any sodas that you would be happy?

908
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,840
I think if someone spilled crystal Pepsi-

909
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,400
Well, cause they have it, then they would have some.

910
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,240
Yeah, then I could have some of it.

911
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,200
But it's back.

912
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,560
It's back in effect.

913
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,240
Do they make a soda where if I spill the cummy Jones soda in the back seat and get the funny

914
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,000
stain back there, but it lowers the resale value of my car.

915
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,680
And then if I spill, is there another soda I can spill on it that'll clean it up?

916
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,080
Like one that has like some-

917
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,920
Oh, I see what you're saying.

918
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:02,960
Yeah, it'll-

919
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,000
Club soda.

920
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,040
Like an oxy-clean soda, which again, Jones soda might make.

921
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,440
Those guys are fucking out of their gourds.

922
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,720
I do have to say again, club soda, please do not add us.

923
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,440
Okay, thank you.

924
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:16,880
Club soda.

925
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,400
You remove stains with club soda.

926
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,280
It's not funny, but it's a thing that I think people would have said to us on Twitter.

927
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:21,760
No, you're right.

928
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,320
You're right.

929
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:22,880
You're right.

930
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,400
You're right.

931
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,360
I don't think it's going to be power enough to get rid of all these cummy stains.

932
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,160
They're pretty deep in there.

933
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,520
Let's see.

934
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,080
Just like a Jackson Pollock painting back there.

935
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,040
Yeah, great.

936
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,880
Ah, fully so good.

937
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,400
Folks, we've so appreciated your patronage here at my brother, my brother, me farms.

938
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,000
We hope you enjoyed yourself.

939
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,960
And we hope that you're taking care of yourself and everybody around you that is within your

940
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,480
power to take care of.

941
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,240
You want to go see Schmaners at the London Pod Festival?

942
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,360
You can.

943
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,280
That's going to be happening.

944
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,680
That's a great picture, Trav.

945
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,040
Hey, thank you.

946
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,000
Who did that picture?

947
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,960
I don't remember off the top of my head.

948
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,440
It's great.

949
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:08,640
Thank you.

950
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,000
You can get tickets for that at bit.ly slash schmanerslondon.

951
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:12,240
Yeah.

952
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,000
And there's also a Cush show happening next month.

953
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,120
Bit.ly forward slash Cush September.

954
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,040
That was the sound of three S's.

955
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,480
Yeah, Cush September 2018.

956
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,200
Who's going to be at that?

957
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,040
Well, I can't tell you because that's the whole thing, but I can tell you it is

958
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,760
maybe my favorite lineup so far.

959
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,720
Don't do that.

960
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,320
It's going to make people feel inferior.

961
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,640
Well, it's really great.

962
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,720
It's one of my favorite lineups of all time.

963
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,520
All right, great.

964
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,920
I launched a new podcast last week.

965
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:49,200
It's called Positivatini and it's messages of hope, inspiration, and joy in 10 minutes

966
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:49,680
or less.

967
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:55,760
It's me and Amy Dallen and Erika Ishii and it's just like, you know, short episodes

968
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:01,360
every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to start the day off with some like positive energy.

969
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,040
Positivatini.

00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:01,280

1020
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,400
queer issues, race, politics, and pop culture.

Learn, laugh, and play.

1025
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,920
All from a perspective that's black, queer, and ladylike.

1026
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,240
Because nobody puts minorities in the corner.

1027
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,680
Every Friday.
