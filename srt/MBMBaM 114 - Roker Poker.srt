1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:46,880
Guys. Guys.

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,280
What? Are you guys there?

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,120
Yes, we're here. This is it. This is the show.

8
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,080
Did you hear the news? What's that? What's the news?

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:04,080
I don't know how it happened, because science hasn't explained it yet, but Al Roker can see

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,640
into the future. What?

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,920
He is a prognosticator. He is a Gautama man. He's a modern day Nostradamus, except with more

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,800
fluctuating weight patterns. Right?

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
He can see into the future. He's like-

14
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,280
What are you baiting, Griffin? What are you basing this on?

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,920
He's like the living version of the Almanac book from Back to the Future,

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,520
because he knows the living- According to what? He's like the living, eating version

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,240
of the Almanac. If the book was a man.

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,640
It's like he's eating Back to the Future.

19
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,960
So, have you guys watched the Today Show lately? I know you have.

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,080
I'm there every day. I turn it on at 6 a.m. I'm like, Hoda, Kathy Lee, I'll check you soon,

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,760
but right now I'm Lowers. I'm all Lowers. Lowers putting some flavor.

22
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,400
You know what I call them? You know what I call them? I call them Lowers hours.

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,920
Yeah. Those are my Lowers hours.

24
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,560
Those are your Lowers hours when you play Roker Poker,

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,720
which is when you masturbate while watching out Roker.

26
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,400
So, anyway, while you're there, you're playing Roker Poker,

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,080
he tells you what's going to happen at the Olympics that day. He knows it.

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,240
He knows it. He saw it.

29
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,920
If there was any market for betting on the Olympics, this man would be rich.

30
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,360
He has. He has.

31
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,960
Hey, people, why haven't Bookie stepped up and worked out, I don't know,

32
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,600
some kind of gambling on the Olympics or something?

33
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:33,520
He possesses the site, and it's not very handy except for every even numbered year,

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,200
I guess, but it's better than nothing. I don't have the site for shit.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,440
And honestly, let's be honest, about half of those are some games that nobody really cares about.

36
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,520
Because you know why you don't care about the Winter Olympics?

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,440
Because you don't get to see all the beautiful, all the heavenly bodies, you know?

38
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,160
Mm-hmm. Like, that's the problem with the Winter Olympics is everybody's so frumpy.

39
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,240
Yeah, it's like, hey, Curling, let's see that. Let's see those glutes. Get them out.

40
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,360
I don't want it. It's not for sex. I just want to admire the glutes.

41
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,720
Yeah, it's not a sexual thing.

42
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,760
It's not a sexual thing at all. I promise you, I just appreciate a good muscle,

43
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,000
and you got two of them down there. So let's peep those.

44
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,680
Let's get that out.

45
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,440
I was playing Roker Poker, and now these glutes are in front of me, but fuck it. Let's keep it going.

46
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:22,320
I'm really enjoying the coverage that shows me the workout routines of the Olympic athletes,

47
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,040
because I can't be motivated to do regular exercise, and now you're going to rub it in

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,320
my face with the world's most physically fit people are doing, as if I'm going to go to that

49
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,080
level. That's what I'm going to do.

50
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,680
I enjoy the coverage that they're doing where they show things that happened at previous Olympics

51
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,560
that were just huge and epic, like Keri Strug landing her vault and everything, and amazing

52
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,160
moments, and then comparing the current Olympians to them. So not only do I get to feel the pressure

53
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,880
of being compared to the current Olympians, but then they also get to feel bad, because they're

54
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,120
not as cool as people that competed 12 years ago.

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,920
It really is horse shit. You can't show the miracle on ice and then cut over to that bad

56
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,000
mitten game that the South Korean team threw. You can't go from miracle on ice to the uh-oh

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,400
with a shuttlecock. Did anybody else know that there was a bad mitten world federation?

58
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,640
Yeah, it's one guy who's never had to do anything in his life, and then they came to him like,

59
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,040
listen, this is the most important decision you'll ever make in your entire life.

60
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,000
And he looked up from his bowl of ramen noodles, and he said, listen to the words I'm about to

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,720
say, because they're going to be very important. This sport is kids play horse shit. We call the

62
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,560
thing you hit a shuttlecock because of how fucking stupid it is. You can't expect me to

63
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:56,080
take it seriously, because nobody else is going to. It's called bad mitten. Nobody fucking cares.

64
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,560
It sucks. Do you think there was any kind of convincing that had to happen to get them to

65
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,920
throw the games, or do you think it was like, I need you to- yeah, you got it.

66
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,960
Yeah, we want you to not- You didn't even hear my pitch. No, I don't care.

67
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,080
Here's what we want you to do. We want you to not play bad mitten.

68
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,360
I'm afforded that option every day, and you know what? I jump at it.

69
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,760
What do you get? What kind of sponsorships are you hoping to land if you gold in bad mitten?

70
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:29,040
Oh man, you get the fly leaf. They make the best shuttlecocks. They're very aerodynamic.

71
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,800
They actually had to outlaw them in this, because last year everybody was breaking all of the

72
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,280
bad mitten world records. Yeah, bad mitten so far.

73
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,000
And then one time somebody hit a shuttlecock so hard it went through a guy. It just went through

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,440
his chest, and they had to cancel fly leaf shuttlecocks. And it didn't kill him. It buried

75
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,120
halfway through. He still lives with it to this day. Yeah, it's really horrifying. It powers a

76
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,040
mechanical suit. He's become a bit of a mascot, actually. His friends make him lie on the floor,

77
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,160
and they put Cheetos in it. And then if he sneezes real hard, they all fly out,

78
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,840
and it's a great game for everyone. Do you guys think that right after the Olympics,

79
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,720
all the Olympians get together and just have a fucking Cheetos jamboree? They're like,

80
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:17,520
fuck it. Michael Phelps is done. He's won 22 Olympic medals, and he said he's never competing

81
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,120
again. That dude has got to be on a fucking combos spree right now. He's got to be filling those

82
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,880
bugles with that whiz, and he has got to be living right. Travis pointed out, but I do have to ask,

83
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:40,640
it's got to just turn into an orgy usually, right? You have a city full of the most physically fit

84
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,840
humans in the world, and you've got them in cramped quarters. And they're all riding the

85
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,080
highest testosterone. Yeah, right. You've got the drama. They're all coming down off the highest

86
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:00,080
endorphin high of competing and winning in front of an international landscape. It's got to be like,

87
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,000
okay, so it's time to fuck. When you have 22 pieces of precious, precious metal hanging

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,760
around your neck, and you're out on the town in London surrounded by attractive people,

89
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:17,600
when you have that much dÃ©colletage, all you're thinking about is, I know I'm getting fucked

90
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,760
tonight. Michael Phelps is getting fucked tonight. There's a one in 22 chance that I'm

91
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,360
getting boned tonight. Yeah, and Michael Phelps will fuck anything. If you slow to a trot in front

92
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,880
of Michael Phelps, he will fuck you. And don't jump in the water thinking that it's like hornets.

93
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,800
He's going to get you in the water. He is not machine gun fire. He can get you up in there.

94
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,360
He will get you up in the water, and I do want to be clear. It will be consensual.

95
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,200
If you get within a few feet of him, the way his pheromones mixed with chlorine is utterly

96
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,160
intoxicating, at least that's what I told my wife. Web fingers attached to his 10 foot long arms

97
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,560
will caress your cheek in such a way that you can't say no. You see him coming down the street

98
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,680
with his metal, and you say, oh, it's just one metal, but then they fan out like the acid

99
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,440
spitting dinosaur from Jurassic Park. All 22 of them just sort of fan out, and you swoon,

100
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,360
and then you poon. Now, I do want to warn you about Michael Phelps. He's been training so hard

101
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,720
that he has lost the use of the English language, so he will look directly in your eyes and say,

102
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Phelps... Phelps... inside. Phelps... inside. Please take Phelps inside. No more water.

103
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,720
I'm sorry, Phelps clammy skin.

104
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,720
It's dry up here.

105
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,720
Phelps cold.

106
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Can you keep Phelps warm?

107
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,720
To be fair, Phelps does love Chunk.

108
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Yeah, sure.

109
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,720
This feels good on Phelps tummy fin.

110
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,720
That's what his penis has to be for him, right?

111
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Another piece of drag, right?

112
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Another thing to shave a few hundros off the old time.

113
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,720
Phelps is smooth down there like G.I. Joe.

114
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,720
We can all agree that Phelps is probably a more tender lover than Ryan Lochte, right?

115
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,720
I think so.

116
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,720
Ryan Lochte is high on winning.

117
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Michael Phelps has been through this before.

118
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,720
He knows how it ends.

119
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
He wants you to win.

120
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
He wants you to win now, Ryan.

121
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
It's your time to shine.

122
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,720
No, he wants you to win sexually.

123
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Oh, sexually.

124
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,720
He wants you to take home the sexual gold.

125
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Hey, this is my brother, my brother and me.

126
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
It's an advice show for the modern era.

127
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

128
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy.

129
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

130
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,720
That was the longest lead-in I think we've ever...

131
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,720
That was 10 advice-free minutes for the folks at home.

132
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,720
Yeah, guaranteed.

133
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,720
And now I want to record an R&B album called Sexual Gold.

134
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
Can we sing the...

135
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,720
Oh, baby.

136
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,720
It's a complete spoken word album.

137
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,720
I'm Michael Phelps.

138
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
You know what?

139
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
We've piddled enough.

140
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,720
Let's get into the advice.

141
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:35,720
I really want to take a swing dance class with my boyfriend, but he is vehemently opposed to the idea.

142
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,720
I mean vehemently opposed to the idea.

143
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,720
I'm sure it's because he's embarrassed or afraid to look stupid or uncoordinated in public.

144
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,720
How can I convince him to get over his fear of looking silly and dance with me?

145
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,720
And that's from dancing by myself.

146
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Well, the good news is because it's swing dancing, there's all but two people look uncoordinated doing it.

147
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,720
And those two people are busy filming movie set in the 1940s.

148
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
Right.

149
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
I have to warn you something.

150
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:16,720
Since the year, let's call it 1949, and every year past that, if you see two people swing dancing at a public event, everyone since 1949 has had the same thought.

151
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
These fucking people.

152
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,720
That's what everybody thinks when you swing dance in front of them.

153
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,720
And that would be my only problem with swing dancing classes.

154
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
It might actually be kind of fun to take the class.

155
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,720
It probably would be super fun.

156
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,720
But you know, like, Cherry Pop and Daddies are going to come on at the wedding and you're going to have a look.

157
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
You just touched on it.

158
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,720
I feel, John Favreau has done a lot of things to help this country.

159
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,720
But that fucking scene from Swingers is not one of them.

160
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:49,720
It's, I feel like that scene from fucking Swingers let an entire generation of people who saw the movie Swingers were like,

161
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,720
I want that.

162
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,720
If I dance good like that, then Heather Graham will like me.

163
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
But she won't.

164
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
She can't.

165
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
You don't know her.

166
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
She doesn't have emotion.

167
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
She doesn't have emotions either.

168
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,720
I also think that my other problem with swing dancing is that no one has ever started swing dancing and anyone's thought,

169
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
I bet they can just naturally do that.

170
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
No, that's the problem.

171
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,720
They know you've been prepping to like impress them for a long time.

172
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,720
And then it's like, oh, man.

173
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,720
You're going from like, if you do that shit at a wedding or something like that, fuck you.

174
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,720
Like, because it's their special day, not yours.

175
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,720
And when you swing dance at a wedding, like you're not just having fun.

176
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,720
You're performing.

177
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
This is a show.

178
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Unless you're in the hit musical Swing, you should not take swing dancing.

179
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,720
Even then, like you can stand on the stage and be like, no, guys, it just feels a little pretentious.

180
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Now we need to, now we need to help the person.

181
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
This is me helping.

182
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
This is me helping.

183
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
You're backing up the guy though.

184
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
The guy didn't write in.

185
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
Well, OK, well, let me say this.

186
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,720
This is helpful advice to tell your boyfriend.

187
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,720
The point of a class is for people who don't know how to do it to show up.

188
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Like if his worry is looking stupid and uncoordinated and not being able to do the thing, that's why you go to a class.

189
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,720
That's a sweet, sweet, sweet world that you live in, Travis.

190
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
But that is not the truth.

191
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,720
You think that if somebody, here's how it works, Travis.

192
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,720
And this is a great, this is a great example of this sort of scenario, like would be perfect for this happening.

193
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Is somebody goes to a swing dancing class and they spend two years getting their swing dancing so right.

194
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,720
And then they get out of swing dancing class and like, well, shit, now I have no place to swing dance.

195
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:38,720
I know I'll go back to the beginner level swing dancing class and make people think like I'm some sort of fucking zoot suit daddy prodigy.

196
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Well, then that person should like test into swing dance six.

197
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
They shouldn't be back in swing dance one.

198
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Yeah.

199
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Looking beginner Charlie, make him look stupid.

200
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,720
That person no longer wants to learn the art of the swing.

201
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
They just want to get. Oh, now he's a swing hustler.

202
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
He's a fucking swing hustler.

203
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
He just wants to get his rocks off.

204
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
He just wants to make swing bets.

205
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,720
And like, I bet I can throw this girl between my legs and catch her.

206
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
No way, dude.

207
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
This is beginner swing.

208
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
And then he does it and dudes out 20 bucks.

209
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
Right.

210
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,720
Hey, I bet you can't swing.

211
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Oh, you're right. I don't swing very well.

212
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Do you want to have a swing off?

213
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,720
And then it's like swing, swing, swing, swing, hustle.

214
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,720
And then it's like your wife is mine now.

215
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,720
And you see that more and more every day since swingers came out.

216
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,720
It's suddenly everybody's swinging everywhere.

217
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,720
Well, no, just me.

218
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
That's not not exactly.

219
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,720
I mean, swingers did come out like, like a year and a half ago tops.

220
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
So it really is.

221
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,720
It's really still pretty hot.

222
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,720
I am having a hard time with this because I don't think I myself would.

223
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,720
It's just such an ostentatious thing to learn.

224
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
That's my problem.

225
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Here's the thing.

226
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,720
I was in a couple musicals in which I learned to swing dance and it is incredibly fun.

227
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Like there's a reason it looks fun and it's because it is.

228
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,720
And it but but it's fun for you and your partner.

229
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
It's not fun for anybody else.

230
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
But fuck them.

231
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,720
As long as they give you a wide nose circles that when you lift her up and she does that thing where she kicks backwards, she doesn't knock anyone out.

232
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,720
You're good.

233
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
That's the real problem.

234
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Have you considered the legal ramifications of swing dancing?

235
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Have you considered how how the first time you like your fluffy skirt like spins around and lacerate someone's red?

236
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Yeah. Have you considered how you're going to deal with those?

237
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,720
When you swing or like when it picks you up and your skirt falls down and like, oh, there's her butt.

238
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Yeah. It's awkward.

239
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Now, Travis, do you know what legal do you know what legal things are?

240
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
Because that's not technically against the law.

241
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
Everyone can see her legal briefs.

242
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,720
Yeah, sure. That's gross.

243
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:48,720
When you swing dance with somebody and they are the the passive, the more passive person of the swing dance.

244
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
They're the sub.

245
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,720
They are basically you are turning them into fucking human nunchucks.

246
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,720
And like, you're not ready for that kind of level of power or responsibility.

247
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
But no, have fun.

248
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
But have fun. Really enjoy.

249
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Have fun. Really get up in there.

250
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

251
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
Yes.

252
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,720
We've never turned a question on somebody like that before.

253
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,720
But I guess if somebody wrote in and was like, hey, I'm thinking about like eating poison, but my boyfriend says not to.

254
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
We would probably come down on the same side.

255
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
I guess I like that.

256
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
All I'm getting at.

257
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:35,720
And and this is sort of the the maybe the more practical, you know, side of this advice is that if it's not something that both of you are excited to do, there's like so many different things.

258
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,720
I mean, there's so many other things to do.

259
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,720
And if he's not excited about it, I mean, you could try to you could try to badger him into it and you would win eventually.

260
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:52,720
But you is that you could always trade off of like one of these classes with you.

261
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,720
And then I'll go to and I'll finally do that gross whipped cream thing that you want me to do.

262
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Like that's where you put the nozzle for the can of whipped cream, like in your butt.

263
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
And then you empty the entire can in there.

264
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,720
You just shoot it all up in there.

265
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
It's called a squeaky Greg.

266
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,720
Why does he want to give you a squeaky Greg?

267
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,720
It's 2012. Those are illegal.

268
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,720
In most states, not in every state.

269
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
It's illegal to give you.

270
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,720
Well, that's the that's part of the trip he wants to with.

271
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,720
He wants to whisk you away to Delaware or squeaky Greggs are still street legal.

272
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
It's great. It's only it's only.

273
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,720
Baby, you've got to see the trees up there and oh, we'll get some cider.

274
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,720
You're going to love it.

275
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
Hey, pack the ready whip.

276
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Just pack the ready whip in case we like want to put it on the cider or you know what?

277
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
We can probably buy some cans there.

278
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,720
Yeah. And I do mean some cans.

279
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
Yeah. Please.

280
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
Yeah. Yeah.

281
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Don't get it twisted.

282
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:52,720
If there is only one can, we'll have to we'll have to search out some old other some old general storage or something.

283
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
But hey, you know what?

284
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
It'll be like antiquing.

285
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Oh, it'll be.

286
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
You know how you always want to go antiquing?

287
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
It'll be like that.

288
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
It'll be a lot like turning you into human cannoli.

289
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
You're going to love it.

290
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
It's going to. Thanks, Delaware.

291
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
You guys want to Yahoo?

292
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Yeah.

293
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Yeah.

294
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Cool.

295
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
This one was sent in by Spummy or spew me.

296
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,720
Thank you.

297
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,720
Whichever two of those you like better.

298
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:20,720
It's by Yahoo Answers user DS who asks how to collect my scent for GF.

299
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,720
I'm going off to college and I want to give my girlfriend some of my pheromones to remember me by.

300
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
I also want them to last.

301
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
What is the best way to do this?

302
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
I have two ideas.

303
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,720
One go on a run in an undershirt, then put the shirt in a bag and the freezer.

304
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
I could do this multiple times.

305
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
No.

306
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Should I shower without antiperspirant before the run to sleep in an undershirt for a couple of days?

307
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Presumably I should shower before this, too.

308
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,720
I'm extremely healthy in terms of diet and exercise, and I know my sweat should be pretty pure.

309
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
Don't tell me I'm weird.

310
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
I already know.

311
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Is purity a factor?

312
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Oh, this is 100% crystallized pure.

313
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
I am so grossed out right now.

314
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,720
This shit will get you so high.

315
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:18,720
What he's asking is in what form should I scum up a t-shirt and give it to my girlfriend?

316
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Because nothing says I love you like handing over some dirty laundry.

317
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Hey guys, girls aren't weird like you are.

318
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,720
They're not weird.

319
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:37,720
There's no reality in which it's like, gosh, Darlene, I really enjoyed getting drinks with you and the girls,

320
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,720
but right now I have to go home and smell my boyfriend's dirty shirt for the freezer.

321
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,720
It's six months old, and he ran in it for eight days, and it's grown legs, and it's walking around in the freezer.

322
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,720
Let's see.

323
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,720
I got some skinny cow up in here.

324
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
I got some ready whip.

325
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:03,720
I got a brown and yellow flannel that used to be a white shirt.

326
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
It used to be a plain white shirt.

327
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Now it's a brown and yellow flannel because of its odors.

328
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Why not just get her a fucking necklace?

329
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,720
How about a necklace?

330
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
How about a necklace or a DiCaprio?

331
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
How about you just do that?

332
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Or a locket, and you can drip your juices into a file.

333
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,720
No, I'm trying to stay away from anything that comes from your body.

334
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,720
No, because we've got to keep your smell in the rotation somehow, so you've got to get some sort of phylactery.

335
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,720
Okay, so you're going to want to get her a pillow case stuffed with your own hair.

336
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
How about just a pillow that you have slept on?

337
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,720
Because when you sleep on a pillow for long enough, that pillow is basically a small dead version of you

338
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,720
because it's covered in your cells and your smells.

339
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,720
So just give that to her, and then she can have that.

340
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,720
And then when you're off fucking all kinds of college buddies and you're developing new smells,

341
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:03,720
smells like incense, smells like swing dancing, other college books, then she'll have that to remember you by.

342
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Hey, I have a message for this question asker.

343
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Listen, I've only known you for one Yahoo Answers question,

344
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,720
but I'm pretty sure that she is planning on dumping you before you go.

345
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
You are very weird.

346
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Although it might be, it's a pretty good excuse as you hand her your gross sweaty t-shirt for her to be like,

347
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,720
oh, this is exactly the window I've been looking for.

348
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,720
You're done.

349
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
Great, you're done. You're out.

350
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
Three strikes. You're out.

351
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
It's actually 38 strikes. You're so weird.

352
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,720
Oh, what is this?

353
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,720
It's a grocery bag with an old ass sweaty t-shirt in it.

354
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,720
Okay, great.

355
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,720
The door's over there. It's been fun.

356
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,720
It's cold out there. Do you want this back? Are you sure? Okay.

357
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,720
We've actually never dated.

358
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
Hey, real quick.

359
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,720
You sit behind me in math class, so thank you for the shirt.

360
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,720
I appreciate the shirt. Can you just run me through really quick?

361
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Why does it stink like shit?

362
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,720
I really like the iPod Nano you've given me.

363
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,720
I was curious why it doesn't reek of your personal musk.

364
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
It's damp, though.

365
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:19,720
Yeah, it is damp, but it doesn't really reek of your self-esteem.

366
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,720
I am a woman, and this is a man's shirt.

367
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,720
It does not appear to be new out the store,

368
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,720
and it reeks like shit like a man would smell.

369
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,720
So if you could just run me through really quick, I'm going to miss you so much.

370
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Have fun at college.

371
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,720
Have fun at college. Goodbye.

372
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:46,720
A lot of people don't know that Blue Can Trail wrote Hit Em Up Style after exactly an incident like this.

373
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Her boyfriend gave her a musk shirt, and then she went on a shopping spree.

374
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,720
Justin, have you ever worried that you have an inappropriate fascination with Blue Can Trail?

375
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,720
It's like every other episode we reference that fucking song.

376
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
You really think so?

377
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,720
I wasn't going to say anything, but you're in a safe place here, and we love you.

378
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,720
I just feel like you're a little bit obsessed with it.

379
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
I just think she's a talent.

380
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,720
Our key demographics, the numbers we've really pushed the ads on,

381
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,720
this is a generation that does not know this song, I bet.

382
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,720
We could start referencing Single Ladies. That's a good one.

383
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
Would that be good? Would that be better?

384
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,720
He gave her a stank ass shirt, and he didn't put a ring on it.

385
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,720
I think in this case, Irreplaceable would be better.

386
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
To the left, to the left.

387
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
I know, it's so hard to say.

388
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,720
All your fucking stinky shirts are in the garbage, and I set them on fire because they smell so bad.

389
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,720
And then they sweat, got burned, and now it's in my walls.

390
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,720
You need to tear down all the wallpaper and put up new wallpaper.

391
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Because it smells like your body odor in the kitchen, which sucks because that's where I eat.

392
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Baby.

393
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Hey, I've had a crush on a girl for a few months now. I just asked her out yesterday.

394
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,720
She said that she was flattered, but she doesn't think the relationship would be for her.

395
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,720
That's a crazy excuse.

396
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
That sounds great, just not for me.

397
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,720
That sounds like a really weird, interesting arrangement.

398
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
Just not sure it would be a great fit for me right now.

399
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,720
But I'll tell all my friends.

400
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,720
So my question is, should I continue being her friend and pursue a relationship later or just try to move on?

401
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,720
We are in our early 20s.

402
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,720
You need to take that microphone, and you need to turn it horizontally to the ground.

403
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,720
And then you need to let it fall.

404
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,720
And then you need to put one fist in the air, and then you need to walk away.

405
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:51,720
There was a piece of advice that Griffin used to give quite frequently, but I think it would be apropos in this case.

406
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,720
Don't wear silk on a Sunday.

407
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Nope.

408
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,720
No, not that.

409
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
Give the people what they want.

410
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,720
Fish and friends go bad.

411
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Nope.

412
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
So eat them both quickly.

413
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Nope.

414
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,720
Are you talking about like, I'll pack your bags and move away?

415
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Yeah, you do that because you're done.

416
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,720
You're out and you can't be here anymore.

417
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,720
When you say to a girl, hey, I think we should go out on a date, and she says, that sounds great, just not for me.

418
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
That's not really what I'm into right now.

419
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,720
You pick up your bags and put on your hobo hat and you shuffle on down the road to the next town.

420
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:36,720
That advice, though, is incongruous with the other advice which we've been giving out this year, which is get it in 20 days.

421
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,720
This person took a shot, went for it, went up to this person, got it, didn't get it, but they shot for it.

422
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,720
You know what I mean?

423
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,720
But he didn't stick the landing to continue on with the Olympics.

424
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
You didn't stick the landing.

425
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:57,720
And he shouldn't have to fucking leave town because there are tons of reasons to pack your bags and move away, and I don't think this is one of them.

426
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:16,720
But you're forgetting about, and this is sort of the dark side of 20 Does, right, because as powerful as Get It in 20 Does is, it's sort of like whatever motherfucker first said, live like you were dying or carpe diem or whatever.

427
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,720
Can we work YOLO?

428
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
YOLO, exactly.

429
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
It's so much fun to say. I wish we could say it more on the podcast.

430
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
I know, right, but we can't.

431
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,720
I feel like this power's been tapped already, the YOLO power's been tapped.

432
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Not too late for Gangnam Style, but it's too late for YOLO, I think.

433
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
Sure, Gangnam Style, okay.

434
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:45,720
But like, the dark side of that is that you are not dying, and you are going to carpe other diems, and you do only live once, but you have to live the whole thing.

435
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,720
You can dance like nobody's watching, but guess what?

436
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,720
People are fucking watching, and they're saying, look at those fucking douchebags swing dancing.

437
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,720
I have an idea.

438
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
No day but today.

439
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
And then Tuesday.

440
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Yes, that's accurate.

441
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
And then your dad's birthday.

442
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,720
And then your dad's birthday, and then you and Janine are going out to the lake.

443
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
There's other days, there really are.

444
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
This is my suggestion.

445
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,720
This is what people need to start doing.

446
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Carry around with you a tiny notepad and a tiny pencil.

447
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:20,720
And if something like this happens again, and you ask a girl out, and she says no, pull out the notepad and pencil and cross something off and say thank you very much for your time.

448
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,720
Then move to the next closest girl to you and ask her out.

449
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,720
And then just continue on with the circle, marking people off your list.

450
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,720
That is actually metaphorically like how Travis got through college.

451
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,720
That's basically just like that.

452
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:42,720
When you said that, did you think of that as soon as we read the question, and then you just sort of let her sit there in the chamber and wait for a time in which you could interpret?

453
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,720
I actually let that bounce around for a while, and it still came out.

454
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,720
You let that one just percolate, and you really honed it down to a perfect diamondine point.

455
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,720
I don't see anything wrong with that, because what it is is it gives you an out.

456
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
The fucking dumbest thing ever to do that anyone's ever done.

457
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,720
No, because it gives you an out, because suddenly you're not embarrassed, because she was just next on the list to see what was up.

458
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,720
Yeah, except everyone's going to think you're a fucking serial killer, dog.

459
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
Well, there is that.

460
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
I'm not saying it's a perfect plan.

461
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
It's the farthest from that.

462
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,720
It's the farthest from perfect.

463
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,720
I'm not saying it's a perfect plan.

464
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
It's a plan of garbage.

465
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
It has some faults.

466
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,720
It's all faults.

467
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
It has some faults.

468
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
It's made from faults.

469
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
It's from fault pie.

470
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,720
It has a certain air of fault to it.

471
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
It's a fault tart.

472
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,720
There's not even a crust on top.

473
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,720
It's just a bottom crust of dookie, and then faults all through it, made in it.

474
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
You know, to each his own.

475
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
That's what I say.

476
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,720
Yeah, one man's trash is a...

477
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,720
Yep.

478
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,720
One man's fault is another man's win.

479
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,720
It's...

480
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,720
So, here is the answer, and I will tell you the answer now.

481
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
You are out.

482
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,720
Like, Griffin had it right.

483
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
You're done.

484
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,720
And because...

485
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,720
And I'm not saying, like, men and women can't be friends, because they can.

486
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,720
But that's not what you were in it for.

487
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
That's not what you...

488
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
Not at all.

489
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,720
And if you were to continue to be her friend under the pretense of eventually dating her again...

490
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,720
Yeah, girls know that.

491
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Like, they're pretty smart about...

492
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,720
If you think you're gonna, like...

493
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,720
You're gonna Wile E. Coyote your way through this one.

494
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Like, she's not gonna see it coming, and then she'll fall off a cliff, and you'll catch her, and you'll be in love forever.

495
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:32,720
Because if you think about it, like, what's your hope that she, right now, when you were really playing game, wasn't interested?

496
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,720
But maybe if you try to fake a friendship with her, and she knows that for a while, that's what's gonna make her go,

497
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,720
You know, I'm gonna think twice about this guy now that he's totally trying to worm his way into my life.

498
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,720
It's just gonna be hard on your heart, and you shouldn't spend your time that way.

499
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,720
It's spent...

500
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
Dog...

501
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Fucking...

502
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
Listen to me.

503
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Listen to the words I'm saying.

504
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,720
This is a hundred percent, like, legitimately true advice.

505
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,720
If you're in college, don't waste a fucking second on this.

506
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,720
Don't waste a goddamn second.

507
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,720
Because you're not always gonna be in college, and then you're gonna look back and say,

508
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,720
Oh my god, why did I waste as much time as I wasted?

509
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
It keeps me up at night.

510
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
Like, don't let it happen to you.

511
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Just live it as hard as you possibly can.

512
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
Don't be a statistic.

513
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,720
And don't pine for people who are callous with your heart.

514
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,720
Do what you can now so that you don't have to look back when you're old and callous and say to people in college,

515
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,720
Move on, man, don't waste a minute.

516
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,720
Don't turn people into projects.

517
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,720
There are people out there, there are dozens of people out there who would like you and would like to spend time with you

518
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,720
and want to be with you because you are who you are.

519
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,720
People you don't have to, like, wear down.

520
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,720
Don't waste your time that way.

521
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
Get it. Get out.

522
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
Get it in 20 does with somebody else now.

523
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
You're done.

524
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,720
Cross around the list and move on to the next person.

525
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Don't fucking...

526
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
No lists!

527
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Don't do that!

528
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
It works!

529
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:07,720
You can have lists in... I feel like elementary school is okay to have lists of girls that you would want to, you know,

530
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,720
I guess in elementary school, like, smooch on the cheek or something.

531
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,720
I don't think that that can...

532
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Your top ten smooch list.

533
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
Yeah, your top ten.

534
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,720
I don't think that that can go... I don't think that can leave the elementary school.

535
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:28,720
And don't go to elementary school now and make one because you're fucking 22 and that's gross.

536
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,720
Do you think that metaphorically, like, when we look back at college and think of all the times we didn't get it.

537
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
Yeah.

538
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
And you're like, ugh.

539
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,720
Do you think that's what, like, all of life is like that metaphorically?

540
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,720
Like, if you're not getting it, it's so...

541
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,720
The difference between college and the life I'm living right now, this is what I'm saying.

542
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,720
The difference between college and the life I'm in right now is similar to the difference between...

543
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,720
Is relatable metaphorically the difference between being alive and being dead is basically what I'm saying.

544
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
Yeah.

545
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Do you think that's an accurate metaphor?

546
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
I don't think it's...

547
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:09,720
I bet that Hell is just like a series of being able to watch, like, completely watch on like television or on a giant movie screen,

548
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,720
those moments and then like having a pop up video that's like, if he would have done this,

549
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,720
then this is the million dollar idea that would have changed his life or it would have been the most amazing night of his life.

550
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
But he didn't because he was chicken shit.

551
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Hey, if you'd ordered the Panang curry, Steve Buscemi would have heard and he'd be like, oh, bro, that's my fave.

552
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
Let's party down.

553
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,720
And then he would have been best friends with Buscemi.

554
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
Yeah. And that is, I guess, life's ultimate achievement.

555
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,720
What the fuck are you talking about?

556
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,720
I regret...

557
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
I'm just saying it's a cool thing that could happen.

558
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
My life is perfect right now.

559
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,720
I have a great podcast and family and girlfriend and job.

560
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,720
But man, me and Buscemi were buds.

561
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
What if Buscemi were your roommate?

562
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,720
Oh, God, I would forsake everything to be a Buscemi bud.

563
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
You fucking idiots.

564
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
I'm sorry that this isn't enough.

565
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:06,720
I'm sorry that you don't live satisfying lives and that you need like a trap toothed actor to help you,

566
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,720
to help you find satisfaction.

567
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,720
I'm going to tell Sydney all this shit that you said and Teresa.

568
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,720
You don't have to listen.

569
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,720
Listen, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, I love you.

570
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,720
But I, I love, love Buscemi.

571
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,720
So I just feel like there's a Buscemi shaped hole in my heart.

572
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,720
It was for Sydney's for Sydney's sake that I didn't pick like a girl or something.

573
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,720
Like I didn't say like and then Kathleen Turner would hear.

574
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720
And you would get totally crazy.

575
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,720
So wait, in your mind, Kathleen Turner is the female version of Steve Buscemi?

576
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Like they're equivalent.

577
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
Right. Exactly.

578
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,720
Oh, Christ.

579
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Let's go to the money zone.

580
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
It's time.

581
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
I'm ready.

582
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
You're ready.

583
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,720
Hey, Griffin, who's this message for?

584
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,720
It's for Amanda A-M-A-N-D-A.

585
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,720
Hey, Travis, who's this message from?

586
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,720
From Cody.

587
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,720
It's from Cody?

588
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,720
For fuck's sake.

589
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,720
Oh, was there like a thing?

590
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,720
That would have been the traditional first anniversary gift is paper.

591
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,720
And the internet is kind of like paper.

592
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:33,720
So Cody thought that an N-B-N-B-A-M blessing would be a neat way to surprise his beautiful, loving, nerdy wife while she's driving or doing her makeup.

593
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:41,720
After all, she first introduced Cody to that sweet, sweet McElroy wisdom.

594
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:48,720
So congratulations to the two of you on your anniversary, on your first one.

595
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,720
And Amanda and Cody, I want you to know you have my blessing.

596
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,720
You can now pursue your relationship with the blessing.

597
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,720
Time to consummate this.

598
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,720
What else we got, Travis?

599
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,720
Can we just address the fact that what we do is not paper?

600
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,720
You realize we're not like talking into paper and then putting it on iTunes.

601
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,720
Well, hold on.

602
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,720
Okay, well, I've been meaning to talk to you about your recording setup for a while because it's...

603
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,720
It filters out all my plosives.

604
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,720
Yeah.

605
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,720
Travis used to pop his pees really bad.

606
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,720
But then he started shouting it into paper, making indentions and reading it with a needle.

607
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,720
And it depends on like how loud it is because sometimes it's three-sheeter, sometimes it's a four-sheeter.

608
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
It just depends on the day.

609
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Yeah, tell me about it.

610
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Poop, like poop.

611
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Nope.

612
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,720
We got another message for Tyler Matheson.

613
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,720
And the message is from Ben Gordon.

614
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,720
He says, happy birthday to a loyal MBMBAM listener for a present.

615
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,720
Could you creatively insult our friend, Corin?

616
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,720
He's getting a dual masters in literature and poetry.

617
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,720
I would submit that Corin is doing a fine job of it himself.

618
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,720
But how can we make fun of him?

619
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
He's a dual master.

620
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,720
Yeah.

621
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,720
He's fighting in both literature and poetry.

622
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
He's killing people with his words.

623
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:13,720
I don't want to get on this guy's bad side since he's so good at Yu-Gi-Oh!

624
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,720
That joke worked on two levels because he probably is pretty good at Yu-Gi-Oh!

625
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,720
I'm just glad that he's working long and hard, like probably 80 hours a week on these masters

626
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,720
so that he can work at McDonald's, I guess.

627
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,720
What do you do with literature and poetry degrees?

628
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Besides try to impress women.

629
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
That's off.

630
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
You took it right out of my mouth.

631
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,720
Guys, I want to talk about the all new Squarespace 6.

It's got social media connectivity.

635
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,720
It's got cloud stuff up in it.

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,720

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:24,720
I can't confirm that griffonspacejam.com is built on Squarespace, but wink nod.

646
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Maybe it is.

647
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
But it probably isn't.

648
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,720
I don't want to give them a bad name because it's a nice website, but it's not Squarespace material.

649
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,720
I did want to mention one other thing.

650
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,720
Fundinghunter.com, it's a free social site directed to entrepreneurs and investeurs.

651
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:46,720
Members can make profiles and pitch their ideas to other members using tools and features.

652
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,720
Anyone could be an investor.

653
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Members make the connections and build relationships.

654
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
We provide the platform.

655
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,720
This site, Fundinghunter.com, is where you can learn more.

656
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,720
It's especially applicable for us because I think it's fair to say we've had a history of bad investments.

657
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
You think that's accurate.

658
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
I keep betting against Michael Phelps.

659
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,720
What the fuck am I thinking?

660
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,720
That's not an investor.

661
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,720
I did want to talk to you about that.

662
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
That's gambling.

663
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
No, it's an investment in Winston.

664
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,720
I invested in Family Circus, the comic strip.

665
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
But here's the problem.

666
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,720
The return on that investment, it has been zero.

667
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,720
I don't think that's a thing that you can invest in.

668
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,720
I did invest in it.

669
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,720
I filed the investment papers from the ride-aid parking lot, from the guy.

670
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,720
From that one guy.

671
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,720
If it makes you feel any better, at least it's just a zero return.

672
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,720
I've been losing money on Marmaduke for years.

673
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:52,720
That guy, though, he's got to be making a killing.

674
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
He's always out there.

675
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,720
He's been out there for 20 years, it seems like.

676
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,720
I got a little more specific.

677
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,720
I'm more of a risky investor.

678
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,720
I short sold Beetle Bailey.

679
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,720
That's a real blue chip there.

680
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
He's a blue chip.

681
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,720
That's one of your classic performers.

682
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
It mitigates the risk, I think.

683
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,720
I tried to short sell Jeffy, but then the cop showed up.

684
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,720
It's hard.

685
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,720
That's tricky.

686
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,720
There's a lot of copyright that goes into that, a lot of trafficking.

687
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,720
It's a sticky little wicket.

688
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:37,720
I got into BC really hardcore, but all the religious undertones really put off all my potential buyers.

689
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,720
I'm not going to fall for that one again.

690
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,720
Hey, Lockhorns!

691
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:49,720
Hey, if you could just turn a profit in this quarter fiscally, please.

692
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,720
Thank you.

693
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,720
Can you stop with the fighting and maybe focus on Black Ink for once?

694
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,720
If you could do that.

695
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
You're the worst, Lockhorns.

696
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
Just get a fucking divorce!

697
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,720
You're not happy together.

698
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
Split the stocks.

699
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,720
I'll take the shares of the lady and you take the shares of the guy.

700
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,720
We can just focus on profitability.

701
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
Maybe you meet somebody nice.

702
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,720
You're wasting your lives, Lockhorns.

703
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,720
You're wasting your lives.

704
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:27,720
Hey, my coworker is trying to get me to play Magic the card game, but I don't think my street cred can handle it.

705
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,720
Got any suggestions?

706
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,720
That's from Too Cool For Cards.

707
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,720
You don't have any street cred?

708
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,720
Yeah, well, first off that, guaranteed if you listen to this podcast, you ain't got no cred.

709
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,720
I love you listeners, but come on.

710
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,720
You ain't hard.

711
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:55,720
But also, more importantly, fuck your street cred because that shit's gonna keep you from doing all kinds of cool stuff that you would otherwise miss out on.

712
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,720
Like playing Magic.

713
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:03,720
And by cool stuff, I don't mean in the traditional sense where anybody would ever look at you and say, oh, that's a desirable sexual object.

714
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,720
But you'll probably have fun.

715
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,720
Griffin, you don't think ability to play Magic is a trait that people look for in a sexual partner?

716
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,720
I don't think anybody has ever perused somebody's swamp deck and gone, this person is fuckable.

717
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,720
Highly fuckable.

718
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,720
Now, I'm gonna disagree because I've been to PAX.

719
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,720
I'm going to disagree with you.

720
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,720
I think that's probably happening.

721
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:32,720
I do want to, if I had someone who was trying to get me to play Magic, I would probably do it.

722
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,720
My problem is that I'm a 31-year-old man.

723
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,720
I live in my house.

724
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,720
You mean that better than living outside your house?

725
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,720
I mean that in the hermetically sealed sense.

726
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,720
Justin is sealed for freshness inside of his house.

727
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,720
Right.

728
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,720
That's how I keep my cherubic look is I don't let myself get exposed to the elements.

729
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,720
His front door is tamper-proof.

730
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,720
No one's getting in here.

731
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:07,720
The only reason I'm not playing super nerdy-ass board games in Austin is just because I haven't met a group of people to play those with yet.

732
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,720
You can't be afraid of...

733
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:20,720
I've realized recently that it's a lot like trying to find, what I imagine, trying to find a drug dealer or buying or selling drugs.

734
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,720
There's a lot of innuendo and raised eyebrows when it comes to D&D.

735
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:31,720
I just started working at the theater and we were talking about video games and Dragon Age came up.

736
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:37,720
Somehow that led to this, like, have you ever played Dungeons & Dragons?

737
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,720
I mean, I may have.

738
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:48,720
I remember when we were trying to find out if our group of friends in Huntington would be interested in playing the new D&D.

739
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,720
This was a few years back.

740
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:57,720
It was our cool going out drinking buddy group of friends that I don't think we'd ever even played Risk with or anything like that.

741
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:06,720
Trying to broach that subject with them is like two fucking intelligence agency officers trying to drop secret codes at each other.

742
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,720
Like, hey, have you ever watched Lord of the Rings?

743
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,720
Do you like that swords and shit?

744
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,720
Yeah, what's that all about, huh?

745
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:26,720
Like in, you know, like Willow, like goblins and just like, hey, do you like Candyland?

746
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,720
Sorry, are you in operation or anything?

747
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:38,720
Can you imagine a world in which someone just like knocked on a door and was just like, I love Dungeons & Dragons and I think you do too.

748
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,720
Let's do this.

749
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
Oh, okay.

750
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,720
Suddenly it's out here in the light of day.

751
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,720
Oh, it's a lot more attractive than I would have thought.

752
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,720
Here's what's up.

753
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,720
I used to feel this nerd shame in a big, big way.

754
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:04,720
And even when I was like writing about games professionally, like I would be embarrassed to tell people what I did because I was in college and I was super, I cared about what other people thought about me.

755
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,720
But like, don't ever, if you want to play Magic the Gathering, like if you want to get super into it, just fucking do it.

756
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:16,720
Like if you want to do something and it's healthy, then just do it.

757
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,720
And don't let, you know, your so-called street cred, which isn't a real thing that exists.

758
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:28,720
Everybody's too busy like giving a shit about whether or not people think what they're doing is nerdy to actually do it to other people.

759
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,720
So just fucking.

760
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:42,720
But like, okay, I see your point. Like I know what you're saying and I do think anybody can get hung up on, you know, outside perception.

761
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:49,720
But at some point your inner perception comes into play too.

762
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:56,720
I mean, I think it's legitimate to say that you don't want to see, that's not the kind of person that you want to be.

763
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,720
You don't see yourself as the sort of person who plays Magic the Gathering.

764
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,720
But they haven't tried it yet.

765
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:10,720
First off, they haven't tried it yet. But second off, it's fucking stupid to define yourself that way.

766
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:18,720
Like, when you play, like if you play Magic the Gathering, if you start playing it, you are not all of a sudden the guy who plays Magic the Gathering.

767
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,720
And if you do think of yourself that way, then you need to-

768
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,720
Literally define, yes, you're incorrect. But go on.

769
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,720
You know what I mean. You're not like, hey, I'm the magic guy. Like, people don't introduce you to parties.

770
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:38,720
How many times do you think you need to get spotted by babes playing Magic the Gathering before that particular image sticks?

771
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,720
You're goofing. You are goofing right now.

772
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:46,720
But this is like the actual thing this person is worried about. Just fucking own it.

773
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,720
It's 2012. It's not 1995 where you're going to get beat up for fucking playing Magic the Gathering.

774
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:59,720
A nerd is not going to, or a bully is not going to come and like drop a big pile of sand in front of you and then proceed to kick it all over your face in cards.

775
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:04,720
Like, that scenario, by the way, did not take place on a beach. That's why they had to bring their own sand to kick on you.

776
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:10,720
They're not going to open a bag of sand and dump it at your feet and then wait for the whole thing to empty out and then kill you.

777
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:16,720
I swear to God, if you own it, like, you are never, ever, ever going to have an issue with this.

778
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:23,720
When John Locke was playing board games with his friend across the phone, is that when you thought John Locke ruled?

779
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:29,720
Or did you think John Locke ruled when he went to an island and brought a box of knives and started getting it?

780
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,720
That's, like, you don't ever see him like on the island.

781
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,720
And then he carved his own chess set.

782
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,720
Like, yeah.

783
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,720
With those knives, Justin.

784
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,720
Okay, correct.

785
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,720
And he played backgammon on the beach with Walt.

786
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,720
They're just trying to cling to civilization at that point. That's different.

787
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,720
If he had Sid Meier's civilization on the island, he would have put his knives down and said, oh, I think I'm going to get really good at this.

788
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:59,720
And maybe there's a chance that you start playing Magic Gathering with your friend, and then the writers realize that he's going nowhere.

789
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,720
So they write him off the show until, like, season six, and then they bring him back.

790
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:10,720
There's lots of things I haven't tried that I don't think are cool, so I don't want to do them.

791
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,720
Like what?

792
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:18,720
We just had like a ten-minute goof about how we're not going to take swing dancing classes because we don't want to be those people.

793
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:27,720
But that's different because if I got super into magic and I went out to a park or something and had an intense Magic the Gathering match, I wouldn't be doing it so other people would look at me.

794
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,720
Quite the opposite, actually.

795
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:37,720
But if I went to the park and started swing dancing, I might as well put up signs and fucking charge admission.

796
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,720
But would you wear a cloak?

797
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,720
That's what I keep coming back to is my question. Would you wear a cloak?

798
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,720
You're bordering on hate speech right now, so watch it.

799
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,720
You're being very mean to Magic the Gathering.

800
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,720
I'm not. No, I'm not.

801
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,720
This isn't what I'm saying.

802
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:04,720
What I'm saying is there are things that you don't have to feel peer pressure to be nerdier than you are.

803
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,720
That's what I'm saying.

804
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,720
No, you also don't have to feel peer pressure to not try new things.

805
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:16,720
That's what I'm saying. Everything that you are worried about, I swear to you, because this person's not going to go around throwing magic cards in everyone's face like,

806
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,720
I'm the king of all magic.

807
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:25,720
Unless it turns out he is the king of all magic that's been prophesied about for centuries.

808
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,720
There is a king of all magic. He is coming. Praise be his name.

809
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,720
But that's not what this person's doing.

810
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:39,720
This person is worried about outside scrutiny. It doesn't fucking exist. I swear to you it doesn't exist.

811
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,720
So let's boil it down. This is what I think we're saying.

812
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,720
Take a second. Close your eyes. Don't worry about anyone else.

813
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,720
If you truly don't want to play because you're not interested in doing it, fine.

814
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:53,720
Then you say, you know what? I've got enough stuff going on. I'm not interested in it. Great.

815
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:59,720
But if your only hesitancy to not do it is that you're afraid of being judged by other people, try it.

816
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,720
But do remember that you are judged by other people all the time.

817
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,720
You aren't being judged by other people all the time, and if you are, fuck those people.

818
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,720
That's going to have zero...

819
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,720
Because I guarantee they do something that they're embarrassed about.

820
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,720
Yeah, if you live your whole life like...

821
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,720
Maybe they're playing Roker Poker at home constantly, every day.

822
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,720
If you want to play Roker Poker in public, I think you should be able to.

823
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,720
I'm trying to get those laws passed through Congress.

824
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,720
It's a tough putt though.

825
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,720
Public masturbation is a big thing with these people.

826
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,720
What is your hang up?

827
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,720
Prudes?

828
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,720
It's the 60s.

829
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,720
It's not.

830
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:42,720
It makes me sad for people who have to keep their freak on a leash.

831
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,720
Griffin's not afraid to tell everyone about his Pokemon days.

832
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,720
By which I mean the present.

833
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,720
Now, this day, he's telling everyone about the day that he is in.

834
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:02,720
I'm not saying go around and write songs about Magic the Gathering and then sing them to people.

835
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,720
That's not what I'm saying.

836
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,720
Because then it's a fetish.

837
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:13,720
But don't be afraid to do it just because somebody walking by might tweet about it.

838
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,720
Fuck it, man. Life is way too short.

839
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,720
What if Steve Buscemi plays Magic and you don't get to be friends with Steve Buscemi

840
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,720
because he wants to play Magic the Gathering with you and you're afraid to try it?

841
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:30,720
If you're not embarrassed about it, there's nothing anybody can do that can hurt you.

842
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:35,720
You're doing it. You're owning it. You're living it. That's great.

843
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:42,720
What I'm saying is, if you're embarrassed about it, it doesn't jive with your own sense of self,

844
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,720
then you shouldn't feel like you have to do it.

845
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:53,720
It's okay to think that things aren't for you or they're not how you want to conduct yourself, I guess is what I'm saying.

846
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,720
I'm just saying everyone should watch the hit Jim Carrey movie, Yes Man.

847
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,720
Don't watch the Yes Man.

848
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,720
Yes. Yes. Watch the Yes Man. Say yes.

849
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,720
Okay.

850
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,720
Because it's the sequel to Liar Liar, which everyone loved.

851
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,720
Why didn't they just call it that?

852
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,720
This is literally, we had this conversation on the last podcast and I edited it out.

853
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,720
Really?

854
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,720
I swear to God.

855
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,720
I want to have it again.

856
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,720
I feel like I maybe didn't make my-

857
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,720
I understand what you're saying, but there is-

858
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:28,720
I don't want to come off as hypocritical because I do review video games for a living, but there are levels of being nerdy that I can't get into.

859
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:33,720
I'm overweight. I've got some strikes. I'm pasty. I've got some strikes against me.

860
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:38,720
There are levels of nerddom that I cannot embrace as a rule.

861
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:44,720
I played Magic a couple of times in high school. I sat down, had somebody walk me through it, teach me how to play it, played a game or two.

862
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,720
It wasn't for me. It wasn't something I picked up on and I've continued on to this day.

863
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:54,720
But leading up to it, it was my friend Eric and he kept saying, oh, come on, it's really great.

864
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,720
And I didn't want to play it because it was, quote, uncool.

865
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:03,720
And then I played it and was like, oh, I could see where someone would totally get into this, but this is not for me.

866
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,720
This is not something I'm going to dedicate my life to.

867
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:11,720
But like, okay, here's an example. SCA guys, right?

868
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:22,720
They're in the park, they've got lances, they've got armor, and they're morphing, I think is what they're doing.

869
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,720
They're morphing is what they're doing.

870
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,720
Do I think that would be fun to do for an afternoon? Of course I do.

871
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,720
But I also know you can't unring that bell.

872
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,720
But that's a bad example because that is tantamount to medieval swing dancing.

873
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,720
Basically, yes, right? You could do it on your lawn and you're not.

874
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,720
Nobody does Magic the Gathering as a performance art.

875
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,720
So if someone can figure that out, I will kickstart it.

876
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:56,720
What I'm saying, though, is if this person plays Magic and really likes it and it makes them happy to play it,

877
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,720
if you just own it, then you're not going to feel embarrassed about it.

878
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:08,720
If you don't let it define yourself, if you just say, yeah, it's a thing I do, whatever, it's fun, I enjoy doing it.

879
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,720
Yes, that is the key, Griffin. You're right.

880
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,720
That is the salient point that I want to get across.

881
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,720
If you're not embarrassed about it, then don't worry about it.

882
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,720
But I'm saying that's a switch.

883
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,720
No, but I think you're using the word embarrassed where you should say if you don't like it, if you don't enjoy it.

884
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,720
That's not what we're saying at all.

885
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:32,720
What I'm saying is the embarrassment in your brain, and I swear to God, this is true, it's a switch, and you can flip it.

886
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:41,720
You can flip that switch from, like, I used to be embarrassed to, like, fucking ride the bus in Chicago and play my Nintendo DS.

887
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:46,720
I would not do that because I didn't like people watching me play video games.

888
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,720
But I flipped that switch eventually and I realized that this is a thing I want to do on here.

889
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,720
It's a great way to pass the time. I'm going to do it.

890
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,720
And then, like, it seriously is as easy as that.

891
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:06,720
We spent a long time on this question, but I think, I don't know, it's a thing that comes up really, really frequently for me.

892
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:26,720
But, like, yes, I get your point. I understand what you're saying, but that level of, like, it's not as easy as you're making it seem because that level of social recalibration, deciding that something isn't, is appropriate socially, like, just deciding it for yourself.

893
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,720
It doesn't matter if it's appropriate.

894
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,720
That doesn't always fly, like, because you still do live in a society.

895
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:38,720
Like, it's the same reason I, like, I think sweatpants are comfortable, but I'm not wearing them every day because that's not...

896
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:45,720
What I'm saying is if you wear those sweatpants on a bus and fucking 55 people on that bus see you and all say,

897
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:52,720
look at this fucking goon in his sweatpants and then they go home to their families at night, they are not going to talk about your goddamn sweatpants.

898
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,720
They're not going to remember that you exist. You're dead to them.

899
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:05,720
That's, listen, like, this is not a message of sunshine and flowers. Like, you are so fucking insignificant that maybe 10 people are going to remember you after you die.

900
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:14,720
And those 10 people sure as fuck aren't going to remember that you played Magic cards. I guarantee goddamn T it.

901
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,720
So, good luck.

902
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,720
Like, life is meaningless. Life is meaningless, I guess.

903
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,720
And, like, you're super insignificant and you're probably not going to be famous.

904
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,720
If you get famous, then, yeah, maybe you shouldn't be playing Magic cards.

905
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:30,720
But, Steve Buscemi, if you're listening, and I hope that you are, probably put them down.

906
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,720
Or maybe you should play Magic cards.

907
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,720
Maybe you should. You could lead the fucking revolution like Vin Diesel when he's like, yeah, I play D&D.

908
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:41,720
Like, he fucking started the movement and he made it easier for the rest of us and thank you Vin Diesel.

909
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:49,720
But, like, seriously, nobody gives a shit. Zero people give a shit. There are zero shits to be given.

910
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,720
Unless you wear sweatpants every day.

911
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,720
No, even then.

912
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,720
No, Griffin. I'm sorry. I have to stand my ground.

913
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:02,720
It's so extreme that I could walk around Austin with 10 fake dicks attached to my body.

914
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:10,720
And I could run around and I could be the fun guy who runs into people and slaps them with his fake dicks as he jogs down the street.

915
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:19,720
I could ride a fucking jazzy and I could use a giant fake dick as a lance and I could run it into people.

916
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:25,720
I could beat someone to death in the street with a fake dick and in a year and a half nobody would remember me.

917
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:33,720
This is, like, you think I'm joking but I'm being 100% serious. I could be the fake dick murderer and I would not be remembered.

918
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:42,720
But what I'm saying is that, yes, while you may be technically correct, that behavior becomes your defining aspect.

919
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:48,720
Nobody's gonna say, man, the fake dick murderer has gray hair. It's just not going to be something they know.

920
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:54,720
You're right. But what I'm saying is in 10 years they're going to be at dinner and someone's gonna say,

921
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,720
do you remember the fake dick murderer? And the other person's gonna say, no, I don't.

922
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:04,720
I don't remember what my wife looks like and I've been away from my house for six hours.

923
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:15,720
I'm not joking. These are things that I seriously think about when I think about whether or not I should do this thing in public.

924
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:23,720
You make such a small impact in the world that nobody's gonna give a shit. Just play Magic Cards.

925
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:29,720
Everybody play Magic Cards. This podcast is sponsored by Wizards of the Coast. Thank you, Wizards of the Coast.

926
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:37,720
They are paying us exclusively in energy. We did like three questions this week because of this question.

927
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:55,720
I'll be honest with you. I feel like this is one of the few times where the differences in our age is dictating these answers.

928
00:57:55,720 --> 00:58:02,720
I do think it's okay to care about what people think about you.

929
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,720
Now let me weigh in because you guys have been arguing for like 20 minutes.

930
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:15,720
It's just occurred to me that I feel this same way, but about things in the reverse, like joining a fantasy football league.

931
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,720
If someone was like, play my D&D game, I'm like, okay, totally cool.

932
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:28,720
But if somebody was like, play in my fantasy baseball, fantasy football, March Madness thing, I would go, oh, I'm gonna look stupid.

933
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:39,720
I gotta tell you, I'm right there. My friend Justin Minsker has asked me I think to be on two different leagues of like a bowling league and a kickball league.

934
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:47,720
Both times I was like, no, that's not for me. Just because I would kick the ball and it would hit a child and then I would be embarrassed.

935
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:54,720
That's the same thing. You're right. I've come to terms with the kind of person that I am.

936
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:02,720
And that person is kind of nerdy and enjoys watching sports. Yeah, I'm embarrassed to try and crossover.

937
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,720
But this is what I'm saying. Travis is exactly right.

938
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:13,720
This guy has come to terms with the person that he is.

939
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:19,720
And I think it's okay to come to terms with yourself being a person who wouldn't play a fantasy card game.

940
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:23,720
But I disagree because I think you should at least try. I don't think you can.

941
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:29,720
Did you try kickball? Yeah, when I was fucking nine years old.

942
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,720
I have no pleasant memories from the experience.

943
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:40,720
I'm just saying that I think it's it's really easy to say, you know, live like your diet and it doesn't matter what other people think and you're insignificant and they won't care.

944
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:50,720
Until you're actually in that moment where you're playing Magic the Gathering and somebody walks by and snickers behind their hand and suddenly you feel like a tiny, you know, insignificant person.

945
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,720
If you let that kind of shit bother you, then your life is going to be just miserable.

946
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,720
No, no, no. I'm not saying I'm not saying that you should let it bother you.

947
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:09,720
I'm saying that as much as I would love it to be a switch that flips, it's not like you've got to convince yourself and it's a constant thing to remind yourself not to care what other people think.

948
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:24,720
But I still don't think like that's not even what I'm talking like if somebody wants to to judge like that, like somebody wants to get a kick because their personal like adjudication of what's cool doesn't grok with yours.

949
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,720
Like that's like fuck that guy. I'm with Griffin on that.

950
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:39,720
Like I think, yeah, screw them. I'm just saying that it's OK to have a series of guidelines for yourself in the way in which you want to to.

951
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,720
Yes, but I also completely rob yourself of a positive experience.

952
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:52,720
I remember I remember going to the Bob Dylan concert with you, Justin, and sitting there and like everybody else is on their feet and dancing and me going, you know, this isn't my usual way of enjoying a concert.

953
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:59,720
And I'm not that big into Bob Dylan. And you looked at me and said, you're never going to see Bob Dylan in concert again.

954
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:10,720
You should get up and enjoy this. And I did end up having a great time in spite of myself because I just let myself do it and didn't worry about anything or try to like rob myself of a positive.

955
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:22,720
The problem with your the problem with creating your self-identity, like you're talking about, Justin, and knowing the kind of person that you are and using those as guidelines is that's that's fine. And that's a great way to like live your life with that guiding light.

956
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:34,720
But the very first time that keeps you from doing something awesome that would become a new defining like thing in your life, it's all fucking it's all fucking forfeit.

957
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,720
It's all it's it's all for not.

958
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:44,720
That's accurate. I'm just like I say where you're coming from. I one of my friends invited me to go play golf.

959
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:54,720
And it's like I've never played before. I'm not an athletic person. I knew I was going to fucking humiliate myself because that is a game that requires both physical prowess and accuracy.

960
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:59,720
And I was I was embarrassed and I was embarrassed like my first few holes because I shot it and I hit a child.

961
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,720
It's a big problem for me. It's a big theme.

962
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:12,720
But but then like I had a great time and I want to go play it more like it do it do as much new shit as you possibly can because that's the only way that you can know whether or not you're going to like it.

963
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:19,720
YOLO. You had some really good advice there and then you completely ruined it. ROLOS.

964
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:26,720
Okay. Frodo. There it is. We've been recording for about six hours.

965
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:37,720
I feel like we didn't bring any goofs. No I think you got some goofs in there but I think we got some real like we got that advice that like is broad.

966
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:43,720
I feel like Delilah right now. Can I can I. I'll tell you what's fucking me.

967
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:49,720
And maybe this will help to inform I have like in my head ideas of people who I think are cool.

968
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:54,720
Right. Like oh man that's a cool person. That's the kind of person I'd like to be.

969
01:02:54,720 --> 01:03:10,720
And there are some parts of all culture not just nerd culture but anything watching bad TV whatever you know like that don't that I think to myself I let I get the thought of like man that person would never do this.

970
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:22,720
And like that's and but like and that's the thought that I have like I think that person is cool and I think that person lives like the sort of life that I would like to have or be perceived of having.

971
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:27,720
And then but there's no way that they would be caught doing this thing.

972
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:38,720
We're 114 episodes in and from going over Yahoo Answers and everything that people have asked us you don't think that that person that you think is infallibly cool goes home and does something.

973
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,720
That's what I'm saying like uncool or just super weird.

974
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:45,720
Straight real talk. Do you think I'm cool Justin. Do you think I'm a cool person.

975
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,720
I think you're cool dude.

976
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:55,720
OK when I was 15 I spent probably eight hundred dollars on Pokemon cards.

977
01:03:55,720 --> 01:04:02,720
Like you can't because if everybody else is thinking like that and I think a majority of the people are then they're not like airing out their secrets.

978
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:07,720
There's no way to really know like what a person is like until you like marry them.

979
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:21,720
That's basically that's basically it like there's no way of knowing what kind of shit a person is into if they are also living their life like embarrassed of the things that make them happy.

980
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,720
So inspirational advice YOLO.

981
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,720
So YOLO.

982
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:29,720
Seriously YOLO.

983
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,720
I think you should.

984
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:35,720
But do do play it in private though because it may not may not work for you.

985
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,720
You should also play it in private because it's not really that fun to watch.

986
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,720
It's like the most boring game ever.

987
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,720
Pokemon cards though.

988
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,720
Oh that game has at least half the cards are racist.

989
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,720
So you don't want to say them out loud.

990
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,720
You know it's great strip Pokemon cards.

991
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,720
Yeah yeah yeah.

992
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:56,720
You know what I like is strip out Poker Roker Roker poker strip something.

993
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:57,720
How are you.

994
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:03,720
Can I ask how you're playing Poker Roker without it being strip.

995
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:12,720
I play reverse Roker Poker where like I put on more Al Roker masturbates while watching you do the things that you do.

996
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,720
I just have him give me like some tips about the weather.

997
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:23,720
You know he wants to know what's going on on your neck of your penis.

998
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,720
I answer is a small tie.

999
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,720
Yeah yeah.

1000
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,720
I got a small tie down there.

1001
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,720
I won that hand.

1002
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:33,720
Now you have to tell me what's going on in Des Moines.

1003
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,720
Well otherwise but do it slow.

1004
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,720
Take it slow for me.

1005
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,720
You put a few more pounds on.

1006
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,720
Hey wait now we can't get into creepy.

1007
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:50,720
No I'm just saying I liked it better when there was more Al to jerk off to.

1008
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,720
OK I've got jerkable.

1009
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,720
I've got jerkable Roker for miles.

This has been my brother my brother and me.

1011
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,720
Of course it's a comedy advice show as you've certainly gathered over the past 20.

1012
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,720
There is a nice parabola of like helpfulness there.

1013
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,720
We came down nicely.

1014
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:13,720
This is this is this is what a literarist would call the descending action.

1015
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:19,720

I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

1037
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:10,720
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed, which which you should be which you should be listening to.

1038
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,720
You should also listen to the other Long Winters albums.

1039
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,720
I listen to it.

1040
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,720
I've been flying around a lot lately.

1041
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,720
I've been listening to to the whole discography.

1042
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,720
So so get up on that.

1043
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,720
You should also be listening to all the other Max Fund podcasts.

Jordan Jessica, Throwing Shade, all of them.

1045
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,720
And I've been on a big kick of audiobooks this summer.

1046
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:35,720
And if you haven't listened to the audiobook version of John Hodgman's books, you know, more information you require in the areas of my expertise.

1047
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:39,720
I don't know if that is all is out on audiobook yet.

1048
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,720
But if you get a chance, make sure you listen to them.

1049
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:42,720
They're just wonderful.

1050
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,720
They're great.

1051
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,720
Yeah.

Yep, yep, yep, yep.

1053
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:51,720

01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,720
Daddy's ready.

Thank you, Christian.

How can I make my pennies longer?

1059
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,720
What?

1060
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:10,720

01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,720
