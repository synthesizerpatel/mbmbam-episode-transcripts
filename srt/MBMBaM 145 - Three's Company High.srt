1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:44,480
It's a new craze, and good girls do you want it? Just say, hey I wanna. Just say, hey I wanna.

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,440
Pass the dutchie, it's time for Passover. With me, Justin Mac... Let him do it. Pass the dutchie,

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,680
it's time for Passover. With me, the honorable rabbi Justin McElroy. Your venerate, your grace,

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:05,280
your grace. Yes, yes my son. Please do pass the dutchie. I'll pass the dutchie, it's the 15th of,

9
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,960
today's the 15th of Nissan, everybody, and that means it's Passover time, so let's pass that,

10
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:22,160
pass it over here, that last... Dutchie's a weed, right? It's like a jazz cigarette? Yeah, that is

11
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:30,240
very different from Passover, which here is the literal thing that I found just now when I was

12
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,280
researching Passover to make sure my goos were not only insightful but relevant. It's the blood on

13
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,080
the door, right? Or the white paint? What was it? It's you find a red door and you want it painted

14
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:50,000
black. Fox News says, why is Passover the most celebrated Jewish holiday in America? And Fox

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,320
News answers, simply put, like America itself, Passover is about freedom. Because Passover rules

16
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,400
and eagles and stuff. That's true. Passover rules, put a firecracker in your butt, eat some cake,

17
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:12,000
it's Passover time. Fuck yeah, Passover. Get ready to get passed over, Nazis. Is the freedom to not

18
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,720
be murdered by an agent of the Lord? Is that what... That's the... No, the freedom was,

19
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,880
it was freedom from the Pharaoh, from the Egyptians. Right, but some fools got wrecked,

20
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,680
right? Because it was the plagues and shit. Oh yeah, all the Egyptians. It was a freedom from

21
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,760
having to look at all the Egyptians' first born children. I'm sick of looking at all these fat,

22
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,880
ugly little kids. Fat Derek. I wish an angel would come down with a flaming sword. I wish there would

23
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:50,160
be a great reaping. Hey, pass that Dutch. Pass the Dutchie. Kids, not Jewish kids, but kids,

24
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,120
you know, Jewish kids in that period, must have been pretty cool because they were the only kids

25
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,440
to have a prominent, deep-seated, and very practical fear of angels. You could at any point

26
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,240
threaten that an angel's coming for them and they'd like hide under their bed. Dad, did you

27
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,000
put the blood on the door? I'll do it later. Dad! Dad, do it now! What's the matter with you?

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,720
This is vital, Daddy. Dad, you didn't buy that. Oh, you bought store brand blood? Come on, Dad!

29
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,320
Get the name brand stuff. You can turn on the faucet and it's blood, because that was an earlier

30
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:29,680
plague, Daddy. It couldn't be easier. It's a whole different plague, Papa. The other thing that Fox

31
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,160
News tells me about Passover, I'm just getting all my Passover facts from Fox News. Why is wine so

32
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,640
prominently featured at the cedar meal? Drinking wine, especially over a leisurely meal, expresses

33
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,400
the freedom of those gathered together and demonstrating that freedom is central to the

34
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,960
feature, is the central feature of the cedar. Fox News is super hung up on the patriotism.

35
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,400
You're showing your hand a little bit too, because I'm pretty sure it's cedar. It's cedar.

36
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,200
Although a cedar meal sounds delicious. Oh, this is hickory smoked barbecue. Oh, is this salmon?

37
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,720
This is delicious. Throw it over some cedar chips. That's what I meant. What were you guys talking

38
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,360
about? I was talking about, you know, the nymphs and the satyrs and the games around and they eat

39
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,840
the food as a stretch. That joke was a stretch. I apologize. They pass you a big fat J, but they

40
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:27,280
pass it counterclockwise. That song would have been way better and much, much clearer if it had

41
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:36,640
been passed the dutchy counterclockwise word. So this is my brother and my brother mates.

42
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,360
It's an advice show. Was that all offensive? Like, do people...

43
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,240
It may not... It has shit to do with the plagues, right? Like, it's been a while since...

44
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,280
Yeah, it is. It's about the angel passing over the children and not killing them. Okay, cool. Cool

45
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,120
all day. But like, Fox News doesn't mention plagues. I don't know. I wish that I had a...

46
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,400
I don't know. I wish I had a holiday that I celebrated. Maybe I should get down with Passover.

47
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,760
I've never fucked with Passover before, but I wish I had a holiday that had the eating of

48
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Thanksgiving with some of the ceremony of like an Easter. You know what I mean? Yeah, it's called

49
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,920
Easter. I guess that's true, but like Easter... I don't think of Easter as being like a big eating

50
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,760
holiday. Oh, it is. You get the ham and then you get cake eggs and you just go to town. Yeah,

51
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:31,200
but it's not standardized, you know? Sater, they have, you know, latkes, they have challah bread.

52
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,040
They get down with it. Black and white cookies? Black and white cookies, do they do that on

53
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:44,720
Passover? I don't like ham. Yeah, Justin also doesn't like ham. I like ham. I don't like ham,

54
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,400
really. If I go to a place and ham's the only meat available, like, I really don't like ham.

55
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,480
Mm-hmm. I don't get it. Let me hit you with this. Let me bounce this off you. How do you feel about

56
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,880
unleavened bread? Good question. That sounds pretty good. Okay. It sounds pretty good. Sorry,

57
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,120
let me reframe it. How do you feel about leavened bread? Because you pretty much have to get rid of

58
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:15,680
all that. I would miss leavened bread. Yeah. I'm assuming that the stuff in hot dog buns is leavened,

59
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,440
right? No, it's unleavened. You're good. It's unleavened, that's fine. Here's the only way

60
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,760
you can tell is you have to put the bread in water, and if it sinks, it's unleavened. If it

61
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,560
floats, it's a witch. I'm sorry, it has to be toilet water. You have to put it in the toilet

62
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,080
because that's the only kind of water that works as a litmus test. You have to test each piece

63
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,400
individually because you can't just assume the entire package is leavened. Did you guys know

64
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,520
that s'mores were invented when people were trying to figure out if marshmallows were witches?

65
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:52,080
That's a true story I made up. That's true. And they said that I can't be sure, but the one thing

66
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,960
I am sure about is this is delicious. I feel ice. What do you think, Reverend Hershey? Let's toast

67
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,080
it. Hey, I've got a totally dope idea. Hey, pass that J and let me drop some science on you guys.

68
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,440
Thanks, Reverend Hershey, and we shall form a town here and we'll make chocolate and shit.

69
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,240
It'll be awesome. Give me those Doritos. I can't stop eating these things. They must be ensorcelled.

70
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,480
How could you do this to us, Marshmallow? We're building a community. This is My Brother, My

71
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,880
Brother, Me. It's a advice show from the modern era, and we know a lot about Drew stuff. Trust me.

72
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,000
Here's the first question. Also, to answer your question, Griffin, I don't know if that was

73
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,960
offensive or not, but if it was offensive, it came from the most pure source of something

74
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,520
to be offensive, and that is ignorance. The one thing you cannot be angry about someone being

75
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:49,520
offensive for is ignorance. That is the one thing that is okay to be offensive. Will you

76
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,760
learn anything from Archie Bunker and Family Guy if that shit is funny as long as the person is

77
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:04,800
stupid? Sure. But that's a pretty bad catch-all, though. That kind of catches a lot of shit,

78
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,600
though. Yeah, it's a lot of things in there. Let's spread our ignorant seed. Let's spread it.

79
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,840
My boyfriend and I will be house-sitting for his favorite professor over the summer,

80
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,560
and I plan to live with him while he stays there. Although I am excited to live with my boyfriend

81
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,360
in a real adult's house, I do have one qualm. If we were to have sex in the professor's home,

82
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,480
would it stir up bad juju there? If so, how can we protect the professor from any strange

83
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:41,760
residual sex energy that's from the boorish border? Is he a professor of voodoo? Let's tackle

84
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:48,320
this big question. Okay. Somebody house-sits for you, they fuck in your house, you come home.

85
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,880
Maybe it doesn't even have to be that, like you're at a party and you walk into a room.

86
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,720
Can you guys tell when someone's been freaking? Oh, yeah. If someone's been freaking in my home

87
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,840
and I walk in the door, I turn into R. Kelly. I'm like, my hands are in the air. I'm like,

88
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:15,120
oh no. You're not catching them in the act. You could tell. What's up guys? What are you doing?

89
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,440
You're not watching people express love to each other physically with love acts.

90
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,080
I'm talking about you walk into a room and like the specter of fuck is just like hanging.

91
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,800
No, I'm saying I can sense that and every time that someone's had sex in my house when I wasn't

92
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,320
there, I felt like you look at my hair, it was standing straight up like I just took off a wool

93
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,640
sweater. I know when people have been doing dirty in my home. You can see your breath.

94
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,280
There's a doorknob. The doorknob is red. I can see my breath because I'm pressed against the glass.

95
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,280
I'm watching this go down. It's my home. Misha Barton is there. She's thrown up. You're so gross,

96
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,280
Misha Barton. Get out of here. The question is, does the professor know that you're going to be

97
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,000
staying there too? Because if so, he already knows what's up. If you're like, I'm staying here with

98
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,920
my boyfriend. Also, he's fucking dirty. I wouldn't stay in the house now. I wouldn't stay at any house

99
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,760
that any professor, a college professor, I assume so since that's the only people that people get

100
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,360
called professor. Anytime an adult professor says, yes, you and your boyfriend can stay here,

101
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:31,760
you shouldn't stay there because he wants to collect your fluids. What? Why would you jump

102
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,760
there? It's a part of some sort of experiment. I was going to say it was like a manicam set up

103
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,640
to watch you do it, but you took it to a place. Oh, so mine is less creepy than that thing you

104
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,800
just said. Yes, because mine's voyeurism and yours involves collecting things. Yeah, it does.

105
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,960
Samples. You shouldn't do it for a lot of reasons. No, you're exactly right. There's cameras all

106
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,920
over the place. The place is wired like some fucking deleted scene out of sneakers. There's

107
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,840
lots of cams all over, nanny cams, teddy cams, camera cameras. Yeah, they hide cameras in cameras.

108
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,880
Yeah, so you break the outer camera and you're like, haha, foiled them. What you didn't see.

109
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,800
It's the matryoshka dolls of cameras. I probably didn't say that right, but it came from a place

110
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:29,360
of ignorance. It's actually matryoshka. This guy is going to walk in at the end of summer and be

111
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,600
like, did you enjoy my house? Did you enjoy being me for a while? And you guys will say yes, and

112
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,560
you'll start to walk out and then he'll slam the door shut and padlock it and he'll say, hold up.

113
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,600
And then he'll flip a switch and all the lights in the house will go off and then he'll flip on

114
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,520
another switch and a bunch of black lights are going to come on. And then he's going to lead

115
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:56,960
you through the house by the nose and point to all of the glowing, all of the iridescent detritus

116
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,320
that you have left around the house, followed by a family circus cartoon. I know you sexed there.

117
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,200
I know you sexed there. Twice there. Good job. I'm just saying there's no such thing as a fucking

118
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,240
free lunch. This guy is going to jerk off to you somehow. Everyone is just looking for a chance to

119
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,720
jerk off to you. Right. If you see a sign up in front of Quiznos, it's like free lunches.

120
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,840
Just go ahead and assume that you're going to be like, cool. Can you do one quick favor?

121
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,520
One quickie. Just a quick thing. You're going to do it anyway, but do it here now.

122
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,440
This is so weird. I feel uncomfortable house sitting for anyone. Why do you feel?

123
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,920
You're always into it. Like you're always into it beforehand because you think like.

124
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Vacation home. Yeah. You think like, Oh, this is what it's like to have like a villa or something

125
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,000
that you go stay at, but it's not. It's like more like breaking and entering. Well, okay.

126
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,920
You would, you go there, but like I'm, for me, it's more like an episode of wife swap,

127
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,880
but there, but nobody else is there. So, so it's just a surviving swap. It's a surviving mother.

128
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,720
Maybe the rest of her family died in a fire. And so they, I have swapped with her.

129
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:16,160
Why? Okay. With the memories. Just walking around the house. You're like, man, this fucking sucks.

130
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,440
I can see how this would have been a pretty good scene pre-fire, but this place is like a

131
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,720
museum to her sadness. These rooms are locked. I can look through the keyhole and just see dusty

132
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,920
rocking horses. This is terrible. I want to fuck in here. I'm going to fuck in here and recite lines

133
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,800
from ordinary people. This is going to be great. Next week, I'm going to have the best scene study

134
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,360
class of my life. My sense of memory is fucking topped off. It's out of control. I'm feeling this.

135
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,400
Let's Griffin, let's talk about something less upsetting. If you want to take it to Yahoo,

136
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:58,000
if you want to take it to Yahoo, that is not possible. This Yahoo was sent in by Addy twice.

137
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,600
Thanks Addy. It's by Yahoo answers user country girl, 2415. It is unintelligible. She asks

138
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,120
if a guy wants to take you for a ride in his car. Okay. So his name is Chris. He's my old, sorry,

139
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,160
no punctuation in this entire fucking diatribe. Okay. So his name is Chris. He's my older brother's

140
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,320
friend. And I know he knows I love him anyway. My favorite cars are convertible Mustangs. And

141
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,680
he knew that so like a couple of months ago, he went out and bought. Also, I was considering buying

142
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,000
one before him anyway. I really love this guy, but sadly he has a hot G who I think hates me,

143
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,640
but whatever. Uh, but today he came up to show me hot G uh, GF. Okay. I want to stick with G.

144
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:49,600
Yeah. He has a really sexy G who I think hates me, whatever. But today he came to show me his car

145
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,000
and we have been really talking ever since he dated, started dating this gal. So anyway,

146
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,080
his friends and my brother went for a ride in his car. Then he came back and dropped my brother off.

147
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,640
Then my mom and family came to look at the car. Then they told him he should take me for a ride.

148
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,640
And I was like, no way he'll drive too fast. And then he said, no, I won't. I will drive fast. Then

149
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:16,080
he said, I'll take you for a ride sometime. Then left. Doesn't mean anything. This is the best

150
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:23,200
short story ever. I listen, dear penthouse. I never thought it would happen. Dear penthouse.

151
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,360
Okay. So his name is Chris. He's my older brother's friend and I know he knows I love him anyway.

152
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,440
Listen, Vin, I know you're excited about your first time directing a Fast and Furious film.

153
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:40,560
I think this whole scene you've written is going to end up on the proverbial cutting room floor.

154
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,480
I really don't think you have any sort of dramatic motion here.

155
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,160
It is basically just a girl almost getting in a car and then not.

156
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,920
Listen, Luda, I appreciate what you've done for me, but I do need you to take the nitrous out.

157
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:02,400
I do not like to drive fast. I live my life a 20th of a mile at a time. And it takes me a

158
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:09,600
while to get there. It feels more like a Nicholas Sparks novel. I mean, she's excited about this guy.

159
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:18,800
She thinks he's showing some interest by buying the car she likes best. I like the part where she

160
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,680
says she was thinking about buying it before him, which I don't like to throw stones or cast

161
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,880
dispersion, but based on this, I can estimate that this person's reading level is three.

162
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,680
Three. So I doubt that they have the finances required to buy a convertible Mustang.

163
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,560
However, I do like the logic of now that he's bought one,

164
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,640
I will be unable to, for there is only one in the world.

165
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,200
Sure.

166
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,800
One in this town, maybe.

167
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,560
Well, and also like, he knows-

168
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,480
This is a one Mustang town.

169
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,720
He knows she knows he loves- He knows that she loves him, right?

170
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,960
I don't know if you guys heard that part. He's got this banging jeep.

171
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,880
He's got the hottest jeep.

172
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,080
Hates her fucking guts. Oh my God, does she hate her?

173
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,320
But the jeep doesn't fit. That's what's so weird about this story for me is-

174
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:06,880
We'll break it down, Justin.

175
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:14,960
If I understand this correctly. Okay, so Stephanie loves this car.

176
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,040
Uh-huh. Let's be honest, Steffi.

177
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,960
Steffi loves Mustangs.

178
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,440
Let's be honest. Stump.

179
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,400
Okay.

180
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,840
Okay, stump.

181
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:33,600
Okay, so Destiny loves Mustangs and then this guy who she loves and knows loves him buys a Mustang.

182
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:33,840
Right.

183
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:43,440
He's got a jeep that's really sort of, I would say almost a tertiary character in this particular

184
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:53,920
tale. The guy shows up at Destiny's door with the Mustang that she loves and he knows she loves.

185
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,400
Uh-huh.

186
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,640
And he offers to give her a ride into the sunset and she says,

187
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,080
you will drive too fast. I cannot accommodate you in this request.

188
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,640
Justin, that's a fucking metaphor.

189
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:04,960
Yeah.

190
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,320
He's gonna drive too fast. She's afraid that the relationship will move too fast and he's like,

191
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,840
no, it won't. It'll be fine.

192
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:18,000
But she's too afraid to go and the jeep represents the star-crossed love interest that's going on

193
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,680
here. She's the barrier.

194
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:25,760
He bought the car because he knew it was her favorite car, making it the most self-serving

195
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,680
romantic gesture in the history of all gestures.

196
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,520
I bought that car you like, but it's also mine.

197
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,880
The sweetest car ever.

198
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,600
But we didn't answer the question. We just made fun of it. Does it mean anything?

199
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,520
Of course it means something. In this crazy mixed up world where two people can barely find each

200
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,360
other as it is, if you can bond over the love of a sweet ass Mustang, then you need to literally

201
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,520
hop on board and go. Get out of this one horse town.

202
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,520
I never in my youth, which I'm assuming this person is in.

203
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,640
I think that's a bold question.

204
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,680
I think that's a bold choice because if she were 40, this is a way better question.

205
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,200
This is a way sadder question.

206
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,080
But I never, and a lot of my friends in high school did it because I had a lot of, which

207
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,920
is bizarre because I was driving an Oldsmobile Colosseum that Justin gave me shortly after

208
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,560
it died.

209
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,920
Justin asked me to drive around in the carcass of his rusty tauntaun.

210
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,720
Most of Griffin's cruising in those days is like foot powered like red Flintstone.

211
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,440
Yeah, yeah.

212
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,880
It's a good learner, though.

213
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,960
You learn how to fix your power steering and fix tires.

214
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,720
You learn how to convince your dad's shady mechanic friend to give you a fake inspection

215
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,640
sticker because there's no fucking way that any certified agency will give you one.

216
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,160
You know what? I did that.

217
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,960
The guy you're referring to who shall not be named told me I needed to go to Tri-State

218
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,440
Tire and ask for a guy named Whistle.

219
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:09,760
And Whistle would give, and if I asked for Whistle, he'd give me an inspection sticker.

220
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,120
God, that dude was awesome.

221
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,280
That dude's renegade spirit fucking inspired me as a human being.

222
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,840
Anyway, I had a lot of automotive enthusiast friends who would like, what do you want to

223
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,240
do tonight?

224
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,440
Let's go driving.

225
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,240
And whenever they'd invite me along, I'd be like, to where?

226
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,200
To Blockbuster?

227
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,560
If we're going to Blockbuster or Outback, just fucking pick a place and let's go to

228
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:32,880
there.

229
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,800
I just don't get that.

230
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,920
It's a locomotion.

231
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,200
It takes you from one point to the other.

232
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,680
I don't get that.

233
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,160
A to B.

234
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,200
A to B.

235
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,080
You know what, Griffin?

236
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,840
It's not about the destination.

237
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,360
It's about the journey.

238
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,080
Exactly.

239
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,480
Yeah, and when you saw one pair of footprints, that was me walking away from your offer to

240
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,600
go driving because it sounded like-

241
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,040
Because I was afraid you'd do it too fast and I was worried about your GIF.

242
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,280
Yeah.

243
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,040
You know, the Blockbuster closed here.

244
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,120
Yeah, it closed like a decade ago.

245
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
It probably because you stole so many fucking-

246
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,360
It was built.

247
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,000
Probably because you stole so many video cassettes from them.

248
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,920
Did you think about that, Justin?

249
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,120
They b- to what?

250
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,920
You ever look at that box that you have full of stolen video cassette tapes in the Blockbuster

251
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,520
video and think, I'm sorry, old friend.

252
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,040
You gave me-

253
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,640
I changed your lifeblood.

254
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,080
You gave me employ at a very hungry time in my life and I have betrayed you in this manner.

255
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,840
They built the Blockbuster on the same spot where they tore down Ronald's cheese corner

256
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,520
and now Blockbuster's closed, so I don't know if that's a net loss or what.

257
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,080
Hey, here's another question.

258
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,320
My girlfriend and I both have our five-year high school reunions this year.

259
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,480
When this came up in recent conversation, she implied that she intended to bring me to hers.

260
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,440
This surprised me because I was under the impression that you only bring people with

261
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,920
whom you are not in very serious relationships, i.e-

262
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,600
No, with whom you are.

263
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,400
With whom you are in very serious relationships.

264
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,240
I- Sorry, it's my first day reading.

265
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,720
I.e.

266
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,240
Fiancés and wives to high school reunions.

267
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,960
This is not to say we aren't in a serious relationship.

268
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,040
We've been dating for almost a year and a half.

269
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,160
Plan to move in together ASAP, but I'm not sure what's culturally acceptable.

270
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,840
What's the right move here, brothers?

271
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,960
If I do go, any dos and don'ts, to go or not to go?

272
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,880
Well, we're going to make this one real easy for you.

273
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,880
If she says you're going, you're going.

274
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,360
You're going.

275
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,080
Well, there.

276
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,280
I mean, how's that?

277
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,160
Don't make it-

278
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,840
It's dudes and ladies.

279
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,120
This is not a gender-

280
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,840
Okay, because it just fucking quickly took a sharp veer towards Jeff Fox.

281
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,680
No, no, no, this is not like because you're wrapped around your little finger in your whip

282
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,400
kind of thing.

283
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,920
This is not a Ray Romano event.

284
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:49,600
I'm saying if the person in your relationship says, will you be the metric of quality by

285
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,520
which my current life will be judged as opposed to my high school life, and you say no-

286
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,960
I don't believe it's culturally acceptable for me to go, honey.

287
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,600
Sorry, I'd love to, but it's such a faux pas.

288
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm going to check the mores, but I'm pretty sure that I can't be that yardstick for you.

289
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,760
What's next, white after Labor Day?

290
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,720
Come on.

291
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,920
I think you go, because I have not been to my reunion yet.

292
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,440
Fuck, it's coming up, ain't it?

293
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:22,240
Anyway, I haven't been to my reunion yet, but when I do, I don't know.

294
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,680
I'm not going to see any of those fucking people ever again, you know?

295
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:31,280
A lot of them probably don't know who I was, because I fucking skirted it at high school,

296
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,200
by which I mean I was on the outskirts of not that I was chasing skirts.

297
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,600
Like, I'm just going to fucking live it up, because you get one chance, you know what I mean?

298
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,160
I didn't go to mine, so I don't know what you mean.

299
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,560
Here's the bigger thing, because I just went to my tenure, and I'll say this.

300
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:54,000
You go with her, she'll go with you, because you need all the help you can get to get through

301
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,040
some of the situations you'll be put in, namely not remembering who any of those people are.

302
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,360
And so you need a partner there to do the introduction game with,

303
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,280
and so that way you can remember their names.

304
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,640
I do get what this person is saying though, because how long have they been dating?

305
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,120
A year?

306
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,120
That's long enough.

307
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:17,840
Like, I have been in that position before where you are at a group function with somebody you

308
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,360
have not been dating very long.

309
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:25,040
They know everybody there, you know nobody, and every time you are introduced it is,

310
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,560
because it's like, how do you guys know each other?

311
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,000
But, oh, we've been dating for three weeks.

312
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,200
And they get that look in their eye like, then why the fuck did you bring them?

313
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,960
Yeah, why are you here?

314
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,000
Why did you agree to come?

315
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,520
This is a social violation.

316
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,760
I think a better question is, why would anyone go to their five-year high school reunion?

317
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,720
I know, I saw you guys last fucking week.

318
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,200
Yeah, right?

319
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,880
Like, hey, what have you guys been up to?

320
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,560
Oh, I just graduated college.

321
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,720
Or, oh, I didn't go to college.

322
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,160
Well, have you done anything?

323
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,000
No, I'm like 23.

324
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,240
Cool, cool, good check-in.

325
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,840
See you guys in five years when it matters.

326
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,840
I just found out about IKEA, which is pretty cool.

327
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,600
I've just been catching up on Amazing Grace.

328
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,320
In 20 years, this will not, like, reunions will not exist.

329
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,880
There is no way, five, 10, I mean, it's crazy to me that we're even like, if I wanted, listen,

330
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:22,240
it's 2013, if I wanted to even, like, vaguely keep tabs on you, then I would.

331
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,520
I would know who you are and who you're balling and everything.

332
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,560
This is gonna be fun.

333
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,800
I'm gonna go to my high school reunion right now, and that is the group

334
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,440
on Facebook called Huntington High School Class of 2005.

335
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,000
It has gotten to a certain point in technology where I have to actively

336
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,640
work to not know things about people.

337
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,200
Jesus Christ.

338
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,440
Yeah.

339
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,680
That's a way you gotta treat your reunion.

340
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Like, from now on, you have to treat it like trailers for a movie you're really excited

341
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:51,920
about.

342
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,560
Like, no, no, no, I can't be friends with you on Facebook.

343
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,440
I'm saving it all up.

344
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,600
I really wanna be surprised when you're dead.

345
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:57,920
Or when you're married.

346
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,280
Of course I know you have a kid.

347
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,880
Ah, damn it, spoilers.

348
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,320
I spoiled it for myself.

349
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,880
Wow, has it been that long?

350
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,200
Yep.

351
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,960
It has been that long.

352
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,520
It has been seven years, to be precise.

353
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,040
You guys remember?

354
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:11,920
Nope.

355
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,040
Nope.

356
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,720
No, I do not.

357
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,240
Do you hear about Mr. Stinkins?

358
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,240
I did not hear about him.

359
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,840
I did not.

360
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,560
He taught me good about algebra, though, I guess.

361
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:30,480
I don't really remember much about it, but he ended up sprees, so that was nice.

362
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
I went to Sydney's reunion.

363
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,600
It was something.

364
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,480
Is that all you got in the chamber?

365
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,840
That's all I got!

366
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,440
She was so excited because, like, things had been going pretty well for her.

367
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,280
And so she was gonna show everybody, and, like, we get there and she realizes that, like,

368
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:55,040
the only people that are there are kind of disasters.

369
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,920
It's not really like, you know, I trumped the quarterback.

370
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,480
She did have that portion of people at hers that I knew that had gotten, like,

371
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
that had had a bad term.

372
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:17,440
But you'll be surprised at how little traction you can get out of capitalizing on pleasure

373
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,040
from others' misfortune.

374
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,680
That is despite, despite.

375
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,280
Oh, you live here at the high school.

376
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh, in the gym.

377
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,920
You haunt it like the Phantom of the Opera.

378
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,080
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

379
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,960
Where's your nest?

380
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,000
Underneath the bleachers.

381
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,200
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

382
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,760
If there are two things in this world that I despise.

383
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,200
Sorry, I meant to say love, and then this whole thing is gonna be sarcastic, but let's cut through

384
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,700
the bullshit.

385
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:50,740
It is trying to remember people's names whom I do not know, and they do know me, and also

386
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,940
telling people what I do for a living, and then having to explain to them that yes,

387
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,140
it is indeed a real job.

388
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:04,100
And it sounds like my high school reunion is just gonna be an evening of that.

389
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:13,140
Yep, just a whole, you know, whenever I describe my living to norms, I always end up saying,

390
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,900
you know, like Roger Ebert, but for video games, which is like, which is okay.

391
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,700
You sell out.

392
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,180
Every sentence is a sellout you make.

393
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,060
Just the worst.

394
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,980
What I realized going to mine is because I think I have a really cool job.

395
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,820
I work in professional theater and everything, but what I realized is the people that went

396
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,380
to the reunion, and some of them I really love, and they're like actual friends of mine,

397
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,820
they don't think it's cool.

398
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,580
They think what they do is cool.

399
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,780
You know, it's like nobody's gonna sit there and go, holy shit, really?

400
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,980
That's amazing.

401
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,020
My job's bullshit.

402
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,300
Your job's awesome.

403
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,180
Like, because everybody else is going to the reunion for the same reason.

404
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:54,020
Right, because if they did fucking live at the high school and worked at Arby's, not

405
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,620
that there's anything wrong with working at Arby's.

406
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,780
If you work at Arby's, thank you for your service.

407
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:04,340
But if they work at Arby's, which is a fucking clown job, then they're not gonna go to the

408
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,220
fucking reunion.

409
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,500
Yeah, no one is gonna play the foil to your little power fantasy.

410
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,540
I know I shouldn't go to the reunion.

411
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,260
I know I'm gonna be consistently embarrassed the whole time.

412
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,780
But Travis needs this.

413
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,020
But Travis really needs this.

414
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,780
I was sort of a bully too in high school.

415
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,060
It's the least I can do.

416
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,580
Guys, what you don't understand is I just get enjoyment out of the smile on my children's

417
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,060
face.

418
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:31,700
It's not about how successful I am, but for Travis, Travis will be empty if I'm not there.

419
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,980
Do your due diligence.

420
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:38,180
Do your 10 minutes at the real reunion, then come back upstairs to the old Mr. Stinkerson

421
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:45,540
science room at the Arby's to the 10-year Arby's reunion, which is where you'll stay

422
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,420
for the rest of the night.

423
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,140
I wish that you had to agree to that in high school.

424
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,060
Listen, everyone talked about it, and you've been kind of a dick.

425
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,180
Yeah, no, 1999.

426
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,660
Okay, but listen, you have to go to the reunion.

427
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,940
No matter what.

428
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,820
Legally sweet.

429
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,820
Yeah, but would not, especially in my life.

430
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,060
Has to go.

431
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,940
Has to be there.

432
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,020
I hope that at my reunion, they wheel everybody out like a debutante's ball, and as they walk

433
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,660
into the room, they announce every fucking detail of your life for the past 10 years.

434
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,460
Your mistakes, your follies, your successes.

435
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,780
Michael has been in three hit and runs in three years.

436
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,300
DUIs, don't get him started.

437
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,260
Antoine lost 100 pounds, then he gained 200.

438
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,300
Here's a great idea.

439
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:42,260
If you look forward to your reunion, instead, why don't you call all the people you were

440
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,820
friends with in high school and just like hang out with them?

441
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,980
Have a second reunion.

442
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,820
Hey, Steve, I haven't seen you in a while.

443
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,140
Let's grab a drink while I'm in town, and don't fucking go to the actual reunion.

444
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,100
But then what if old Cindy Lou is there?

445
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,860
Well, not Cindy Lou, because that's the girl.

446
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,060
That's the girl from the Grinch.

447
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,660
What is Cindy Lou?

448
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,220
Who is there?

449
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:03,620
What if Darren is there?

450
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,300
And now she's 22.

451
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,260
Remember Darren that you used to flirt with in cooking class?

452
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:08,980
What if he's there?

453
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,300
Remember Mikhail?

454
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,420
Remember Mikhail and his navy?

455
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,900
And Tom Arnold's there, and he's looking good.

456
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,420
Yeah, Mikhail always showed off his navy, and he would always...

457
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,620
Remember your friend Hogan?

458
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,740
He had all those heroes.

459
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,780
Oh, and who's that?

460
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,500
It's the old F Troop gang hanging out on the bleachers again.

461
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,100
What a weird...

462
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,300
There's Demi Gillis.

463
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,820
He always has his tail to tell.

464
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,340
I'm so glad I went to high school at Nick at Night.

465
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,020
Come at night on our door.

466
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,420
It's winter to a school.

467
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:55,060
And you go to school, and then you learn Three's Company High.

468
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,580
Oh, man.

469
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,220
Fuck I miss John Ritter.

470
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,660
I miss John Ritter every day.

471
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,620
Every goddamn day.

472
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,940
Can we go to the Money Zone with the hopes that we will raise enough money

473
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,540
to invent the science to make John Ritter come back to life?

474
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,700
Trav, who's this first message for?

475
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,580
This is for Tom.

476
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:29,860
Tom?

477
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:30,740
Yeah.

478
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,420
Yeah, wait, is this the Tom that knows Peter and Matt?

479
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:34,980
Yes, it is.

480
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:40,980
And they would like to wish Tom a happy 21st birthday for Monday, the 25th of March,

481
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,980
which we might have missed.

482
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,100
But happy birthday.

483
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,380
Man, I bet they were psyched.

484
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,420
Monday, it happened.

485
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,620
It finally aligned.

486
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,940
Monday's when the bim-bams come out, and that's his birthday.

487
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,260
And then we blew it.

488
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:52,820
We blew it.

489
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,300
Tom's awesome at piano and does web things and stuff,

490
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,540
and we're just really into Tom right now.

491
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,900
Have you heard the new Tom?

492
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,260
Yeah, he's not quite as mainstream as a Jim or a Dave.

493
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,980
So I just think it's a little indie right now.

494
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,580
I'm really into indie Tom.

495
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,380
Oh, man.

496
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,100
His old stuff is way better than his new stuff.

497
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,820
I agree.

498
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,980
Before he went all corporate.

499
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,780
While we're on the subject, well, it's not really the subject,

500
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,300
but it's close enough, quick retraction.

501
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:26,100
I hate to derail our Money Zone flow, but quick retraction, quick correction.

502
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,740
That new Justin Timberlake album is fucking off the chains.

503
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,380
And I think two or three episodes ago, I said it was...

504
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,540
I said it was bunko.

505
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,300
I think it's my exact words.

506
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,660
And it is the dopest.

507
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,260
I set my ringtone to push her love, girl.

508
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,620
I can't fucking get enough.

509
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,020
Anyway, that's just a quick retraction.

510
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,420
Can you assure me that you will edit that part

511
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,540
and place it at a more appropriate juncture in the show?

512
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:47,780
Yeah.

513
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,060
A more relevant juncture?

514
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,700
We just need to make sure that-

515
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,980
Maybe put it in the Money Zone.

516
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,260
Put it in the Money Zone.

517
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,100
In 20 minutes from now, we just need to make sure

518
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,140
that we very fluidly talk about Justin Timberlake.

519
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,700
Okay.

520
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,180
Hey, I want everybody to go to Axe Cop Wedding.

521
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,580
We're gonna help Ethan fund his wedding.

522
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,700
Now, who's Ethan, you ask?

523
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:08,820
Well, the Axe Cop is, as you know, a webcomic written by an eight-year-old

524
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,900
and drawn by his 32-year-old brother.

525
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,300
They've been creating it since they were five and 29

526
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,260
and have produced four graphic novels with Dark Horse Comics

527
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,860
and have a TV show that works at Fox.

528
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,500
Ethan, the older brother, is getting married

529
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,780
and is doing a campaign to sell artwork to raise money for his wedding.

530
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,380
He's selling exclusive print.

531
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:32,420
There's a sketchbook and there's lots of other items, Axe Cop Wedding.com.

532
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,140
So we're gonna-

533
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,660
If you guys have not checked out Axe Cop-

534
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:40,580
Guys, Axe Cop, I can't remember when I first got involved

535
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:46,020
when I started doing Axe Cop, but goddamn, it is so good.

536
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:47,780
It's the best.

537
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:53,460
Obviously, you want to get over to Axe Cop Wedding.com and help Ethan out,

538
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,420
but also get something for yourself in the process

539
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:02,740
because obviously altruism is an illusion

540
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,420
and you, too, can help Axe Cop get married.

541
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,780
But not just you, too.

542
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,300
You can also do it.

543
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,940
Yeah, don't leave all the goodness to you, too.

544
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,820
They have done enough.

545
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,140
Listen, Bono already does so much for us.

546
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,340
He does so much for us.

547
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,060
Hey, I want to wish a very happy birthday to Cory and Atchison.

548
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,020
And I hope you're enjoying it.

549
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:29,060
And that comes to us from a mysterious,

550
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,540
very dedicated MBMBA and listening partner,

551
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,060
Corrin, I hope you know who we're referring to.

552
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:40,100
Otherwise, you are probably about to be killed.

553
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,980
Oh my God.

554
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,860
Look behind you, Corrin!

555
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,580
Oh, the spookiest Money Zone message.

556
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,180
Very spook-

557
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,220
Well, it's the spookiest Money Zone message.

558
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,340
Corrin's very, very happy birthday was the spookiest

559
00:35:54,340 --> 00:36:00,420
until this next one when we talk about things to put down there.

560
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,420
Hold on one second, guys.

561
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:02,980
Okay.

562
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,180
I just got an email from James saying Sexy Garfield is compromised.

563
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,140
No!

564
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:07,780
Son of a bitch!

565
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,140
Yeah.

566
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,900
Who keeps fucking leaking our shit?

567
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,900
Our shit's leaked!

568
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,620
I will say this, though.

569
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,380
I really enjoy saying the phrase Sexy Garfield is compromised.

570
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,140
It makes me feel like Robert Redford in Spy Games.

571
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,220
This is still in the show, right?

572
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,820
I mean, we're still making our show right now?

573
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,220
Yeah.

574
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:27,700
Yeah.

575
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,260
Okay.

576
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,220
Holy shit.

577
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,020
This is fucking-

578
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,180
We need to get fucking Angelina Jolie.

579
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,540
We need to get Devin Salwa.

580
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,420
Was he in Hackers?

581
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,620
Was Devin Salwa in Hackers?

582
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,660
Was I in Hackers?

583
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,580
Um, we need to get them on the fucking case.

584
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,260
We need to swordfish this fuck.

585
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,340
Who- Hey, fuck!

586
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,340
If you're listening to this show and you're leaking all our fucking coupons to coupon sites,

587
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,660
hey Coupon Hog, can you fucking chill on it for a second, please?

588
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:00,180
Give us a two-week head start to get these coupons out there before you start hogging them all.

589
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,580
You fuck.

590
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,940
Just leave our coups alone.

591
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,340
How do you think that they figure out that it's been compromised?

592
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,100
Do you think they get like a billion dildo requests with that coupon on it?

593
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,220
And they're like, holy shit.

594
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,660
I don't know what the McElroy brothers said on the last podcast,

595
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,060
but it got people lubed and tubed.

596
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,460
Uh, maybe it should be some sort of clue.

597
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,980
Maybe the problem is we're saying it.

598
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,460
Oh my god.

599
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,940
And someone's got like scanners on the show.

600
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,180
Okay.

601
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,580
Maybe they need to get like, you know what I'm saying right now?

602
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,340
Okay, so I'm gonna tap it out in Morse code.

603
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,140
Arebus.

604
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,500
Arebus, perhaps.

605
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,700
Arebus, okay.

606
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,500
What's our new code gonna be?

607
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,620
This is making me so angry.

608
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,820
Well, while we think of it, let's talk about what the site is.

609
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:46,660
It's a site for sexual products of so many kinds.

610
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,220
Real sexy.

611
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:55,220
If you have two to three go-to positions, that is clown sex.

612
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,380
You need to spice up your life.

613
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:04,820
And the way that you do that is with, you know, a rod or a pouch or, uh, you know,

614
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,220
metal spheres or some kind of salve.

615
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,620
Like, all of these things are, but they're sex themed.

616
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,620
They sell them on Extreme Restraints.

617
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:18,820
Otherwise, you've just described all the simple mechanisms as described by Play-Doh.

618
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,620
I've described all of the clue murder weapons.

619
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:30,420
ExtremeRestraints.com is an adult superstore that I have been to so many times.

620
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:37,300
I am no longer offended or even moved by pictures of dicks.

621
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,540
Or welcome in the public library.

622
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:44,980
I am no longer, but the same thing has happened with boobs.

623
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:48,580
I can't feel anything.

624
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:58,660
So I got a one-fit elastic ball stretcher for $7.95 and I sure as fuck felt that.

625
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,900
This is how people get into this stuff.

626
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:06,260
They stop feeling things from looking at pictures of boobs, booberoobs, and ding-dongs.

627
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:06,820
Yeah.

628
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,660
And then they need to stretch them out.

629
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,180
I can only get turned on by fire hydrant sex now.

630
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,780
That's the only thing that does it for me.

631
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,060
And do you guys, you guys know about that, right?

632
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,020
Oh, yeah.

633
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,220
I don't think I've heard about that one.

634
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,860
Oh, man.

635
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,500
It's even hard for me to talk about it without chubbing up.

636
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:36,660
It's when you, you put a, you put a pair of sunglasses on a fire hydrant jerk off on it.

637
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,500
They have a wide selection.

638
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,620
It's not just sex toys.

639
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,900
You've got to put the sunglasses on it though, because it personifies it.

640
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,300
You know what I mean?

641
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,500
Otherwise it's just weird.

642
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,660
They've got a, they've got-

643
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,460
What does that guy do?

644
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,420
Oh, it's got sunglasses.

645
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:50,900
That's fine.

646
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,380
Nevermind.

647
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:51,620
It's a person.

648
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,940
It looks like a little, it looks like a little red person.

649
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,580
It's a person disguised as a fire hydrant.

650
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,340
They got uniforms, if you want that.

651
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,660
They've got a tank top that says police on it.

652
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,980
You know, like police are always wearing.

653
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,860
And there's also one that says fireman.

654
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:11,060
And there's also a tank top and a belly shirt.

655
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,420
Yeah, I'll wear that fireman one.

656
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,940
I'll wear that fireman one.

657
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,380
And then people don't ask questions.

658
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,140
Like that's a weird looking fireman.

659
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,420
I don't think he's doing that right.

660
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,860
And why is that hydrant wearing sunglasses?

661
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,820
Oh, he looks so cut.

662
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,740
They don't have a video game blogger uniform.

663
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,860
So I don't really know what to say about that.

664
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,700
They, oh, they also have erotic art.

665
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,540
If you don't want to put your dick in something,

666
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,300
you just want to put your eyes on it.

667
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:33,940
They got that.

668
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,260
You don't want to make your house guests think about

669
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,780
putting their dicks in something.

670
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:41,540
You can only have that if you are super, super, super rich.

671
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,180
And you have a lot of really big windows.

672
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,300
And also the erotic art is like the only decoration

673
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,660
you have in your house whatsoever.

674
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:54,260
How many zeros have to come out in your paycheck

675
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:58,740
before you can have a sculpture called sexual exploration

676
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,660
and don't raise an eyebrow?

677
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,580
Like how rich does that have to be?

678
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,700
How rich do you have to be to have a hung tied girl sculpture

679
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,940
that costs $249?

680
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,460
Of course you can save 20% with the coupon code

681
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,980
not sexy Garfield because that got fucking compromised.

682
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,220
Fuck.

683
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:17,780
What about this?

684
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,260
What about this leaky coupon?

685
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,180
Leaky coupon.

686
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,460
That's a little unerotic.

687
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,540
It's not very erotic.

688
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,540
How about fuck coupon sites?

689
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,100
Yeah.

690
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,940
And that way if it leaks, they're like, oh, that stinks.

691
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,980
Do you guys think it's China?

692
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,900
Cause China fucking hacked the New York Times

693
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,660
and I think that we might be next.

694
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,620
Maybe it's anonymous.

695
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,820
And by next, I mean last.

696
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,060
Cause we already got, we already got hit a couple of times.

697
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,460
Why don't we use the coupon code Westboro?

698
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,020
That would be good.

699
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:50,020
W-E-S-T-B-O-R-O.

700
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,460
Do you think that would, that would work out?

701
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,860
You save 20% using the coupon code Westboro.

702
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,620
Ira Ray.

703
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,180
Wouldn't that, what better thank you could there be?

704
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,020
Yeah, but then, but then like, I don't know.

705
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:08,180
People are gonna jerk off while thinking about Ira Ray.

706
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,260
Like they don't already?

707
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,700
How about maximum chub?

708
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,200
Chub.

709
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:20,340
Cause it sounds like our name and like chub is like, it's, it's a.

710
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:20,900
Sure.

711
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,500
Chub is like, you know what I mean?

712
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,940
Chub is like a power word.

713
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,060
It's like a dragon shout.

714
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:26,980
You know what I mean?

715
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,260
How about sexy buns?

716
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,900
Cause I feel like that does some good.

717
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,100
Oh, here we go.

718
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,660
This, yeah, we need to get on some grandpa shit.

719
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,580
We need to get like tushy in it.

720
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,020
Oh, I like that.

721
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,540
I don't know how to spell tushy.

722
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,340
Tushy time.

723
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,500
How about sizzle buns?

724
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,300
How about, how about tushy time?

725
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,540
I don't know how to spell.

726
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,860
T-S-H-Y time.

727
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,420
Now see, I went I-E, so.

728
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,100
So now we can't do that one.

729
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:54,420
Okay.

730
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,820
Tuckus, fanny.

731
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,860
Oh, fanny's good.

732
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,740
Fanny time.

733
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,660
Fanny time.

734
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,540
Fanny time.

735
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:01,780
Okay.

736
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,100
Now hold on cause this works on a few levels cause isn't fanny like

737
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,180
a term for a vagina in the UK?

738
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:08,420
Yep.

739
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,500
I like it.

740
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:10,820
Perfect.

741
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,620
Fanny time.

742
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,900
Fanny time.

743
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,700
All one word.

744
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,780

747
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,420
Don't put it in print anywhere.

748
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,100
Don't write it down.

749
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,300
Don't write it down.

750
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,420
Don't let anybody know.

751
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,220
Keep it a secret.

752
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:35,380
If you, if I see any of you motherfuckers, if I see hashtag fanny time on-

753
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,060
If I paper trail this back to you.

754
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,340
If I, oh my God.

755
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:42,820
If I crack your IP address and I go through your proxy server

756
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,900
and I, I will call your dad.

757
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:51,620
And I see that you AOLIM somebody like, hey, check out this new coupon code fanny time.

758
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,220
And it's like some kind of coupon.

759
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:53,780
I'm gonna, I'm gonna-

760
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,620
I'm gonna send it to you cause you don't realize the difference.

761
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,900
I'm gonna tweet hashtag fanny time cause nothing's funnier on the internet

762
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,940
than when somebody asks you not to do something and then you do the opposite.

763
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:02,500
Oh guys.

764
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,220
So don't be a dick.

765
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,420
Ooh, I will come down on you with God's own fury.

766
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,380
Oh my God.

767
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,660
You'll be blocked from everything.

768
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,900
We'll IP ban you from getting this show ever again.

769
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,540
I will not pass over you with my bands.

770
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,660
He will kill your firstborn son with his sculpture called Hogtide Girl.

771
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,660
Your firstborn son will never even know who we are,

772
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,180
which is probably accurate for most people listening to this show.

773
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,380
I'm Cameron Esposito and I'm the host of Maximum Fun's new podcast,

774
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,780
Wham Bam Pow, a sci-fi movie show and action movies.

775
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,180
Also, did I forget to say action movies?

776
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,100
Every week I'll be joined by Mr-

777
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:40,900
Ricky Carmona.

778
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,620
And Ms-

779
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,420
Rhea Butcher.

780
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,940
And we are going to chat about films.

781
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:44,980
We're going to tell jokes.

782
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,100
We're going to be hilarious.

783
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,060
We're going to play games.

784
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,020
We're going to have guests.

785
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,060
We're going to give reviews.

786
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,580
It's going to blow your mind.

787
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:54,260
If you want to listen to the show, you can find it at maximumfun.org

788
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,780
or you can subscribe on iTunes.

789
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,700
Can you believe how many things I just listed?

790
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,420
So many things.

791
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:00,680
Wham!

792
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,680
Wham!

793
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,320
That's great.

794
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,000
My fiancee and I are getting married in June

795
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,440
and we'll be starting the process of adopting a child shortly thereafter.

796
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,400
How nice.

797
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,760
That's all very exciting.

798
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,520
But one thing is already stressing me out.

799
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,760
We have no idea what the kids should call us.

800
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,000
Dad and dad is too confusing.

801
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,360
Father makes it sound like I'm going to use a whistle to summon them,

802
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,880
ala Mr.

803
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,600
Von Tramp.

804
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,320
I think it's Von Trap.

805
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,520
I think it's Von Trap.

806
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,200
Von Trap would be a way better movie.

807
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,200
Use the coupon code Von Trap.

808
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,960
Papa just makes it sound like I sing.

809
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,640
I like it when you call me big papa.

810
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,600
What are some alternatives to dad one and dad two?

811
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,880
Or should we go full happy and just full hippy?

812
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,380
Fuck!

813
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,000
And just have them call us by our first names.

814
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,080
And this is from clearly dad one in Portland.

815
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,720
Man, you gotta, you don't even fucking realize.

816
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,560
There is no best option.

817
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,600
There is only a least worst option in this department.

818
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,960
And you need to fucking get down on that land grab before he snatches it up.

819
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,400
Seriously, is there anything?

820
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,720
We don't have the good note.

821
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,720
We don't have good nomenclature for this.

822
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,560
You can have, he can call one of you Paul Reiser and the other one Greg Evigan.

823
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,600
Can we do that?

824
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,320
I don't even get your reference, but it sounds hateful.

825
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,920
That's why would you ever call anyone Paul Reiser, Dustin?

826
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,440
Because Paul Reiser and Greg Evigan were on the hit series My Two Dads.

827
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,120
Someone really enjoyed that joke.

828
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:34,760
I'm not, it was Paul Reiser listening at home.

829
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,280
Such a treat to have you, Paul.

830
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,960
That wasn't as mean as I thought it was going to be.

831
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,080
I love your early live stuff.

832
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,280
He kind of lost it later, but.

833
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,200
Mad About You was not a bad show at all.

834
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,800
Do you guys think him and Helen Hunt ever fucked?

835
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,360
All the time.

836
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,840
I bet they shared a trailer.

837
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,200
I bet they did.

838
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,920
This is hard for me because I know them both so well.

839
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,920
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to put you in a place, Justin.

840
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,240
Just have him call you, what's wrong with dad?

841
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,840
Hey, what's wrong with dad?

842
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,000
What about daddy and dad?

843
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:12,360
And then depending on who they like better in any given moment, that person becomes daddy.

844
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,880
I like that.

845
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,520
Pretty sure you lifted that off an episode of Modern Family though.

846
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:17,800
Really?

847
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,400
I've never watched Modern Family, so that would be quite the feat.

848
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,560
Yeah, I've never seen Star Wars, but wouldn't it be cool if there were swords made of light?

849
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,160
That's you right now.

850
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,200
I'm not telling the truth.

851
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,840
Can I tell you guys a word about My Two Dads,

852
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,080
since you're obviously kind of out of the loop on this one?

853
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,360
Giovanni Ribisi was starred on this show.

854
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:40,600
Okay.

855
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,200
Here's another fact.

856
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:50,840
At the top of the Wikipedia page, it says for the Scrubs episode, see My Two Dads Scrubs.

857
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:55,400
So I don't know who the target demo is for this Wikipedia page,

858
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,520
but you've accidentally stumbled on this.

859
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:05,320
It is the same target audience of this goof that you are baking up in the crock pot.

860
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,480
It only got three seasons, did you guys know that?

861
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,640
I didn't because like remembering other things,

862
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,080
you just booted something out of my brain that I would have preferred to keep in there,

863
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:15,640
a nice recipe.

864
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,520
Did you know, did you know that My Two Dads had a crossover with Nightcore

865
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,560
where they're in the same verse?

866
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,720
I did not know that.

867
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,240
Is that like when Family Matters and Step by Step crossover?

868
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,680
See, I know those two shows.

869
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,360
Those are all on the same verse.

870
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:31,800
That's amazing.

871
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,360
There is a TGIF verse, right?

872
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,520
Yeah, because there's one episode.

873
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,080
Okay, so there was one episode where Sabrina the Teenager,

874
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,760
the cat ate like some kind of magic hairball that transported everyone through time

875
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,920
and he traveled through all the different shows on one night

876
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,080
and they had like a show in the 40s and like a show in the 50s

877
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,560
and a show in the 60s and a show in the 70s, right?

878
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,680
Okay, yep, yep.

879
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,240
All the things.

880
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,720
But he also, so here, the verses are continually connected though

881
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,120
because the Family Matters verse is linked to the Full House verse.

882
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:00,920
Obviously.

883
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,440
They're, that's in the TGIF verse.

884
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,040
No, it's a Step by Step verse.

885
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:04,440
I don't know Full House.

886
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,480
No, no, no, no, no, no.

887
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,000
They're in the same verse.

888
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,480
Okay.

889
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,280
Like Step by Step verse, Full House verse, Family Matters verse,

890
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,720
they're all in the same, they're linked by Urkel.

891
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,120
Do you guys remember, do you guys remember Grandpa Wabi?

892
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,200
Because I can't remember what his face looks like now.

893
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,280
That's, you just, you just fucking replaced that RAM.

894
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:18,920
Damn.

895
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,920
Steve Urkel is pen pals with Cory Matthews.

896
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,640
So yes, the Boy Meets World verse is the same as the TGIF,

897
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,000
is in the TGIF verse.

898
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,800
Like they're all in the same verse linked by the fucking Time Walker.

899
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,880
The one who walks between dimensions that is Steve Urkel.

900
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:43,080
Steve is the thread that ties this tapestry together.

901
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,800
Okay, I have a suggestion for the question asker.

902
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,680
Take it a completely different direction, because your kids don't know shit.

903
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,400
Because there's a kid.

904
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:49,640
Hey.

905
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,320
No, have them call you like-

906
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,520
Hey, you're a fucking idiot kid.

907
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,880
Hey, this kid that knows nothing, and you're teaching him about the world,

908
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,880
have him call you guys like Tango and Cash.

909
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,680
Like take it a completely different way.

910
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,040
That's fantastic.

911
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:02,360
Just like-

912
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,840
But if the fucking social services hears your child call you guys that,

913
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,760
where'd our kid go?

914
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,960
There's a kid shaped puff of smoke here, where a kid once stood.

915
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,440
This is my dad's, turn around and hooch.

916
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,800
Nope, this is the back seat of my Volvo.

917
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,160
I'm taking you somewhere much safer.

918
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,720
These are my dad's, stop with my mom and shoot.

919
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,600
This is my dad Rocky and Rocky too.

920
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,520
I think I misunderstood your bitch.

921
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,640
No, you nailed it.

922
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,360
You're doing great.

923
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:32,840
You did good.

924
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,400
Got it in one.

925
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,040
You guys want Yahoo?

926
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,400
Yeah, please.

927
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,680
This one's sent in by Ira Ray.

928
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,520
Are you serious?

929
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,320
Are you Ira Ray?

930
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,360
Who wants to know?

931
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,160
God damn it.

932
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,120
I always fucking guess.

933
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,280
It's always the one you don't do that I try for.

934
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,720
We need to formalize this system off the air.

935
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,040
By Yahoo Answers.

936
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:54,680
Oh, thank you Ira.

937
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Daniel who asks,

938
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,520
I accidentally sent a naked pic to my grandpa.

939
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,200
How do I keep this from being awkward?

940
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:09,000
I was texting and I accidentally sent a naked pic of myself to my grandpa.

941
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,560
Don't fucking waste my time for repeating the headline.

942
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,520
Is that so much to ask?

943
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,280
It's storytelling 101.

944
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,080
A fresh lead.

945
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,680
I want the inverted pyramid.

946
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,040
Why did you send a naked picture?

947
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:23,880
My family is going-

948
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,120
Tragedy struck this afternoon.

949
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,800
Dateline, my house.

950
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,800
He never saw it coming.

951
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,160
My family is going to go over to his house this Monday for a family reunion.

952
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,640
How do I keep things from being awkward between me and my grandpa?

953
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,160
I love Daniel.

954
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,080
Literally, the only option you have is to try to get him arrested.

955
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,040
That is the only option you have.

956
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,200
If you're ever going to have any semblance of a normal life again, he's gone now.

957
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,640
God, I just had the meanest idea ever.

958
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,000
Hit me.

959
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,680
It's like I haven't said anything this mean in a long time.

960
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:07,240
Like, since that joke I made about Lou Gehrig's disease, like, this is a top fiver.

961
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,200
What's your idea?

962
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,200
What if you installed-

963
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:20,680
What if you, on your senile grandparent's phone, you installed Snapchat,

964
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:33,640
and that was the only program you used to send them family pictures?

965
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:38,440
Why would you do that to him?

966
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,200
Look at this beautiful picture of my child.

967
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,080
Oh, it was on here.

968
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:41,400
Hold on.

969
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,600
Hold on, I'm fine.

970
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,360
He was at NAG's head.

971
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,200
He was putting his head in a big fake fish.

972
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:46,760
It was really-

973
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,480
Oh, God.

974
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,760
It was a picture of his dick.

975
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:49,800
I swear to God.

976
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,600
Hold on.

977
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,360
No, there's a picture of him and his-

978
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,880
I've not seen the girl he's engaged to.

979
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,320
I thought he had a baby.

980
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,600
I haven't met her yet.

981
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,320
I thought he had-

982
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,400
It was just on these darn things.

983
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:07,880
My wife has just squirted off listening to our podcast ever again.

984
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,440
She literally just threw the phone at a wall and said,

985
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,280
fuck this show, I'm done.

986
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:13,880
Oh, man.

987
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,800
Man, is this needle-threadable, guys?

988
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,840
It seems like one of those fucked up needles that the metal grows over.

989
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,240
I think what you're going to have to do is fake your death.

990
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,680
Yeah, you've got to fake your death.

991
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,400
The last picture of you living has to be the naked picture.

992
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,160
Time to start a new life in Sheboygan as a factory worker.

993
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,920
You're going to have to Bruce Banner now.

994
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,360
You got to walk the-

995
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,160
Is it too late?

996
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:42,120
Has the ship, the wacky sitcom ship of sneaking into the high school

997
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,560
to get your failed test back, you know what I mean?

998
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,680
Mm-hmm.

999
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,120
Has that ship sailed?

1000
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,760
Although, inevitably, you'll be Kai if sitcoms have taught me anything.

1001
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,920
What are you doing with my phone?

1002
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,720
Let me see what you-

1003
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,360
Oh, my God.

1004
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,800
I was wondering which one of us would bring it up first.

1005
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,280
Yes.

1006
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,840
Did you say to delete it or make it his desktop background?

1007
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,880
Stinky, because that's his friend's name.

1008
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,680
He's a fuck up.

1009
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,600
Oh, is this Mr. Stinger-

1010
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,040
Oh, ToeJam.

1011
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:12,760
You fucked it.

1012
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,120
Not like that, ToeJam.

1013
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,120
You got to follow it up.

1014
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,440
Send him a text message that says, oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

1015
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,960
I didn't mean to send you that picture.

1016
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,920
I meant to send you this one and then another picture of your dick.

1017
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:29,240
Only that one's taken from the bottom so he can see your face,

1018
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,440
and your face is fucking stone cold serious.

1019
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,080
Send him that and say, what do I got to look forward to?

1020
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,000
Send him that and say, what do I got to look forward to?

1021
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,720
Huh?

1022
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,440
Where's it going to be?

1023
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,040
Where's it going to be?

1024
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,080
This is fucked up, this question.

1025
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,040
Why did he do this to his grandpa?

1026
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,960
Here's a good thing about this situation.

1027
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:01,720
I know grandparents and they've never been able to open a file before.

1028
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,920
I do not see why that's going to start now.

1029
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,520
Listen, time is short.

1030
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,720
You only have three weeks before they remember to check their phone.

1031
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,720
I'm a guy, and my best friend's a girl.

1032
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,360
She has a boyfriend, and I have a girlfriend.

1033
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,120
Hopefully something more soon.

1034
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,760
But it doesn't stop people from accusing us of hooking up every time we see each other.

1035
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,880
This includes our families and other close friends.

1036
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,880
This is really starting to get on our nerves.

1037
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,160
How do we deal with this?

1038
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,200
That's from apparently untrustworthy Melbourne.

1039
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:30,920
I tell you what-

1040
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,680
Justin, can I just say real quick?

1041
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,760
Your parentheticals are so good.

1042
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,480
Thanks, Trav.

1043
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,920
I really appreciate it.

1044
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,720
Listen, I'm tired.

1045
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,320
People say we are dating, I'm gonna send you a naked picture of myself.

1046
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:45,080
That's gonna shut these rumors up for good.

1047
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,720
Yeah, I think the only thing you can do is really just come out and confess it.

1048
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,360
You're fucking-

1049
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,160
I know you are.

1050
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,320
I know that he knows it.

1051
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,040
We all know it.

1052
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,240
I know that you're muddying up that.

1053
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,840
Guys and gals can't be friends.

1054
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,640
Neither can farmers and cow hands.

1055
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,360
Fuck you.

1056
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,320
Good night, everybody.

1057
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,200
Good night, everybody.

1058
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,240
No, who cares?

1059
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,040
Everybody, I mean, I don't understand.

1060
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,240
Do you?

1061
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,680
Oh, wait a minute.

1062
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,640
Oh, wait a minute.

1063
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,920
I think maybe this is like a Nick and New Girl situation.

1064
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,960
Oh, we're talking a little-

1065
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,720
Everybody else sees it.

1066
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,640
Oh, man, you're looking a little tense after that harmless kickball game you played.

1067
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,280
Let me rub those thighs.

1068
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,560
That might be a little forward.

1069
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,200
Maybe it's the back.

1070
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:31,800
Let me stick it to the back.

1071
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,400
Let me caress your legs.

1072
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,800
Let me look at your legs.

1073
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,840
Your butt looks sore.

1074
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,800
Let me check it.

1075
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,920
Let me rub your butt to prove we're not dating.

1076
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,200
I feel nothing.

1077
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,040
This is just a friend boner.

1078
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,000
This is like a big bag of pudding.

1079
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,840
Oh, I feel nothing.

1080
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,080
I am not attracted to this.

1081
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,360
This is the worst romantic novel audio book I've ever heard.

1082
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:03,400
He squiggled it around and it was pretty cool.

1083
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,400
He liked the way it felt on his hands.

1084
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,680
It ran over his hands like a babbling brook, the butt did.

1085
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:17,000
He reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out the Oakleys and placed them tenderly.

1086
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,680
Tenderly.

1087
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,160
So, so tenderly upon the hydrant's brim.

1088
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,440
We are going to do this so good, the hydrant said.

1089
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:31,960
She jollops down onto his lap like a bag of kids.

1090
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,960
What about your G if she asks?

1091
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,960
Don't worry about her, Mustang time.

1092
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,960
It's Mustang time, let's undulate together.

1093
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,960
Their bodies, their face slapped together kissingly.

1094
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,960
They slapped and flapped and they clapped.

1095
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,960
And it was so good, guys.

1096
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:53,960
It's hard for me to describe how good it was, but you have to trust me.

1097
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,960
If you had seen this, buckets.

1098
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,960
Buckets of it.

1099
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:03,960
Their bodies were like one of those big nets of crabs from Dudley's Catch.

1100
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,960
And one of the boats on the show as well.

1101
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,960
I don't know the names.

1102
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,960
That would have been better.

1103
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,960
Edit that in later.

1104
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,960
Wizards game or something.

1105
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,960
Time Bandit.

1106
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,960
Time Bandit, was that one of them?

1107
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,960
I think so.

1108
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,960
Is that one?

1109
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,960
Life of Brian.

1110
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,960
Brian's song was one of them.

1111
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,960
Claw game.

1112
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,960
Oh man, this episode's really just for us.

1113
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,960
Do we even need to pub this one or should we just give it to each other for Christmas on Jump Tribes?

1114
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:49,960
I think the problem is, anytime we record an episode during the evening, I think our synapses work different.

1115
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,960
I'm so fucking high on allergy medicine right now too.

1116
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,960
Because that's what I do at 6pm.

1117
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,960
It's jacked.

1118
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,960
So this has been our show.

1119
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,960
We didn't answer that question at all.

1120
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,960
Oh, okay.

1121
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,960
Yeah, we did.

1122
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,960
Tough it out.

1123
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,960
If you think about it, we really did.

1124
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,960
The answer is coded in there.

1125
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,960
You've got to think about it.

1126
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,960
Yeah.

1127
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,960
You have to kind of cross your eyes a little bit and look through it.

1128
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,960
You can't look at it.

1129
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,960
And then it appears like a hologram.

1130
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:25,960
So thank you to everybody so much for listening to the show.

1131
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:33,960
Thank you for those who were patient on Monday and didn't complain about a new episode.

1132
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,960
Thanks to all the neat people.

1133
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:41,960
I met this weekend, Seth Ryder.

1134
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,960
I met him.

1135
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,960
I can't even get into names.

1136
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,960
I met so many fucking people.

1137
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,960
It was so much fun.

1138
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,960
Yeah, it was really cool.

1139
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,960
Man, I wish we could have done some max fun.

1140
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,960
My bim bam shit up there.

1141
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,960
Did everybody miss me?

1142
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,960
Just like nobody asked about you.

1143
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,960
Which is weird.

1144
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,960
Nobody asked about me?

1145
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,960
That's okay.

1146
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,960
I like to remain mysterious.

1147
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,960
If you met Joey Lawrence, you would be like, oh, man.

1148
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,960
Where's Andy and Zeppo?

1149
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,960
Oh, the fuck I wouldn't.

1150
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,960
Zeppo was on Boy Meets World.

1151
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,960
And Andy played a clone movie on Disney Channel.

1152
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,960
Hey, guys.

1153
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,960
Hey, fucking guys.

1154
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,960
Hit me.

1155
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,960
The 2013 Max Fun Drive is next goddamn week.

1156
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:35,960
Whether you are already a devoted monthly member of Max Fun or you've never even thought about donating before, Dick, at least think about it.

1157
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,960
You know what I mean?

1158
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,960
At least cross your mind.

1159
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,960
Yeah.

1160
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,960
Either way, tune in beginning April 1st.

1161
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,960
We will be running some of our best shows of the year.

1162
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:51,960
We usually do some long form goose, which is good because after hearing this one, you're thinking like that but more of it.

1163
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:57,960
Doing awesome giveaways and tempting you with thank you gifts like our all new Intimate Sensations Pack.

1164
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,960
What's that, you ask?

1165
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,960
Oh, shit.

1166
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:07,960
It is, we don't know, but it's for your butt or your dick or your clam.

1167
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,960
Oh, no.

1168
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,960
By which I mean your vagina.

1169
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,960
It's from Extreme Restraints and it's a thing for your butt or your dick or your vagina.

1170
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,960
Great.

1171
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,960
So don't miss it.

1172
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,960
It starts April 1st, runs for just two weeks.

1173
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:29,960
Tune in, show us your support, and catch the best episodes that we've got to offer.

1174
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,960
And here's the important thing, you guys.

1175
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:35,960
We provide, it's so great to be part of this community and we all kind of do this together.

1176
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,960
Seriously, can't stress that enough.

1177
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,960
It's the coolest fucking community ever.

1178
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,960
I'm not talking out of my ass.

1179
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,960
It's the only community on the internet that is 100% cool people.

1180
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:51,960
And the important thing is that you guys all pick us as your favorite and we win Max Fun Con.

1181
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,960
We win Max Fun Drive.

1182
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,960
It's a competition.

1183
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,960
It's not so much about us winning, it's everyone else losing.

1184
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,960
Yeah, second place, first loser.

1185
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,960
Pain is weakness leaving the body and that's why we need to be first in Max Fun Drive.

1186
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,960
Third place is you're fired.

1187
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:11,960
And if you are not the lead dog, then sit on the porch and sniff some butts.

1188
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,960
I found the pledge gifts.

1189
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,960
Can we talk about these? Or is it a secret and tall?

1190
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,960
Let's keep it a secret.

1191
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,960
Alright, I'm looking at it though and no shit, it's the best it's ever been.

1192
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,960
Not shitting you, it's fucking amazing.

1193
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,960
Oh shit.

1194
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,960
Oh my god, the intimate sensations pack, you guys.

1195
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,960
It really does have something for everything.

1196
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,960
All the holes.

1197
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,960
All of them, it's got belly button stuff.

1198
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:41,960
Anyway, so that is next week.

1199
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:45,960
Again, the episodes are usually longer.

1200
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,960
And we'll have a bonus episode also.

1201
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,960
I don't know if we mentioned that.

1202
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,960
Is there anything else? Oh, thanks John Roderick and the Long Winters for our final theme song.

1203
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,960
Our final theme song.

1204
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,960
This is it.

1205
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:57,960
This is the last one.

1206
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,960
I was thinking about switching to St. Elmo's Fire in sweeps, but no.

1207
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,960
This one's final.

1208
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,960
It's our theme song.

1209
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,960
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1210
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,960
It's a gooden, it's an oldie.

1211
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,960
Is it an oldie yet?

1212
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,960
If I turn it on 101.5, the RIV, am I gonna hear it?

1213
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,960
Definitely.

1214
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,960
I'm not, because it's now Bob FM.

1215
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,960
Definitely not gonna hear it on Bob FM.

1216
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:23,960
And finally, some jokes everyone can enjoy.

1217
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,960
Bob FM's worldwide, we got Bob FM here.

1218
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,960
It's a radio station that thinks he's a person.

1219
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,960
Which is the fucking saddest thing I've ever heard.

1220
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,960
It's a radio station that knows how to love.

1221
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,960
His jams are real, but he is not.

1222
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:39,960
Thank you for listening or whatever.

1223
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,960
And this has been my brother, my brother, me.

1224
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,960
Here's your final question.

1225
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,960
You really want this to be over, don't you?

1226
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,960
Justin just fell asleep.

1227
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,960
Both my cats are in my office now.

1228
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,960
Oh, it's cuddle time.

1229
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,960
I'll hurry it up so you can get the sandwich in your face.

1230
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,960
Snug o'clock.

1231
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,960
Time to snug out.

1232
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,960
Nick Jensen sent this one in.

1233
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,960
Thanks, Nick Jensen.

1234
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,960
It's by Yahoo! Answers user Michaela, who asks,

1235
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:09,960
What is Taylor Swift's favorite foods at Cracker Barrel?

1236
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,960
I'm Justin McElroy.

1237
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,960
I'm Travis McElroy.

1238
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,960
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

1239
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,960
Kiss your dad.
