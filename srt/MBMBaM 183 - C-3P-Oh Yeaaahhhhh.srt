1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Hey everybody, it's Griffin, and you may know me from the podcast that you're about to listen to.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,220
Listen, this week's episode is what people in the TV industry would call a very special episode.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,180
Maybe an arrow that you would keep in your quiver until Sweeps Week, when it really mattered.

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,060
Because here's the thing, it sounds really shitty.

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,980
Not all of it, actually, just my audio, which I accidentally recorded with my webcam,

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:35,840
instead of my high quality microphone, so for the next hour, I'm going to sound a little something like this.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,320
Yeah, so it's going to sound something like this.

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,800
That's not great, is it? It's so unpleasant that I don't actually even want you to experience it in this sample version,

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,240
because you're about to eat an hour of it, and I feel really, genuinely very bad about that.

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,480
So let's switch back to good mic.

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,240
Ah, there we go. There's the stuff that you're used to.

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,160
So yeah, that's this week's episode. I'm really, I'm very sorry.

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,040
I try to make this show sound as good as I possibly can, despite the fact that we live in three different states,

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,640
and syncing all that up is kind of tricky from time to time, and big fuck-ups like this don't help.

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,200
So bear with us, it's not going to be an issue in the future.

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,600
I don't like putting out stuff that's not as good as we can do, but that's very much what you're going to have this week.

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,880
So if you want to skip this week, like, I totally understand.

18
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,760
We do some bits about Home Alone 2 that I thought were pretty good.

19
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,920
We talk about having sex with Star Wars characters. That was a pretty nice run.

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,720
So that's sort of like a CliffsNotes version of it, if you want to pass.

21
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,440
Again, I totally understand. Otherwise, here's the show. Enjoy!

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,920
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

23
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,680
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

24
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,720
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

25
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:30,720
What's up, you cool baby?

26
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,120
Welcome, my brother, my brother and me. CES 2014 edition. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

27
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,360
I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy.

28
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,080
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy, just loving all the tech.

29
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,480
I have a lot of wearable technology on right now. A lot of wearable tech.

30
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,920
It's hot. I was in an H&M yesterday and there was a dude wearing ski goggles in the H&M.

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,680
And I think there's probably a little bit of wearable tech in those there goggles.

32
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,320
I have a new cyber implant that I got on the show floor. It's a throat.

33
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,360
I don't know if you guys saw these, a throat computer.

34
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,760
They actually embed it in your throat.

35
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:27,920
What it does is it turns your mind signals from your mind into speech without having to move your mouth or throat or anything.

36
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,320
Not working super well, just like based on that last sentence.

37
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:38,480
You know what, the piece that I'm most excited about, because I saw a little clip about it, it's a six slot toaster.

38
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,920
Interesting.

39
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,240
I don't think, Travis, that was actually part of the CES technology.

40
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,880
This January, get into Subway for a $5-

41
00:03:50,880 --> 00:04:00,320
Okay, here's the thing is, no, this is the problem with the throat computer, very expensive, it is subsidized technology.

42
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,120
So occasionally, in the middle of-

43
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,960
Don't miss Will Ferrell and Ackerman, too.

44
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,720
Why does it make you sound like that, though?

45
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,120
Well, it has to be very clear that it's not my natural speech.

46
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,320
That's what it sounds like when Justin is resisting the throat pewter with his own organ muscles.

47
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,960
Yeah, I'm fighting against it as hard as I can.

48
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,120
Can I hack your throat pewter?

49
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,240
I don't think it's Wi-Fi.

50
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,440
I think it's just with like my throat singing time is snack time with popcorn, bread, popcorn.

51
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,920
Popcorn, bread, popcorn.

52
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,760
I'm glad that they're doing it well enough to afford such prime time ad, though, as an episode.

53
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:47,120
I wish I could shut it off during certain times, like when I'm recording my podcast.

54
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,920
Kids love Lunchables and Lunchables are kids.

55
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,360
Okay, apparently Lunchables are made of children.

56
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,080
I think I might have been hacked.

57
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,720
I do think hacking is possible because that seems to have happened.

58
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:08,200
Do you want me to, like, do you want me to, like, ram MacAfee like antivirus down your throat?

59
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah, or I could just take a cold and flu medicine.

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,440
Or you could just drink something, I think, and the liquid would probably compromise.

61
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,680
You'd have to eat some sand, maybe, and get in the gears.

62
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,600
Yeah, that did.

63
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,560
I just drank some Diet Dr. Pepper and that, okay, that wasn't an ad.

64
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,080
I mean, I did just drink some Diet Dr. Pepper.

65
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,880
It is goddamn delicious, though.

66
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,080
It's really, it tastes just like regular Dr. Pepper.

67
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,320
I don't know what the big hubbub is.

68
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,280
Travis, you're not feeling great?

69
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,840
That is correct.

70
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:41,440
Did you get any, maybe you caught a computer virus at CES?

71
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,800
Yes, that's exactly what happened.

72
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,920
I caught a electronics-based virus.

73
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,440
I worried for a second that we had lag on the call, but I think it's lag on your brain.

74
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,400
I think your brain is lagging.

75
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,240
Oh, no, I just didn't enjoy your joke.

76
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,520
In my defense and yours, it wasn't so much of a joke.

77
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,160
I think Travis is just put off by all the CES talk because he's something of a Luddite.

78
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,480
I do fear technology and all the things it can do to us.

79
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,160
Oh, like connect those in ways we've never been connected before, like fix diseases

80
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,920
and 3D print flesh for burn victims.

81
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,360
Yeah, and eventually we become too reliant upon it.

82
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,960
Please, just no more flesh.

83
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,640
Fleshbot, I'm not interested anymore, how about some more flesh?

84
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
I'm good.

85
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,040
I definitely have plenty of flesh.

86
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,280
What about when the kids, they're on their cell phones and they're not connected with

87
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
nobody?

88
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
That's a good point.

89
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,200
What about that, Griffin?

90
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,080
We're creating a communications ghetto with our phones.

91
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,040
The people always, they're taking the Instagrams and they're not just enjoying the moment.

92
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,640
Back in my day, you just enjoyed the moment, maybe with a Polaroid or some such, and then

93
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,480
you paint it on a wall and now the people, they take it with their phones and they put

94
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,720
it on the interwebs.

95
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,000
Man, you sound horrible.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,760
Just like the quality of my voice or like what I'm saying?

97
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Check, check, check.

98
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Check, check, check.

99
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
All of it.

100
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,840
Hey, let's get into the advice, guys.

101
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
I'm ready.

102
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Are you ready?

103
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,320
This January, Josh Holloway stars in Special Agent Gabriel Vaughn in Intelligence.

104
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,360
Half super agent, half computer, basically Chuck.

105
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,880
How hard did the throat peter have to research that one to know everything about it?

106
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,160
He knew it off the top.

107
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,320
I think it's just being streamed directly into my throat.

108
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,520
That seems like a weird marketing campaign to like write for your show.

109
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,920
Check out our show.

110
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,360
We basically stole the idea from Chuck.

111
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,280
Chuck, but serious.

112
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,240
Serious Chuck.

113
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,000
We call it Charles.

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,440
My wonderful girlfriend of four years is turning 21 in a couple of weeks.

115
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm throwing her a surprise birthday party, inviting all our friends and even some friends

116
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,680
from other colleges.

117
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,480
I was worried about people mingling and getting along, though, seeing as many of those people

118
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
have never met.

119
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,720
Are there any activities other than drinking legally that I could put on, make sure everyone

120
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,120
has a great time?

121
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,240
That's from Perplex Partier in Pittsburgh.

122
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:30,080
When was the last time you guys threw a party?

123
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
I have get togethers.

124
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Right.

125
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
That's not what this person is talking about.

126
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,440
We're talking about a 21st B-Day fucking rager barnstormer.

127
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,400
Yeah, because honestly, what my mind immediately jumped to is I know lots of party games, but

128
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
I don't...

129
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,680
Is that what you're looking for?

130
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,380
I think they're looking for some great...

131
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:58,160
It's hard because you think about the sort of formal atmosphere that we sort of eschewed

132
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,280
from the Victorian era, we sort of let that fall by the wayside, but there certainly is

133
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:10,920
something to be said for having some sort of codified way of handling interactions

134
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
in a place.

135
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,960
You need one.

136
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:20,400
Every time we want to have people over, there's usually an activity that serves as sort of

137
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,080
the linchpin for the entire thing.

138
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,080
We're going to grill, and then people know that this is where hot, this is where charred

139
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,840
food is going to be served, or we say, we're going to play HeroQuest, and then people know

140
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
just not to come.

141
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Not to come.

142
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,480
Because they don't want to do that.

143
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:44,040
We usually do Cards Against Humanity, or you can also play, I don't know what it's actually

144
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,920
called, but we call it Fishbowl, where you write down...

145
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,920
Put your keys into a...

146
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,080
You put your keys into it, and then everybody sleeps with everybody else.

147
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,200
It's pretty good getting to know you, Exercise.

148
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,360
Yeah, getting to know somebody, and maybe something about yourself.

149
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,600
You could have a herald announce everyone as they come into the party.

150
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,080
That's over pretty quickly, isn't it?

151
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,320
Yeah, but that seems like a pretty good way to get to know each other, when you're like,

152
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,360
oh, that's Lord Steven of Miller.

153
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,640
That's why the ideal to do parties like this is Halloween, because then, even if you don't

154
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,400
know the person, everybody knows Snooki, so you feel comfortable with Snooki.

155
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
You want to talk to Snooki.

156
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Always.

157
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,560
God, Justin, your fucking pop culture references are like super, super on point.

158
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,400
They're like super, super up-to-date, hot hip, what's now, what's hip?

159
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,560
Everybody who knows Nicole Richie, what are you even saying anymore?

160
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,840
It's 2004-ward.

161
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
I'm done, though.

162
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
I'm 33 years old.

163
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,080
I'm out of the game.

164
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
I am out.

165
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,360
He knows everything about pop culture that he'll ever know.

166
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Here's the thing about it.

167
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Here's the thing about pop culture, right?

168
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,720
We're making more every day.

169
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Fair?

170
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Correct.

171
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Yeah.

172
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
There's new YouTubes.

173
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
There's new whatever every day.

174
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,040
There's like three new YouTube videos every day.

175
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,400
How are you supposed to keep up with that?

176
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,980
At some point, you have to say, well, I'm done.

177
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,360
I'm going to work backwards from here.

178
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,640
So at least there's a finite amount of culture for me to intake.

179
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,200
All the good stuff's already done, been made.

180
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,760
I'm out of the game.

181
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
I'm done.

182
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,580
Back to this person's question.

183
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,920
The easiest thing to do, and I think the thing that I run into the most when I or my friends

184
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:32,920
have these sorts of gets-togethers is to base it around the preparation of some sort of

185
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,160
non-everyday food.

186
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,960
Like last night, we went to a friend's house, and he made ribs that he got from the Salt

187
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
Lick.

188
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Like, oh, that's exciting.

189
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Ooh.

190
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,080
Or like a friend will do like a shrimp boil.

191
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
Like things that you just-

192
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
What about fondue?

193
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Fondue?

194
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
Sure.

195
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,120
I think that was sort of like the whole idea behind that craze.

196
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,200
Not that anybody- Justin, I got you in Sydney a fondue pot for Christmas like two years

197
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
ago.

198
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Have you used that?

199
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Hell yeah, we did.

200
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,440
Put some chocolate in that mother grabber.

201
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
Some pretzels.

202
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
I'll take you right to town.

203
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
I think that's-

204
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
You could do a fry.

205
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,320
We used to do fry parties in college where we'd set up a D fat fryer, and then you just

206
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,040
bring shit to fry.

207
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,040
That's kind of-

208
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Safe?

209
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,040
It's super safe, and it's-

210
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,640
And you get super drunk while you're doing it.

211
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,200
I met the cutest guy with the cutest scarring ever at this point.

212
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,080
He was very bubbly.

213
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
Not like his personality.

214
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Like his flesh.

215
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
He's a keeper.

216
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
You guys want Yahoo?

217
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Please.

218
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,560
Guys, you fucking drowned me in Yahoo's today.

219
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,320
I got ready for the show.

220
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,760
I usually take about 20 to 30 minutes to prep.

221
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,600
There was easily an hour and a half worth of Yahoo's, which is why I was late.

222
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Sorry, boys.

223
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,280
Thank you all very, very much.

224
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,160
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Ira Ray.

225
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,520
Are you Ira Ray?

226
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Who wants to know?

227
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Ira.

228
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
Welcome back, my friend.

229
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:58,160
It's by Yahoo Answers user, books, where the magic happens.

230
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Done.

231
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,000
That's all I needed.

232
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Thank you.

233
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,360
Books, where the magic happens asks, how often should catch phrases be used?

234
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,400
Just like people in real life, characters often have catch phrases for things uttered

235
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
often.

236
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
Just like people in real life.

237
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Just like those real people.

238
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,760
The question is, how much is too much?

239
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,920
How many times do you think is just the right amount?

240
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,440
The trick is that it's per hour, but you could use them all up right at the top of the hour

241
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:35,000
and then have to wait another 55 minutes to get to say, like, them some sweet pants, bro.

242
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,080
You could say that like 10 times.

243
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,080
Is it always pants though?

244
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,640
Oh, it's a good call.

245
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,520
I guess, well, then it comes into, can you vary the article of clothing and count that

246
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,800
as varying the catch phrase?

247
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,920
I don't know why it has to always be clothing.

248
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,320
Sweet sock suspenders, bro.

249
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,840
Pretty sweet merkin, bro.

250
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,360
I don't know why you'd be looking at that on your bro.

251
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,480
Well, maybe he was self-conscious about it.

252
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,360
He didn't know if it was a good merkin or not.

253
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
Maybe you're at a merkin party.

254
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
Does this look natural?

255
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Does this look natural?

256
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,740
You're like, that's a pretty sweet merkin, bro.

257
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:16,240
Do you know, first of all, like, I guess we have catch phrases like for the show.

258
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,360
In case your dad's crying on the lips, I guess it's a catchphrase, but we only do that once

259
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,120
per hour, which I guess is not so bad.

260
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,840
No, I guess that's fine.

261
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,320
I mean, it's more of a sign off than a catchphrase.

262
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,520
I mean, Griffin, when you were establishing Oops!

263
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:37,480
I Eated All the Potato Chips for your series, Little Griffy, yeah, but during the run of

264
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,400
the sitcom, during the sitcom run of Little Griffy, was it Little Griffin?

265
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:49,160
Yeah, Little Griffy, the issue was the censors were like really hesitant to have a show where

266
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:57,120
a child ate potato chips, sorry, ate all the potato chips, sorry, eat all the potato chips

267
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,600
multiple times per episode.

268
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,520
Like, it didn't really paint a healthy picture of Little Griffy's dietary habits, and they

269
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,880
were afraid that like kids at home would see that and just like go grab up all the cheetos

270
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,280
that they had on the shelf and just let them introduce themselves.

271
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:17,280
The names are diabetic because they did all the potato chips four times over.

272
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:23,640
You can tell if you're watching late series or early Little Griffy because he'll say Oops!

273
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,280
I Eated All of the like quinoa in the house.

274
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
Oops!

275
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,200
I Eated a Reasonable Amount of Potato Chips and balanced it out with some fruits and vegetables.

276
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Right.

277
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Jump the shark, actually.

278
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,000
There is not, I don't think, a reasonable amount of potato chips.

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,440
I think the last, I do think that catchphrases are sort of a lost art on television.

280
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:52,640
I mean, like the last great catchphrase I can remember is like, the work of Steve, well,

281
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,080
I would say the work of Steve Urkel.

282
00:15:54,080 --> 00:16:00,640
I think it comes a little after the Farhouse Heydays, but did I do that?

283
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,720
Friends was pretty heavily catchphrased, like how you doing and yeah, there were some good

284
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
catchphrases there.

285
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,880
Oh, fucking, how about your mother is like, everything that Neil Patrick Harris says is

286
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
like catchphrase.

287
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,880
That's true.

288
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,600
I guess it's still like alive and kicking.

289
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,200
I just don't know people who do that shit in real life because it would make them like.

290
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Think in your lives.

291
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,560
Do you guys actually know anybody that literally has like catchphrases?

292
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,400
Well the thing is, is like there's such a huge difference between having a quote catchphrase

293
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,960
and having certain patterns of speech that you tend to repeat.

294
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
You know what I mean?

295
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,560
Like as soon as you identify something like, this is going to be my catchphrase, you're

296
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,920
on like the fast track, the douche down because like you shouldn't actively make the decision.

297
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,480
But if you're a guy who just says like, you know, coolio a lot and that's just a natural

298
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,000
thing that you do.

299
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,320
It's also very situational.

300
00:16:52,320 --> 00:17:02,280
Like I have a circle of friends here in Austin that we bandy about terms like day rage and

301
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,320
crush sesh and things like that.

302
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,040
So we never like, there's not like a thing that anybody says every time they enter a

303
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,160
fucking room because that would be the weirdest.

304
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
Yeah.

305
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
I think it would be awesome.

306
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,960
Holler if you hear me, Jay's in town.

307
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,960
Yeah.

308
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,520
I've tried to get that one going.

309
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
Cha boy!

310
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,520
Every time you're in a room.

311
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Cha boy!

312
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
Oh hey.

313
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,280
I think it would be really awesome if like when you turn 12, kind of like in the giver,

314
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,480
everyone was assigned a catchphrase and it came to you with your social security number,

315
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,600
you know, and you, you were legally required to use it every time you entered a room.

316
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Sure.

317
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,400
And then it would be like retired when, when little Griffey dies, then the giver would

318
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:47,360
receive oops, I eat all the potato chips and then would just like store those memories.

319
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,160
It's a very heavy burden that we have.

320
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,760
You would have to think though that some people's catchphrases would be really pertinent and

321
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,960
be like, holler at me, right?

322
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,320
But then some people would just be like, we have to walk in and be like, I'd like a raise

323
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,840
and it's like, wow, that doesn't work.

324
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
Apples!

325
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Yeah.

326
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
Man, that's not great.

327
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,360
Well, gentlemen, we've been trying to solve the case of the Ripper for three years now.

328
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,760
We believe we finally have a break in the case.

329
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,080
According to all eyewitnesses, he says later turd burglars every time he leaves the scene

330
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
of a crime.

331
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,920
So it should be, you should check with the catchphrase office.

332
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,920
Let's check the index.

333
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,400
Oh, it's Steve Harvey.

334
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,040
It was Steve Harvey this whole fucking time?

335
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
Yeah.

336
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Who knew?

337
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,400
I didn't even think he was alive, but that's like his whole thing.

338
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,680
That's how he opens up every episode of Harvey.

339
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
What's his show?

340
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Family Feud.

341
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,280
Family Feud was the answer.

342
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,760
He's got a lot of, he's got a lot of catchphrases.

343
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
He does.

344
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:50,080
When I, last time I was in New York, I took a cab to JFK, it took me like an hour from

345
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,160
the hotel and my cab driver listened to Steve Harvey the whole time.

346
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,920
And I listened to it too and I laughed at it and made me feel pretty hip.

347
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Pretty pretty now.

348
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
How about another question?

349
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:07,200
My girlfriend and I are visiting a city neither of us have ever seen before and our question

350
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,240
is this, should we plan out a long list of things to do and see beforehand or is it more

351
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,820
fun to just wing it?

352
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,400
We don't have a ton of travel experience, we already have a place to stay and just about

353
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
nothing else.

354
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,640
We're going to be there for six days and the city is Austin if that helps.

355
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
Fuck yeah it helps.

356
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,560
It's from Thanks Scouting in, oh sorry, that says Thanks and then it's from Scouting in

357
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
San Francisco.

358
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,000
Alright Griffin, before you jump in, before you jump in with Austin suggestions, let's

359
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,360
answer as a general question first.

360
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,600
Alright, go to Barton Springs, it's like this beautiful swimming hole like in the heart

361
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
of downtown.

362
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,560
I'm not saying like if there's a Barton Springs in whatever town that you visit, like make

363
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,880
sure that you check that out.

364
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,240
I know that there is one in Austin, so.

365
00:19:53,240 --> 00:20:01,720
By and large, I think that the thing you want to plan and over plan is like getting there,

366
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
transit.

367
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,960
Like that's where you're going to, that's where you're going to get boned.

368
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,020
That's where I will get overly analytical and figure out every last detail.

369
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,080
Like figure out how you're getting from you know your house to the airport to your hotel

370
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,080
etc.

371
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,640
After that, I tend to just bring a laptop with me and sort of figure stuff out as I

372
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
get there.

373
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:28,400
It never hurts to have like two or three like don't want to miss things so that you always

374
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,560
have something to fall back on.

375
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,680
So for example, if you're in Austin, you want to go to the Alamo Drafthouse, cool.

376
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,960
Then you know that at least one of the days, the centerpiece of the day is going to be

377
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,240
going to the Alamo Drafthouse because that always kind of lets me relax a little bit

378
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,280
more when I know that something is planned, but I don't feel the need to plan every single

379
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,320
second of the day.

380
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,160
I just, I just, I plan everything.

381
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,880
Like it just, it's more of a, it's a relief to have like a big like checklist of stuff

382
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
and like a schedule.

383
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,320
I think that once you do that though, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.

384
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
Yeah.

385
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
That's the thing.

386
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,080
If you got no, if you have no plans and you can't fail.

387
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,200
Teresa has been helping me with that because I tend to like, I used to over plan stuff

388
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,640
and then it just leads to frustration because if you're like, I'm going to do these eight

389
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,960
things today and then you only get to do like five of them.

390
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,480
You know, you don't want to be stressed about the three you didn't get to do.

391
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,440
You want to be living in the moment of the five you did get to do.

392
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,320
I really, I think another good thing that you can research is find like a general area

393
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,440
that is nice and then go there and, and don't have any specific plans beyond that.

394
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,840
But like when we were, we went to the UK recently, the nicest day we had in Bath was going to

395
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,160
just sort of the center of town and looking around.

396
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,040
And we knew that that was an area we wanted to get to, but beyond that, there really wasn't

397
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,920
a, you know, a lot we had planned.

398
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,880
We sort of let the day unfold as it, as it wanted to.

399
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,640
And that's a lot more relaxing than having a checklist that you got to go through.

400
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,240
I guess it's a good point because like whenever people come here, I tell them to go to South

401
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,200
Congress, which is just like a cool street with like a ton of cool shit to do instead

402
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,240
of saying go to this one specific place.

403
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,800
Because like a lot of cities, especially Austin, like there's some shit that you might have

404
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
on your checklist.

405
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,680
Like I'm going to go do Franklin's barbecue and then like, guess what?

406
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,280
You are totally, totally not going to be able to do that because the line is around the

407
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
block.

408
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,280
Yeah.

409
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
Food, food for me is an important one.

410
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,860
I usually know like two or three places I want to like have dinner or do breakfast or

411
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:38,560
some someplace that either friends have told me beforehand, like I went to, you know, I

412
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,400
went to Pittsburgh and you got to check out this place, you know what I mean?

413
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,760
And that's usually go find an area with the restaurants and stuff like Justin was saying

414
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,840
and just kind of cruise around the, uh, the other, the only other thing that I would say

415
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,800
in terms of like planning that is really useful is to find out, uh, the, the car situation.

416
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,200
Um, cause there are some areas where like friends to use two recent examples, uh, we

417
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,680
were in bath, we rented a car and as it turns out, if you find a place to put your car in

418
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,080
that city, it lives there forever.

419
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,320
Like you can, don't ever, ever move it because that's where it lives from then on.

420
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,600
They just pour cement over the car and turn it into a statue commemorating the moment

421
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
where you found a parking spot.

422
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,360
Right, you'll visit it from time to time, you take your grandkids, and then I just turned

423
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,400
left and then I turned right and there it was.

424
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,520
Fuck, I left my bill of flex CD in there, shit, now it's gone, part of the memorial.

425
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,040
But in Austin, if you don't have a car, I don't think you're going to do much.

426
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,280
You're not going to really get around much.

427
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,420
People bike, but like they just do it so other people see them on their bike.

428
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,560
We get it guys.

429
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,560
We get it guys.

430
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,560
Like it's got only just the two wheels.

431
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:50,680
Um, can I give Austin suggestions now or do you want me to do that off the top?

432
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:58,560
You got to get a pizza taco at a, at the place.

433
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,920
There's a food truck downtown where you'll see it.

434
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,120
It has like a giant pizza taco on top of the car.

435
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:11,960
So you'll see exactly which one to get, um, the Alamo, go to the Alamo.

436
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Definitely.

437
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,560
Uh, there's a, uh, there's a beautiful spring fed pool behind the Alamo.

438
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,200
That's very refreshing to dip in.

439
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:31,360
Uh, there's the Custer's last stand frozen custard shop, um, that has some of the, I

440
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,400
would say like the fifth best frozen custard in Texas.

441
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
That's definite.

442
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,840
We're checking out top 10 at least.

443
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,720
Uh, there's, you can get a 10 gallon hat full of Custer's.

444
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,220
They call it Custer's Custard.

445
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,860
You can buy that there and eat that.

446
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,120
You have to eat it on the spot though.

447
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Cause they got it.

448
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,360
They need that hat back.

449
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,560
So please demand a clean hat a lot of times they're going to tell you that they don't

450
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
have any.

451
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,240
You're going to get one with someone else's custard leavings and you don't want that.

452
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
You don't want that.

453
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,120
Uh, go to a Longhorn fight.

454
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,600
Is that two Longhorns?

455
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,320
It's uh, eight Longhorns usually.

456
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,400
And one dude.

457
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:21,320
You have to really plan your trip around that because just because of like the, the rate

458
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
of death.

459
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,920
There's, I mean, they burn through seven Longhorns every time that they do it.

460
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,000
And so it's like a Longhorn demolition derby.

461
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,400
They're a tough animal to breed for obvious reasons.

462
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Those horns get in the way of the, of the copulation.

463
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,040
So like you got to, you got to make sure you're planning a trip around that because I think

464
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,440
it's like once or twice a week.

465
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,680
Make sure you meet George W. Bush.

466
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,380
He's just wandering around handing out peppermints to kids.

467
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:53,400
He runs a cool down tent on a sixth street, uh, Fridays, Fridays and Saturdays, uh, when

468
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
it gets pretty tazy.

469
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,960
Hey, you're looking a little beat.

470
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,680
Why don't you come on in, chill out, have some orange juice.

471
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,080
Have some, uh, have some insure.

472
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,200
It's good for you.

473
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Bring you down.

474
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Oh, bro.

475
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
You can not rehydrate, bro.

476
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Come on.

477
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,120
These are all really good, George, George W. Bush, or is it, oh, sorry.

478
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,120
It's George H.W.

479
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,000
Bush is the one that runs the cool down tent.

480
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,120
So anyway, those are just a few suggestions for me to use.

481
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
I dropped my Pringles.

482
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
Oh, fuck.

483
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,320
That wasn't an ad.

484
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,320
Justin dropped it.

485
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,320
All the potato chips.

486
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,240
Uh, they're actually technically potato crisps because they're made from reconstituted potato

487
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
granules.

488
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,320
There's a lengthy lawsuit about, I'll walk you through this sometime.

489
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,000
I work in a type of service industry that not many people know about, but it's growing

490
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,200
in popularity.

491
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,600
I work in a rock climbing gym hosting birthdays and private lessons.

492
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,080
The problem is I don't think people know it's customary to tip their belayer, the one who

493
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,040
pulls in the slack of the rope while the climber climbs after pulling the kids up a wall for

494
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
about an hour.

495
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,480
My question is, how do you ask for tips without asking for tips?

496
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,320
And that's from Tipus Trainer.

497
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,840
Let me help you out with something, Tipus Trainer.

498
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,480
Allow me to assist you with something.

499
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:11,360
If most people don't know it's customary to do something, then it's kind of what a custom

500
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,440
is is that you kind of do it because it's the thing to do.

501
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,800
If people don't know that that's the custom, I'm sorry, dog, but like a custom, I don't

502
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:28,520
know, there's not like a unless I'm mistaken, not like a chart somewhere, some official

503
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:35,200
laminated chart that says you tip your belayer and yet people have not bothered to go check

504
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,480
out that particular office.

505
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,360
I don't even know what a belayer like I didn't know that word until Justin VAU just like

506
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,720
introduced that shit into my brain like there's no way I would have tipped you.

507
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,080
Not a not a chance.

508
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:56,940
The only way I tip where I don't know like know for certain that I am supposed to like

509
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:02,240
obviously there's some of those that are easy, waiters, taxi drivers.

510
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,160
The only time that I don't I do I have to see a bowl you I have to see a bowl or you

511
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,780
have to do the thing that Rob Schneider does in Home Alone 2 where you kind of rub your

512
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,560
fingers together like you're looking for fruit stripe gum.

513
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,440
It's like that's I've got to see one of those two actions.

514
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:27,120
Maybe what you could do to kind of be cute is once the kid is up just hold him there

515
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,800
and wait because you've got that kid you've got to turn him up to look at the down like

516
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
so is that your son?

517
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Yeah.

518
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,960
It's like how much is it worth to you for me to not let him fall yeah or turn the kid

519
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,240
upside down turn the kid upside down and he'll fall out of his pants like he's in a cartoon.

520
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,880
Or maybe just let one kid fall yeah let one kid fall so they know you're serious make

521
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,320
sure he's and then just loudly announce I guess his parents didn't tip.

522
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,200
And then when you're on the run from the wall and you move to another state and you get

523
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:06,000
a job because the kid and you are in it together oh my god he faked it the kid knows what's

524
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,480
up he's now the kid died the kid sacrificed his life but he was in it with you.

525
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,480
I think he lived and it turned out he was David Blaine.

526
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
What?

527
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
How did this happen?

528
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,480
How did it happen?

529
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,480
He's amazing.

530
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,640
I'm going to dress I'm going to dress like a white kid named Skyler for the next six

531
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,720
months it'll be the greatest hoax of my life.

532
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:33,360
We rag we've talked I think at length about Home Alone 2.

533
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,120
You mentioned it and it brought up something something I didn't really realize until my

534
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,080
latest like holiday time viewing of that film which is like I think it is cemented itself

535
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,960
as a holiday classic by this point.

536
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,560
Okay have we talked about this on the show recently?

537
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
I don't think so.

538
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,440
We talked about how Tim Curry was so very very upsetting in that film yes but let's

539
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,200
explore that subject just a little bit deeper.

540
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,920
That's the worst hotel basically ever.

541
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,040
Okay why what what is your problem with it?

542
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,560
There's a scene it's entirely managerial are my issues with it and not like the obvious

543
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:14,760
stuff of like they check let a kid check in it's that once they did that they definitely

544
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:22,160
invaded that person regardless of his age invaded his privacy to a like felonious extent.

545
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:30,240
Case in point there's a scene where Tim Curry goes to check on the room and this is after

546
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,440
his suspicions been peaked and he starts you know sort of snooping around and Kevin gets

547
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,960
wise and it's the scene where he sets up the clown in the shower and plays the recording

548
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:45,680
of his uncle singing but let's like play through Tim Curry's brain thoughts in that scene where

549
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,120
he sneaks in and he's looking for an adult but he doesn't see an adult so at this point

550
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,760
he thinks oh a child is staying in this hotel room and definitely fucking grifting me.

551
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:02,440
He walks into the bedroom and he hears that the shower is on in the bathroom and Tim Curry's

552
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:09,120
next like fucking step is to just go right in that bathroom and check out what he fully

553
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:16,280
fully believes to be a naked a naked kid in the shower right now like it sounds like an

554
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,160
adult voice but there's really only one way to be sure to see if it's not a naked kid

555
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,140
in a shower that's totally grifting me right now and he pops his head in and then he finds

556
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,800
out it's an adult and the adult sees him and that's what makes him run away not that if

557
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,080
he had seen like if what if that scene had played out differently and it was naked Kevin

558
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:38,000
McAllister in the shower and naked Kevin McAllister was like hey dog hey buddy hey pal and Tim

559
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,960
Curry would have just yelled I knew it hey pal yeah you caught me you're also looking

560
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:48,960
at like my kid dick right now nice bust so like I know kid dick was also my favorite

561
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,880
procedural cop drama like great work you bust I'm busted I guess you busted me but now like

562
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:01,080
now you're going to prison for like a long time you're going to prison for checking out

563
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,000
your hotel's fucking gone like once this hit the press what's he gonna do fucking kill

564
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,720
Kevin that's what he has to do because if Kevin talks yeah great hotel manager definitely

565
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,040
checked out my kid dick in the shower trying to catch me grifting like that one's on me

566
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:22,200
I was grifting I it was not an open invitation for Tim Curry to like scope out my zone yeah

567
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:28,160
like I love that movie it's a holiday classic can't watch that part anymore it's because

568
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:36,640
what human being is like I've owned the case it would have been worse you sound more like

569
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:48,320
the count here is here is my problem with Hobo it too they originally had intended to

570
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:55,840
shoot the climactic scene in the toy shop that's right they ran out it up as they ran

571
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,240
out ran out funds or FAO shorts wouldn't let him do it and they that's where they originally

572
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,480
were going to shoot the the the climactic scene but instead they didn't so they decided

573
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:13,120
to do it at an abandoned house on a soundstage which okay is problematic because what it

574
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,800
does is it removes from the burglars the impetus of robbing a place they're not trying to rob

575
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:26,600
this place they are trying to kill a child right now that's problematic sure but the

576
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:34,000
other thing that is worrisome about this is in turn this little Dexter just lures these

577
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,020
guys in this house to kill them yeah let me figure this out why doesn't he call 9-1-1

578
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:44,120
and just say like hey there were some guys scoping out the toy store he has to he has

579
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:51,160

667
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:13,520
your intended you have got to have sex with either r2d2 or c3po i don't mean i don't know

668
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:19,960
if that means like you are required to or like sort of like how you have been poisoned

669
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:25,800
and the only antidote is to have sex with either r2d2 or c3po or maybe it means that

670
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:31,520
like i have got to eat some pringles i'm out of pringles now so i can't there's nothing

671
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,300
i can do about that you ate the whole there was i eat it all the potato crisps um copyright

672
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:46,040
infringement uh i mean first off let's hurry this conversation along because i'm sure kevin

673
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,840
smith is transcribing it for inclusion in clerks 3 so we want to make sure to to really

674
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:59,040
not keep it out of the park yeah i think the obvious answer is r2d2 there's a lot of hateful

675
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:08,080
like people agreeing with travis in the comments saying like well c3po is a guy well r2d2 r2d2

676
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,240
though like he's got the better personality you want to chill with him well here's the

677
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,800
good thing about i like about r2d2 in this case hey motherfucker can keep a secret yeah

678
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,240
again the problem look i'm gonna need to make sure i don't know which of his widgets and

679
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:26,040
servos i need to deactivate to make sure he's not making a 3d hologram of our love making

680
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,800
but i am definitely going to need to deactivate that i might just dump a big gallon of iced

681
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,080
tea on his head just to make sure that like that part of him is broken for good microwave

682
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:44,600
turn it to high exactly um yahoo answers user aid and says r2d2 it's possible that it's

683
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,960
a girl plus the robot probably has a great dick sucking mechanism in there somewhere

684
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,560
oh no why would that be part of the that's why the jawas were like oh definitely him

685
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,800
definitely protocol droid like sure he speaks like three in the language is like yeah we're

686
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:08,040
into it but this dude he's got a great dick sucking he has a great a great out of this

687
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:14,160
world you guys i actually saw that at the ceo show for the dick sucking mechanism the

688
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,880
dick sucking r2d2 attachment you know they're you know they're gonna upsell that that's

689
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,640
gonna be an upcharge you're gonna never come standard it doesn't come with the base model

690
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:29,680
it's a it's a usb dongle for your dongle put your dongle in this dongle uh and literally

691
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:35,240
every yahoo answers user response c3po is a guy i don't want any i don't want any gay

692
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:41,160
shit when i fuck one of these god fictional robots i mean if you're talking about fucking

693
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:48,080
a fictional robot can you just like open your mind for like a minute for like a minute and

694
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,680
think about like one of them actually has a humanoid shape maybe that's something that

695
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:59,520
would be interesting i'm also gonna throw out c3po is not a dude he's a robot right

696
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,240
you don't know the job of the hut might be it might be like the female of the species

697
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:10,000
why are you assuming you have such a closed mind about like this idea of gender take that

698
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,540
internet what better chance to experiment with your sexuality than with a robot that's

699
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:21,600
fiction that fictional robot you can't even imagine the idea of having sex with a robot

700
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:28,720
that is i mean theoretically gendered like i i think that that's so that's so short-sighted

701
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:34,200
what if it's not like just have the thought experiment like i just i guys i just fucked

702
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:40,200
gandalf the gray in my brain i just thought about it i just did that for me and you know

703
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:46,560
why because it's like it's fictional have some fun i bet if you were to do an interview

704
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:53,600
with a million gay people and you were to ask them how did you realize you were a homosexual

705
00:46:53,600 --> 00:47:01,120
i bet not one of their stories start with well i was imagining having sex with c3po

706
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:10,160
and i realized i was gay i bet that that is well okay it is the earth uh there's one certainly

707
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,280
but it's probably not you statistically speaking no it's it is what malcolm gladwell would

708
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,720
call an outlier that's why his book was all about by the way i don't know if you guys

709
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,360
read that one it's probably you can probably skip that particular novel here's another

710
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:30,160
thing too call me crazy but i would bet there are many homosexual men who would also not

711
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:38,040
want to have sex with c3po yes yes thank you i don't think our nation's gay men are lining

712
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:44,160
up like oh okay we had a really great turnout when we relaunched the star wars series but

713
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:51,840
why can't crack the code obviously c3po has no orifices look at him look at a picture

714
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:57,680
there are no orifices that is the end all be all of this question and the prequel trilogy

715
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:03,480
you do get to see him with that as plating on and that i was baiting i was baiting to

716
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:12,180
that plating baby it was perfecto mundo yes please george lucas show me more of anakin's

717
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:20,480
youth if that's the trade-off i would a spoonful of naked 3po helps the jar jar go down and

718
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,360
jar jar does go down in the most in the sequel you got to stick around for that one he goes

721
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,200

00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:12,320
we're gonna do this we need to do some revisions listen revenge of the sith is out in three

725
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:18,080
months we have a very limited amount of time to commit this to celluloid here's a yahoo

726
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:28,400
answer that was sent in by ira ray who am ira ray who am ira ray thanks ira ray it's

727
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:36,760
by yahoo answers user bill v who asks is parkour weird or sad i'm 15 and an england and i want

728
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:41,680
to start parkour but since it's not the most popular thing around where i live well people

729
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,800
think i'm weird or sad climbing roofs all the time etc there's only a few people who

730
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:50,520
do it around where i live and they're really good with all their flips and stuff and i

731
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:57,040
can only do a front flip so far will i look stupid here yes here is the thing about parkour

732
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:06,960
your the level to which you look stupid is uh inversely proportionate to how sweet you

733
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:14,520
are at flips if your flips are sweet you may look like it may be like uh new for some people

734
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:20,160
sort of experience but if i see anybody doing anything really well it doesn't really matter

735
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,280
what that thing is you know what i mean like if you see someone busking on the street and

736
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:32,160
they're playing uh saxophone badly then that's kind of cool then okay that would be sort

737
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:43,440
of sweet that's kind of a sweet thing that would be sort of like oh shit that is a smooth

738
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:49,640
operator over there is that careless whisper almost if you see someone doing parkour full

739
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:57,120
whisper if you see someone doing parkour badly in public that's someone who's desperate for

740
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,720
attention sure if you see someone doing parkour well in public then that's someone who just

741
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:07,000
had to let it loose they just had to practice the problem is is i don't know that parkour

742
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,840
is a solo activity because i think if you're just doing it by yourself you're just that

743
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:17,440
guy jumping over fences and climbing roofs and shouting parkour and shouting parkour

744
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:25,560
but when you are in a group oh now it's fine i think it's one of those things um that if

745
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:30,200
somebody's not filming you with a camera said oh this is going on youtube then it is going

746
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,800
to be like a weird thing to catch you doing you're saying it's important to have someone

747
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:39,120
to film you doing the parkour yeah or else you're just what are you doing it for exercise

748
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,700
well here's here's a possibility let me hit you with this do all your parkour with like

749
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:49,820
a messenger bag and then it's like whoa oh shit oh we got a premium rush we do have a

750
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:55,640
premium rush situation uh yeah premium rush guys critics just got the response back did

751
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,900
not like the bikes too many bikes they said love jgl he did a great acting job a little

752
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:05,200
too much biking so uh we're just going to subtract them from premium rush 2 no bikes

753
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,920
no bike we're going to go ahead and put no bikes in the title maybe that'll entice people

754
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:13,280
who got a little burned by the first one and all its bikes don't you think though that

755
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,960
like when when skateboarding first started to take off there was like a kid who was like

756
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:23,040
i want to do skateboarding but everybody else in the city is really good yeah i don't want

757
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:28,120
to show up okay here's the thing though you see someone with a skateboard and you think

758
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:33,360
oh that guy's out there skateboarding having fun if you see someone doing parkour badly

759
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:38,160
it's just like hey asshole the stairs are right there yeah don't be an idiot also i

760
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:43,680
also think that parkour badly translates to broken ankles well that's right it's not a

761
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,520
game it's not a long-term game plan yeah you see somebody jumped off the roof and you died

762
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:54,200
you see somebody jump off the roof and just barely land it and you think like that's not

763
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:59,480
sustainable that that kid's going to be in the game for maybe another couple weeks and

764
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,440
then he's going to have to get an office job somewhere it's going to it's going to affect

765
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:10,520
his gait is parkour weird or sad though like i think the word sad it makes me think of

766
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:15,040
like all clinically depressed people actually do parkour whenever you see somebody doing

767
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,360
parkour they're actually crying and they're they're flipping their tears every time they

768
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:24,560
do a backflip a few tears just like just like fling off their face why are they so sad when

769
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:30,480
they're able to flip and gyrate in such an artistically impressive manner i would be

770
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,720
so happy they're not if the parkour isn't making them sad they're parkouring because

771
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:39,920
they're sad is what i'm saying they're trying to parkour the pain away and it's the only

772
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:47,280
thing that works it's the only it's the only thing the only balm for my sadness is a flip

773
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:54,080
and a spin and a jump just do it i mean i don't think it's weird or sad like i i'm pretty

774
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:59,560
impressed with anybody who wants to get out there and get active i guess in this society

775
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:06,760
especially if i bought some soaps the shoes with the the slippery like inner part that

776
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,560
you're supposed to like be able to grind on like railings just using your shoes i've never

777
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,760
seen anybody do that but i always thought it was pretty fucking cool um if i bought

778
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,360
some soaps would that be weird or sad i i don't think it would be either of those things

779
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:26,120
i think it would be it you would look great and and feel great about yourself for like

780
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,640
a minute for a minute and then you fall and you hurt yourself i gotta come to your funeral

781
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:34,840
gotta fly away to austin that's great yeah you'd be buried here right where do you want

782
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:39,240
to be buried this is welcome to our comedy show my brother my brother and me today because

783
