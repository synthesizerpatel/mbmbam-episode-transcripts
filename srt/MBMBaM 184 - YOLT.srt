1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,320
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,320
oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. And I'm your baby,

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,800
baby, baby, Griffin McElroy. This week, Travis told me that we've been overthinking intros,

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,440
that we don't need to keep planning. Like we're always having this conversation about current

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,840
events right before. And maybe there's, and he said, just, just start running.

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,600
You know, that's a, that is a complaint that we get probably more than any other complaint,

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,320
which is that our intros are too thought out and overproduced. They have too strong a sense

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,520
of direction, uh, almost as though they'd been written for us ahead of time by Bruce Valanche,

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,480
which of course everything we say on the show is, it just kind of ruins the, the mystery of it all.

14
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,440
So I feel like, you know, let me just look for some material. There's no reason to like,

15
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,400
overthink this.

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,920
Just look around your room, pick an assortment of objects.

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,480
Okay. You know what? I love this. This is sort of a freestyle. It's like somebody give me,

18
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,160
somebody give me like a, uh, an action, you know, something that people are doing every day.

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,040
Uh, euthanasia.

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,160
Euthanasia. Okay.

21
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,560
Great.

22
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,880
Uh, someone give me a noun, you know, something to, to work.

23
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,240
Colin Mockery.

24
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,640
Colin Mockery. Okay. This is good so far. So far I got a euthanasia, Colin Mockery.

25
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,360
Now I just need a musical style that I can set this to.

26
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
Anything at all? Let me just hear the first thing.

27
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,560
Gregorian chant.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,240
Okay. Anything. Just shout it out.

29
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,520
He already said it and it was perfect.

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:24,400
Okay. So here we go with that. Here is some improvisational comedy from the masters of,

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,880
uh, improv comedy, my brother, my brother, me.

32
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,600
Okay. Hold on. Here comes.

33
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,800
Colin Mockery. Your time has come.

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,200
Freeze.

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,400
Hey, hey, Gov. Can you, can I borrow a biscuit?

36
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,880
I'm a Gregorian.

37
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,680
No, I said freeze, Justin. You're supposed to say yes and you don't go back to the thing

38
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,240
you already did.

39
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,640
Okay.

40
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,560
You don't fucking go back to the safety of, like, the perfect goof you already created.

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,880
We have to create new. We're constantly destroying and creating. That is part of improv comedy.

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,520
Okay. All right.

43
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,360
No problem, Gov. No, I'm a Gregorian monk. Colin Mockery.

44
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,840
You're just doing the same fucking thing that we just did.

45
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,960
It's all about destroying your art from before and create, kill your-

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,360
Freeze.

47
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
I didn't have something better. I just needed time to think.

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,840
Okay. That's not really how freeze works.

49
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,800
Travis.

50
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,080
Freeze. Hey, Gov. Would you fancy a biscuit?

51
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,800
Okay. You're just doing the same fucking things.

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,040
No, I hadn't done that before.

53
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:31,840
That's new.

54
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,480
Yeah, improv comedy is easy. I don't know why. I don't know what Drew Carey was giving

55
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,440
people points for. So, this is my brother. My brother and me, it's a comedy advice show.

56
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,240
When we told, we've told people before it's a comedy advice show and they say,

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,680
so you wait, you give advice to comedians? And it's like, well-

58
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,160
Now we do.

59
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,680
Now we do.

60
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,360
Here's how you improv, fools. Listen up.

61
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,240
That's how you improv.

62
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Listen, pay us $50,000 a month and you can move up the MBM improv comedy levels. Like,

63
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,160
right now I'm level four. And if I want to move up, I have to test out,

64
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,160
but I also have to pay another $50,000.

65
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,960
There's also a significant amount of auditing that has to go on there.

66
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,040
A lot of auditing. I mean, that's basically all-

67
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,200
And lots of otters. There's so many otters, you guys.

68
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,960
So many otters. See, that there was improv comedy on Travis's behalf.

69
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,280
Improv is basically when you think of something and then you just say it.

70
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,520
Yes.

71
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,840
What improv comedy is, basically-

72
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,040
It's talking without thinking about what you're saying. So, basically,

73
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,560
everything Travis has ever done or said has been improv comedy.

74
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,960
Basically, you know how words are usually used to communicate ideas, thoughts,

75
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,440
that kind of thing? What improv comedy does is it takes that away and it says,

76
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,800
what if it was just noise?

77
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,680
What if it was sound?

78
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,440
Let me suggest this because this is what I do.

79
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,800
Pretend like you have an audience of one and it's yourself and don't worry about anyone else

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,240
and just try to make yourself laugh and say things you think are clever.

81
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,600
Just think like, what would I like?

82
00:04:59,600 --> 00:04:59,840
We are.

83
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,880
Just do that.

84
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,760
I love the image of Travis standing alone in a nightclub with Travis,

85
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,880
another Travis, maybe like a slightly older, more wizened Travis,

86
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,080
sitting alone at a table with a bourbon.

87
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,160
Just, you can hear him call out from the back,

88
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,080
Otters! Nice!

89
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,520
Yeah! Nice!

90
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,960
Make more fart noises.

91
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,680
And then maybe they meet up after the show, they have a couple of drinks

92
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
and they realize that they have a lot in common.

93
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,360
And, you know, they just see where the night takes them.

94
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,920
Let's get to the advice.

95
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,600
I've studied abroad in the UK and since coming home, I've been really depressed.

96
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,720
I left everything about living there and all the adventures I got to have on a daily basis

97
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,680
without the responsibilities of a difficult classes or a job.

98
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,880
It was the best time of my life.

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,960
Being home in Texas now seems dull and America's troubles just make me want to pick up and move there.

100
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,040
But I can't leave my family and friends.

101
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,680
I've been trying to use my experience to open my eyes to the greatness of my own home without much luck.

102
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,320
Can you help me find my love of America and get over this study abroad withdrawal?

103
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,680
And that's from Gmail.

104
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,760
Is it possible that it's...

105
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,400
Maybe it has nothing to do with the place so much as it does the experience.

106
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,800
Like it was a really super fun, wonderful thing.

107
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,040
And it's like, yeah, of course you're going to be.

108
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,360
Vacation is great and everybody wishes they could live on vacation all the time.

109
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
But you can't.

110
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,360
If you lived in the UK all your life and then you went to visit somewhere else,

111
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,640
you would love that place too.

112
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,640
It's new and different.

113
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,560
Here's the thing about studying abroad, right?

114
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,840
You go to another place where you don't know anybody.

115
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,920
You know that whatever you do there, A, your time is finite.

116
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,280
And B, the things that you don't have to put down roots or try to figure out.

117
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,760
Some of the bigger questions, you just live moment to moment.

118
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,960
Let me tell you what you were doing for that time you're studying abroad in the UK.

119
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,440
A, you lived like you were dying.

120
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,920
Indeed.

121
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,080
You went skydiving, you went Rocky Mountain climbing,

122
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,160
or maybe Stonehenge climbing, either way.

123
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,920
They don't let you do that, I don't think.

124
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,520
You lived in a way that you were free of the serious responsibilities

125
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,480
that make day-to-day life as an adult such a just a slog.

126
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Just a just a slog.

127
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,800
And maybe that attitude is something that you could inject a little bit more

128
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,080
into your day-to-day life in Tejas.

129
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
And maybe you should just move out of Texas.

130
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,600
Hey, shut the fuck up.

131
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,320
Texas rules.

132
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,080
I mean, unless you live in Austin.

133
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,520
He probably does, because God, where else would you even live?

134
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
I don't... Are there other towns here?

135
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,080
Here's the thing.

136
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,920
You guys touched on it.

137
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,680
If you lived in the UK, imagine you lived in the UK your whole life,

138
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,600
and you came to America and you ate a hot dog,

139
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,440
you're like, fuck, I'm moving here.

140
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,480
Because that's sort of our main tourism is hot dogs.

141
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,800
We have a hot dogs and aquariums.

142
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:52,960
Right.

143
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,240
I've thought this about every place I've ever...

144
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,200
Almost every place.

145
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,080
Not every place, but almost every place I've ever taken vacation at.

146
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,720
Like, you know, when we go to Tybee Island near Savannah,

147
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,800
I think, oh, my God, I could totally live here.

148
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,520
Or Austin.

149
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,960
Oh, my God, I could totally live here.

150
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,040
But the thing is, what you're doing is basically...

151
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,600
Like, for a few days, you're living a life where all you have to do

152
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,920
is worry about entertaining yourself and having fun.

153
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,320
Right.

154
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,720
And like, yeah, that's gonna be pretty addictive.

155
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,600
Let me throw this out.

156
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,280
It's like you're watching a TV show, right?

157
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,160
In which the characters are always having the fun, happy,

158
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,720
or like action-packed, exciting times.

159
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,520
But what you don't see is them going to the grocery store.

160
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,800
You don't see them like...

161
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,520
Yeah, Jack Bauer never poops on 24.

162
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,880
He never like eats some really foul nachos in like episode three.

163
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,400
And then episode six, he's like, I'll be right back.

164
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,320
And then... Although, I don't know.

165
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,440
Think of your time there.

166
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,600
But think of your time there as like an episode of the television show

167
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,240
in which all you had was the highlights.

168
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,640
Right.

169
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,920
And then you come back and it's shitty 24, literally.

170
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,880
I hope that they incorporate that into the new season.

171
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,000
I think that that's must-see TV.

172
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,640
Because like, you'll see one episode and you'll be like,

173
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,440
I haven't seen Jack Bauer in like two entire episodes.

174
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,320
What the fuck?

175
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,240
And then you find out at the end of episode eight,

176
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,680
he has really bad food poisoning.

177
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
He is not going to be a major character in this one.

178
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,120
I wish in this modern era, we probably...

179
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,920
If 24 was on the air right now, and I know it's coming back,

180
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,480
but if it was on the air right this moment,

181
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,640
I think there would probably be a web series

182
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,880
after that was like the next 24.

183
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,880
And it's just Jack Bauer sleeping for 14 hours.

184
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,400
And catching up on Downton Abbey.

185
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,840
I'm so tired.

186
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,640
I'm getting Thai.

187
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,400
Waiting for Thai.

188
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,160
Waiting for Thai is a whole episode.

189
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,600
God, is it going to get there?

190
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,440
Is it going to get there before Downton comes on?

191
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,160
God, I hope so.

192
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,800
What about just a whole season of just him like oversleeping

193
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,960
for the first like five hours?

194
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,800
And I was like, oh my God, everything's going to shit.

195
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,680
And there's bombs going off.

196
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,480
Where's Jack?

197
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,200
Where's Jack?

198
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,080
I haven't seen him in a while.

199
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Listen, he had really bad food poisoning yesterday.

200
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,360
He's plump tuckered.

201
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,040
Will you get off his case?

202
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,320
He just shit his guts out last season, which was yesterday.

203
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,000
Maybe you could calm down for a second.

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,200
Jack, it's Chloe.

205
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,440
We need you to bring down the terrorists who finally...

206
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,120
Chloe, damn it.

207
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,280
Can you bring him here?

208
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,160
Can he come here?

209
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,640
I'm still in my cookie pants.

210
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,800
Can you please bring him here?

211
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,840
I'm not even...

212
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,480
Didn't shave, feel a bit...

213
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,920
Can it wait until tomorrow?

214
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,840
I've sort of told myself I'm just going to kind of putter around today.

215
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,480
You know how you putter to try to get your strength back up?

216
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,280
Chloe, I got a diarrhea.

217
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,920
I got diarrhea.

218
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,000
Why does he get diarrhea every time?

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,200
Why do we want to see Kiefer Sutherland just like spewing his guts out?

220
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,360
Why is that something that fascinates us?

221
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,400
I think it's because he's so strong.

222
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,680
He's such a strong stoic.

223
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,480
Because there can't be heroes anymore, Griffin.

224
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,520
I guess it's true.

225
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,560
We as a society cannot allow heroes and we must watch them poop.

226
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,840
You guys know Yahoo?

227
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,000
Here in America, we just want to watch our heroes poop.

228
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,840
Here's the other thing.

229
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,720
The UK is great.

230
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,200
Every time I go there, I feel like I want to get back there.

231
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,560
Got to get my paper right.

232
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,320
And I'm on that hustle constantly just to try to get back over the UK

233
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,800
because I've had a great time every time.

234
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,440
But every time I've been there, I've also been on vacation.

235
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,160
So I don't know.

236
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,440
Just get a highlight reel, really.

237
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,200
Hang in there.

238
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,800
You'll find it again.

239
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,360
Or you know what?

240
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,200
Just move.

241
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,880
I don't think you can move to the...

242
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,040
I don't think you're allowed to just like move to another country.

243
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,120
It's a one in one out kind of thing.

244
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,280
You got to convince someone in the UK to move here.

245
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,400
Just wait until the next time you see Russell Brown on TV,

246
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,520
ask him to please stay put for a little while

247
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,440
and then get back over there.

248
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,280
Sounds pretty easy.

249
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,320
Here's a Yahoo answer.

250
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,000
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Dan Yoel.

251
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,640
Thanks, Dan.

252
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,120
It's by Yahoo Answers user Hook who asks,

253
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,360
Am I cursed or is 2014 cursed?

254
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,520
I'm I cursed or is 2014 cursed?

255
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,640
I failed in my college and just yesterday I had accident

256
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,400
and it's cost me a lot, $2,500.

257
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,480
My new car, it's Hyundai Elantra 2013

258
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,560
and I don't know what to do.

259
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,800
And I was planning to buy a new phone, but now I can't.

260
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,560
Does anyone have a lot of money and want to give me?

261
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,680
First off, yes.

262
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,880
How much do you need?

263
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,920
This is a promising investment.

264
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,880
I've been watching a lot of Shark Tank lately

265
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,640
and I've learned to identify when there's a promising...

266
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,320
So what's your business?

267
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,600
I just failed out of college.

268
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,160
I'm pretty sure that the year that we are in is cursed.

269
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,840
Can you float me like four grand?

270
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,200
Yep.

271
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,920
You know what?

272
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,720
Here's what I'm going to need.

273
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,400
I'm going to need 50 cents for every car that you wreck

274
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,160
until I get my money back

275
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,000
and then I'm going to need a quarter in perpetuity.

276
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,360
I don't need a portion of your business.

277
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,920
I actually would like to stay out of the you business

278
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,960
if at all possible.

279
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,760
And we're going to need...

280
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,040
It does not seem super promising.

281
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,880
I'd like to be in charge of the branding.

282
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,840
So just like call yourself Justin McElroy from now on.

283
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,120
Is that something we can negotiate?

284
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,200
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this story

285
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,240
and I'm going to license it.

286
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,160
I'm going to take it to Black & Decker.

287
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,520
You know, I'm going to take it...

288
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:25,920
Fuck that.

289
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,400
I'm going to take it to fucking George Clooney

290
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,240
and it's going to be his next film.

291
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,960
It's the story of...

292
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,760
It'll be called A Cursed Year

293
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,120
and it will star who else?

294
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,320
George Clooney.

295
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,240
Well, that's great because you get in a car accident

296
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,200
and you call somebody like,

297
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,080
I was in a car accident.

298
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,960
Like, oh my God, are you okay?

299
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,520
Like, yeah.

300
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,720
I mean, it's just like $2,500 of damage.

301
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,560
It's not even that serious,

302
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,080
but still like bummer.

303
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,320
And I was going to get that phone.

304
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,960
You know, but...

305
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,240
Music swells.

306
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,280
Tears, tears, tears.

307
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,000
You're joking.

308
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,160
But there are whole episode arcs on the OC

309
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,000
that are far less dramatic than this.

310
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,040
This could have a potential on television.

311
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,080
Guys, is 2014 fucking cur...

312
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,440
I know we talked about 20 forward

313
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,560
and like everything's great,

314
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,080
but like, I don't...

315
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,040
What it like...

316
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,920
This person's having like a shitty day

317
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,920
to good Rick Day ratio so far.

318
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,240
2014 has not been working in this dude's favor.

319
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,000
What it seems to me is that in 2013,

320
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,200
it all kind of spread around

321
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,600
and everybody got like 1% of it, right?

322
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,720
Maybe in 2014, it's just a dump on this guy

323
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,840
and everybody else is going to have a banner year, right?

324
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,640
Because all the shit has just been funneled.

325
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,120
Just been funneled into this one person.

326
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,520
Yeah, he's the Job of our generation.

327
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,800
He's taking on all of it so we can have a great 2014.

328
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,280
God and the devil have an agreement about Job 2.0.

329
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,960
You're saying Job in the biblical sense,

330
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
not in the Arrested Development sense.

331
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,760
Yes.

332
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,560
Okay.

333
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,080
Yeah, everybody thinks a great way

334
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,880
to close out New Year's Eve is by taunting Rolani's.

335
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,800
That's not ideal.

336
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
You think it's going to work out.

337
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,080
You think it's going to be a real lark

338
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,040
for you and your friends.

339
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,000
It's going to be a laugh,

340
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,840
but like that laugh is going to cost...

341
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,880
You're going to be haunted by a satyr or something.

342
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,880
Yeah, you don't want to do that.

343
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,320
Don't taunt people.

344
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,760
Stop taunting people, please.

345
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,520
And don't drink and drive

346
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,920
and run over people's daughters.

347
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,000
They might curse you.

348
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,440
Well, that's like good fucking advice in general, Travie.

349
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,560
That's fair.

350
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,520
I mean, that's also just a bad way to start 2014.

351
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,560
Is to kill someone?

352
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,760
Yeah, I would say it's pretty...

353
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,400
Yeah, it's bad.

354
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,240
I don't believe in curses that I believe in is momentum.

355
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,840
You make your own curse, right?

356
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,840
You make your own curse in this life.

357
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,040
And this guy made his by taunting Rolani on New Year's Eve.

358
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,600
You can't get away with that.

359
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,160
This guy taunted Ray Romano on New Year's Eve.

360
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:57,920
And he made...

361
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,120
Ray Romano is a treasure who got a bad rap

362
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,280
for doing comedy that was broadly enjoyable,

363
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,960
as if that's some sort of crime.

364
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,800
I feel bad about this guy because like 2014 is,

365
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,400
for me, been pretty good.

366
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,320
For me, I guess it's all subjective, isn't it?

367
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
Because for me, it's not cursed.

368
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,840
I would say I'm having a blessed...

369
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,240
Hey guys, have a blessed year.

370
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,320
That's something I'm gonna start saying to people.

371
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,840
Let me throw this out though.

372
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,760
Okay, you got in a car accident.

373
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,600
I could see where that's a horrible twist of luck.

374
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,840
You fail out of college?

375
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,360
That's not like a sudden thing that happened in 2014.

376
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,680
The only...

377
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,000
We've only been in 2014 for three weeks.

378
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,960
But the only class he was taking was Safe Driving 101.

379
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,440
Is it this?

380
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,840
That's the problem.

381
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,800
This is pass fail advanced calculus one week edition.

382
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,280
Here we go.

383
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,360
Nope, you got one question wrong.

384
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,560
Get the fuck out of here.

385
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,840
You're out of school.

386
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,560
You're out of...

387
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,360
Listen, this sucks.

388
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,600
It's a bad term, but hey, have a blessed year.

389
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,960
And be careful as you walk out.

390
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,400
We've seen Romani on the lawn.

391
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,000
Do you like how we have tried to be more sensitive

392
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,320
by not referring to Romani as gypsies,

393
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,760
but still clinging to the idea that Romani's

394
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,280
are people that will curse you?

395
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,800
Yeah, we're the worst.

396
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,000
We're the pits.

397
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,720
I love them.

398
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,840
I think they're great people.

399
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,840
You know who's having a good 2014 is Drake.

400
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,000
Drake was on SNL.

401
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,720
Is he a Romani?

402
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,600
Drake is half Jewish, half black, half Romani.

403
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,320
Well, he's one and a half man.

404
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,200
That's why he has that extra torso coming out of his butt

405
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,760
and that has a second person that he keeps inside

406
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,880
the big jackets he wears.

407
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,160
You know, you always see Drake and he's wearing

408
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,000
a big puffy jacket and you wonder why is that?

409
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,600
He seems like a pretty trim dude.

410
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,880
You'd think he'd dress in a sort of more Metro fashion,

411
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,480
but no, he has a second torso that comes out of the base

412
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,120
of his spine and he has to keep it inside of his clothes.

413
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,760
It used to be great.

414
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,920
He used to be able to fold it back on itself

415
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,480
and wear JNCO jeans, but nobody can really wear

416
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,600
JNCO jeans anymore.

417
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,360
I have to be honest, I spaced out for the beginning

418
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,200
of that bit and it got pretty bizarre there in the middle.

419
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,120
You know who else gets bizarre in the middle?

420
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,840
Drake, because he has a second torso that comes out of his ass.

421
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,320
Sydney looked at me, Sydney was a huge Degrassi fan,

422
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,160
which of course everybody knows.

423
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,840
Fucking Drake, that human being is bulletproof.

424
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,720
That motherfucker got to be the kid in a wheelchair

425
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,680
on Degrassi and not in a wheelchair the whole time.

426
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,640
Obviously, Jimmy was shot in that one episode

427
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,680
in the school shooting episode.

428
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,120
Making him literally bulletproof.

429
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,040
Oh, I guess now he's not super bulletproof.

430
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,160
Not super bulletproof.

431
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,280
He's bullet resilient.

432
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,440
She was penetrated by a bullet,

433
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,920
which had some adverse effects on him.

434
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,680
And then he's going to be a rapper.

435
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,920
Do you know how hard it is for regular people

436
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,840
to establish rapper cred?

437
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,800
Like to get cred and believability as a rapper.

438
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,040
This motherfucker, we saw his adolescence.

439
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,120
He was on Canadian TV.

440
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,360
Like you can't snap back from that,

441
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,000
but somehow Drake has made a living as a rapper.

442
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,320
Like he's rapping as if he is not also Jimmy from Degrassi.

443
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,360
After the episode, after the episode of SNL,

444
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,240
Sydney looks at me and says, I'm proud of Drake.

445
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,960
What?

446
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,280
She said, I'm proud of Drake.

447
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,240
Do you think Drake knows whenever anybody in the world

448
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,560
says that and it's like a little bell rings

449
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,000
and he's like, oh, all right, working my way back.

450
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,960
YOLO, I guess.

451
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,360
He came up with YOLO.

452
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,320
That's the other thing.

453
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,440
Did he really?

454
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,880
Yes, Drake invented YOLO.

455
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,120
Oh, great.

456
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,160
Now someone's Googling.

457
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,400
He popularized it.

458
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,600
I don't know if he invented it.

459
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,280
He said on SNL, he said, I invented YOLO.

460
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,440
Actually, Mae West was the first person to say YOLO.

461
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,080
This is true.

462
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,440
Mae West did not say YOLO.

463
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,200
Mae West, popular actor of the early 1900s,

464
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,040
invented YOLO.

465
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,080
She didn't say YOLO.

466
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,240
She said you only live once, but that's.

467
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,160
Yeah, but it's 2014.

468
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,920
Everybody lived as much as they wanted to.

469
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,600
And Mae West brought down the judgment and said, from now on,

470
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,040
you only live once.

471
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,000
And everyone panicked.

472
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,160
And then the stock market crashed.

473
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,760
Mae West was half-fay.

474
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,000
So she got to decide the fate of humanity.

475
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,120
That makes sense.

476
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,520
Yeah.

477
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,320
Do you think Drake, while he was doing Degrassi,

478
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,520
somebody came up to him and was like, hey, Drake,

479
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,840
can I tell you something that Mae West once told me?

480
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,960
You only live once.

481
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,280
And he was like, fuck, I thought I would get like another go-around

482
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,280
on my second torso.

483
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,640
I thought I would get like a second life.

484
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,240
I've been wasting all this time doing Canadian teen dramas.

485
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,040
Yeah, Drake got to be on a Canadian teen drama called Degrassi.

486
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,080
And then after that, he got to be a rapper named Drake.

487
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,320
If anybody should not be preaching to me about how we only have one life,

488
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,200
it's Drake.

489
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,160
That motherfucker has obviously, at this point,

490
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,000
lived two very distinct lives.

491
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,220
YOLT.

492
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,640
YOLT.

493
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,140
YOLT.

494
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,040
IOLT.

495
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,040
IOLT.

496
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,560
IOLT YOLO.

497
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,120
OK?

498
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,620
IOLT.

499
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,200
That's fine.

500
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,080
But YOLO.

501
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,960
I think it would actually, it'll be like ODLT,

502
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,720
which is only Drake lives twice.

503
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,280
Nobody else can even try it.

504
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,320
How about another question?

505
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,360
Our question to goof ratio has been pretty bad.

506
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,200
It's Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

507
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,120
We're just, everybody else gets the day off.

508
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,040
I don't know why we can't take the day off from being topical or funny.

509
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,520
I think we've done a pretty good job so far.

510
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,160
Like others, my grandmother bakes cookies and other goods.

511
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,560
One problem.

512
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,240
She often uses expired ingredients to make the food,

513
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,280
saying that the new food has its own expiration.

514
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,320
Hold the goddamn phone.

515
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,600
A moment.

516
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,520
You're saying, like, if she uses some rotten ass, like,

517
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,640
eggs that she found in a mummy's crypt,

518
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,440
and then, like, bakes that into a pie,

519
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,200
she's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

520
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,400
Don't even worry about it.

521
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,800
Now it's new.

522
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,760
It's been reborn.

523
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,680
Refresh the clock on this pie.

524
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,480
You think those eggs are like,

525
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
oh, guys, guys, guys, we're pie now.

526
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,680
All right, start it over.

527
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,120
Cool, cool.

528
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,840
Start it over.

529
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,320
Germs, germs, bacteria, you guys get out of here.

530
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,200
We're starting fresh.

531
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,840
It's got to be a stressful thing as an egg, though.

532
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,160
You get this new lease on life as pie,

533
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,560
and then you have to hope that you're,

534
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,640
you start racking your egg brain like,

535
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,680
what else could pie be?

536
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:22,960
Oh, fuck.

537
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,680
She could transform the pie into maybe a smoothie.

538
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,040
Can you put us in a blender, please?

539
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,400
And then you just take that smoothie,

540
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
pour it into another pie.

541
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,680
That's actually what the movie Life of Pie is about.

542
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,520
And also what the Miracle of Hanukkah was.

543
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,120
A lot of people don't know that.

544
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,840
That's what that was.

545
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,840
That part's not true.

546
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,440
Do you want to finish the question?

547
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,200
Yes.

548
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,120
My family won't confront her about it.

549
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,240
And even says she's right.

550
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,360
What the fuck are you doing?

551
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,040
You need to emancipate.

552
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,440
Your family's fucking crazy.

553
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,760
Am I right in thinking this is disgusting and wrong?

554
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,320
And if so, how do I get my family to stop eating her food

555
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,440
or get her to stop?

556
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,560
That's from Nana's Nasty Nibbles in Naga Doches.

557
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,600
Hey, here's a fun game.

558
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,520
Nacog Doches.

559
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,480
Here's a fun game.

560
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,400
Wait till you're in the middle of a crowded room

561
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,880
and then just patiently lean forward and say,

562
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,600
hey, my grandmother cooks with expired food.

563
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,280
And then lean back and watch everybody react and go,

564
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,120
okay, yes, I am 100% correct.

565
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,080
And no one in that bar, stranger or no, will go,

566
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,360
well, yeah, that's perfectly normal.

567
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,120
She uses old ass eggs and gross milk.

568
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,080
Yeah, that's fine.

569
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,960
Please just promise me one thing, question asker.

570
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,400
If you and your family have an intervention

571
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,880
for your grandma over her old food

572
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,720
and you get your old, old grandma

573
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,120
and you get to shame her about using expired ingredients,

574
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,640
please promise you'll invite me.

575
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,480
I just need to be in the circle

576
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,800
where I can stand up and read my letter

577
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,560
about how her use of expired ingredients

578
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,640
has hurt me personally and how I care about her.

579
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,520
It's hurt you in a very, if you're eating it,

580
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,640
it'll hurt, it'll hurt you.

581
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm not like a doctor

582
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,200
and I'm probably not even very good at science

583
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,520
just like compared to the average person.

584
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,960
But if you eat an old egg,

585
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,160
you're gonna get sick from it probably.

586
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,800
Here's the thing, listeners, listeners,

587
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,320
here's what I don't need.

588
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,720
I don't need any of you to email me and go,

589
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,640
well, actually, because the baking process,

590
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,960
blah, because the fact of the matter is

591
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,800
she's using old-ass eggs and old-ass milk

592
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,320
and I don't even let that shit in my house.

593
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:22,960
No.

594
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,480
Let alone in my cookies.

595
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
Now, I feel like Nana needs an advocate here.

596
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,000
So I'm gonna say, I mean, you're cooking it.

597
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,680
It is safe, like it's safe.

598
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,200
It's gross.

599
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,240
Wait, wait, no, hold on.

600
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,720
Because this argument is starting to take a real turn

601
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,080
for the worst because you're saying,

602
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,920
regardless of the age of the egg,

603
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,680
if you apply enough heat to it,

604
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,960
it will become safe to eat.

605
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,240
Yeah.

606
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,040
Unless she is cooking at 1200 degrees.

607
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,360
That's right.

608
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,560
If she's irradiating them, then yes, I agree.

609
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,240
There's no danger of anything.

610
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,360
It's not dangerous.

611
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,840
It's dangerous to your palate.

612
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,480
It's gonna taste like-

613
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,960
You realize that you can cook food

614
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,640
and still get food poisoning from it, right?

615
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,600
That's not how that works, Travis.

616
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,880
It is, in fact, how that works, Justin.

617
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,920
That's not how it works.

618
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,760
If you cook, okay, I have my food handler's license, okay?

619
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,880
So everybody take a step back.

620
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,840
Jesus, what did you get?

621
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,360
Where did you, Olive Garden?

622
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,200
What, yes.

623
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,920
Okay, can I, I think that that food handler's license

624
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,880
is no longer, I think you have to re-up that every,

625
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,080
I don't know, decade.

626
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,160
Yeah, but I don't think the science on food handling

627
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,880
has changed that much.

628
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,960
Also, I don't think during your food handler's classes,

629
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,560
they're like, yeah, don't even worry about it.

630
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,680
Once you cook it, the clock resets on that one.

631
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,960
No, I mean that we didn't cover that.

632
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,680
I think that though, once you bake it

633
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,440
and you kill all the bacteria.

634
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,240
Justin, I want you to take a chicken cutlet,

635
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,640
set it on the counter for three days.

636
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,000
Wait, I got one here.

637
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,240
Okay, set it on the counter for three days

638
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,680
and then I want you to bake it at 350 degrees for 20 minutes

639
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,960
and then I want to watch you eat it.

640
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,360
I would do that.

641
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,960
I have enough patience.

642
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,680
Bullshit.

643
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,480
I would do that.

644
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,160
I have enough patience, I would do it.

645
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,960
Let's do a quick edit.

646
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,160
Let me leave some chicken out.

647
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,560
Okay.

648
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,680
Okay, I've got the chicken here.

649
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,240
We're back.

650
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,120
It's been three days.

651
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,920
It's Thursday.

652
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,120
Let me just, yeah, I'm fine.

653
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,880
Gosh, guys, through the magic of radio,

654
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,160
I've proven you wrong.

655
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,080
You ate that really fast, Justin.

656
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,120
I'm worried about how quickly you were cooking it.

657
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,040
I had to cut away some stuff.

658
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,160
There wasn't a lot of salvageable meat left.

659
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,880
It had largely decomposed, but it was still delicious.

660
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,680
Little Dijon, delicious.

661
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,000
I think you need to go to your old grandma and say,

662
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,800
listen, you don't have much time left.

663
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,880
Wow, okay, come on.

664
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,320
What are you supposed to say?

665
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,240
Well, don't bring up her impending death.

666
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,120
That's probably not a good way to start up any conversation ever.

667
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,840
You guys, you guys, you guys, you guys.

668
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,320
Travis.

669
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,160
What if she's using expired food as a metaphor

670
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,000
for how she still has a purpose

671
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,080
and they shouldn't put her in the home?

672
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,800
Oh my God, she's trying to stay out of a home.

673
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,120
Of course.

674
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,320
She sent you a message like,

675
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,840
yeah, maybe these eggs are a little old,

676
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,920
but that doesn't mean they're not still useful.

677
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,960
Hey, Nana, can I make a quick suggestio?

678
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,800
If you could get Nana on the line real quick.

679
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,000
Make this point with anything else.

680
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,560
Make it with old board games.

681
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,520
Like this Scrabble may have a little dust on it,

682
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,880
but it's still a hoot to play.

683
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,760
We lost all the E tiles, but it's still a pretty fun game.

684
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,560
Reset the clock.

685
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,600
VHS copy of Spaceballs may be a little cracky

686
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
and a little staticky, but it's still pretty fun.

687
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,440
Reset the clock.

688
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,160
Reset the clock on these Spaceballs.

689
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,600
These fresh Spaceballs now.

690
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,880
Put it in the DVD player.

691
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,240
Like Meeps, we can't.

692
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
We can't be, it's a VHS, Meeps.

693
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,760
That movie's fucking definitely expired.

694
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,360
Tried to watch it the other day.

695
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,960
That shit gone bad.

696
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,080
It went rancid.

697
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,720
You watch that and you watch Men in Tights

698
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,560
and you're like, oh, now I get it.

699
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,840
Now I understand.

700
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,920
No, F you, Men in Tights is great.

701
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,840
Yeah, sure, sure.

702
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,880
Eat these eggs, Travis.

703
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,640
Eat these old eggs.

704
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,080
Eat these old eggs, you're gonna love it.

705
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,040
I got some prime Florida real estate to sell you, my man.

706
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,080
Audience Travis is like, yeah, he's right though.

707
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,560
Nailed it, stuck it to him.

708
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,000
You know what never goes bad?

709
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,500
What?

710
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:27,840
Money.

711
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,360
I mean, it does if it like defaults.

712
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,720
Like I don't think they're-

713
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,320
Or if you like soak it in eggs.

714
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,960
I think it's still legal tender like forever.

715
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
But I don't think they use francs anymore.

716
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,360
I think if you have francs, they just like,

717
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,720
they won't accept those.

718
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,240
And hey pennies.

719
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,400
And hey pennies, doubloons.

720
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,620
Amazon.

721
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,720
Amazon takes doubloons?

722
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,120
I was trying, okay guys, listen.

723
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,720
I was trying to say money zone just now

724
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,120
and the word that came out of my mouth was Amazon.

725
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,160
I had like a mini, I'm worried.

726
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,440
Can one of you get down here?

727
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,080
Can one of you get down here?

728
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,680
You ain't done expired chicken.

729
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,120
And look at you, your brain's shut now.

730
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,760
Guys.

731
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,560
Piece by piece.

732
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,320
We need to get the magic school bus up in your face.

733
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,040
We're wasting time.

734
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,840
We need to get paid.

735
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,320
We need to get paid.

736
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,360
Let's go to the puppy pool.

737
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,660
All right.

738
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Let's go to the family zone.

739
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,720
I'm going to set it up.

740
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,080
I mean, I'm keeping all that in the show.

741
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:31,680
Let's go to Tremzalore.

742
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:38,800
What's the first message for?

743
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,520
This message is for Chris, who is apparently also known as the Phoenix.

744
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,840
You can't just do that, Chris.

745
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,400
You can't.

746
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,480
Well, I mean, I don't think Chris wrote the message.

747
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,920
In fact, it's from Nate, Brian, Chelsea, Jeremy, and Alicia.

748
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,400
Or Alyssa.

749
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,040
That's their gift.

750
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,000
That's their gift to him.

751
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,880
Like, finally.

752
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,600
OK, fine.

753
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,640
Fine.

754
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,360
You're the Phoenix.

755
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:57,520
Fine.

756
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,320
What do you want to be?

757
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,200
Space Hawk?

758
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,520
Sure.

759
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,000
Fuck it.

760
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,400
Whatever.

761
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,720
Can't believe we won't see your beautiful angst filled face at the office anymore.

762
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,440
You're a super hardworking, smart, and amazing writer.

763
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,320
Hilarious, spirited, and made the best coffee.

764
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,880
Your absurd sense of humor and habit of openly napping at your desk will be missed.

765
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,080
Damn you for leaving.

766
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,960
Damn you.

767
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,080
But best of luck out there.

768
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,200
That's for Nate, Brian, Chelsea, Jamie, and Alicia.

769
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,520
Jeremy.

770
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,640
Jeremy, not Jamie.

771
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:22,880
Jeremy.

772
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,080
There is no Jamie.

773
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,720
From Jamie.

774
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,600
Maybe there's a Jamie at the office, but I don't want her getting credit for this.

775
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
So best of luck, Chris, in all your future endeavors.

776
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,480
For a second, I worried that Chris was dead, and that he had died,

777
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,520
and they were writing this, and then I remembered he's the Phoenix.

778
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,960
Oh, shit.

779
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,920
That is impossible.

780
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,720
Miss you, Phoenix.

781
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,240
We'll see you, like, in a week.

782
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,800
He's been reborn as a gas station attendant.

783
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,760
Please don't touch the pile of ashes on Chris's desk.

784
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,400
That's Chris.

785
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,320
He's gestating.

786
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,640
He's gestating right now. He's going to come back more beautiful than ever.

787
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,240
You only live twice.

788
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,960
My brother, my brother being supported by Squarespace, an all-in-one platform that

789
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,880
makes it fast and easy to create your own professional website or online portfolio.

790
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,960
You want to dedicate a website to Drake?

791
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,440
Of course you do, but you can do that now through the magic of Squarespace.

792
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,480
They're always improving.

793
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,840
They got a support team available 24-7, and it's just eight bucks a month with a free domain if you

794
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,600
sign up for a year.

795
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,880
You can get a trial with no credit card required, and you can start

796
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,960
building that Drake website right now.

797
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,480
Just go build your website.

798
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,200
You want to write Justin Drake slash fiction.

799
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,760
You can make a Jake website, and that's the name of his weird torso.

800
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,960
If you want to write Travis slash older, more distinguished Travis in the audience slash

801
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,360
fiction, and then we can compare what we've written.

802
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,600
Travis already has some literature on the subject.

803
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,240
He would be happy to share.

804
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,520
I've been published twice.

805
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,020
Mm-hmm.

806
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,680
I'm the only published slash fiction author.

807
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:59,280
The great thing about this terrible website you're making is that it'll work on mobile,

808
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,080
just like that.

809
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,200
It'll match your style, and that's automatic, so don't worry about it.

810
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,720
It will be terrible in content.

811
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,960
It will design in the programming.

812
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,920
It'll be terrific.

813
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,520
Go to Squarespace.com, use the offer code MYBROTHER1.

814
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,960
That's all one word, MYBROTHER, and then the number one to get 10% off your first purchase.

815
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,440
Squarespace, everything you need to create an exception.

816
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,160
I think it's an exceptional website.

817
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,840
Okay, that got cut off.

818
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,000
Everything you need to create an exception.

819
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I bet you there's no good Drake slash fiction websites.

820
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,880
I have an exception to that rule, and it's my Squarespace site.

821
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,280
I know everybody's tried Hulu.

822
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,720
All right, that's old news.

823
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,600
Everybody's got Hulu.

824
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,440
I've got it at my contacts, streamed through Wi-Fi to my contacts I wear.

825
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,320
You have Google Eyes.

826
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,440
I have Google Eyes.

827
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,760
I have googly eyes, and I'm going to upgrade that experience.

828
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,960
You wear as Googles.

829
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,920
I wear what?

830
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,560
They're like goggles, but with Google in them.

831
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,600
I'm going to upgrade that experience.

832
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,320
Why did they call Google Glass Googles?

833
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,920
We call them Googles.

834
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,720
Googles.

835
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:12,080
You've probably tried Hulu, but Hulu Plus is the better version of that, okay?

836
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,240
You can watch your favorite shows anytime, anywhere.

837
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,560
Smartphone, tablet, it doesn't matter.

838
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,720
Whatever show you want to watch ever in the history of mankind, they're all on there,

839
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,720
and that's legally binding because I just said it.

840
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,560
I don't think, I don't think like...

841
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,880
Well, agree to disagree.

842
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,480
It's all the ones you'd ever want to watch.

843
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,600
Travis, name literally any show you can think of.

844
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,640
Jimmy Kimmel Live.

845
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,520
Yes, on there.

846
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,120
Shark Tank.

847
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,080
On there.

848
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,800
Scandal.

849
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,200
On there.

850
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,080
Do you see Griffin?

851
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,240
Any show, and there is original stuff too.

852
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Travis, just like come up with a name for a show that isn't on TV that you would just

853
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,040
like to see.

854
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,560
The Wrong Man's.

855
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,280
Yeah, it's on there.

856
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,000
Hulu Plus.

857
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,240
What, they made it just because I said it out loud?

858
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,280
There's one on there.

859
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,200
Anything your mind can conceive of, Hulu Plus will summon into existence.

860
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,760
Can I try?

861
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:58,640
Yeah.

862
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,600
Law and Order SVU.

863
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,920
Yeah, it's on there.

864
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,120
It's like Law and Order.

865
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,400
It just got retrofitted to all of like, we all remember SVU existing now because Hulu

866
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,160
went back in time and made it.

867
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:17,760
And this amazing technology can be yours for $8 a month, but you're not going to have to

868
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,240
pay that.

869
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,360
No, you're with us.

870
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:25,040
HuluPlus.com slash my brother will get you an extended two week free trial.

871
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,400
So head on over to HuluPlus.com slash my brother and they'll know we sent you and you can get

872
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
your two free weeks of Hulu Plus.

873
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,920
Every referral we get, they give us one more episode of Law and Order SVU.

874
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,000
It's like a referral bonus every time.

875
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,120
And by the way, these are episodes that nobody else can watch.

876
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,080
These are bespoke episodes of Law and Order SVU just for us.

877
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,760
We can even, we can even specify what we want the crimes to be.

878
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,080
It's mine crime.

879
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,960
The one thing they won't do is make another season of Flavor of Love.

880
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,120
I've tried so many times and it just isn't going to happen.

881
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,120
It would destabilize the time stream.

882
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,440
Well, they also have explained that they can't find a single woman that would

883
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,600
agree to do that show on Earth.

884
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,880
They've actually started sending probes out into the vast corners of the universe

885
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,760
to try and find some sort of living being that would agree to be on Flavor of Love.

886
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:29,040
By the way, just so you people know at home, you would expect, just statistically speaking,

887
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,560
that eventually an advertiser would be mad at us for something we did.

888
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,120
Hasn't happened.

889
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,600
Nope.

890
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,040
Has never happened.

891
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,240
I don't know if they just shoot this money into space and like,

892
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,440
well, best of luck, money.

893
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,400
That or we are like fucking like madmen.

894
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,320
We're like so fucking good at this.

895
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,400
Listen, all right, listen, I'm going to fire this entire board of directors

896
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,080
unless someone tells me why we never thought to offer every show in existence.

897
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:57,680
And the nominees for Advertisement of the Year are the Coca-Cola Polar Bears.

898
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,480
Always a classic.

899
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,440
That one commercial water refrigerator, Perry, gets the Coca-Cola from kid

900
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,840
kid before the big game and everything that my brother, my brother and me have ever done.

901
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,360
The best act with Coca-Cola.

902
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,360
Thank you for joining us for the Coca-Cola Awards.

903
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,800
I'm Carrie Poppy.

904
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,680
I'm Ross Blucher.

905
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,720
And we make a show.

906
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,920
Oh no, Ross and Carrie.

907
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,480
Oh no.

908
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,480
We investigate fringe science.

909
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,520
Spirituality.

910
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,480
Religious groups.

911
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,840
Alternative therapies.

912
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,720
We put ourselves through a lot of uncomfortable situations.

913
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,840
So that you don't have to.

914
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,440
Because really, why would you?

915
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,440
For example, I watched a tube be inserted into Ross's anus.

916
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,920
That's true, but it sounds terrible out of context.

917
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,880
We've tried penis and breast enlargement pills.

918
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,360
We spent six months undercover becoming Mormons.

919
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,040
We hung out with the 9-11 truthers.

920
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,880
The UFO cult, the Raelians.

921
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,760
And we're going to do more.

922
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,560
It's one of the newest shows on MaximumFun.org.

923
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,720
On my way to class the other day,

924
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,120
I found a nice camelback water bottle lying on the ground.

925
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,640
That sounds like an anecdote, but I promise there's a question.

926
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,720
After looking around to make sure no one was looking,

927
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,320
I swooped in and picked it up.

928
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,400
Later that day, and before drinking from the bottle,

929
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,240
I went to the store and bought a new mouthpiece

930
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,360
and straw for the bottle.

931
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,320
This is getting exciting.

932
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,960
Despite this, my girlfriend says,

933
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,640
still, it's disgusting to drink out of,

934
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,920
and I should throw it away.

935
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,680
A bottle like this would cost around $26.

936
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,600
So I don't want to get rid of it.

937
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,560
All right, sorry.

938
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,280
I'll stop laughing, because there's a lot of math

939
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,960
being bandied about on this question,

940
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,000
and I want the audience to really consider all the variables.

941
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,400
I don't want to get rid of it so quickly.

942
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,040
What should I do?

943
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,520
That's from Waterless in St. Louis.

944
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,400
Let me throw this out.

945
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,720
Oh, your camelback that you found on the ground.

946
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,600
You want to throw that out.

947
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,880
You want to throw that right in the garbage,

948
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,320
because it's a liquid that somebody else

949
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,520
had used with their mouth.

950
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,200
If you've already drank out of it once,

951
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,520
what's it matter now?

952
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,160
Have they?

953
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,680
In for a penny, in for a pound.

954
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,160
Okay, yeah.

955
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,600
He has already drank from the bottle.

956
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,240
I think the problem is,

957
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,000
is this bottle going to be a point of friction

958
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,120
between you and your girlfriend?

959
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,040
Because if that's so, hop in the old car,

960
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
sit there for 15 minutes, get out of the car,

961
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,680
come back like, yeah, switch that old bottle out.

962
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,560
And then paste a picture of a different girl

963
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,440
onto the camelback, and it's your new girlfriend now.

964
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,280
This is my girlfriend camelback.

965
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,480
She's very hydrated.

966
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,000
That's what the movie Her was about.

967
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,560
I feel like I can talk to you in a way

968
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,920
I've never been able to talk to anybody else.

969
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,840
Yeah, I'm dating my camelback.

970
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,400
Yeah, that's not weird.

971
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,440
Lots of people are doing that.

972
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:49,120
I'm dating merman from email.

973
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,600
I just wish you had a body so I could make love to you.

974
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,480
Oh yeah, I'm touching your nozzles.

975
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,000
At least the camelback has an orifice.

976
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,200
That's true.

977
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,680
That cyber lady in Her didn't have that.

978
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,360
Have you guys read any of that Drake camelback slash fiction?

979
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,000
I think that the fact that you bought a straw for it

980
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,600
is a little crazy.

981
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,200
Because I think that, is there a straw

982
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,560
that's like an attachment for it?

983
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,760
Or is this just like a straw?

984
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,840
Do you know what a camelback is, Justin?

985
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,000
Yeah, it's like a water bottle.

986
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,200
Okay, camelback is like a bag that one like

987
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,640
if you're bicycling or walking that you're not carrying

988
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,480
it's attached to the thing and then there's a tube

989
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,080
with a mouthpiece that goes in your mouth

990
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,040
and you got a hole in your mouth.

991
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,840
It's a backpack.

992
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,200
It's a backpack.

993
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,840
Wait a minute.

994
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,480
Wait a minute.

995
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,280
I have a question for you question asker

996
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,120
that maybe you should confront yourself with.

997
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,720
What are the set of circumstances

998
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,280
that would cause a human being to say,

999
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,600
Oh, well, I'm never drinking from this again

1000
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,680
and throw it on the ground.

1001
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,280
Now that is an accident.

1002
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,840
Here's what happened.

1003
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,680
The person was walking on the quad, right?

1004
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,640
And then they took, they were enjoying their beverage.

1005
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,640
Maybe they had some Sierra mist in there, right?

1006
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,320
Mixing it up and they take it out.

1007
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,000
And right when they take it out a hawk flying overhead shits

1008
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,040
and the shit falls directly into the tube

1009
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,880
goes directly into the camelback bag.

1010
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,040
Like he sees it go all the way deep down.

1011
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And then he says, well, I guess this party's come to

1012
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,160
I guess we've reached the end of the road old friend.

1013
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,880
Oh, let me throw this out.

1014
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,640
The gentleman, he's walking across the quad.

1015
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,480
He's drinking it and he gets a text message

1016
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,240
from an unknown number and it says,

1017
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,600
you've been poisoned.

1018
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:39,920
Okay.

1019
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,640
Your camelback contains cyanide.

1020
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,160
You have 20 minutes to get the hustle.

1021
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,760
He rips off his backpack,

1022
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,840
rips off his camelback and just starts running.

1023
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,400
Five minutes later, along comes question asker.

1024
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,960
Like, Ooh, free camelback and die.

1025
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,480
You're saying that this person is probably already dead

1026
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,880
and we're giving advice to a ghost right now.

1027
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,040
Yep.

1028
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,640
Yep. I do wonder what the lag time has been

1029
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,400
between this person sending in this question

1030
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
us answering it because I like the image

1031
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,920
of a water bottle just sitting alone on a shelf.

1032
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,720
Like I'm going to get you.

1033
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,840
I'm going to figure this out.

1034
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,560
I'm going to crack this.

1035
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,760
What if we get an email like tomorrow?

1036
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,040
It's like, Hey guys, thanks for the help.

1037
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,320
Got trench mouth already though.

1038
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,080
So send it in two weeks ago.

1039
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,800
Could have used it then.

1040
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,680
Got this here trench mouth, but I guess.

1041
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,680
Here's another thing you need to learn

1042
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,720
about being in relationships.

1043
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,600
A lot of times you'll come into items by unscrupulous means

1044
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,200
and you've got to be better at covering your tracks.

1045
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,960
You shouldn't tell someone that you got it,

1046
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,440
that it's dirty and you got it from a dirty place.

1047
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,040
Your friend Steven gave it to you.

1048
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,240
Cause he didn't want it anymore.

1049
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,800
My friend Ricky, he's done with water.

1050
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,760
He's getting out of the water.

1051
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,440
That's why it says Ricky on the bag.

1052
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,200
You know, you've never met Ricky before,

1053
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,520
but we house sat for Ricky that one time.

1054
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,040
Remember, remember he had all that pizza you didn't like

1055
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,640
and you kind of made the yucky face.

1056
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,520
And Ricky was like, I got too many water bottles.

1057
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,680
I'm eventually going to unload some.

1058
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,080
You remember you commented on his water bottle room

1059
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,040
and there was a journal in the water bottle room.

1060
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,960
It was like, man, I can't wait to start throwing these away

1061
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,080
and handing them out to my friends.

1062
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,760
You remember, you remember, you remember it.

1063
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,640
You're just our friend, Ricky, the water bottle magnate.

1064
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,000
He's got the glass eyeball.

1065
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,040
He's got two glass, he's got two glass eyeballs,

1066
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,200
but he's always, he's never thirsty.

1067
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,120
You remember he's the moistest man.

1068
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,320
He's very damp.

1069
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,360
Ricky Nalgene, you know, come on.

1070
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,080
This is gross.

1071
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,840
I can't, I can eat.

1072
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,160
I could probably eat some food

1073
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,120
if I cut around the mouth marks, right?

1074
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,600
I think fluid is just like, it's so pervasive, you know?

1075
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,240
So wet.

1076
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,800
Well, no, like it, your shit gets in there

1077
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,080
and then it's just like, that, that CamelBak

1078
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,600
is like a fucking incubator at that point

1079
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,360
because it's just like a little closed off,

1080
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,960
water tight surface.

1081
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,640
It's like a fucking, it's like a Petri dish.

1082
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,440
It's kind of gross.

1083
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,800
Like you're not even supposed to reuse.

1084
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,640
But I feel like this is a Columbo moment

1085
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,240
where you've already said, like,

1086
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,400
if you didn't know it was gross,

1087
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,360
you wouldn't have bought a new mouthpiece and tube.

1088
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,880
Like you would admit that it's gross,

1089
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,440
but you think that you've hedged your bets on the grossness.

1090
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,600
It's kind of, it's living in a pretty cool city

1091
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,320
where you can buy just like attachments for water bottles.

1092
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,840
I don't know what story this is.

1093
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,160
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

1094
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:26,660
Please.

1095
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,840
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

1096
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,080
Are you Ira Ray?

1097
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,120
Who wants to know?

1098
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,080
Thanks, Ira, it's by Yahoo.

1099
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,120
The American government.

1100
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,560
The American, is he like Edward Snowden?

1101
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,320
He's at least number two on the list.

1102
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,720
Oh, fuck, I'm so sorry that I evoked that.

1103
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1104
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1105
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,240
No, it's fine, let me help you with this question.

1106
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,120
Yahoo, please, I won't read the Yahoo if you don't.

1107
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,440
Please, go ahead, it's just me, Snowden.

1108
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,240
So that's by Yahoo Answers user Anna, who asks,

1109
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,800
can anyone find me an article

1110
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,000
about not smacking horses in the face?

1111
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,320
Can anyone find me an article

1112
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,960
about not smacking horses in the face?

1113
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,560
Can anyone find me an article about not smacking horses in the face?

1114
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,920
That's worded weirdly.

1115
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,200
My sister seems to think that smacking my horse in the face

1116
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,480
solves every problem,

1117
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,560
and even though I've told her a hundred times

1118
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,600
not to smack him in the face.

1119
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,720
Every problem?

1120
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,200
She says I'm being too soft and does it anyway.

1121
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,040
He's getting head shy.

1122
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:34,820
Sorry.

1123
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,000
Getting smacked in the head turns you head shy?

1124
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Like, yeah, I guess it makes sense.

1125
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,500
Yeah.

1126
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,480
And I still can't convince her to just verbally tell him off.

1127
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,480
Or even smack him on the neck.

1128
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,840
Just not his face.

1129
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,720
Her and my horse are having problems deciding who is the boss.

1130
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,720
So do any of you know of an article that would say

1131
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,480
not to do that, I can send her.

1132
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,840
Additional details.

1133
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,440
My sister partially owns, quote unquote, my horse.

1134
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,920
So I can't tell her not to go near him.

1135
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,960
She is an excellent rider and is generally great with them,

1136
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,840
but her and this horse just don't get along very well.

1137
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,280
So far, all of your answers have been great.

1138
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,000
Thank you so much.

1139
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,400
Okay, there's a lot going on here.

1140
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,160
First of all, every problem?

1141
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,720
Damn this Obamacare.

1142
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,920
God damn it.

1143
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,000
I tried to use that website for a week and I can't do it.

1144
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,120
And I broke my arm and I can't.

1145
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,620
Come here.

1146
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,440
Son of a bitch.

1147
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:26,640
Sorry.

1148
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,480
I mean, this is for you.

1149
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,520
For to run better.

1150
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,400
Secondly, are there other circumstances in which you

1151
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,880
verbally tell off the horse and the horse goes, I know.

1152
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,680
You're right.

1153
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,040
Listen, I blew it.

1154
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,680
I fucking blew it.

1155
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,680
Listen, you're preaching the choir, okay?

1156
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,320
I know.

1157
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,920
I tried to cancer over those crossbars and I fucked it up, okay?

1158
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,640
You don't have to hit me.

1159
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,280
There's no pain you could give me that's worse than the guilt

1160
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,560
I'm feeling right now, Deborah.

1161
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,120
God damn it.

1162
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,280
I also don't think you're going to say that someone else

1163
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,520
partially owns your horse.

1164
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,000
I think that by definition makes it our horse.

1165
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,400
Or that makes it both of your horses.

1166
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,920
Look, it's God's horse.

1167
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,360
Yeah.

1168
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:12,000
You may be leasing this horse and subletting it to your sister,

1169
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,280
but make no mistake, it belongs to our Lord and Savior.

1170
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,880
What's the original question?

1171
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,520
What's the-

1172
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,960
Can anyone find me an article about not smacking horses in the face?

1173
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:29,280
I can find you a wicked lot of articles that are not about smacking horses in the face.

1174
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:35,280
I bet you can't find any articles about not smacking horses on the public internet.

1175
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,040
Yeah, that's right, Justin, an excellent point.

1176
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:39,440
You're saying-

1177
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,880
They're on the secret-

1178
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,960
Edward, you're saying that the NSA-

1179
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,240
Yes?

1180
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,680
Runs some sort of-

1181
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,000
Follow it to the end, shake it through.

1182
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,520
Runs some sort of-

1183
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:54,960
Add it up.

1184
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,080
All the trapeze is coming together.

1185
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,760
Some sort of website network that is-

1186
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,200
Think bigger, Benghazi.

1187
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:15,280
Benghazi is when two shooters were the grassing-

1188
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,840
The grassing all, actually, added up.

1189
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:24,640
And to the right, then hold on, I'm almost there.

1190
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,520
You're so close.

1191
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:32,240
The national treasure to Book of Secrets, Book of Secrets.

1192
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,720
It's the Book of Secrets.

1193
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,000
Then I think that all horses are Illuminati?

1194
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,000
Welcome to the-

1195
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,800
This is the first puzzle, I use it to test everyone.

1196
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,560
Can you find the article about not smacking horses?

1197
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,000
It's secret.

1198
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,720
Oh, man.

1199
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,640
Take it from me.

1200
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,640
Let me Google smacking horses plus-

1201
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,080
No, don't use regular Google, you must use Sheogol.

1202
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,200
Let me go into incognito mode.

1203
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:05,700
Sheogol.

1204
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,120
Sheogol.

1205
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,640
I'm in Sheogol.

1206
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,200
Secrets.google.hotspot.

1207
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:18,880
Secrets.google.hotspot.geocities, then let's search-

1208
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,160
.angelfire.

1209
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,720
.angelfire, a lot of redirects, but okay.

1210
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,360
Angelfire, and then search-

1211
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,560
.lycos.

1212
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,040
.lycos, at some point I'm gonna type Sheogol in here.

1213
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,320
.lycos, then I'll copy and paste all of that into AltaVista.

1214
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,200
Quote, horse smack, one word.

1215
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,600
Quote, WikiLeaks.

1216
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,720
You are going to be very surprised when the result is just a picture of Jimmy Hoffa's grave.

1217
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,440
Quote, stonemasons.

1218
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,520
Stonemasons, very good.

1219
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,520
All right, I think that should be good enough to-

1220
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,480
.Guys, my computer screen just went bright red.

1221
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,200
What does this mean?

1222
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:02,800
That is blood.

1223
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,760
You have found a secret.

1224
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,560
Did I just kill-

1225
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,840
Oh, I killed the whole internet.

1226
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,000
I can't look up this Yahoo answer anymore.

1227
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,320
That was the kill switch that I just turned-

1228
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,960
Okay, this has been a lot of fun.

1229
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,400
Don't smack a horse in the fucking face.

1230
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,440
What are you fucking-

1231
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,120
What are you fucking talking about?

1232
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,600
What are you fucking talk-

1233
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,960
Like, what are you talking about?

1234
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,720
We've considered everything about this question,

1235
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,520
except for the fact that we're talking about literally hitting a horse in the face.

1236
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,160
Our relationship-

1237
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,160
And not only that, but that she's talking to her sister,

1238
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,240
who apparently needs some written proof that that's a bad thing to do.

1239
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,360
Don't smack him in the face.

1240
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,080
Oh, prove it.

1241
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,200
Show me an article about it.

1242
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,440
No, how about I smack you in the face?

1243
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,400
Let's be honest.

1244
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,440
Our relationship with horses has always been tenuous.

1245
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,880
Our basic interaction with horses is,

1246
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,120
I don't want to run while I want you to run.

1247
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,160
Well, I don't want to.

1248
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,400
Well, I have sharp points on my shoes.

1249
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,600
So, I guess you're going to.

1250
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,040
Yeah, why don't you learn how to use metal,

1251
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,560
and then, like, come back and talk to me, I guess.

1252
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,360
I have, like, spikes on my heels.

1253
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,600
I have, like, spikes that I made out of metal that I got out of the ground,

1254
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,480
and then I smelted.

1255
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,920
Hey, do you know anything about smelting horse?

1256
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,000
Then why don't you shut your fucking huge mouth?

1257
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,000
Go eat some fucking oats.

1258
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:11,920
Dumb motherfucker.

1259
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,120
I invented computers.

1260
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,240
Yeah.

1261
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,520
Can you even use a computer?

1262
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,840
Do they even have Horse Google?

1263
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,640
I bet if I brought you a computer, you would just lick it.

1264
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,200
You would just probably lick it, or maybe step on it and break it.

1265
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,800
Great job, just bought that.

1266
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,640
The job that I have that you don't have,

1267
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,480
because you can't, like, make money.

1268
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,680
Probably don't even know what money works.

1269
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:35,600
Our being mean to horses is our right for working,

1270
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,760
because horses don't have jobs.

1271
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,160
So, their job is to get hit in the face by us to help us relieve our stress.

1272
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,720
That's just, I mean, that seems obvious to me.

1273
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,840
This bummed me out, this whole enterprise.

1274
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,480
Stop hitting horses, everybody.

1275
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,560
They're nature's most beautiful creature.

1276
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:54,960
Their nature's candy.

1277
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,200
You can wrestle them all you want, because that's fair.

1278
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:57,760
Yeah.

1279
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,120
Give me a question, Justin.

1280
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,240
I recently went out on a couple of dates with a lovely young lady.

1281
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,640
About the third time hanging out, I made a move and we did some kissing.

1282
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:12,640
Without telling too much, it was, sadly, among the worst kissing experiences I have had.

1283
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,880
We really enjoy hanging out together, and I anticipate more of the same.

1284
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,960
So what, if anything, can I do to make this situation better?

1285
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,240
That's from somewhat surprised in Somerville.

1286
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:26,880
Like, nothing.

1287
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,840
Like, basic.

1288
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,400
Here's the thing.

1289
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,960
You learn, you do get better at it, but to, you have a, I think everybody has a cap.

1290
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,760
And I think you hit that cap pretty fucking quick.

1291
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,320
Like, I think-

1292
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,160
Have you thought about filling out a comment card?

1293
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,400
Like, in an anonymous Dropbox, and you put it in, and you're like,

1294
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,520
oh, there's two cards.

1295
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,560
I wrote one.

1296
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,060
Shit.

1297
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,640
Use of tongue.

1298
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,360
Use of tongue.

1299
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,560
You give me a two out of 10.

1300
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:49,840
That's a two.

1301
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,120
That's pretty brutal.

1302
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,160
Lip moistness, six.

1303
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:54,960
So that's not bad.

1304
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,000
No.

1305
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,320
Nose placement, four.

1306
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,160
I got lip moistness, 10.

1307
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,480
And I don't know if that means that my lips are, like, too moist.

1308
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,720
They're, like, really super, super, super sloppy.

1309
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,240
There's a butter zone in which you put butter on your lips.

1310
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:10,480
Okay.

1311
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,680
It means you're a camelback bottle.

1312
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:19,920
So I think that your only way of addressing this is saying,

1313
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,800
no, wait a minute.

1314
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,200
I was gonna say something, but there's not.

1315
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,080
There's no way.

1316
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,360
There's nothing you could say.

1317
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,440
Hey, I really like you, Susan, but-

1318
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,360
Am I right in my assertion that you do get better at it?

1319
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,320
Like, you start with zero, okay?

1320
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,040
You're saying never been kissed fucking Drew Barrymore, okay?

1321
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:41,280
And then after you kiss, like, a few people, you're getting better at it.

1322
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,160
You have, like, one person you get especially randy with.

1323
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:49,200
And we're gonna get blue here, talking about red hot pecs.

1324
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,680
You reach a certain point where that's, like, that's as good as you get,

1325
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,640
and you hit it really quickly.

1326
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,480
I don't think it's, like, something that you just

1327
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,120
master over the course of your lifetime.

1328
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:03,120
I feel like by age, like, by age, like, 20, you're basically, like,

1329
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,120
that's just your style at that point.

1330
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,920
I mean, age is such a big thing in this question.

1331
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,160
If you're talking about, like, if you're 15, 16, like,

1332
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,360
well, yeah, that's fine.

1333
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,000
If this is, like, a 26, 27-year-old person

1334
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,520
and her kissing game is off, then, like, it's not gonna get better.

1335
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,200
Again, it may not be bad.

1336
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,560
They may not be bad at kissing.

1337
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,240
It could just be incompatible.

1338
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:24,800
Right, yeah.

1339
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,760
Yeah, there's certain levels of moisture that need to pair up.

1340
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,040
You can't have one person getting fully super sloppy double there

1341
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,960
and the other person just Sahara over there.

1342
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,960
Well, no, that is actually somewhere in the middle.

1343
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,800
That's actually what I prefer is to have, like,

1344
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,040
one person physical challenge and then the other person

1345
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,040
is a cat on a hot tin roof, you know?

1346
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,640
Yeah, absolutely.

1347
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,040
Is it possible it's a symptom?

1348
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,000
Because I imagine, like, if there was really, truly,

1349
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,680
like, a real connection, it would be amazing no matter what.

1350
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,280
Is that just too romantic?

1351
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:09,360
You can connect, like, on a deep spiritual and emotional level

1352
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,240
and then your kisses are just, like, two big mouth trains

1353
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,600
just, like, crashing into each other.

1354
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,720
That's where it should be, like, that back to the future moment

1355
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,800
of, like, I feel like kissing my brother

1356
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,560
and you're just, like, Hannah McCarty that says, like,

1357
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,920
we're friends forever now and we're only friends.

1358
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,080
It's really as tragic because maybe you just stop kissing, you know?

1359
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,320
Just like in her, you don't need to express yourself physically.

1360
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,160
You can phone fuck each other.

1361
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,600
I was going to say Death to Smoochie, but I didn't see that movie.

1362
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,280
I was going to say Pushing Daisies.

1363
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:37,780
Okay.

1364
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,960
All of those were pretty good except for Justin's example,

1365
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,760
which I don't really think was Jermaine except for the fact that I had Smoochie.

1366
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,280
I'm just basing it off the title.

1367
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,240
I haven't seen the film.

1368
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:46,740
Sure.

1369
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,840
Yeah, it's too bad, though.

1370
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,760
Really, it's a shame.

1371
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,120
This is the best we have?

1372
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,280
I mean, what can you fucking do?

1373
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,800
What, go to kiss school?

1374
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,400
Like, you can't fucking, like...

1375
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,160
Oh, bring in, like, a Jackson Galaxy-esque character.

1376
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,560
Yeah.

1377
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,040
Oh, God.

1378
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,640
Just fuck it.

1379
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,320
Just bring in Jackson Galaxy.

1380
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,120
Bring him.

1381
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,080
Let me kiss you on your weird, weird, weird, weird face.

1382
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,160
Bring that weird face over here.

1383
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:12,800
Come here.

1384
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,080
I'm going to kiss your beard.

1385
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,840
I'm going to kiss along the perimeter of your beard

1386
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,840
and it'll be like a little lips roller coaster.

1387
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,640
Whee!

1388
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,400
I love writing your face, Jackson.

1389
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,240
I think you're going to regret this when we start bringing on guests on the show

1390
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:29,360
because I feel like Jackson Galaxy is exactly in our, like,

1391
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,720
sphere of celebrity that we could conceivably get on the show.

1392
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:37,440
You're going to feel pretty bad about lambasting him this way.

1393
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,320
I think it's lambasting, although I would love to baste him in kisses.

1394
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,720
It's hard for me to watch that show without getting just rock hard.

1395
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:46,720
You know what I'm saying?

1396
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,920
Because it's got everything I need.

1397
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,040
It's got, like, a weird dude who looks like the bassist from Anthrax,

1398
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,680
uh, but also people being stern to cats.

1399
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,400
That gets my noodle going.

1400
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,080
Meow, indeed.

1401
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,120
My boner from hell.

1402
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,160
I like that we've just accepted that people on this show

1403
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,880
know that by name the host of an Animal Planet series

1404
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,680
about making your cat not be such an asshole.

1405
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,480
Oh, you know, Jackson Galaxy, the person on the show.

1406
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,400
Pretty soon we'll get to just calling him Jackson

1407
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,680
and everyone will know what we mean.

1408
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,040
Jackie.

1409
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:23,540
Jacob.

1410
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,200
Jacob.

1411
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,680
Do, uh, do another question, please.

1412
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,760
I share a name with a well-known actor.

1413
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,080
He's great, so it's not shameful at all,

1414
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:40,240
but when I meet new people, they get so excited pointing out the name connection.

1415
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,920
This includes when waiters or phone customer support people find out my name.

1416
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,720
Deep, depending on my mood, I'll joke around and riff off some of the movie references,

1417
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,960
but sometimes I'm exhausted by the topic.

1418
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,640
Uh, if in my place, how would you either quickly riff

1419
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,600
or move the conversation past the topic that I deal with on a near daily basis?

1420
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,400
And that is from Daniel Craig.

1421
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,840
And that's from Judge Reinhold.

1422
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,880
Um, God, Daniel Craig doesn't really give you a lot of, a lot of runway.

1423
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,920
You know what I mean?

1424
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,880
Not a lot of riff.

1425
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,880
If it was, if it was Judge Reinhold, then fuck.

1426
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,480
That's a deep, deep, deep, deep vein.

1427
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,000
Talking to him in the baby goose.

1428
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,160
You got, uh, the police, police academy goose.

1429
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,560
Daniel Craig, you got Bond.

1430
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,440
You got, what was he in?

1431
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,160
Trainspotting?

1432
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:26,800
Was he in that?

1433
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:27,840
No.

1434
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,480
Pound cake.

1435
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:28,960
Layer.

1436
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,120
He was in, he was in the cake movie.

1437
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:31,680
Cake boss.

1438
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:37,200
I think you need one pat response that just shuts the whole thing down.

1439
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,480
Uh, just say no relation.

1440
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,400
No relation, maybe, or, or maybe just like something cute.

1441
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,480
It's like, keep it down.

1442
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,920
I'm trying not to get recognized.

1443
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,600
Or like, I'm undercover.

1444
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,320
Are these people like my accents?

1445
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:52,560
Right.

1446
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:52,960
That's the thing.

1447
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,440
Like what if you're just, if you call the phone company, like,

1448
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,000
Hey, what's up?

1449
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,120
My name's Daniel Craig.

1450
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,560
I'm calling about my phone service.

1451
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,840
They're like, the Daniel Craig?

1452
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,920
Like fucking listen to me.

1453
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,080
Do you think that this is what Daniel Craig sounds like?

1454
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,880
Hi, this is Daniel Craig.

1455
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,680
I'm just calling like, do you Daniel Craig?

1456
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,960
Like, yes, obviously.

1457
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,360
I don't think he's experiencing confusion between thinking that Daniel

1458
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,480
Craig is calling PF Chang's and putting in an order.

1459
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,600
I don't think that's the problem.

1460
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,280
I think it's just like the conversation that he's being forced into like,

1461
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,480
Oh, like James Bond.

1462
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,040
Yes.

1463
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:25,680
Like James Bond.

1464
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,560
Yeah, James fucking Bond.

1465
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,280
What if you, what if you pretend like you lived in a one man alternate

1466
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,840
universe in which the other Daniel Craig did not exist.

1467
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,280
So when people were like, Oh, just like Daniel Craig, James Bond.

1468
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,160
I'm like, I'm sorry.

1469
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:36,480
What?

1470
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:36,800
What?

1471
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,080
I don't know that person.

1472
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,080
Is that, no, you're not Daniel Craig for the movies.

1473
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,160
Do you mean I haven't been in any movies?

1474
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,680
Do you mean Pierce Brosnan?

1475
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,240
Let me hit you.

1476
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,360
Do you mean Woody Allen?

1477
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:48,720
Let me hit you.

1478
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,720
Let me hit you with this.

1479
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,960
What if you live the rest of your life as Danny Craig?

1480
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,080
No, no, Justin.

1481
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,000
I'm not going to let Daniel Craig do that.

1482
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,720
Danny Craig.

1483
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,600
He's going to bow to other Daniel Craig.

1484
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,600
Like he, he gets the title.

1485
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,400
You can, you send Daniel Craig a sternly worded letter saying, listen,

1486
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,920
you handsome motherfucker.

1487
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,360
I don't know if you've seen his abs.

1488
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,760
He gets whatever title he wants.

1489
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,280
You're Dan-O from now on.

1490
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:15,840
Dan-O Craig.

1491
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,720
Dan-O Craig.

1492
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:23,040
Your best bet is that Daniel Craig keeps doing great movies and he gets knighted.

1493
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,960
And then he's Sir Daniel Craig.

1494
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,680
And then I feel like the confusion will be alleviated.

1495
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,160
Or then you can take Sir Daniel Craig.

1496
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,200
You just add it to yourself.

1497
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,680
Hi, I'm Sir Daniel Craig.

1498
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,440
I would like the General Tso's chicken.

1499
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,200
Hello, I'm Sir Daniel Craig.

1500
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,200
My HBO has been a little bit fuzzy lately and I feel like the connection's really weak.

1501
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,480
Oh, this sucks.

1502
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,080
Just call yourself Judge Reinhold.

1503
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,120
Nobody knows who that is.

1504
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,040
So like, they will confuse you.

1505
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,240
Judge, that's a weird first name.

1506
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,040
Anyway, what'd you want?

1507
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:53,840
Judge?

1508
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,800
Nobody's called Judge.

1509
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,480
Anyway, we're having a half off special on the Szechuan.

1510
00:59:59,120 --> 00:59:59,520
You in?

1511
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,640
You in, coward?

1512
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,040
Come on.

1513
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,840
Come on, pussy.

1514
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,040
You worried it'd be too spicy?

1515
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,000
What's wrong?

1516
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Oh, you're worried we're gonna give you too much chicken?

1517
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:10,960
God.

1518
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,200
We're gonna be too flavorful that it's gonna be too great a value?

1519
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,120
Just give me your order, asshole.

1520
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:20,080
Are you worried you won't be able to fit the chicken into your baby's mouth?

1521
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,280
Because you have a baby mouth?

1522
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,600
Why is this P.F. Chang so hostile?

1523
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,240
It's actually P.F. Chang's Last Resort is what it is.

1524
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,640
It's the new, they're prototyping it.

1525
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:38,160
It's basically a P.F. Chang's, but everyone's just like, really shitty to you.

1526
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,960
And then Judge Reinhold actually calls there one day.

1527
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,800
Like, what kind of fucking name is Judge?

1528
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,920
He was like, I was in Two and a Half Babies.

1529
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,680
What was that, what was it we called?

1530
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,480
Thank you so much for listening to our comedy podcast.

1531
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,920
We hope you've enjoyed yourselves.

1532
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,200
Before you complain about this episode, get a little off topic from time to time.

1533
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,160
Please remember that this is a holiday.

1534
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,560
And that's it?

1535
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,320
And we were good enough to record an episode for you.

1536
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:12,080
Even with all of our big Martin Luther King Jr. plans, we were able to fit in an episode.

1537
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,800
We squeaked in an episode, so we hope you enjoyed it.

1538
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,200
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

1539
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:26,240
Like David Fador, Tanner, Negari, Harley, Craig Lynn, Jared,

1540
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:31,120
Paul O'Regan, Stephen Strom, Fred Wood, Danny Persky, everybody.

1541
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,800
You're all the best, and we really appreciate it.

1542
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,640
If you want to tweet about our show, try to remember to include a link to our sampler,

1543
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:42,400
bit.ly forward slash mabim bam 2013, or to our iTunes page would be fine.

1544
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,560
And tell a friend about the show this week.

1545
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,000
We would really appreciate it.

1546
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,440
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

1547
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,760
It's a Departure, on the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1548
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,800
Had somebody tweeted us this week that they wanted us to put the days to bed?

1549
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:58,880
Had somebody tweeted us this week that they went to a Long Winters show,

1550
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,640
and they played It's a Departure?

1551
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:05,680
And the person, I guess, never paid attention to whenever we said the thing I just said,

1552
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,720
and like freaked the fuck out.

1553
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,000
They're like, holy shit, I didn't know that was you guys, which is-

1554
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,440
They never make it to the end of an episode.

1555
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,880
I guess, I guess they hear, we want to thank you, and they're like, nope.

1556
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,960
Not thanking me, I'm out.

1557
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,440
And thanks again to Hulu Plus.

1558
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,360
If you are the one person in the world who has not tried Hulu Plus yet,

1559
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:27,040
it's time to let down your walls, and then try it,

1560
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,680
and go to huluplus.com forward slash my brother,

1561
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,000
and check it out, get that extended free trial when you go to that website.

1562
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,920
Also, if you would like to have a personal or business shout out on The Money Zone,

1563
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:48,160
just go to maximumfund.org forward slash jumbotron, and if you ask a loved one for that,

1564
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:54,240
if you say, dearest sweetheart, all I want for my birthday is a shout out, tell them where to go,

1565
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:59,600
so that we don't get confused, sad emails where they go, I don't know how to do it, please help.

1566
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:04,640
Just say to your loved one, maximumfund.org forward slash jumbotron.

1567
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,160
Trav, I've been meaning to ask you the whole episode.

1568
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,520
You sound kind of Tom Waits-y.

1569
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,080
Have you been eating beer bottles again?

1570
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,760
Yeah, I'm a bluesman now.

1571
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:18,160
Okay. Also, go check out the other shows.

1572
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,120
You've listened to the new podcasts, right?

1573
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,240
The four new podcasts?

1574
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:22,880
Yeah.

1575
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:27,760
I mean, they're so great, and they're so free, and they're so great and free,

1576
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,080
so go check those out. You won't regret it.

1577
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,120
And that's gonna do it for us here on my brother, my brother, and me.

1578
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:42,000
If you want to send us a question, it's nbmbam at maximumfund.org, so do that.

1579
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,320
Do you want that final?

1580
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:44,720
Give me.

1581
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,480
Okay. This final Yahoo! is sent in by Christopher Green. Thank you, Christopher.

1582
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,800
It's by Yahoo! Answer to User Sophia, who asks,

1583
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,680
do you learn how to twerk, or do you just know how?

1584
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,840
I'm Justin McElroy.

1585
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:00,640
I'm Travis McElroy.

1586
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,840
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1587
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:15,680
This has been my brother, my brother, and me. Kiss your dad. Square on the lips.

1588
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,400
Co-host of The Goose Down, along with Kimberly Clark.

1589
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,960
And some of y'all might be asking yourself, what the hell is The Goose Down?

1590
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:46,160
It's a comfort food, and we want y'all to climb underneath it with us

1591
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,200
and snuggle up so we can find your ears and things.

1592
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:55,120
So come check us out at maximumfund.org, also available on iTunes.

1593
01:04:55,120 --> 01:05:02,000
Geel!
