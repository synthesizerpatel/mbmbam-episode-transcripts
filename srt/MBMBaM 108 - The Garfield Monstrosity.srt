1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,480
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, The Advice Show for the modern era,

6
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,600
and we are celebrating today No More Human Interaction for a year.

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,880
Yay! Back to the safety of my shell.

8
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,320
We did Max Fun Con, it was great. We did E3, it was great. I'm done.

9
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,560
Was it? I'm done talking to everybody.

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,040
I know Max Fun Con was great. I don't believe you when you say that E3 was great.

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,640
Okay, Max Fun Con, it was great. I did E3, it was...

12
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,200
So did you guys have a good time at Max Fun Con?

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,000
Max Fun Con was amazing. We made so many new friends,

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,120
and there was a man who had a plate of sausages in a hot tub.

15
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,920
That's really the only thing I took away from the entire weekend.

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
Jesus, guys. Did you not go? Did you not do like any of the...

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,040
Did you do the... Like, I went on the spelunking session.

18
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,640
You went on the spelunking session?

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,200
Yeah, I went on Ashcon's spelunking session. It was called Ashcon Subterranean Adventure.

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,080
Yeah, huh. Subterranean on the late night.

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:58,320
Yeah, it was really nice. We went down deep inside of the mountain, and we fought mole people.

22
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,600
Is that where you... You brought back a sword that was glowing that had some runes etched on it.

23
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:11,760
It was an etched runed glow sword that lets me know when there are either mole people

24
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:19,520
or podcasters nearby. So that bitch was going full blown neon the whole weekend.

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,600
Now, see, I did the Steve AG's Lazy River session, and I ended up at the bottom of the mountain.

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,360
I don't know what happened, and it was terrifying. It was not lazy at all.

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,840
Now, the tricky thing about my etched rune sword is that John Hodgman is both a podcaster and a

28
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,000
mole man. Right, so that was...

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,160
So I didn't know whether to strike or to giggle.

30
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Last year at the con, I got myself an etched rune sword, but it just lets...

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,120
It glows whenever haters are around.

32
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,520
Yeah.

33
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,960
So it lets me know when haters around the corner are about to hate on me.

34
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,360
There weren't that many haters at Max Fun Con, though, were there?

35
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,360
No, no, no, no, no, no. But at E3, it glued so hard, it became sentient and blinded

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,200
an Asian businessman. So that was too bad.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,640
This is, of course, an advice program. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

38
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

39
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,640
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Seriously, guys, if you came out to Max Fun Con,

40
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,680
thank you so much. It really was such a great weekend.

41
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,240
You are all collectively my new best friend.

42
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,480
Yeah.

43
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,640
And L.A., fuck, I'm glad to not be in you anymore.

44
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,640
Hey, L.A.

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,840
Hey, L.A., just one quick note. Just, you know, constructive criticism.

46
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,800
You fucking suck.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,400
No, you know what? I'm in the minority.

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,960
I'm in the minority of the three, brother. I love L.A.

49
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,080
I'm gonna get a t-shirt that says so.

50
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,640
We love you!

51
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,680
I mean, it was...

52
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,760
Travis walked around with stars in his eyes.

53
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,720
I was like, where's the contracts, people?

54
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,520
I will say, I saw so many celebs. No kidding.

55
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,400
Like...

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,200
I saw a shocking...

57
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,320
Aside from, of course, the great celebs there at Max Fun Con, how many...

58
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,320
What celebs did you actually get? What did we get on the show floor?

59
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,200
We got... Well, I saw... We saw Tim Heidecker coming out of the Arclight when we went and saw...

60
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,640
Yeah, he was at our show of Prometheus.

61
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,320
Shitty... Shitty Alien... Shitty Aliens 4.

62
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,720
Um... I saw... I saw Dave Foley just, like, walking the street with his kid.

63
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,360
What? Cut me out. No way.

64
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,840
I saw the saddest thing I saw all week was I saw Verne Troyer rolling into the conference center.

65
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
And then I saw a man trip over him.

66
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,840
What? How can you guys say you hate L.A.?

67
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,080
Um...

68
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,520
Well, let's say... Let's just say none of these people were smiling.

69
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,000
Did you guys talk to Dave Foley, by the way?

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,120
No, he didn't have the nerve.

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,240
I don't know what I would have...

72
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,080
I don't know what I would... Like...

73
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,720
Like, fuck, man. I'm so sorry.

74
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,320
Can I help?

75
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,000
Is there anything I can do to help you, Dave? David?

76
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,560
I'm so... Let's get you back on track.

77
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,840
I just want to set you straight. Is there anything I can...

78
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,040
I can help chip in. Is that a...

79
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,960
We didn't talk to Tim Heidecker either, Travis. We really needed you with us.

80
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,040
See, this is why I should always be there.

81
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,120
Pardon me, sir. Pardon me.

82
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,600
I saw... Who's the woman from Leeds and the West Wing?

83
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,640
Mary Louise Parker?

84
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,000
I thought I saw her at the Burger King and the LAX,

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,920
but that doesn't seem very probable, does it?

86
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,000
No, it was probably her. You're probably right.

87
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,880
She was there with, like, a family of, like, maybe a husband and a daughter.

88
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,160
I didn't do the trouble of Wikipediaing it.

89
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,440
I just saw her while I was walking out with my tinder crisp, and I was like,

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,360
yeah, that's probably Mary Louise Parker.

91
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,400
The thing about Mary Louise Parker, she loves chicken tenders.

92
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,520
She was eating a chicken tender through a rice mile,

93
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,080
and I was like, oh, that's probably the MLP.

94
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,320
She calls them chicken tenders. That's how excited about them she gets.

95
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,080
She's like, Justin, let's go to the BK, get some tenders.

96
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,920
And I'm like, I don't know, MLP? I'm married.

97
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,480
I'm not sure.

98
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,920
She also calls Nintendo Nintenders, which is really weird.

99
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,080
Let's get into the advice.

100
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,440
Um, I'm going to be driving across the country at the end of June,

101
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,320
and I'm wondering if you have any advice for doing a cross-country road trip.

102
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,520
Mostly, I'm wondering how to avoid going insane while driving by myself

103
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,560
for 12 hours at a time, five days in a row.

104
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,720
That's from West Coast to Best Coast.

105
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,760
Oh, Jesus.

106
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,560
It's urine for a pretty rough trip.

107
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,000
It's going to be kind of a thing.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,160
I did this exactly once.

109
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,640
I drove from Cincinnati down to Huntington and then from Huntington up to Boston.

110
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,920
And most of that was by myself.

111
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,280
And it was a total, it was a total nightmare.

112
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,640
I drove from Huntington to Oklahoma and back a couple times.

113
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,140
Yeah.

114
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,360
I've never taken the plunge and gone completely across country.

115
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,000
I mean, I think everybody at some point like fantasizes about doing like the Route 66,

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,680
traveling the American highway.

117
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,400
And I think that that lasts all of about five hours.

118
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,760
And then you hit like Pennsylvania and you're like, oh, this is dump.

119
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,740
Yeah.

120
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,160
Well, actually Pennsylvania is great because Pennsylvania has the turnpike that is,

121
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,680
I think the speed limit on it is 158 miles an hour.

122
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,440
So you can just like get in and it's like a vacuum tube that like sucks you through the state

123
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,520
as quickly as humanly possible.

124
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,760
Whenever I picture doing that, like Route 66, you know, cross-country thing, I always just,

125
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,040
always just, and I know that this is the eight-year-old in me.

126
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,400
I want to stop at every like roadside attraction and giant plaster dinosaur.

127
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,480
Let me taste your gravy.

128
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,200
Yeah.

129
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,000
Now I see here you have the world's best coffee cake.

130
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,840
Let me get a piece of that, please.

131
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,120
I would like to experience this.

132
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,240
I always imagine that if I'm going to drive from one end of the country and another along the way,

133
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,760
I'm going to right a lot of wrongs.

134
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,120
And I don't right wrongs in my neighborhood.

135
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,560
But I kind of feel like if I do that, I'm going to become a wanderer.

136
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,560
And I want to be the kind of wanderer.

137
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,800
I don't want to be the kind of wanderer that steals your kid when they're going to the bathroom.

138
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,840
I want to be the kind of wanderer that sets things right and helps people,

139
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,280
you know, finds people that are missing or maybe like-

140
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,760
So you want to like quantum leap across the country.

141
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Figures out who stole the pie, just like helping, you know?

142
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,040
I want to be like a, like came from kung fu, just helping people.

143
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,200
Or Bill Bixby.

144
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,880
I wish I did that here, but I don't know.

145
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,040
Everybody knows me and they think I'm just, they think like I'm hypocritical.

146
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,840
I think every person of a certain age has that.

147
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:48,400
Whenever they do go on a long road trip, they try to fill it with a whimsy and a meaning

148
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,680
that just does not exist.

149
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,080
Like they, like as they drive through, they're like, yeah, man, this is life.

150
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,440
This is what it is.

151
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,680
This is the real America.

152
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,680
They, they just watched, they just watched, they just watched Elizabeth town and they

153
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,680
like want every single stop to be like, oh, this is so steeped in history.

154
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,680
I'll be changed because of this.

155
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,120
And I really think that the, the, the, the wheels come off of that wagon really quickly

156
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,760
when you do drive through, say in Oklahoma and you're like, oh, it's 115 degrees here

157
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,880
and I haven't seen a tree.

158
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,120
I want to die.

159
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,760
I want to die.

160
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,800
I probably will.

161
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,160
I mean, I don't, I've never done such a long one.

162
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,200
I mean, my, my typical advice is always just, just the easy stuff.

163
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,920
Like get a book on your phone.

164
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,920
No, she's driving.

165
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,960
She can't do that at all.

166
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,160
That's a horrible advice.

167
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,120
I said on your phone, like get an odd book.

168
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,680
Okay.

169
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,600
I thought you meant like getting an ear.

170
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,240
That cuts, that cuts down on the whimsy.

171
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,040
You know what I'm saying?

172
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,200
Like you can't really appreciate, you can't soak in America and life and this American

173
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,840
life if you're listening to, you know, the new Grisham, it's hard for you to roll the

174
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,440
window down and put your hand out the window and do that, like do that snake thing and

175
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,760
just like, let your hair blow one with the fucking road.

176
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,240
You know, you can't do that when John Rhys Davies is in your ear.

177
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,600
Just like telling you how it is.

178
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,640
Well, what, I mean, what preach it Jim Dale, let's do this.

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,600
Should we, man, I, I do miss Maury.

180
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,080
I wish I had my Maury to spend Tuesdays with.

181
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,960
This is a good book.

182
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,680
Wait, oh fuck, I'm here already.

183
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,600
That I, that was convenient.

184
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,840
See, this is why I recommend podcasts instead of the books because I get caught up in the

185
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,200
book and I'm like, but what's going to happen to Harry?

186
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,120
And then all of a sudden I'm swerving all over the road.

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,920
What, how, how into this book are you?

188
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,240
Well, whenever I, whenever I listened to the book on tape version of the novelization

189
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,440
of Harry and the Hendersons, I get pretty into it.

190
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,480
Don't punch him again.

191
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,320
He just wants to live with you and be a family and love.

192
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,720
Damn it.

193
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,560
Novelized version of John Lithgow.

194
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,440
He just wants to stay with it.

195
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,720
Oh, I'm in a holiday inn.

196
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,520
Just drove into it.

197
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:03,840
Fuck.

198
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,760
Just drove into the building.

199
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,640
I'm in the pool.

200
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,840
God damn it.

201
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,200
Wait, there's John Lithgow.

202
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,480
That's John.

203
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,480
John, you're not going to believe this man.

204
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:20,800
Listen, how's your fish?

205
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,920
Oh yeah, it's a fish.

206
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,720
Something expensive.

207
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,040
Really your two options are whimsy, but that's going to require a lot of work.

208
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,320
A lot of suspension and disbelief.

209
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,240
A lot of prepro, a lot of yelping.

210
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,200
A lot of yelping or total turn your mind off.

211
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,280
Just like distraction.

212
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,280
It's like sleeping, but you have to be awake to do it.

213
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,160
You have to zone out so hard.

214
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,440
And there are podcasts that will do that for you.

215
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,640
Prairie Home Companion.

216
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,040
It might be a great horrible, horrible posture thing.

217
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,760
I do when I'm driving by myself on a long stretch of road.

218
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,680
Set the cruise control and I'll sit cross legged.

219
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,960
Oh God, Travis.

220
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,160
Travis, you really do that?

221
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,320
Not that I haven't done it in a long time because I haven't been on like a big.

222
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,160
But like when you're driving back from Oklahoma,

223
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,560
there are literally like 40, 50 miles of straight nothing road.

224
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,800
Like you don't see another car for half hour, 45 minutes at a time.

225
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,640
But trade off, it takes you 30 car lengths to stop your vehicle.

226
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,200
That is a little, you set your cruise control.

227
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,240
You get a little shut eye.

228
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,720
This person stopped in front of me.

229
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,920
I got to hold on.

230
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,120
Wait, I need to.

231
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,840
I was doing yoga.

232
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,400
Charlie Horse.

233
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,960
Charlie Horse.

234
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,000
Is there anything scarier than accidentally falling asleep behind the wheel?

235
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,160
And not realize, is this not a thing that you guys have done?

236
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,720
Oh yeah.

237
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,280
I just feel really alive afterwards though.

238
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,440
I drive, like don't do it.

239
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,280
Like it was the stupidest thing I've ever done.

240
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,120
I tried to drive back from Bonnaroo the day that it ended.

241
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,720
So I was still like floating on opium and no, that's a joke.

242
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,920
Opium is a body.

243
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Body just coursing with American cigarettes, tobacco, American spirits, great tobacco.

244
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:22,480
Just American spirits and opium and some sort of, it was like a black oil and I drank it.

245
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,320
What do you mean oil?

246
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,000
I guess it was just, it might've just been oil.

247
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,480
But a man gave it to me and he called it spirit water.

248
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,160
Anyway, I was just rolling, I was floating on spirit water.

249
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,640
I was floating on spirit water and had a van full of people and I was like,

250
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,840
all right, time to go home.

251
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,360
And I drove the seven hours back from Tennessee to West Virginia overnight.

252
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,160
And I would just like, I would just like be driving.

253
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,320
And then all of a sudden I would hit a rumble strip

254
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,320
and realize that I was in a different state than I was a second ago.

255
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,880
Jesus.

256
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,080
That's terrifying.

257
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,160
And I did, but I couldn't have been asleep the whole time, right?

258
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,240
Cause I'm talking about entire state jumping.

259
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,800
I'm talking about, it must've been some sort of, some sort of twilight region

260
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,040
between sleep and awakeness.

261
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,840
Anyway.

262
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,320
There was a long period of time when I worked in Charleston

263
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,960
and I was driving an hour to work and an hour back.

264
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,240
And there would be times that I would leave work and suddenly be at home.

265
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,600
And like, I couldn't tell you anything.

266
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,640
How did this happen?

267
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,720
There was no whimsy.

268
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,800
Well, I meant for this to be such a whimsical return trip

269
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,040
and instead I'm home and oh no, it was all a dream.

270
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,080
I'm dead and in heaven.

271
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,120
I think it might be a really great opportunity.

272
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,480
Just what if you could spend the entire time with no stimulus?

273
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,480
Just spend it thinking about everything and just clearing it.

274
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,800
Oh, put some tape over the clock.

275
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,440
Yeah, just clear it out completely.

276
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,520
Put some tape over the windshield even.

277
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,040
Need some mushrooms.

278
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,400
No, not that.

279
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,200
That's kind of stimulating.

280
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,920
I mean, just watch Fantasia 2000.

281
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,400
Go down.

282
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,640
Just get in there, get a broom and just unpack your adjectives, you know?

283
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,240
Just sweep it all out.

284
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,800
Yeah.

285
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,720
Get everything that's been on your mind out.

286
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,160
Figure out where you are going.

287
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,480
By the end of it, you'll be Maury.

288
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,920
You don't need to spend two days with him anymore because you'll be him.

289
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,560
I think I would eat my own arm in this scenario that you have described.

290
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,760
All right, fine.

291
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,200
Just for something to do?

292
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,280
Just for the novelty?

293
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,800
I have two arms now, I want to be like with one arm.

294
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,320
This will be whimsical.

295
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,680
Do you want a Yahoo answer?

296
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,160
I do.

297
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,600
It was sent in by Ethan Booker.

298
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,400
Thanks, Ethan.

299
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,680
It's about Yahoo Answers user Jamal who asks,

300
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:49,360
What was the goal of Al-Qaeda in their assassination of Dale Earnhardt?

301
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,840
Oh, no.

302
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,320
What?

303
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,760
In February 2001, members of Al-Qaeda tested their infiltration skills on American soil

304
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,720
by sabotaging the race car of Dale Earnhardt Sr., which ultimately resulted in his death.

305
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,920
Several reliable sources indicate that this was an attempt to destroy the country's morale

306
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,720
in the months before the planned 9-11 attacks.

307
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,440
However, it's common knowledge that most U.S. citizens do not watch NASCAR.

308
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,440
If so, what was Al-Qaeda's motivation for killing Dale Earnhardt?

309
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,840
Okay, first and foremost, disclaimer, Dale Earnhardt was a perfectly fine human being

310
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,360
and it's a tragedy of his loss.

311
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,320
What the fuck?

312
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,520
I mean, I think everyone knew that.

313
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,200
We don't have to, we're just telling people.

314
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,520
Yeah, but I'm probably going to launch into my anti-Dale Earnhardt thing later.

315
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,720
I did not know that you had strong feelings one way or the other towards Earnhardt.

316
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,880
I do not have strong feelings towards Dale Earnhardt.

317
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,720
It sounds like you're about to have them.

318
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,840
Well, I have strong feelings towards the number three never forget and it being everywhere

319
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,920
and like it was a tragedy, but this making him a saint.

320
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,520
I almost lost a job over at once.

321
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,520
I think that, anyways, I don't like NASCAR.

322
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,520
How did you lose a job over here?

323
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
I have to know how you almost lost a job.

324
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,040
You can't just leave those breadcrumbs out.

325
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,520
Come on.

326
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,240
No, I brought it up and my boss literally looked at me and said, take it back.

327
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,600
And I said, excuse me.

328
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,320
And he said, I swear to God, take it back or you're fired.

329
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,000
What job was this?

330
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,040
It was when I was working in a shop at OU and I made a joke about how he, oh God, this

331
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,720
is a terrible joke, but I was an asshole in college and I said, all he did was drive a

332
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,040
race car really fast and apparently not that well.

333
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,680
Oh, Travis.

334
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,320
I know, I don't defend the joke now, but is that really something to fire a man over?

335
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,440
I don't think, just cause the man didn't, didn't tweak his bit, you know, like just

336
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,120
cause you didn't punch up the gag.

337
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,520
Oh, wait, was this a comedy improv shop?

338
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,760
I thought I was here to workshop these gags.

339
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,560
I was at the chuckle garage and we were just getting deep into a bit and,

340
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:02,160
Dale had you hoisted it up, was lubing it.

341
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,280
I was lubing the bit and he was like, hey, apologize.

342
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,560
And so I was like, I'm sorry.

343
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,480
And he was like, that was close.

344
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,480
How?

345
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Thanks man.

346
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,320
If you had an apologist, I don't know what I would have done.

347
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,400
I lose, I entirely lose control of my body and actions.

348
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,800
I start thinking about the intimidator and it's literally, I go black and red.

349
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:32,160
Literally the next day he came in, in like full like t-shirt, jacket, t-shirt, oh, like

350
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,400
you didn't already fucking know.

351
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,480
Like he had to, uh, like just to really drive the point home, huge Earnhardt fan.

352
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,960
Now listen, you can't apologize to Dale Earnhardt himself.

353
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,520
You're going to either apologize to junior or you're going to apologize to Barry pepper

354
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,600
who played him in the hit sports channel miniseries three.

355
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Apologize to Barry pepper.

356
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Go call up Barry pepper.

357
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Go call up Barry pepper.

358
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
I'm sorry Barry pepper.

359
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
I'm sorry junior.

360
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
I'm so sorry.

361
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,640
I'm sorry Barry pepper.

362
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
Now leave me alone.

363
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,640
I'm going to go jerk off with this Benzoil.

364
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,080
God damn it.

365
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,080
This is 530.

366
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
This is 530.

367
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,960
I need 400 to get it in there.

368
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,800
I don't like this guy you work for, Travis.

369
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,180
I want to call him.

370
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,960
How awkward is the apology that you have to make to somebody when you make a tasteless

371
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,220
Dale Earnhardt joke?

372
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,220
Because are you?

373
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,220
It was pretty awkward.

374
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,160
Cause we were also like on our backs underneath a platform attaching legs.

375
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,720
So we're going, we're lying next to each other in the dark.

376
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,400
So it was like doubly creepy.

377
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Kind of romantic.

378
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,160
The other thing was it's a dude in theater, right?

379
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,560
Like in no way would I have ever suspected that this was a touchy subject with him prior

380
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
to this.

381
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
Right.

382
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,280
Cause you were dissing terry cloth bathrobes and small dogs, right?

383
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,280
Yeah.

384
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,280
What are you saying?

385
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,200
Um, oh shit.

386
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,120
Why does, why did I have to, I know we've gone over this, but I have to know why he

387
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,240
demanded an apology and wasn't just like, Oh, that was kind of tasteless.

388
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,600
What does you apologizing to him get him in the long run?

389
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
He felt I had crossed the line, I guess.

390
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,280
I don't know what line that was.

391
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:19,720
Yeah, but he is not a conduit for the Earnhardt estate, you know, he actually was the executor

392
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,940
of the Earnhardt estate.

393
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,720
And I failed to mention that earlier on in the story.

394
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,960
He was Dale Earnhardt jr.

395
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,440
I should have said that.

396
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,120
You have to listen.

397
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,160
If you, if you believe in Dale Earnhardt hard enough, and if that's a big part of your belief

398
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,880
system, then you have to clap your hands and you have to believe that Dale is watching

399
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,360
us all the time.

400
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:51,080
Dale is watching us, Dale is watching us, Dale is watching us from a distance.

401
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,740
If you don't believe that, that he is always seeing you, that he can see the tasteless

402
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,080
joke you made, that he can see me making fun of Barry Pepper.

403
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,580
He doesn't care for that either.

404
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:09,800
If you can't believe that Dale is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and omnifast, then

405
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
what's your belief system?

406
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:17,320
Travis, how many, Travis, how many Hail Berries did you have to do, uh, after you've created

407
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,320
that sentence?

408
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,560
I'm sorry, it's actually a Hey Barry!

409
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,720
That's what it's called.

410
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:29,440
When you, when you make a tasteless Dale Earnhardt jr., uh, senior joke, you have to do eight

411
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,800
Hey Berries, and, um, if you say something about how Dale Earnhardt jr. is gonna lose

412
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,200
a race, that's only two Hey Berries!

413
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,680
What, what did Al Qaeda have against him?

414
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,280
You know what they had against him.

415
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,280
What?

416
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,400
Cause he, cause he was so inspirational to us.

417
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:56,920
He was, this was a man, Justin, who, uh, played by his own rules, changed the rules, uh, there's,

418
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:05,920
there's something to be said about the immeasurable amount of freedom had by these men who are

419
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,320
only allowed to drive in a circle very carefully.

420
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,320
Right.

421
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,120
Um, and so, they took that sign of freedom, it's like if they had, if they had single-handedly

422
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,760
killed all bald eagles on the planet, uh, that's pretty much what they did when they

423
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,280
killed Dale Earnhardt jr.

424
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:28,720
I do really like, I like the logic of this theory, which is, they had, so they were planning

425
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,760
9-11, and they said, okay, so that's pretty bad, but what can we do to undermine the morale

426
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
of the country?

427
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,760
Cause 9-11's not gonna do it.

428
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,880
It's just a massive miscalculation, I think, if you're sitting in a room planning on 9-11,

429
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,440
and you say, you know, the problem with this plan is it's not gonna make people in red

430
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,720
states hate brown people enough.

431
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
Yeah.

432
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,520
They're not gonna, they're not gonna be too upset about it, we really need to dig into

433
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:00,480
those guys and get like, no, they were, they're gonna be the angriest, like they're gonna

434
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,920
be so angry at anybody who looks like you for the longest time, they're gonna be mad

435
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,680
at like Harry Hamlin, like, it's gonna get bad, okay?

436
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:17,000
It's gonna get real, they're gonna get, they're gonna get really mad at anybody who even remotely

437
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
looks like you.

438
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,960
I don't think you need to also kill Dale Earnhardt.

439
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,920
Can you imagine on the day that Dale Earnhardt, Sr. died, being a graphic designer who had

440
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,480
really only nailed down italicized numbers and wings?

441
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
Yeah.

442
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,840
Like, it must have been just like the best day for that one guy.

443
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
Mhmm.

444
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,360
Especially if he just hooked up with like a plate manufacturer, like, it's so fucking,

445
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,440
ugh, time to print some gold.

446
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,080
Oh, gosh.

447
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,040
I'm sorry, you know, we brought the show down, I feel like.

448
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,560
I feel like, let's, what could cheer, is there any way we could cheer up Griffin?

449
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:59,040
I know a great way we can cheer up when we can ponder the death of Dale Earnhardt, Sr.

450
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,400
That's to watch Comedy Bang Bang every Friday at 10, 9 central on IFC.

451
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,680
It's an absurd half hour comedy show that only looks like a talk show, it's comedy so

452
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,020
nice, they banged it twice.

453
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,560
With your host Scott Ackerman, a band led by Reggie Watts, and it's got amazing guests

454
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,720
from some of the biggest names in comedy like Amy Poehler, Zach Galifianakis, and Seth Rogen.

455
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,240
So you could catch that and give it a watch.

456
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Give it a watcher.

457
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,680
Hey, I need help overcoming my absent mind in this.

458
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:32,520
Ever since I was a kid, I've been prone to misplacing things, forgetting, what, what?

459
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,920
I've been prone to misplacing things, forgetting appointments, and suddenly realizing I have

460
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,640
no idea what I came in the room looking for.

461
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,120
Generally, I'm very good natured about it, but now that I'm a young professional with

462
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:50,080
bills and deadlines, I spend more and more time worried that I'm forgetting something

463
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,080
important.

464
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,840
What can I do to improve my memory and maintain some peace of mind?

465
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,680
That's from Leonard Shelby.

466
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,720
You gotta put it in the cloud.

467
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,920
Is that the key?

468
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
I don't know.

469
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Is that like let go and let God?

470
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,240
Yeah, let go and let God.

471
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,000
Jesus take this wheel from me, please.

472
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,880
Jesus take my appointments down.

473
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,000
Jesus is my stenographer.

474
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Got it.

475
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Okay.

476
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,360
Dictated, but not written by Jesus.

477
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,840
So yeah, you got to put it in the cloud.

478
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,320
Keep keep keep E files of everything.

479
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,320
That's what I have to do after the second that anyone tells me I have to put a calendar

480
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,400
to eat breakfast or I forget oatmeal is a thing.

481
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,480
What do you normally end up eating then?

482
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,480
Nothing.

483
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,480
I ended up eating the hunger.

484
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,320
There's a sad realization to make about yourself.

485
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,360
I know got to put it in the cloud.

486
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,880
Is there a what's the name for that?

487
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:49,200
When you forget something that you're like you walk in a room and you forget what you're

488
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
going to be doing in the room.

489
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,920
There's a there's an idiom for it in another country.

490
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
Does anyone know?

491
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
Forgetful?

492
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
Fushigi.

493
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Fushigi.

494
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,240
Oh, man.

495
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,280
I went a whole week without practicing Fushigi.

496
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,160
That's the real human cost of my life.

497
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,520
Can I tell you something though?

498
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
What?

499
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,960
You can put that shit in the cloud.

500
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
That's true.

501
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
I could have been working with it in the cloud for the whole week.

502
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,840
I could have been I could have had my Johnny Mnemonic virtual reality gloves on and I could

503
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,020
have been manipulating my Fushigi during my mini break.

504
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,080
And you still schedule breaks would not have been the nerdiest looking person at either

505
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,560
Max von Connery 3.

506
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,040
You know what I do to help remember things?

507
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
What's that?

508
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
It's not a joke.

509
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,620
I'm really bad about setting things down in random places like without thinking.

510
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,440
And then when I go to look for it later, it's like on top of the refrigerator or in a drawer

511
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,400
in my kitchen or something.

512
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:44,240
I loudly announce exactly what I'm doing whenever I set something down.

513
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
No, you don't.

514
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
I do too.

515
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,240
No way.

516
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,680
When I'm at work and I need to like I'm putting my keys down.

517
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,120
I'll say like I'm putting them in this chair.

518
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,880
I do because I have at work because I work in a very large theater.

519
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,560
I will put my keys down somewhere and then when it's time to leave, we will spend forty

520
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,340
five minutes looking for where I put my keys down.

521
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,240
So this way I just announce where I'm putting them down.

522
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,880
And so when I say where did I put my keys?

523
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,600
Everyone that was in the room will say you put them in that chair.

524
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,000
Now listen, I know I know sometimes I get a little overzealous about Dale Earnhardt,

525
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,280
but I work with a guy who announces every goddamn thing he does today.

526
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,080
He said, I'm eating my twenty seventh bite of this muffin.

527
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,560
I'm eating my twenty eighth bite of the muffin.

528
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,280
Is it I'm throwing the wrapper away.

529
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,280
Is it possible, Travis, that you are actually being haunted by the mischievous specter of

530
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,840
Dale Earnhardt Senior because of your tasteless comedy, Goofs, and he just moves your things

531
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,480
around on you?

532
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,920
Is it possible?

533
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,960
Is it is it likely?

534
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,560
Yes.

535
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,840
Is it 100 percent certain exactly what's happening?

536
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,040
Every culture has its own Dale Earnhardt.

537
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,480
Some people call him the Sasquatch, some the Yeti.

538
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:07,520
In Japan, Dale Earnhardt fills his children's shoes with motor oil if they have been bad.

539
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,480
If they have been good, he leaves them a koozie.

540
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,120
Hello, Ricky.

541
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,360
Have you been good this year?

542
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:21,960
I'm going to leave you a koozie filled with Skoal tobacco products.

543
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,080
This is the kooziest Christmas.

544
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,460
This is the kooziest.

545
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:31,440
You know, every child in Whoville had no koozies, yet Christmas came anyway.

546
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,280
Someone had stolen all the koozies.

547
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:41,460
That is my favorite rank and bass animated series when the Japanese specter of Dale Earnhardt

548
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:48,800
has to travel across the globe and recapture the koozies that the evil insert other race

549
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:54,040
car driver's name here has stolen from around the globe.

550
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,760
Jeff Gordon, is he still on the pro circuit?

551
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
We could do Jeff Gordon.

552
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Yeah.

553
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,760
Yeah.

554
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
Remember me?

555
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,760
Known for being an evil koozie thief.

556
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,920
Jeff Gordon is the perfect thief.

557
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,760
Jeff Gordon hates fresh and cold beverages.

558
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:16,320
Koozies and oil, koozies and oil, mean so much more when I see that black liquid filling

559
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,160
up koozies under racing Christmas trees.

560
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:31,400
Other countries are much weirder than ours when it comes to holidays, I think.

561
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,640
You got to respect it, though.

562
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
You got to respect it.

563
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,640
Oh, Christ.

564
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
Did you ask it?

565
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,640
Maybe the guy was Japanese, Travis.

566
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,640
Did you ask if he was Japanese?

567
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,440
Maybe that was the problem.

568
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,560
No goof I can make here won't be racist.

569
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,640
I want to move on, please.

570
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,200
We've entered into this weird Venn diagram of racism where redneck people and Japanese

571
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
people cross over.

572
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,400
Oh, Christ.

573
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:03,240
So yeah.

574
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:10,200
This is goofy, but I take a... This is really goofy, actually, but I'll take a picture.

575
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,400
I'll make my fingers like a frame and then take a mind picture of something.

576
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,160
If I need to remember where it is, do you say like click?

577
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,600
No, I'm not like a crazy person.

578
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,720
I just take the mind picture and then I'll remember like, oh, okay, I put this down here

579
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,720
so I don't forget it.

580
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,880
That's a whimsical thing that you can do on a car drive.

581
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,320
It's just like snap pics, make a little frame with your hand.

582
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,240
It's hard to Instagram them, though.

583
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:47,720
You know what really makes me super mad is the fact that my memory is selective, but

584
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,120
also really shitty.

585
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,200
It's shitty about the things that it selects to remember.

586
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,400
I can't remember to eat my oatmeal in the morning, but I can remember the password to

587
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:05,920
Mega Man 2 that is saved right before you've finished all of the Robot Masters except for

588
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,520
Quick Man.

589
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,820
I can remember the exact pattern that password is, but I cannot remember my dad's phone number

590
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,420
if I need to in case of emergency.

591
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,400
I've learned over the last couple of days in communicating with one of my new Max Funcon

592
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:27,080
friends, Rhea Butcher, that I can tell you every tertiary character in Back to the Future

593
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:34,360
1, 2, and 3, but I cannot tell you the names of most people I met at Max Funcon.

594
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,920
Which is a shame, because we kept seeing them over and over again.

595
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,080
And they wore name tags.

596
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,400
They wore basically little things that said, hey, stupid, this is my name.

597
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,800
Travis actually couldn't remember their names in the time it took his eyes to travel from

598
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,720
their name tags to their eyes, so it was pretty humiliating.

599
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,080
He had to do this quick up and down dance.

600
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,720
It looked like he was just nodding very intently, but actually he was just like, Jeff, okay,

601
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,720
Jeff.

602
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,720
Fuck!

603
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
Hold on.

604
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
I've gotten really good at heyduting.

605
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
Yeah.

606
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Hey, bud.

607
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,520
No, actually, heyduting is where you pretend to be one of the characters from the Nickelodeon

608
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,520
show Hey Dude.

609
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Preferably Ted.

610
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,520
Yeah, sure.

611
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,520
Hi.

612
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
My name is Melody.

613
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
Hi, I'm Ted.

614
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,840
Did you see how Travis actually just set up that conversation with a plan to sabotage

615
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
it?

616
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,840
Thank you.

617
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,560
Thank you for appreciating the prep of the goof.

618
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,560
I wish- What's up, girl?

619
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,280
I just wish I could remember things better, or I wish I could remember more practical

620
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,400
things, because it is almost never that I can impress somebody with my Mega Man 2 password

621
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
knowledge.

622
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,720
I actually, whenever I have something I have to remember, I feel like I'm racing against

623
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,520
time until I can put it in my phone as a reminder.

624
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,840
I shit you not, I agree.

625
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
You got to have buckets.

626
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,360
I mean, that's the only thing that I can tell you is buckets for... I use a service called

627
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:58,440
Remember the Milk, which is a... It's in the cloud.

628
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,800
It is just a big to-do list that is parsed out with different areas of your life.

629
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,880
When I have something I know I need to do, the only time I can breathe easy is when I'm

630
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,160
like race... Is when I can actually type it in to Remember the Milk.

631
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,720
It's like, okay, got it.

632
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,720
That's in there.

633
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,640
I don't have to worry about it anymore, but until then, I can't leave the room.

634
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,040
I can't stand up.

635
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,200
My brain won't hold on to it for more than 20 seconds, and then it'll just be gone forever.

636
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,200
That's a problem.

637
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,280
There's a memento where you blink your eyes, or you look away and look back, and it's gone.

638
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,440
I will sit here and say to myself, don't forget to grab that bag on the way out the door.

639
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,880
Don't forget to grab that bag on the way out the door.

640
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,200
Then if I turn and do something else, I'm out the door and I've left the bag, unless

641
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,040
I do it in that second.

642
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:48,280
That's the problem with the cloud is that I'll be on a bus playing Chrono Trigger,

643
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,200
and I'll be like, I'm going to check my email, and so I go back to the home screen, and then

644
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,640
I see my cloud, and I'm like, oh shit, I haven't been in my cloud in a while, and I'll go in

645
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,080
and I'll be like, oh fuck, I was supposed to pick Billy up from his locker practice

646
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
two and a half weeks ago.

647
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,800
I put it in the cloud, but I forgot to go back in the cloud.

648
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,520
Now he's just a cute little skeleton.

649
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,640
Now I have a tattoo of a cloud on the back of my hands, so I know.

650
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
Just peep the cloud.

651
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,400
So I guess that's good advice, just do everything right away.

652
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
Don't wait.

653
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,280
Or just eat some ginkgo biloba, or be fucking smarter than we are.

654
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,080
Yeah, that would be good if you could figure out what combinations of supplements you

655
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,840
need to take to remember shit.

656
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,240
Now, this is going to sound like a goof, but I've actually always wondered this, because

657
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,400
they always have it in movies and TV shows, like professional business people have personal

658
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,120
assistants.

659
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:39,520
Is that a real thing that you can just hire someone to do, or do you have to be a signed

660
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
one at a business?

661
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,120
I make the internet my personal assistant.

662
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,480
By which I mean, I'll get on Twitter and be like, hey Twitter, in like a half hour, can

663
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,360
you remind me to take my vitamins?

664
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,440
And how's that working out for you?

665
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
Not very well.

666
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
Not well.

667
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,200
I'll get a tweet like a half hour later, but it's like, suck my dick.

668
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,800
And I'm like, that's, I don't think that's what I was supposed to do.

669
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,920
But I didn't need any vitamin dick.

670
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,920
Yeah.

671
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,920
Let's go to the money zone.

672
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:20,660
What was that, chuckles the clown?

673
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,960
This message is for Cara Joy Chapman.

674
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:30,020
She's at Chapman Cara on Twitter, and it's from Israel Johnson.

675
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,020
They're best friends.

676
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:35,400
She's a college student, future coolest elementary school teacher ever been listening since episode

677
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,040
three and got me into the show for my episode 11.

678
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,860
Last year we went to the Cincy live show for her birthday where she got that poster Justin

679
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,720
mentioned in her Twitter profile pic.

680
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,080
She's turning 20 June 13th.

681
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,360
Happy birthday, best friend.

682
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:58,840
Love Israel at the monster truck rally this Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, one man against the

683
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,840
world.

684
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,280
Four wheels, hot rod, birthday, birthday.

685
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,640
The ghost of Dale Earnhardt poster.

686
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:13,640
The Japanese ghost of Dale Earnhardt in Cara Chapman's birthday.

687
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,920
First hundred kids who've been good all year through the door get a koozie supply by Japanese

688
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,920
Dale Earnhardt's ghost.

689
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,920
Happy birthday, Cara.

690
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,920
Happy birthday, Cara.

691
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:32,660
I want to tell you guys about an album, a musical album on Bandcamp by Red Sky Phenomenon.

692
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,920
It's an album that is entirely made on a Nintendo DS using the Korg DS 10, which is a Nintendo

693
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,240
DS game that is sort of an emulator of the Korg synthesizer.

694
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,360
The album's named Your Own Price, meaning you can get it for a buck or two or you can

695
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:52,280
get it for free and you can check it out at Red Sky Phenomenon dot Bandcamp dot com.

696
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,400
Wait a minute, this guy just played DS for an hour and yours was giving money for it?

697
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,600
He played Pokemon Platinum and he recorded it.

698
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
He recorded the sounds.

699
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,960
You can get a video of me playing Pokemon for two hours.

700
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,440
God, I would probably do that.

701
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,440
You would buy that?

702
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,440
I probably would, yeah.

703
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,960
I like seeing how people develop their tactics and which Pokemons they go on.

704
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,000
God damn it, you've got a problem.

705
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
You've got a serious problem.

706
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,160
I like to be the best.

707
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,600
This podcast is supported by Bing, making search social.

708
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Use Bing to include results from both the web at large and also social media sites like

709
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:33,680
Facebook and Twitter, pulling content from your own friends and from the experts.

710
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,760
More online at Bing dot com.

711
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,720
Bing is for doing.

712
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,200
For doing what?

713
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,200
It.

714
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,200
It.

715
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,680
It's for doing it?

716
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,680
Yeah.

717
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,680
I love Bing.

718
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,160
I don't think they want their message to read like that.

719
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,960
Bing is for doing magic.

720
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,920
You know with some of the sponsors we have on the show, they like it when we get silly

721
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,920
with it.

722
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,480
I'm not sure Bing wants us to get silly.

723
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
Bing is for riffing.

724
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,760
What if I said, uh.

725
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,760
It's yours for friendship.

726
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,000
What if I said, I'm trying to Bing tonight.

727
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,520
What if I said, hold on, wait, let me try this.

728
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,440
You know what my favorite character from Friends is?

729
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,440
Shandler Google.

730
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,240
No, wait, that's not it.

731
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,480
Okay, this is pretty good.

732
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,560
This is a good, now, listen, seriously guys, I don't think Bing wants their corporate message

733
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,600
chopped and screwed in that special way.

734
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
The only way to do it.

735
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,600
Okay, how about this?

736
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
How about this?

737
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,960
Bing wants to like read these things and then dip out.

738
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
We read it.

739
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,240
I'm just saying that Google has been horseshit lately.

740
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,360
I don't know what they do anymore.

741
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:41,680
Yeah, they spend all their time making goofy logos and then what the fuck?

742
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,680
I don't even get those logos.

743
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,680
I don't even get search results anymore.

744
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,680
How about this?

745
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,880
I search something like, I don't know, both.

746
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,880
How about this?

747
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,120
Bing, colon, because Google sucks now and what else are you going to use, Alta Vista,

748
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,120
dummy?

749
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,680
Chaps, do you want to tell us about this next thing?

750
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,680
Sure.

751
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,680
Smooth.

752
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:03,360
So, there's a, once again, we've got another Kickstarter and I tell you what, this one

753
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,360
looks awesome.

754
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:10,360
Basically, we're looking to support word realms and so I'm sure everyone knows Kingdom of

755
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
Loathing.

756
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,360
Oh yeah.

757
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,720
The incredible stick figure game.

758
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:19,240
This is from the people that brought you Kingdom of Loathing and so think Words with Friends

759
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:25,720
if it was an RPG fighting game and basically, through the construction of words using word

760
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:31,440
tiles, you're able to do attacks and stuff and it looks just incredible and they describe

761
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,040
it as fisticuffs scrabble, which is basically like the best thing I've ever heard.

762
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:44,680
The single person version is already finished and it can be yours for just $11 for a Kickstarter

763
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,000
donation.

764
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,200
There's only 11 days left on the Kickstarter, so make sure you go to wordrealms.com and

765
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,680
check it out now before it's too late.

766
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,000
Trust me, you won't regret it.

767
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It looks incredible.

768
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,240
Sounds really neat.

769
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:04,520
I get down on RPGs and word games and this sounds like a nice collabo of those two.

770
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,960
Yeah, so go check it out now before it's too late.

771
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,840
There's only 11 days left, so don't wait.

772
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:18,640
So for Bing, what if Bing, what if it was just like, Bing.

773
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,640
That's good.

774
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
And that's the whole thing.

775
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,640
Oh, that's nice.

776
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,640
BONG!

777
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,640
Nope, nope, you blew it.

778
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
BING!

779
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,640
There it is.

780
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:33,880
So that's my Bing joke.

781
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:42,560
I wish I could just make the jingle for the Korg album Pokemon, like me playing Pokemon

782
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,560
on my Nintendo.

783
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,560
Why can't you do that?

784
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
I can, actually.

785
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:55,480
Griffin, can you just sing along with the theme?

786
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,480
Yeah.

787
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,840
Money's own.

788
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,160
This time is for Red Sky Phenomenon.

789
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:08,880
He made an album on the Korg DS-10.

790
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,240
It's like Pokemon with less Pokemon.

791
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,040
Everybody's got to pick it up.

792
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,160
Nobody likes Fleet Foxes anymore.

793
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,480
Fill the Fleet Foxes void.

794
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,280
I think that's all I got.

795
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,520
It's hard to sing along with this version.

796
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
This is like the Chop and Screwed remix.

797
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,480
Sounds like somebody losing their mind.

798
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,760
I hear you saying that, and I instinctively want to give you three dollars and ask if

799
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,280
I can take you to the nearest shelter.

800
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,280
WordRealms.com.

801
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,000
I need help.

802
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,160
Can you have some soup?

803
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,720
I live on soup.

804
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,440
I live on the streets.

805
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,160
I fight with words.

806
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:58,080
I yell at the dogs at night.

807
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
Is that audio coming?

808
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
How are my levels?

809
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
Is that audio coming through at all?

810
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,080
It's good levels.

811
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,080
So visit those places.

812
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,320
The speaker on the Game Boy Micro, it's surprisingly-

813
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,320
Dang it.

814
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,320
Yeah.

815
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,320
Well, this is all I'm doing now during the show.

816
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,200
Griffin, put it down.

817
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Put it down.

818
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,200
Okay.

819
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,200
All right.

820
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,200
I'm going to put it down.

821
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,400
Griffin, I can hear you playing the game.

822
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,360
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

823
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,360
Yes.

824
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,360
Yeah.

825
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,200
This one was sent in by Josh Papow.

826
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:32,840
I haven't decided if it's the kind of question that we could get in trouble for reading yet.

827
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,840
Okay.

828
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,840
Yay.

829
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,840
Yay.

830
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
Thank you, Josh.

831
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
It's about Yahoo Answers.

832
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,440
Here's your question, Mark, who asked, really freaked out my girlfriend.

833
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,440
Need help?

834
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:47,200
As a teenager, I suffered from severe depression and formed a strong bond with the character

835
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,360
Garfield and his outlook.

836
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,120
It's sad, but reading Garfield anthologies obsessively was the only thing that made me

837
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:01,080
feel normal, and it eventually took on something of an erotic fixation.

838
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,960
Oh, no.

839
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:11,440
I think you mispronounced normal.

840
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,760
Reading Garfield books obsessively made me feel normal.

841
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,880
To avoid feeling like a sicko, I drew pictures of Garfield with a woman's, I think a Pamela

842
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:30,640
Anderson circa 1991, body and Garfield's head so that I was assured that my fixation wasn't

843
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,040
with animals or repressed homosexuality.

844
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:41,080
This Garfield-Pam hybrid still had the same biting wit and acerbic outlook and tended

845
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:45,640
to cut herself in self-loathing while wolfing down a lasagna to fill the void after sleeping

846
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:50,400
with drawings of a much more handsome and muscular version of myself.

847
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,540
These drawings eventually evolved into erotic fan fiction starring Garfield and myself.

848
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:59,200
In my head, Garfield still has a woman's body, but someone reading the stories would think

849
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,520
I'm having sex with regular Garfield.

850
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,880
I killed off John in a jealous rage.

851
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,200
I didn't touch Odie.

852
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:12,200
I enjoy his companionship and don't mind if he watches.

853
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,320
The stories are your pretty basic wish fulfillment stuff, balanced with a self-loathing rants.

854
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:25,320
I've been doing this near daily for years and I have a substantial amount of writing

855
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,800
in a folder I keep buried in eight different folders.

856
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,040
My girlfriend stumbled across them by accident when they came up in a search and is pretty

857
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,200
freaked out.

858
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,640
How can I show her I'm just a normal guy with a weird outlet for my psychological problems

859
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,400
and not some kind of sicko?

860
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,800
And then they included a sample of some of the erotic fiction and I didn't think I would

861
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,680
ever say this on this podcast, but it's too gross to read out loud.

862
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:56,000
Okay, first and foremost, ladies and gentlemen at home listening to our podcast, after this,

863
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,600
I don't want to receive any questions of how to meet people and fall in love because this

864
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,240
fucker found a girlfriend.

865
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:11,360
So on the days that he has unconsensual sex with Garfield in a woman's body, does that

866
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,320
happen on Mondays?

867
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,840
Because that would definitely make a lot of sense.

868
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,800
That would fill in a lot of gaps for me in the narrative.

869
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,280
I also like that he had to go out of his way to clarify that it had nothing to do with

870
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,280
repressed homosexuality.

871
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,280
Anybody who stumbled upon this would be like, you want to have sex with Garfield?

872
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,280
What are you gay?

873
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,920
Yeah, no, no gay boys living in my house.

874
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,960
You'll have sex with Garfield's girlfriend or nothing.

875
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,200
You'll love Gadget and that's it.

876
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:51,000
Now maybe, just maybe, if you put his head on Pamela Anderson's body, maybe we could

877
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
make that work.

878
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,440
Guys, I know different strokes for different folks.

879
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:04,000
Listen, we've all got something buried deep inside that you never, ever, ever want anybody

880
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
to know ever.

881
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,400
Now, I'm not saying mine would be as weird as putting a woman's body on Garfield's head,

882
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,060
but it's pretty fucking weird.

883
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:19,200
The secret to not getting made fun of is that you can't tell the entire world, which is

884
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,000
on the internet.

885
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,120
This is a secret you can never, you're embarrassed your girlfriend found out, so you decided

886
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,960
to put it on the internet?

887
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,680
How bad are you at internet?

888
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,840
You can't hide a Yahoo answer in folders, because I found it.

889
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,320
I found it and I know it forever now.

890
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,760
Now everyone knows, it's a ripple effect.

891
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,040
It's a butterfly effect.

892
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,560
Because you put this out, there's going to be a tornado somewhere, because you want to

893
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,560
fuck Garfield.

894
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,560
Right.

895
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:55,400
But you know the worst thing about it is that by setting a new bar of creepiness, the perpetual

896
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,000
creep out arms race that is the internet, someone else is now going to have to do something

897
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,360
weirder and creepier than this.

898
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,520
It's like the last scene of Batman.

899
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,520
It's escalation.

900
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,760
I've always been a fan of Heathcliff.

901
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,000
Time to step up my game.

902
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Time to step up my game.

903
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Time to put a fucking Steve Buscemi's body on Heathcliff's head.

904
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And then I'm going to fuck that.

905
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Then I'm going to fuck that thing up.

906
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Come here.

907
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
What are you, Cat Burt?

908
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,080
I really love the rabbit hole-esque quality of this question, where he kept trying to

909
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,000
make it better and was only making it worse.

910
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,440
By putting Garfield's head on Pamela Anderson, that was supposed to in some way improve the

911
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,000
situation, but I feel that it made it creepier.

912
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,120
Yeah, there's nothing that's going to get you out of that.

913
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:47,600
Even if at the end you're like, and that's what Tree of Life was about, nothing is going

914
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,600
to save you.

915
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:53,720
I think when you drop the sentence, I killed John off in a jealous rage.

916
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,720
Yeah.

917
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,960
But I like it when Odie watches.

918
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,400
I wonder what his position on Nermal is.

919
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,440
Why not just fuck Nermal for fuck's sake?

920
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:10,000
Is Nermal, I thought Nermal, well one, it's still a cartoon cat, but a dude, right?

921
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,720
Is it Nermal a dude?

922
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,120
I thought Nermal was the lady cat.

923
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:20,280
Nermal's, I'm pretty sure Nermal's asexual, not that that's going to slow this guy down.

924
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,280
Fair enough.

925
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,280
Sure.

926
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:27,220
Do you guys think, I'm just, if Jim Davis ever saw these drawings, I think he would

927
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,920
literally fucking die.

928
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,440
I think he would fucking die.

929
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,040
I think his heart would explode in his chest and he would die.

930
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,120
He would say my baby and then he'd die.

931
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,800
Yeah he's fine with Garfield minus Garfield, but Garfield plus dick.

932
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,800
Yeah.

933
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,800
Garfield plus.

934
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,800
Garfield plus a vagina.

935
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,800
Garfield plus sweet tits.

936
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:50,720
Garfield minus Garfield, plus Garfield's head, plus sweet tits, plus a strange dick.

937
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,080
This is awful.

938
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:57,420
I feel like the answer for this guy is simple and that is you are fighting a losing battle

939
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,400
trying to convince him that you're not a sicko.

940
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,360
I think you need to accept the fact that you are a sicko and it's part of what makes you

941
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:09,520
you and maybe, I don't know, try to turn it around on her.

942
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:16,960
How do you, Travis, tell me how to make that fucking riposte work and I'll quit the show.

943
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,320
You say like, well yeah I want to fuck Garfield but you never wear matching socks.

944
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,320
Okay.

945
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,320
What's wrong with you?

946
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,320
Yeah sure.

947
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,320
At least mine's imaginary.

948
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,080
And you don't want to have sex with the lights on.

949
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,080
Yeah.

950
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,240
That's a problem.

951
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:35,760
Only because I wear my Heathcliff mask, weirdo.

952
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,160
I wouldn't want to do anything with the lights on in a room with this guy.

953
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,280
I would be too afraid he'd find me.

954
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,560
I need to be able to make a quick egress.

955
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,480
Hey, real quick, just for a second.

956
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,640
Let's play devil's advocate here and just like get ourselves in this guy's head space

957
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,640
and just like imagine.

958
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,640
No, I'm not.

959
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,640
I don't want to do that at all.

960
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,660
Guys, come on, come on, come through the door.

961
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,960
We're going to step into this guy's mind.

962
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,240
What if I die in this dream?

963
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,760
You die in the dream and you're stuck in Garfield fucking limbo forever.

964
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,720
You need Joseph Gordon-Levitt to give you the kick.

965
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,720
Yeah, yeah.

966
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,720
Yeah, the kick.

967
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,720
He'll kick you in the head until you die.

968
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,720
Hey, Garfield, give me the kick.

969
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,720
I'm ready.

970
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,720
Okay.

971
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:16,960
Um, which would you, which, no, come on.

972
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,320
Which would you prefer?

973
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:23,800
Pamela Anderson body and Garfield head or Garfield body and Pamela Anderson head?

974
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:30,840
If you had to party down on one of those bad boys, which would you go with?

975
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,840
Additional information.

976
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:36,840
The Garfield head is wearing sunglasses.

977
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:41,600
Garfield body suction cup hands or no suction cup hands?

978
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,600
Either or.

979
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:47,560
Whichever you, whichever would feel be more pleasurable.

980
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,360
Will Garfield's head be into it?

981
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:54,600
Is he being acerbic and biting or is he down?

982
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,920
Does he realize, okay, okay.

983
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:03,320
Does Garfield's head on Pamela Anderson's body realize that his very existence is a

984
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:11,600
sin against God or is he like into it with, does he know that he's a misfit toy or is

985
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,600
he DTF?

986
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,160
Or is he like DTF, like ready to fuck?

987
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,480
And same question for Pamela Anderson head on Garfield body.

988
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:26,760
Is she like wildly like screaming at the horror, the human centipede ass kind of situation

989
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,280
that she has been placed in or is she like ready?

990
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,160
Or was she born into this world as an abomination and has accepted it over the years?

991
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,760
I think that, I think the gypsy curse that put her in this, this sad state, uh, I think

992
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,760
she knows about it.

993
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,320
I think she's been aware of it for, for quite some time.

994
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,000
So I think that they have both, they've both been in this world like this for such a long

995
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
time.

996
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
And they are just happy to have some companionship.

997
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Okay.

998
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Garfield.

999
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Do they hang out with each other?

1000
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,560
Cause that's how you're making it sound.

1001
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,080
Um, no, I think that probably weirdest brothel in the world.

1002
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,080
Yeah.

1003
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,080
That would probably be awkward.

1004
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,080
Um, yeah.

1005
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:04,640
I mean, obviously Garfield's head would prefer feeling companionship, but he realizes that

1006
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,760
that is anatomically improbable.

1007
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,040
Is there a danger?

1008
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,040
Okay.

1009
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,480
This is, this is actually what I need to know.

1010
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,480
This is key.

1011
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,240
Obviously these two things have been created by, by science, not God.

1012
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,240
This is nothing.

1013
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,280
God did it.

1014
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:24,720
If I have sex with Pam body, Garfield head, is there a danger of impregnation?

1015
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:29,640
Because I'm pretty sure that would bring about the antichrist.

1016
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,640
Is that a danger?

1017
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,200
I need you to answer this for me.

1018
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,200
Um, I dunno.

1019
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,180
It would be human ovaries down there.

1020
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:40,120
I'm just saying if we're getting science on it, like it probably human ovaries, but

1021
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:44,840
then again, I don't know cause if it didn't have a hybrid DNA, then it would reject your

1022
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,840
seed.

1023
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,840
Your seed would find no purchase in her, her, her loamy soil.

1024
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,840
Okay.

1025
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,840
Let me ask you one more question.

1026
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,840
Okay.

1027
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,840
Please.

1028
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,040
Is Odie there and is he just jerking it so right?

1029
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:02,840
Odie loves what he sees either, either way, either scenario, Odie's down, Odie is down

1030
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,840
to clown.

1031
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,840
Uh, there is.

1032
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:09,200
Justin, do you want to pick first?

1033
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,320
Well Griffin, you asked the questions that you have to answer.

1034
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:28,040
I'll say, I'll say if it's Bill Murray's voice, pan body, Garf head, well, well I'm flaccid

1035
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,040
forever now.

1036
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,040
He had a good run.

1037
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,040
I knew it would happen.

1038
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,040
I knew it would happen eventually.

1039
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,040
Travis?

1040
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,040
Oh no.

1041
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:39,040
I've already killed myself in this situation.

1042
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:52,800
Decenting opinion from, from justice, from justice McElroy?

1043
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,800
I think.

1044
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,800
Okay.

1045
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,800
What did you choose?

1046
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,640
I went pan Bobby, pan body, Garf head, uh, Bill, Bill Murray voice.

1047
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,640
Okay.

1048
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,120
I'm going to go.

1049
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,120
So Travis is dead.

1050
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:11,200
Travis, if, if afforded the options, Travis would kill himself.

1051
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,960
Can I throw Travis's body at the corpse and buy myself enough time, Travis's corpse at

1052
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,360
the creation and buy myself enough time to get out?

1053
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,360
Here's the problem though.

1054
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,240
You throw it at pan body, Garf head.

1055
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,060
Who's that coming up from behind?

1056
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:28,560
It's Garf body, pan head and, and it is very upset.

1057
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,560
Okay.

1058
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,680
For many reasons.

1059
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:37,640
You have in your inventory, a dagger and a shield, open doors, open doors are West and

1060
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,640
North.

1061
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,640
Okay.

1062
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:49,240
Can I, I am going to go with pan head, Garfield body, but Lorenzo music voice.

1063
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:54,480
Um, I have a thing with the real Ghostbusters, so I think that would be enough to get me

1064
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,480
through it.

1065
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:05,560
You're worried, you're worried about finishing, I can't, I can't, you also changed Pam Anderson's

1066
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,560
voice to Garfield's.

1067
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:12,320
No listen, if I have, if I, if it's, I have too much respect for Bill Murray's work, if

1068
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:18,360
it's Lorenzo music, Pamela Anderson's voice, if I, if it's, I don't see why Pam Anderson's

1069
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:25,240
voice is not going to come out of Garfield's head and I, I find Larry the crash test dummy

1070
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,000
to be a very soothing sexual influence.

1071
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,140
So if I can pretend that if it's Lorenzo music's voice and I can pretend it's Peter

1072
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:38,040
Venkman of the Ghostbusters cartoon or Larry the crash test dummy, or perhaps even tummy

1073
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,200
gummy from Disney's adventure gummy bears.

1074
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,200
How many other cartoons can you ruin for me right now?

1075
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,200
I can't.

1076
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,440
That's all Lorenzo music that I'm aware of, probably something else that didn't even,

1077
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:54,760
that thought didn't even the thought of what would be the most sexually pleasurable that

1078
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,760
didn't even cross my mind.

1079
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,120
This is pure survival instincts.

1080
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,960
I can't think about Bill Murray even, I don't want to ruin Bill Murray.

1081
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,120
Like I don't think that that's that much to ask.

1082
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,440
I don't want to ruin Bill Murray for myself.

1083
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,040
We need to, we need to pull out of this nosedive.

1084
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,040
Let's move on.

1085
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,040
Pull out of something.

1086
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:17,480
Hey, I am 24 and I'm trying to get my sexies so right, but I'm afraid there's one thing

1087
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,440
that's holding me back, vidya games.

1088
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,440
I love them, play them all the time, talk about them all the time and most people my

1089
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,800
age seem to enjoy them as well, but I can't seem to shake the feeling that they are kid

1090
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:34,280
stuff and that people think of me as a man child when I play my game boy at Starbucks.

1091
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,440
I really don't want to stop playing, but is it time to put down childish things and start

1092
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,480
reading a newspaper?

1093
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,120
That's from digitally distraught in Davis.

1094
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:50,200
Oh man, this, oh fuck, this is really rough because Justin and I both write about games

1095
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,880
for a living and so I don't want to sound like they are a thing that you should be ashamed

1096
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:58,440
of, but I do have a real problem with playing them on like handheld devices in public.

1097
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,440
You know what?

1098
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,440
I feel the same way.

1099
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,560
I play video games a lot and when I started reading this question, I did not have a problem

1100
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:10,760
with it until you hit the phrase game boy, which let's face it is not like not designed

1101
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,200
to sound manly in any way.

1102
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,520
I don't think that's, I don't think that there's something that suddenly becomes very childish

1103
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,520
about this handheld game.

1104
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,920
I don't think the problem is the name of it.

1105
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,880
I don't think people are walking by and saying game boy, huh?

1106
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,880
I need a game man.

1107
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,960
I want my tall vintage rip.

1108
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,680
No, it's not about getting a game man.

1109
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,720
It's about the difference.

1110
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:34,640
It's just like it is, it's named that way and so, you know, it's not exactly, I'm just

1111
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,460
saying that across the board, it was not designed to be incredibly adult.

1112
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:41,760
It's not, I mean, okay.

1113
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:50,720
Video games by and large, you're not going to be seen as like a more mature, it is not

1114
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:56,520
going to help the perception of your maturity if you're playing a video game in public.

1115
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,400
Does that always stop me from playing a video game in public?

1116
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,520
No, sometimes I'm not, I'm not, I don't have any fucks to do with it.

1117
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,920
You just have to not give a fuck.

1118
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:07,280
Like I was, it's also way more socially acceptable on like an iPhone.

1119
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,000
And there's, that's the, that's what's so fucked up.

1120
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,640
If I'm playing Pokemon on my game boy micro, which I bought because I prayed it would be

1121
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:17,920
so tiny that people couldn't see it in my hands on the subway in Chicago.

1122
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,020
I'm going to get some, I'm going to get some looks, but if I'm playing it on an iPad, which

1123
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:25,640
God please Nintendo make that dream come true.

1124
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,640
It's like, look at him.

1125
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,640
He's so sophisticated.

1126
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,640
What's he doing?

1127
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,640
Browsing the web?

1128
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,640
Nope.

1129
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,640
Catching them all.

1130
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,200
I, I, and I'm being honest with you here because like I, my whole career is video games.

1131
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:42,080
So like I'm not disparaging them and I personally know the, the progress the medium has made

1132
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,140
in towards like maturity over the past 10 years or what have you.

1133
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:50,360
I'm just saying that you're not shaking the perception that they still are a childish

1134
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,920
thing to be playing in public.

1135
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,540
I mean, people are not going to think of you as a mature person.

1136
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:56,540
Maybe you don't care.

1137
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:00,600
Maybe that's the, see, if I'm going to be in public and I'm going to be consuming media,

1138
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,840
I want to consume media.

1139
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:05,240
That's going to make them think that I'm cool or cooler, you know?

1140
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,160
So like a newspaper, it looks very grown up and debonair.

1141
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,160
Yeah.

1142
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,640
But let me, let me counter argument that.

1143
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,640
Okay.

1144
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,640
Who?

1145
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:17,040
Like the people that are on the subway, the random people who are at Starbucks, who gives

1146
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,040
two shits.

1147
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,720
You're never going to see those people again.

1148
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,720
This is what I'm saying.

1149
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:25,600
If you're not in a mood for fuck giving, then just play it and who cares?

1150
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:30,240
Like if you're already paired off with somebody, you got a beautiful child, like fucking play

1151
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,240
your video games in public.

1152
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,480
But that's, but at the same time, there are people out there.

1153
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:39,720
Like what's so great about, um, events like, uh, uh, like PAX and stuff like that, uh,

1154
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:44,840
is that when you, when you are playing your, your PS Vita in public or something like that,

1155
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,600
people aren't going to walk by and like give you a dirty look.

1156
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,800
They're like, Hey, what are you, what are you playing?

1157
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,880
Like it'll attract a certain type of crowd.

1158
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:57,960
And I don't think we should say that it either won't do that or that that crowd is, you know,

1159
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,920
not the kind of people you should be associating with.

1160
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,640
I'm just fucking do it.

1161
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,600
Who fucking, who gives a fuck?

1162
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:08,280
I wish I was playing video games all the time, but I, I know there are certain environments

1163
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,920
like if you're in a reception area waiting to go in for a job interview or something,

1164
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:17,560
don't break out your Pokemon, but unless you're going in killing some time, yeah, unless you're

1165
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:23,840
going in for the job interview for the position of number one Pokemon master, I, and I, and

1166
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:29,400
if we're looking at like a larger scale, like in terms of not just like what you, what people

1167
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:36,200
see in public, the thing that has always, uh, that, that helps me to counterbalance

1168
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:42,040
whatever perception people might have of video games is that myself, I take in a lot of different

1169
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,040
media.

1170
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:50,600
Like I read, you know, I listen to music, I watch movies, like it's not, um, video game,

1171
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:55,680
whatever people may think of people who play video games, I know for my own peace of mind

1172
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,400
that I'm a pretty well-rounded person.

1173
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,680
So I don't, it doesn't bother me, you know, what people want to think.

1174
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:08,200
If you are the sort of person that only plays video games, that doesn't have knowledge of,

1175
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,760
you know, what is going on in the world, like, you know, you mentioned a newspaper, like,

1176
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:12,760
are you reading a newspaper?

1177
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,000
I, I try to read a newspaper every day.

1178
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,400
I mean, this guy obviously listens to podcasts, like we can tell that he has some good media

1179
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,400
habits.

1180
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,600
Yeah, that's true.

1181
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,120
You're breaking it up a little bit.

1182
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,800
Um, so, so don't give anything up.

1183
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:29,300
Are you saying like diversify, you know, maybe get, and then people can think whatever they

1184
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,300
want to fuck.

1185
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:33,800
Get really beefy strong and then get super beefy strong.

1186
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:40,880
And then you can play like the craziest, like Japanese nudity dating game on your PSP in

1187
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,880
public.

1188
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:42,880
Get super beefy strong and get a Tamagotchi.

1189
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:43,880
Yeah.

1190
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:46,000
And then when people walk by, when people walk by you, they're not going to see shit

1191
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,760
because they're going to be like, who's this guy?

1192
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,640
And then they'll see your guns and be like, uh oh.

1193
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:56,000
The only, the other thing you can do to really help the cause is play video games in public,

1194
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,680
but dress like really good.

1195
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,240
Like dress like an adult.

1196
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,960
Dress super debonair, you know, no black cargo shorts for you.

1197
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:04,960
Yeah.

1198
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,640
You're, you're dressed like an adult and playing video games.

1199
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,180
No chain to your wallet.

1200
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,440
Your wallet's going nowhere.

1201
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,440
Yeah.

1202
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,880
If I saw, who's a stylish man?

1203
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,520
Donald, Jesse Thorne, Donald Trump.

1204
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:20,440
If I saw Jesse Thorne collecting Pokemon, I don't know how that would treat me.

1205
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,840
I could actually probably see that happening.

1206
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,840
What about like Donald Trump?

1207
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:30,640
What if I saw Barack Obama, like in a sweet suit, like sweet silk suit, just like, just

1208
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:34,960
like dip it into fire red and I'm like, you know, I'd start with squirtle.

1209
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,080
You're the best president.

1210
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,080
You're a squirtle president.

1211
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,440
We've reached a point, I think in video gaming where you say those things and none of them

1212
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,040
sound completely utterly ridiculous to me.

1213
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:49,040
Like I could almost picture maybe not a game boy, but Barack Obama would kick him backwards

1214
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,560
in fruit ninja on his iPhone.

1215
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,560
No, no, he's a wee.

1216
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,640
He loves the wee.

1217
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,640
He does?

1218
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,640
This is public knowledge.

1219
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,640
Yeah.

1220
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,640
He's into it.

1221
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,720
He drinks a cold PBR and plays some Wii.

1222
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,720
Yeah.

1223
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,720
No, he doesn't do that.

1224
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:02,720
He does too, you guys.

1225
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:03,720
He loves the peepers.

1226
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,720
All right.

1227
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,720
Loves peepers.

1228
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:06,720
Griffin.

1229
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:07,720
Griffin, you know what I mean.

1230
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,720
A Yahoo answer.

1231
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,680
Can we just do the Garfield one again?

1232
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:14,680
Actually, that got a little gross for me.

1233
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,240
Not going to be able to do it for a few years.

1234
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:20,200
Well, this one isn't incredibly and accidentally related to that one.

1235
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,480
It's sent in by Yahoo Answers user question mark.

1236
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,520
Got to put names down, people.

1237
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:27,000
Got to know who sent them in.

1238
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,640
Got to cite them properly.

1239
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:37,560
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user xxsnailsxx who asks, is it possibly a cat likes aggressive

1240
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,560
petting?

1241
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:44,480
I know that sounds very weird and you may have had weird thoughts, but in all seriousness,

1242
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,800
my Siamese cat is strange.

1243
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:52,120
I can pet him gently or tickle him or rub his ears, head, chin, etc. and he just chills

1244
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,340
like it doesn't matter.

1245
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:57,640
If I pet him aggressively, put pressure on him, pull at him when I pet him.

1246
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:00,240
He'll start to purr like he's the happiest cat in the world.

1247
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,100
He'll start fights with me, bite me, claw me, and then flop over and love on me and

1248
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,200
start purring like I'm the best cat mom ever.

1249
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,960
Is it possible for a cat to like tough love?

1250
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:09,960
This little guy is evil.

1251
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:10,960
Ha ha.

1252
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:11,960
Hey, cat people.

1253
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:12,960
No, no, no.

1254
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,960
Is it possible this cat just loves that rough stuff?

1255
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:31,680
Griffin, if people like rough stuff, I don't see why cats can't also like rough stuff.

1256
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,960
Their problem with it is, is that we already did a cat fucking question.

1257
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:39,120
That cats don't like, cats don't have mouths.

1258
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:43,200
They can't tell you what they like and don't like, so you probably should assume the thing

1259
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,240
that isn't abusing them, right?

1260
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:50,640
And I also have to assume, when I hear that there might be cats that like rough stuff,

1261
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:55,160
that there are cats that like it super romantic.

1262
01:04:55,160 --> 01:05:02,320
You light some candles, pour a glass of wine, turn on some smooth music, and you just-

1263
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:08,800
This cat loves a warm bath, why don't you drop some salts, baby?

1264
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:16,520
Sometimes my cat and I will meet at an agreed upon location and pretend that we don't know

1265
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,520
each other.

1266
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,520
Hey, what you doing in this alley, girl?

1267
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,520
Damn.

1268
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,040
Why don't you come on home with me?

1269
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,920
Let me get you some warm milk, perhaps a flea bath.

1270
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:31,600
Hey, hey baby, you want some pussy?

1271
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:35,120
That's a little joke I like to tell, because I'm a sweet pussy cat.

1272
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,080
I'm a sweet pussy cat.

1273
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:43,440
Hey, you want some cottage cheese mixed up with peaches?

1274
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:51,120
I ain't Siamese, but I would love to attach with your body, what do you say?

1275
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,840
I'm just a little nasty tabby, don't worry about it.

1276
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,840
Yo, that's a little bad, girl.

1277
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,080
Hey, does anybody smell tuna?

1278
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:02,120
Don't worry about your bed getting all ruffled, I'm a short hair, pretty, it's gonna feel

1279
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,040
real nice against your skin.

1280
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,600
Don't worry, baby, I've been declawed.

1281
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:12,880
No telling marks in the morning over here, I'm just going to gently paw, gently massage

1282
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,880
your tummy.

1283
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:21,200
This is a lung behavior, I remember from trying to get milk out of my mother's sack.

1284
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:25,640
Had to compete with four to five brothers and sisters, typically.

1285
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:29,760
Genetically speaking, it's a large litter.

1286
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,320
And don't worry about it, hey baby, I'm gonna be dead in like seven years.

1287
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,960
Ain't no need to tie yourself down.

1288
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:40,720
You're not looking for something long-term, yeah, I dig that, I dig that.

1289
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:46,520
My lifespan is rapidly accelerating past your years of humans.

1290
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:50,560
Baby don't mess with those dogs, don't get down and dirty with the dogs.

1291
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,560
No, listen, hey.

1292
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,240
I am so uncomfortable right now.

1293
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,240
Leave the canaries cage on them, baby.

1294
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,240
Oh God.

1295
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:02,320
What if I name a little snack a-rooey after we, well, you know, meow.

1296
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:05,040
Okay, we gotta stop.

1297
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,040
I tried to be cool.

1298
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:10,720
I want to issue a public apology to anybody who was wearing headphones because that had

1299
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,720
to be the worst.

1300
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:17,800
I would have had an ice pick jammed into my cortex because there had to be like 30 seconds

1301
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:22,480
in where there was like an inner monologue of, are they talking about, no, there's no

1302
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,480
way.

1303
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,640
They're still going.

1304
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:31,680
The creepiest part is, the worst part, I should say, because we did it, the worst part is

1305
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:36,040
that there's one man or woman who has just realized like, well, this is the thing that

1306
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,040
turns me on.

1307
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,040
God damn it.

1308
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,040
God damn it.

1309
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:44,600
I need to listen to the McElroy brothers do impressions of a human voiced sexy cat.

1310
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:49,000
Yeah, it's somewhere between red dwarf and red light distance.

1311
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,200
Somebody is, and there's also somebody hoping that we do a voice impression for the cat

1312
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:56,880
that loves to just like, just fuck, just like fuck.

1313
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,800
If you want to do that, just go see cats, that's what it's all about, cats love to fuck.

1314
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:06,920
Mr. Mistoffelees loves to cats, loves to colon DTF, loves to be, he loves to be choked.

1315
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,360
Oh God, let's end the show.

1316
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:16,400
Speaking of that, before we go, so IFC, this Friday on IFC, comedy bang bang with guest

1317
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,400
Amy Poehler.

1318
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:22,440
She sits down with Scott and dishes on her feud with Mad Magazine and her hair, and Reggie

1319
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:27,960
premieres a trailer for his inspirational new movie, and the scientist comes by to help

1320
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,420
Scott and Reggie remember their dreams.

1321
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:35,920
So make sure to check out comedy bang bang this Friday on IFC, in which I am almost positive

1322
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,120
there is no sex with cats.

1323
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,880
That's their new tagline.

1324
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,840
So this has been my brother, my brother and me.

1325
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:49,880
I am so sorry for like the majority of it, like I really, really am really sorry.

1326
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,480
I feel like this should be like the more you know kind of bit where we apologize to like

1327
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:59,880
the family of Dale Earnhardt and cat owners, Jim Davis, yeah, yeah, everybody.

1328
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,960
I'm so sorry.

1329
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:02,960
So so sorry.

1330
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:03,960
I ain't sorry.

1331
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:09,200
Hey, yo, hey guys, I'm trying to thank John Roderick in the long winters for the use of

1332
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:13,920
