1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:51,280
I was working in the lab late one night, when my eyes beheld a eerie sight,

6
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,080
for my brother from his lab began to rise, and suddenly he did advise him,

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,520
and he said, MBM, MBM, it was my brother and my brother and me.

8
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,160
I could have written something before I think I also think that there's a certain amount to be said about

9
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,700
Like parodying novelty novelty songs. Yeah, that's very meta. That's a good point Travis

10
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:47,120
There's a Halloween channel on Pandora, and you will be surprised to hear that it's not just monster mash

11
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,440
Just monster mash and thriller and thriller monster mash mashups. Yeah thriller monster mash werewolf bar mitzvah

12
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,200
Just you know it's a constantly. There's also Halloween parodies of songs like creepy game of poker

13
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,480
One of my favorite OAR parodies this haunt me maybe

14
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,880
That's a great one I love that walking walking in Memphis, but there's

15
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,360
Ghosts all around there's already ghosts

16
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,160
Oh wait, do you mean walking dead in Memphis there? We go. They nailed it

17
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,520
fuck

18
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Then there's Gangnam style, but first spooks yeah, well come style boost spookum style

19
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,000
How is your guys did you guys party last night? Yeah? It's ectoplasmic I?

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,960
Am I am partying this evening because it is the traditional

21
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:49,760
Theater weekend right night. Yeah, yeah sure you have everything special everything has to be special

22
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,200
I was I was mr.. Belvedere, and this year again

23
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,800
And not again, but this time this time out in public

24
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:05,180
Yeah, this time this time for Halloween this time for Halloween and not just your Brock tune not to get my sad card um I

25
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:13,100
I was mr.. Belvedere and last night over a party with lots of friends of ours of mine from college

26
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,360
And they all knew who I was but I went to a party

27
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,140
with Sidney's doctor friends who

28
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:29,800
Maybe don't have their finger as close on the cultural pulse or are perhaps younger and

29
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,900
The popular guest there was 1800

30
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,780
a bartender

31
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,980
Okay, so but real quick. What kind of pulse

32
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,660
Does that show?

33
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,260
Possibly have at this point. Well. They just like cultural

34
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,540
Osmosis things that you absorb about mr.. Belvedere

35
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,180
Without actually watching mr.. Belvedere. I guess I'm just a cultural awareness

36
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:01,440
Maybe the same way that I'm aware of gun smoke sure maybe they've made a few jokes about it on Family Guy

37
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,240
Yeah, right. That's what it looks it up on YouTube. They saw the SNL bit on YouTube. You're talking about secondhand

38
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,720
I went as over there. Yes, so I went as homeless Elmo

39
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,380
To a Halloween party where I knew maybe five percent of the people at the party and this this costume was I found

40
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,160
Elmo torso and Elmo head and it's very convincing and then I stippled on a beard on my face

41
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:32,480
And I put on like gym shorts over some sweatpants and like a t-shirt, and it's real dirty not that

42
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,120
That's what all homeless people look like but obviously I was trying to you know over exaggerate for the God

43
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,600
I'm thinking about now this costumes a little offensive

44
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,800
But it was built into the fiction of Mitt Romney shuts down Sesame Street

45
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,400
Elmo suddenly has no place to go except the real street, and so this is what I was wearing

46
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:58,080
And I would say all but maybe one of the people I didn't know at this party. They would see me and be like oh, it's Elmo

47
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,760
It's like yeah, but you're not like wondering why I have a fucking like stippled on beard

48
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,560
And I'm wearing like dog shit clothes. It's it's morning Elmo. I guess shit together yet

49
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,640
It made me very frustrated. I put a lot of work into the the invention and I feel like people just saw the head

50
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:23,440
And they you know yeah this evening. I'm going to be going as Marty McFly from Back to the Future and

51
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,080
I feel as though I'm relying heavily on props to really help me

52
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,920
Impress the people because the costume in and of itself is not that impressive. It's just a vest

53
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,280
Yeah, it's a vest and like a jean jacket and a shirt and some pants, but I'm building my own hoverboard

54
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,280
non-functional and

55
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,000
I bought myself a big clunky 80s video camera and a Walkman and some headphones

56
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,280
And I'm hoping that this will carry me through

57
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,800
How are you in them Dawson's Creek wait?

58
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,400
Okay here in a couple seasons towards the end a bartender shows up, okay, who?

59
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,080
Inexplicably cosplays as Marty McFly every day

60
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,840
I know it ever references it, but he's dressed exactly like Marty McFly all the time

61
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,200
I can't wait. I can't wait to not have the burden of that show hanging over me anymore

62
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,680
I just can't wait to be done with it. I'll watch these now aren't you you're like in so very deep

63
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,440
Danger deep and I want to be out

64
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:36,040
Okay, I want you to jump in this hole with me because you've been here before I know the way out

65
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,320
You know there's the way out you keep digging at the bottom you hit China by which I mean the season finale

66
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,200
Can we please stop the show now how long we've been doing it you want to get back into it, right?

67
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,400
You got that disc just calling your name. I don't want to wait

68
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,280
Actually, no, it's the DVD so the DVD has the song the knockoff has

69
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,560
This heart is in my hands

70
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,400
Do the whole thing yeah, let's do this has been so funny

71
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,640
So far so funny my brother my brother me and if I should this is our Halloween episode

72
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,480
So we're only talking about ghosts and Dawson's Creek Dawson's Creek

73
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,480
When looking for a new apartment, I asked the realtor if the house I was looking at was haunted

74
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,760
She said she isn't legally allowed to talk about that. It's that code for yes

75
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,440
It makes me nervous because I get the vibe Virginia can be pretty haunted

76
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:43,400
Sure, so Ohio is for lovers when Virginia is for lovers who killed each other and a terrible passion

77
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,940
God I hope that's true. I hope that when you're getting like your your Realtors license

78
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:56,500
It's like you can tell them about the bathrooms talk about the hardwood floors if they ask about ghosts legally

79
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,260
You must be well legally

80
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,700
I don't think they can talk about if like somebody was murdered in the house

81
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,660
Which is the number of ghosts don't just like fucking wander from house to house like oh

82
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,140
It seems like a pretty good place to set up go shot check out two and a half bath

83
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:15,020
For how much is that a day? That's gonna feel good on my ghost. Oh, it's got like a pool grotto thing

84
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:21,860
Yeah, I love in here. I love the idea that the first week of realtor school is prices and

85
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,580
like cleaning the house and

86
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:31,300
Decoration and the second week is ghosts and goes related questions like listen today

87
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:38,220
We're gonna deal with a sensitive topic of if you are asked about ghosts tomorrow. They talk about Indian burial grounds

88
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,100
Right. Yeah

89
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,800
Curse placed on the threshold. Is it possible that they?

90
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,880
um

91
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,600
They just actually have a week called smart-ass visitors

92
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,040
Yeah, and it's just things that you say to people who are smart asses that come to look at your house

93
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,120
Why is this person using a realtor to find an apartment?

94
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Yeah, I found an apartment

95
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,880
With a Ouija board. I just carried it around the Ouija board and wait

96
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,400
Oh, I know we're trying to make this this spooktacular episode, but we didn't we don't need to fictionalize. You're right

97
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't know why I felt the need to embellish my life. My life's been just fine

98
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,600
I don't know why I need to embellish. Have you guys ever seen a ghost? Oh

99
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,520
Man Wow, just went right for it

100
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:31,240
Before we spend an hour talking about what yahoo thinks about ghosts we should really dig deep and do some spiritual exploration

101
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,080
How we be in real talk. I might still be drunk

102
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:41,680
Is this a real talk? Are we doing a real talk ghost? I don't know Travis. I don't know Travis

103
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Can you make it funny or will it be sad?

104
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,920
It'll be sad. I want to hear oh now you have to sorry. Let me clear mine up

105
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:55,680
No, cuz ghosts aren't real. Go on Travis. I mean neither of us like listen neither of us. Hey, listen, we're all friends here

106
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:02,640
Let's all just put our ghosts on the table. No, I've seen no ghosts. I also ain't afraid of no ghosts. Okay

107
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,040
But but I do I do have a certain belief

108
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:16,160
That that not in ghosts but that like if something really tragic or like really horrific happens in a place that there is like

109
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,760
Really bad juju there. I mean like if you have you I mean

110
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,240
I'm sure it's all purely like psychological and you're telling yourself that but like, you know

111
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:32,360
You've walked into like the Moundsville Prison and like the Lincoln State Hospital that we went to in Point Pleasant

112
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Like you walk in and you're like, ooh

113
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:41,540
Something bad happened here. Like is that just mean that's like, oh, but I think a lot of that's aesthetics. Yeah, that's true, too

114
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,040
You very you very rarely like walk into a Macy's and you're like, huh?

115
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Something bad happened here

116
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,680
Griffin where you at? You know the ghosts

117
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,680
I don't like is that I really double don't believe in our ghosts to have repeatable behavior patterns

118
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:03,560
Oh the ones are like and every night she appears on the stairs. Yeah, she stands but I live on a schedule still

119
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:12,900
Yeah, I can float through anything. Yeah. No, I'm gonna go be a hedonist. Thanks. Yeah, see I'm gonna go to the babes palace

120
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,040
Yeah

121
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,120
I'd haunt you but I want to just like rub up against money all the money in this bank

122
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,360
That's what always kills me about those damn hauntings shows or it's like, you know

123
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,120
The most haunted places in New England or something. There's always like that hotel manager

124
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,280
That's like yeah and guests have reported, you know, they always see a little girl playing with the ball on the stairs

125
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,900
I'm like then why don't you have people there with fucking cameras and like if it's if it happens all the time

126
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,480
Get some fucking proof or say now we made up all this bullshit

127
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:47,440
There's also like I know that there's the whole deal with the electromagnetic electromagnetic fields. No, there's not that's not a deal

128
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:55,200
This is true. You have electromagnetic field that is around your body. That just is true. That's science. Okay, and if you

129
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,800
Lose a limb and take a picture

130
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,480
Captures electromagnetic fields. It'll still show the field. Fuck you around your ghost arm. Yeah

131
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,920
That doesn't that shit's not true Travis. Look it up. Look it up Travis. It's not true

132
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:17,240
It can't possibly be it's not science Travis and maybe science and that's ghost your ghost is your electricity

133
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,680
matter energy can't be a creator to destroy guys

134
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:29,160
If you fucking die and you decompose you don't have electricity in the shape of your body just like chillin on earth

135
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,720
So close-minded Griffin so close-minded. It's normal. It's normal minded. It's normal minded

136
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:42,120
Just my mind is totally normal minded because if you fucking think about that how many people have lived on the earth like a big

137
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Ghost look around you ghosts

138
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,400
Oh, so if you would get that that's what I'm saying. That's not you guys guys. I'm just bullshitting

139
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,160
I don't believe in guys that feeling that you get though because you did say you get a feeling when you wonder into a place

140
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,360
Where a murder happened there have been two trillion people

141
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,300
Sixty trillion people that have walked the earth at any given point. Well, not at any given point on all the points put together

142
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,520
Do you everybody there's not a square foot of this entire planet where somebody hasn't been horribly murdered

143
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,280
You don't know that. I know that for sure

144
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,600
Yeah, think about if you think about all the people who've ever been alive law law of large numbers. Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen

145
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:28,520
Listen, listen, my counter-argument there is it's not just like somebody was killed here at some point bummer

146
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,740
It's always played like usually and this is you know

147
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,600
I I stated by saying that it might be purely psychological and like placebo effect

148
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,120
But like it's usually places where it's been a big mass horrible thing happened there, you know

149
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,000
This isn't like you walk into a house where 20 years ago someone's killed me like who people that do that are charlatans

150
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,320
I'm saying that this is like when you walk into what used to be an asylum like it's not a pleasant place to be

151
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,880
There's a hanging funk in the yes. Thank you a hanging funk

152
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,280
Now I also I also have to state that one of my personal heroes is Harry Houdini

153
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,520
Who is one of like the biggest debunkers in history?

154
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,240
And so I don't believe in ghosts I I believe in Harry Houdini, but he died

155
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,920
So he can't be all that great

156
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
Fair enough Griffin fair enough

157
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,000
Speaking of EMF's a lot of people turn to us for advice

158
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,000
and and and sometimes we don't have

159
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,600
the the exact expertise to give to them like for instance, a lot of people wanted our advice on

160
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,200
Which ghost meter to to buy?

161
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:42,960
So I cheapest one so I turned to amazon.com and dug up some some reviews of

162
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,240
The the ghost meter EMF sensor now

163
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,020
This is real quick you traded in your fashigi balls for I forget what you traded them in for

164
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:57,720
But then you have retraded that thing in for for ghost hunting tech juicing. I was really into juicing

165
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,160
You sorry and juice fast this week. You're really into juicing, but right now I'm into the ghost meter

166
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:09,240
which if you can't if you can google this or Amazon it it is basically just a picture of

167
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,360
a

168
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,720
What looks like a a child's chew toy and it says the ghost meter in like

169
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
sans-serif on it

170
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,480
I've oh no, that's not good

171
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,720
So I dug I went through the reviews of the product because I figure barring my own

172
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,120
expertise

173
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,540
That that I could I could pass along what a few people here have said this does this does not this does not pass my

174
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,240
Spectral smell test us. It simply does not ring true now

175
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,680
That oh, but there is only six left in stock

176
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,320
So hurry so get get it get it now and you guys can see I've left you a picture there

177
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,020
If you want to see this ghost meter is awesome

178
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,860
It's easy to use comes with complete instructions and features the most bang for your buck

179
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,900
They may sell more expensive meters, but more expensive meters. Does it always mean better?

180
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,540
Yeah, in fact quite literally in this case

181
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:13,620
The ghost meter is compact easy to carry and the power LED is bright enough that you could read the meter in the dark

182
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:20,020
I'll buy another one when this one finally wears out and I'll recommend it to anyone joining my team of ghost hunters

183
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:27,780
I would give anything for a transcript of this instruction manual

184
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,740
Let each stick this thing in the air and if it goes up then you are touching a ghost

185
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:40,060
Would you give twenty four dollars because that's what it cost to buy this thing little Egypt go society

186
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:47,760
Southern Illinois paranormal investigators have field tested several EMF meters including the k2 EMF meter and the ghost meter

187
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,580
We have come to the conclusion that the very best EMF reader for the price is the ghost meter

188
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:58,820
Unlike all the other EMF meat readers on the market the ghost meter indicates EMF using three modalities

189
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:05,780
Analog meter flashing LED light and sound. Oh, thank God. The sound can be turned off so that will not interfere with EVP

190
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,260
experiments ghosts hate loud noises, I guess

191
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:17,420
At the little Egypt ghost society Southern, Illinois recommend the ghost meter to ghost hunters and paranormal investigators

192
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,740
From beginners to the most experienced

193
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:26,860
I love the how they're coming at this from an angle of thriftiness because even they acknowledge like if you're gonna just

194
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:33,100
Fucking waste some money on some shit. You might as well waste the smallest amount that you

195
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,460
Exactly. That's yeah exactly

196
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,380
All right

197
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:44,620
Just to my thing is I take a quarter because that's only 25 cents and then I throw it directly in front of me

198
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:52,360
If it's trajectory is interrupted by some sort of intangible entity then I will know that a ghost has happened

199
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,980
Stupid ghost thinks you can still buy things for a quarter. So they'll try to catch it. They'll go crazy for it

200
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,900
Well, they're stupid cuz they're like I could buy a candy bar. It's like no you can't grab it

201
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,740
For a hundred years. Sorry, but I

202
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:10,740
Ordered this ghost detector to help me determine if I was in fact experiencing paranormal activity and cannot be more pleased

203
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,860
So I'm not what I'm home alone. I'm safe. Sometimes when I'm home alone

204
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,440
I hear creaking in the attic and noises in the closets and garages

205
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,440
How rich is this person? I garage or pearl garages

206
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,140
I've been trying to convince myself for the past two years that it's just the house

207
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:34,400
Settling but the creepy feelings kept occurring a friend of mine suggested I look into getting a ghost detector

208
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,700
And I looked at them and they were

209
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:46,260
a wait, oh what a friend of mine suggested I looked into getting a ghost detector and I looked at them like they were a

210
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,260
ghost themselves

211
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:55,660
Anyway, I discovered that I were and here's my short story. That's the end and the end by Stephen King

212
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,780
Anyway

213
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:07,620
Anyway, I have discovered that I do have a ghost but he or she prefers to keep to themselves and I don't have any detection

214
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,260
The main parts of the house because bonkers when I enter the attic thus confirmation of this paranormal activity

215
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,420
I highly recommend this if you're attempting to confirm the presence of this

216
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,260
Okay, this is but this is the last one I want to read

217
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,780
Real quick though. How does knowing that there are ghosts you?

218
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,980
You live in fear because you think there's a ghost you buy the ghost meter it pings you're like, yep ghosts

219
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,680
Cool, like now I know that they're step one of 20. Okay

220
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,100
Justin was is the next review really good. This is yes the last review. Okay

221
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,220
The subject is found all the ghosts

222
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,260
Incredible I have ghosts all around me and never knew it

223
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,380
I bought this meter as a joke for a friend and figured I'd try it to see if it did anything at all

224
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,140
Well, I was totally surprised when I turned it on and the meter started jumping all over the place

225
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,060
I should have known since lately. I have noticed cold spots in my house. Sure

226
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:15,820
It's January but cold spots mean ghosts, right? So I've walked around my house checking on two meter each time in my house

227
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:22,980
I seem to have haunted electrical wiring my switches outlets and plasma TV seem to be crammed full of spirits from the beyond

228
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:30,580
Maybe that is why TV sucks so bad. I would recommend this meter to anyone with haunted electrical wiring and hope they can find their

229
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,780
ectoplasm or hot dogs or whatever

230
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,820
But maybe not this is why this is why I'm afraid

231
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:46,500
whenever Justin gets a spark up his ass and buy some random shit on Amazon like fushigi balls is that you

232
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,660
Would write a review one day like I bought these fushigi balls as a goof for a friend and then like six months later

233
00:20:52,660 --> 00:21:00,300
You're moving to Reno to do your to take your contact juggling show on the road because the thing is those those electromagnetic field

234
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:07,540
Detectors pick up any electromagnetic field including electrical wiring TVs any kind of electronics hot dogs

235
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:13,200
I guess I guess I barely have electromagnetic hot dogs, but like here's okay people

236
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,740
Here's the thing about buying yourself an EMF detector

237
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,880
The only way that you would be able to know that it didn't work is if you had a ghost sitting next to you that

238
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,340
You knew was a ghost you held it up, and it didn't do anything it doing something doesn't prove anything at all now

239
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:33,100
It proves the that things are worse than you could have possibly imagined. I don't wait. I didn't make sense

240
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,900
It says ghost meter. Let me let me explain to you why that didn't make sense it says ghost meter on it

241
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:44,420
So when it's at zero that means there's no ghosts and then when it's not on zero then

242
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,100
There's it goes. There's at least more than zero ghosts. Yeah, so that's what I'm saying

243
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,420
It's the only way that you would know that the product you as you have just bought sucks

244
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,560
Is if you knew conclusively that there was a ghost and it didn't show up on your ghost meter

245
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:05,180
Another fun fact about the ghost meter it comes with three folded pieces of paper

246
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:10,980
The larger one has information on ghost sightings that have been made and the other two are

247
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,260
advertisements for a special Asian health remedy

248
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,740
Sounds legit

249
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,740
sound about right

250
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,740
I got the yahoo's

251
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,860
Yeah, I have a yahoo this one is cinema by Kieran Devlin. Thanks Karen. It's by yahoo answers user

252
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,300
milk rakers local number 227 who asks my uncle Jeffert

253
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:36,460
Says his trailer park home is haunted can trailers even be haunted

254
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:47,080
What kind of low-class ghost sticks around in a fifth wheel for eternity this is the right category for this question right ghosts go in spirituality

255
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,080
I'm sorry Jeffert

256
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,640
Jeffert is it a typo? I don't want to believe it is the best name ever

257
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,840
I don't know why you would know listen. I'm not gonna speak ill of trailers

258
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:08,200
No, I've been in trailers before though, and I know that they are not known for their massive amounts of square footage

259
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,340
Yeah, it seems to me if you had a ghost in your trailer. You know it

260
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:18,920
Yeah, I know it pretty conclusively because you look up and see to the other end of your home. Yeah, there's literally it goes

261
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:25,100
Yeah, it's there's nothing there is no periphery in a trailer. Mm-hmm. You see everything all over the time

262
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,540
I think it's I think it's I think it's definitely haunted

263
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,720
Wait what I think it's definitely a haunted

264
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:41,580
You think the trailer is haunted. I think Jeffert's trailer has a real bad ghost situation

265
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:47,540
I think the problem with Jeffert is his heart seems to open the paranormal

266
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:53,980
I think you have to guard yourself against that or because that's how the devil gets in that's that was the problem

267
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:59,300
I think that's why we're probably so obsessed with ghosts is growing up in the Baptist Church. You were told that

268
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,740
It was where this sort of this weird double standard that

269
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,740
Ghosts don't exist

270
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,880
But if you start thinking about ghosts and stuff

271
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:14,460
Then Satan can use that as a way to trick you to get ghosts up in there to get ghosts up in there

272
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,780
Right exactly possessed suddenly you're possessed, so you didn't know what happened

273
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:25,740
Um do you guys straight up if you feel like you or anyone you know and love is possessed get him to the doc

274
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,740
Yes, see something say something

275
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,140
checked early and often

276
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,260
Do you think I?

277
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:38,180
Mean there probably are we're probably not on on point earlier when we're talking about how ghosts

278
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:46,580
Go to live in the dopest situation they can float into I imagine it goes like regular people like living people

279
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:52,400
They have different wants and needs and desires and maybe some ghosts are like Jeffert

280
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,560
And they they you know they appreciate the the coziness of a bagel

281
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,340
So you're saying like maybe this is like the ghost of Jeffert senior

282
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,960
I like you here. I feel comfortable here. I can I know this fight. This is where my armchair is

283
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,440
I get to watch my son dip. I love it

284
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,440
I've buried a skull in the front yard, and I can't go until you find my secret skull stash

285
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:25,040
Why do you know Griffin I'm curious in the in the fiction you've stitched together not fiction go on though

286
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,320
Why does Jeffert bury the skull what is Jeff?

287
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:36,680
I didn't Jeffert's dead dad buried his secret skull stash yeah effort senior the elder Jeffert mm-hmm the elder Jeff the elder

288
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,440
Elder Jeffert buried his secrets to skull stash in the yard

289
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:46,400
And it's it's guys. It's enormous. It's a repository of sweet tobacco

290
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:54,220
We're talking about hundreds of dollars worth of skull, and he can't leave this earth until Jeffert finds it

291
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,440
So is Jeff so when we're talking have you guys seen no country for old men. It's basically this

292
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,040
This is what I'm describing to you. Mm-hmm is the sequel

293
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,540
Skull buddies

294
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,620
Skull hunters

295
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:14,280
That that would be a pretty good plot for a new city slickers movie

296
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,060
The legend of Jeffert seniors the elder Jeffert's skull

297
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:28,540
I'd watch that hey, so long who answers user Emmy eight seven five and

298
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:34,460
Some other shit. I think eight seven five zero said that ghosts can attach themselves to anyone or anything

299
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:40,680
Anything they could have died on the land or a road nearby and claim that trailer home doesn't that fucking suck

300
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,000
That's fucking if it was me, and I died

301
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,520
Like I would I would be like careening towards the 18-wheeler

302
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,760
I would get Google Maps out real quick and just be like where am I gonna fucking ah god damn it I?

303
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:03,240
Couldn't like careening off the Hollywood Hills and like fucking chill with Will Smith for the rest of eternity. That's just great

304
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
Good

305
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:11,840
They it's the person saying that like as they're driving past this place they died and that's how it happened

306
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,160
That's how it happened you go to the nearest residence the nearest hauntable thing

307
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,760
This is why you guys if you're gonna get murdered have a conversation with your murderer first

308
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,000
Yeah, like maybe try to negotiate the spa, right?

309
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,040
Don't let him kill you like in the middle of like a downtown sketchy place

310
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:35,680
If you can get like a realtor to go along with the murderer just to like show off a few

311
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,280
Places and how it would be good for ghosts. I actually have a living murder will

312
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,040
It's a legally binding document. It took a while to set up

313
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:51,880
But basically it states that if you are going to murder me. Yeah, you need to take me to within a

314
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,960
Hauntable distance there has to be a Starbucks nearby, and you've got

315
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:03,340
God's signature of the head of the Assassin's Guild yeah, I got him to sign off on it. He agrees, so it's top-down

316
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:11,240
You know it's a fish Wow yeah work. Do you guys think Wi-Fi is Wi-Fi important to ghosts do you think?

317
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,160
Like a good strong wife like fat like real fab pipes. I

318
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,040
Think it becomes hard to distinguish

319
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:25,240
Yourself from the Wi-Fi signal. I think that at some point the ghost just like Johnny mnemonic. That's a good plug Dan

320
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,920
Yeah, if it's yeah, but can you imagine like the problem that old people have like figuring out new technology?

321
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:35,360
Can you imagine being like a ghost in like a thousand years from now and trying to cope with like the new?

322
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,320
Technological developments, and you're like whoa whoa what is this back in my day?

323
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,960
I just floated in the pipes and carried myself around the internet

324
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:47,000
If I get fucking stuck haunting someplace for a thousand years

325
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,480
I'll be livid those those local kids should solve my puzzle by then

326
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,840
I mean, okay, so Justin Griffin if you die right now with your unfinished business

327
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,880
That's gonna keep you around as it goes cuz mine is I haven't finished watching walking dead yet

328
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,480
I just I just gotta clear out my internet history gotta

329
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,920
Blast blast my cash. What did you hear that blast my cash?

330

331
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
I

332
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,560
Sound like it's telling us to review his cash no

333
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:32,300
Press ctrl H. Check all the boxes and go set me free blast my cash

334
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:43,780
Shrink the window down in case some words show up that don't you see please

335
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,460
I am I actually

336
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,360
Need to master the fushigi, but I'm gonna need human hands to do it

337
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,160
If someone need a willing host a sort of whoopee Goldberg situation. Oh

338
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,640
where I can them

339
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
through her hands

340
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:12,480
Master the ancient art of contact juggling who who do you think of the two people on this call?

341
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,040
you would

342
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,480
Prefer I don't want to put you in an uncomfortable place

343
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:25,040
But like to possess between the two of us Travis has larger hands. Yeah, but I think there's a better chance of

344
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,360
Travis losing interest

345
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,080
That's a good if he knows that my very eternal damnation hangs in the balance

346
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,840
I think Travis will try for a few hours and then just kind of blow it up

347
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,520
You also would then have to like just fully live through all like the horrible stuff that I do every day. Yeah

348
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,040
Just awful I have crooked middle fingers and I don't think that that lenses on the fushigi

349
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,720
It's the same reason why I couldn't do those little skateboards that you do with your hands, you know

350
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,960
Those things flip sure flip decks flip to flip decks

351
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,420
Hey, I got a question for the longest time. I've been a person of logic and as such

352
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,100
I've always thought the people around me were complete idiots for believing things like ghosts spirits

353
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,900
Spiritual energy and karma

354
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:11,780
How can I put aside my judgy feelings to put on an empathetic smile for people who get swept away in the magic?

355
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:16,500
Okay, I somehow be convinced that this stuff is plausible. That's my shrunks. I

356
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,700
would first like to say that

357
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:26,780
Um, you probably shouldn't like lump karma in there with ghosts. Yeah. Yeah

358
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:35,060
Mostly because that's that's like a religious thing, you know, hey, what's the deal with a ghost and karma and shit? Yeah

359
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,740
Jesus and all that all that jazz

360
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,980
You know, I literally okay. So yesterday Teresa and I we've been watching all these weird like

361
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:52,980
Documentaries as I was narrated by Linda Nimoy. We were watching one about witches and like I had this moment where I looked

362
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:59,180
I was like, do you ever think like it's so easy to be like, well, of course, this isn't real. This is stupid but like

363
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:06,240
Maybe maybe you know, maybe one day like you'll be sitting there and be like, what? Oh

364
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:13,080
Maybe that's possible and I've just never really opened my mind to it. No, no, that's dumb. That's dumb. That's dumb. Yes

365
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,160
you're

366
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,840
Hold on. So you're talking about how you let you open yourself up to these ideas of maybe being

367
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,000
Being real. I'm just saying like it's it's very easy

368
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,480
To be like no quite like okay. Let's look at it from a different way having nothing to do with ghosts

369
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,160
Think of like aliens. It's very easy to be like, of course, there's no aliens

370
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,200
That's stupid or if there were we would have seen him by now blah blah blah

371
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,000
And then like a hundred years from now we find aliens. It's like well

372
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,680
It was really easy a hundred years ago to say that wasn't it dumbasses? Yeah, but that's you gotta go with what you got to

373
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:52,000
Go on and I ain't seen a ghost to on a trill people walking the earth for it through through the fullness of time. No

374
00:32:52,800 --> 00:33:00,240
Ghosts recorded proper no proper ghost recorded footage like what you're saying is like you can't you can't retrospective

375
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,580
You can't look back at him like yeah

376
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:06,440
It was really easy to dismiss the idea of tiny bacteria causing disease because we couldn't see him yet

377
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,200
Yeah, because you didn't have that information. I what I'm mostly saying is

378
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,760
Fucking let's all enjoy these witch free times that we have now because one day we might not be so lucky

379
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,580
It might be incantations and shit going around like crazy

380
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,560
Oh, and then we'll think back and be like

381
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,200
do you remember when we used to watch that movie the witches with Angelica Houston and

382
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,280
We would say this is so silly. Oh the movie that scared the fucking shit out of me when I was a little kid

383
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:39,920
I mean you scared of like didn't she trapped the girl in the painting the feelings that you got like when you saw Angelica Houston's

384
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,680
Sorry Houston's, but they put the little girl in the painting. Yeah, I don't like that one bit

385
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,160
Justin anything bad. Oh god. I don't want to be in a painting. Oh

386
00:33:52,160 --> 00:34:00,080
Oh, let me know anywhere anywhere anywhere else if you if you had to be if you had to be in a painting

387
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,000
Which is not ideal

388
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,600
It's not the ideal situation

389
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,520
Where where do you want that painting to be hanging because if it's over in like the toilet room?

390
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:13,800
Then you are in for what I want to be in a broom with a girl. It would a really pretty girl

391
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,440
Hey, sorry. All right, and I'm also okay with any painting except Guernica. I

392
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,720
I don't get out. I like them. There are people out there that just got that. All right, cool

393
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,720
Good, I can can they email me and let me know what's up. Yep. I uh, I

394
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,660
Like to be in a painting fun has lots of juggy babes

395
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,020
Juggies from like the man show. Yeah, like sometimes you see a painting

399
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,040
Juggie babe thing going on. I think that would be a pretty good pain

400
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,800
When you just replace I could just replenish, you know when you go to me

401

408
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,760
As it like a as a curse. Oh, no, I'd hate that don't put me in with the Juggie babes

How to stop worrying?

That's not especially Halloween thing. I guess you worry how to stop worrying about ghosts about ghosts, right?

425
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:13,080
How does that worry about being killed in front? It's it just it's is it just like him and he's like, hello

amazingly wide variety of items

00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,060
But for me, it might as well think we have any any listeners still at this point that like Kira's job extreme restraints

436
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:11,700
They're like extreme restraints. What's that? What's that be? This is peculiar. This is a sex flesh. Sammy doll

Blow up dolls while listening to Dale Carnegie's how to fuck

00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,280
Man how to fuck right by Dale Carnegie

450
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,920
You know how to be a gentleman and give people like you and once you're there you need to read my son's book

He's gonna teach you how to get down

452
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,320
There's a picture of the sex flesh Sammy doll that is worth the trip

453
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,720
Even if you're not gonna purchase something because it is showing me an interior that I can not identify

454
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:37,360
It's it's all stars. It's like it's a no star. It's beautiful. I don't know

455
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:44,360
What this is is this it looks it looks like there's like a buckle in there. It looks like a scene from Solaris

456
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,760
It's it's it's horrifying. I can't figure out what they're showing me

457
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,640
The weird thing is I want a scene from inner space. I want to put my dick in it

458
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,120
Yeah, I got a weird thing about it. Gotta shove gotta show what I know what that glow is

459
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:02,280
If you go to extremely shades God living in the sex-flesh Sam God lives at that's that was what losses each sex-flesh

460
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,880
Sammy doll had someone murdered next to it. And now there's a ghost light inside. Whatever hole this is

This one was sent in by Steve Lewis, thanks Steve it's by a high school

470
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,520
musical lover

471
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
Who asks?

472
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,400
How do I become a ghost without dying

473
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:12,100
Hmm I want to become a ghost to creep out my friends, but I do not want to die because that might hurt any suggestions

474
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:22,620
You know, this is the problem we use today no commitment yeah, no pain no gain no dead no ghost powers

475
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,240
Is it if you want to freak out your friends that bad you're gonna have to die

476
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:33,420
Hey, do you want to know a great internal geek test if you heard this question you thought oh you should look into astral projection

477
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:40,700
You're a nerd and I know I thought that so I did too. Okay. Um, I was gonna suggest it

478
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,220
I'm glad you got to it before I did so I didn't embarrass myself. I

479
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:51,860
I can you heart I mean, okay. Here's the thing though. You can harness the power of ghosts

480
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:59,660
By just being quiet and every once in a while knocking something over when someone's not in the room

481
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,900
There's one ghost power there

482
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,360
Second ghost power you wait till someone is okay

483
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:10,200
You wait in an adjacent room while someone's drinking a beverage you wait till they turn their head

484
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,560
When they turn your head you sneak into the room you slap the glass across the room and then you get out of the room

485
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:20,560
Right away ghosts. Okay ghosts are there you go up into a room that no one else is in you go

486
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,060
There there's the ghost sounds so you're a ghost is an onomatopoeia. Yeah

487
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:38,280
That is the salad goes so go into the house of a very very stupid person while they're like the stupidest the dumbest person

488
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:44,400
The dumbest person you can find on the internet and you get some symbols while they're sleeping and you crash them over their head

489
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,660
And then you yell I'm not real and then you leave the room

490
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,960
Consider yourself to be fair. I think that that trick works out of context of ghosts or not. Mm-hmm

491
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,800
Just scream. I'm not real and run out of the room. You're the only one that can see me. Don't call the cops

492
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,600
Oh, why not just do that? Oh my god stupidest friend and welcome like I was killed today

493
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,720
I'm a ghost. No one else can see me. Don't tell anyone. I'm here

494
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,040
I need you to blow a few tens that some close friends haven't come by

495
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:19,600
Like Jimmy's right there. You can't see Jimmy and they're like what no and all the while they got that sweet tenor

496
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,960
He died he died today. Let's check out his browsing history. But wait, I feel like

497
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,400
He drew a message in the mud blast my cat

498
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:35,840
I don't understand. Did he go geocaching? What's he talking about? Oh

499
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,920
Wouldn't that be horrible if that was your unfinished business like you had one last geocache you couldn't find

500
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,240
That would be that would be horrible if that was your finished or concurrent business

501
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,920
Can I read the best Yahoo answer response I've ever seen on the platform

502
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:59,760
Yes, please by all means Yahoo answers user bill see responded. Oh boy

503
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,240
You don't know you already are a ghost all of your friends are ghosts, too. No

504
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,280
Just kidding with you. However, as you grow and mature your goals and thoughts will change

505
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,040
Thanks

506
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:22,960
Bill see might be present Bill Clinton Bill Clinton. Hey this this shits dumb, but don't worry

507
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,400
We've all been eventually you'll grow up. You're gonna be such a dumb. You're gonna grow out of this real dumb shit. Oh

508
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
God

509
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:36,080
Didn't you know you're a ghost are your friends you guys listen just playing listen before I need you to know

510
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:42,520
No, no serious that you can actually tell the moment in that response when the person turns their chair around and straddles it

511
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,080
Hey, let's get real talk. Let's get it up

512
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,360
We've all had a lot of fun today pretending that everyone you know is dead

513
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:53,640
So let's talk about how you're gonna grow up and change. Let's rap. Let's rap listen

514
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,720
Your school brought me in today to talk to you guys about the fact that you're done

515
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,760
Do you guys want to see me play some stunt volleyball and talk to you about drugs?

516
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,360
Also all your friends are dead not really cuz I just sunk this basketball shot

517
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,160
But now let me tell you about how you're all gonna grow up and not be so stupid 85 people

518
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:16,280
I will stunt basketball against them solo you're gonna love this, but you shouldn't love heroin to take it from me

519
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,400
I used to do heroin, so I got so good. Oh, I'm a motivational ghost

520
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,840
You and all your friends do drugs

521
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,760
But please don't and don't commit suicide and now I'm going to tear this phone book in half with only the power of Christ

522
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:42,580
It's ironic if you're if you are telling people not to kill himself why make it watch you do your tricks is really a zero-sum game

523
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:50,340
If you were fast you're gonna reset back to one if you were dead you couldn't see me throw this frisbee across his football field

524
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,740
I got a cannon that shoots marshmallows

525
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,780
Please don't tell your parents about this now. Why should you do all these push-ups?

526
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:06,580
So I tell you not to kill your friends guys my supervisor at work spends a fair amount of time of her weekends doing what?

527
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,520
She refers to his paranormal

528
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:15,860
Investigating I can tell she's deeply into it because she frequently listens to shows episodes of shows like ghost hunters at our semi

529
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:20,840
Boring office job and misses out on social gatherings to spend time in allegedly haunted buildings

530
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,980
I don't feel comfortable telling someone who is one step removed from my boss that something

531
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,980
She spends her free time engaged in is totally BS

532
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:35,900
But I also feel it's a disservice to reality to allow her to continue believing such a delusion. How would you tackle the situation?

533
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,980
That's from bemused in Boise, Idaho

534
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:46,100
We've had a lot of fun here today guys, but can I get serious for a second? Yeah, what is you don't owe reality?

535
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,260
Anything? Yeah

536
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,660
Let this person how much let me put it this you this way

537
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,300
How much better is your life?

538
00:46:54,980 --> 00:47:02,180
Knowing there is someone you come into contact with who is like deeply into paranormal investigation. The answer is a

539
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:07,660
Hundred a hundred times better my life's better just from having heard you tell me about it

540
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,780
Because here's the thing there's there's shit that we all do, you know

541
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:13,300
Maybe it's not to the scale and it's not a delusional thing

542
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,820
But that's like saying to someone like you spend too much time reading your books

543
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,740
Like it's just what this person is into it's not affecting you in any I want to believe

544
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:28,660
Right, I think no I used to want to believe and I think that is is I miss those times

545
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:34,460
I miss those times. There's like ghosts. Maybe I'm in college. These are things that I would say out loud

546
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:41,100
I'm in college. I'm exploring my spirituality if there's any ghosts around I want them to know it's Occam's razor guys

547
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,300
It's ghosts. It just makes sense. I

548
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:50,220
Miss those days those sweet doe eyed days not the days when you believe but the days when you wanted the days that I

549
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:55,700
Possessed it you want to want to believe now. It's like I'm I am way too busy for that

550
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,780
I have way too much on my adult plate. I

551
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:05,180
Think that wanting to tell your boss like hey what you're doing is stupid is akin to like I can't believe these stupid kids

552
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,180
believe in in Santa Claus like

553
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:14,660
Leave your boss alone. Also, it is I think super mean to this role of a bike this thing you believe in. It's stupid

554
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:21,660
Yeah, yes, I'm out. And also do you think that your boss is like has not heard that from anyone before and she's gonna pick?

555
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:27,180
Oh, oh, I suddenly open my eyes. I didn't even consider the possibility

556
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:31,460
She may be living in an Emperor's New Clothes situation where no one has actually

557
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,740
pointed out the fact that ghosts aren't real or

558
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:39,140
Unless she's embezzling from the company to buy her ghost meters

559
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,500
maybe her

560
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,100
she has a very strained relationship with her son and

561
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:49,540
The only way that she copes with it or perhaps stays close to him is hunting ghosts with him

562
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,540
Because he's a ghost. Oh

563
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,540
Oh my god, how do you feel now?

564
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:02,020
You are listening to this episode and you are not sufficiently spooked you are not paying attention

565
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:08,740
You just got shivered. Sorry, you just got shivered the calls coming from inside the house

566
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,640
The podcast what had been dead for 30 years

567
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,100
What do you think about that?

568
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:22,060
Fred and I bet there's someone listening the show named Fred and they're like, oh fuck. Oh fuck

569
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:28,080
You they got me good. They shivered me when I least expected it. That's when it always happens Fred

570
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,900
Okay, I draw a webcomic I know I know

571
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,900
lame

572
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:42,260
Not lame. That's not lame. That's not editorial from web. Yeah webcomics are like are like 80% of our demographic

573
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:47,100
We have to keep our webcomic artists. Happy. I would rather alienate white people at this point

574
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:55,740
White college-aged males, I would rather alienate 18 to 24 college-aged males with podcasts addiction

575
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:02,500
Can we start reviewing our favorite way calm tablets I feel like this I feel like that would be a good expenditure

576
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:09,580
That would be a good way to spend our time. Anyway about it's about ghost hunting and bounty hunters and it's called wait for it bounty

577
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:10,740
hunters

578
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:16,220
Now I myself am a skeptic don't buy into the whole. Oh god. I don't know what it was

579
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:20,820
Therefore it must be a dead guy thing, but I love ghost stories. My question is this

580
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:24,140
What's the scariest place for a ghost to show up?

581
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:30,340
And what would you do if you saw one in said location in drawing the comic?

582
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:34,600
I have idea after idea that come up with but then I decided that it's to Scooby-Doo

583
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,260
Them parks museums hospitals theme parks

584
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,260
Man them parks

585
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:47,020
Where would the back brothers back right most not want to meet up with a scary

586
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,740
Boo-boo and or what is your favorite ghost story?

587
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:51,100
Okay

588
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:55,900
I want to limit this to the first part of this question because I can't tell you my favorite ghost story because it is dirty

589
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,900
and racist

590
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:06,340
There's like a whole like 10-minute spiel about Obamacare you wouldn't yeah, it gets raw in there

591
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,940
Charlie Daniels is the protagonist. Let me leave

592
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:19,900
I'll tell you where I don't want to ghost to appear. Okay, sometimes I'm in a long room or hallway and

593
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:25,380
I will I will not turn the lights on on one end because I'm just gonna be

594
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:32,140
Walking through and about halfway through I will regret it cuz it's dark

595
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:32,620

Right there in front of the elevator. Let me get you at this

608
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:32,420
It's an opening night of a movie midnight movie and you just waited in line

609
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:37,380
You get a big tub of popcorn and you get it and it takes you 20 minutes to get it and you paid

610
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,580
$8 for it, right, you know

611
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,940
Take it back to your seat and you got to work your way through the aisle

612
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:51,300
Like excuse me, excuse me, and then you get back to your seat and you look down and it's not popcorn. It's just a ghost

613
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:55,780
Man you that you have to go all the way back

614
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,740
Go back and you have to wait in line for 20 minutes because they can't let you skip and you get there

615
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:04,940
You're like, uh, excuse me. You gave me a ghost and then they say no I didn't and you look down and it's you look

616
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,940
Down and it's popcorn

617
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,460
Shivered

618
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:13,900
Shivered I'm fully shivered at this. Okay, imagine this you've been waiting for a new car. All right

619
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,620
I love it shopped around. Okay, you've gone through all the different financing options

620
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,980
You weren't sure at first because you wanted like a two-door

621
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,140
But then they started showing you the four doors and you're really happy with one of them

622
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,700
And so it's been months. You got all your financing in order you pick the right colors

623
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:30,260
You know the car you want you buy it as you're driving off the lot

624
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:36,380
You open the glove compartment ghost check this out. Check this spooky story. You wait in line at Starbucks

625
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:43,260
You're waiting and waiting waiting and then you wait and then you wait and then you get to the front and you say I want

626
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,340

627
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:48,300

You just got shamed

633

But this one you go to a party and because your friends say that you're gonna know a bunch of people there

634
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:13,740
And you get to it and you don't actually know

635
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:18,460
You don't actually know that many people there and then maybe there's a ghost or something

636
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:26,140
Imagine this, okay. So like you've been marinating like this roast in your crock pot for like, let's say like 20 hours
